<p id="par0065">ARDS is believed to be the result of an injury to the alveolar epithelium and capillary endothelium with abnormalities in the immune system. Neutrophils are recruited to the lungs by cytokines while toxic mediators such as oxygen free radicals and proteases are activated and released.

 </xref> Extensive production of free radicals exceeds the capacity of endogenous antioxidants and causes oxidative cell damage. Factors such as endothelin-1, angiotensin-2, NF-kappa B, and phospholipase A-2 increase vascular permeability and destroy microvascular architecture thus increasing inflammation and lung damage.

 </xref> This results in an influx of protein-rich fluid into the airspaces caused by increased permeability of the alveolar-capillary barrier. Increased alveolar fluid reduces gas exchange through the alveolar-capillary membrane and results in hypoxemia and respiratory failure. However, no sensitive and specific clinical biomarkers for ARDS have been found. Dyspnea is also a predictive element.
