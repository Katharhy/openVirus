<p id="par0010">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent for the disease named as Covid-19 (coronavirus disease-19) which has become a worldwide epidemic threatening many lives especially of those at greater risk of severe outcomes. Intense efforts have been set to describe clinical and epidemiological features to guide both the interruption of transmission, prevention and treatment. These emergency efforts have been resource consuming, affecting human and economical capacities worldwide, as well as a potential impact on other research and on the quality of everyday healthcare activities. Needless to say the effect this sudden overload of work and resources can have over preventive immunization activities. According to data collected by the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (Gavi) and the Sabin Vaccine Institute, provision of routine immunization services is substantially hindered in at least 68 countries and is likely to affect approximately 80 million children under the age of 1 living in these countries.
