  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>Numerous cases have been reported of patients with symptoms of Guillain-Barr√© syndrome associated with COVID-19, but much information is still lacking on this association and its implications. The objective of this review is to analyse the available evidence on this topic in the adult population.</p>

 <sec>
  <title>Material and methods</title>
  <p>A systematic review was conducted of studies published on scientific databases: PubMed, Cochrane, Science Direct, Medline, and WHO COVID-19 database.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Results</title>
  <p>We identified 45 studies, which were analysed and completed using the Covidence platform; the final analysis included 24 articles, with a total of 30 patients.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Conclusions</title>
  <p>We found a strong association between both conditions; furthermore, the studies analysed highlight differences in the presentation of the disease, with greater severity of symptoms in Guillain-Barre syndrome associated with COVID-19.</p>
