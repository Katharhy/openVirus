<p>Lastly, the best PEEP is that at which alveolar recruitment prevails. Estimating the alveolar recruitment potential makes it possible to stratify patient severity and to guide therapy.

 <sup>)</sup> Although the gold standard for assessing recruitment is tomography, different tools have been proposed based on the mechanical behavior of the respiratory system. Mechanics-based methods have showed very good correlations between each other; however, they are not correlated with tomographic estimation, and therefore, they likely assess different phenomena.
