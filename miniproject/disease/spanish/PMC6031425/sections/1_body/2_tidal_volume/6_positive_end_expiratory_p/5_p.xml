<p>In a study conducted to characterize the pulmonary and extrapulmonary mechanical behaviors of patients with ARDS, Gattinoni et al. found that patients with extrapulmonary ARDS had high IAP levels. Therefore, these finding can be used to describe the abdominal hypertension effect on ARDS.

 <sup>)</sup> The high E
 <sub>RS</sub> observed responds to the increases in E
 <sub>CW</sub> and in E
 <sub>L</sub>. In turn, the gradual increase in PEEP showed significant improvements in the elastance of both structures, even at PEEP levels that did not reach the IAP value.
