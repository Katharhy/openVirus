<p>The results presented in 
 <xref rid="tab03" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> showed that the predicted number of dengue cases in Ribeirão Preto depends on the number of cases in the previous 2 to 24 months. In addition, the monthly incidence of dengue observed in 2016 was significantly higher than the number predicted by the SARIMA model. In fact, out-of-sample forecasts follow the past observed behaviour and may not be credible to forecast the number of dengue cases in epidemic years, such as 2016, since the large number of reported cases may be a consequence of the lack of immunity of the population exposed by the first dengue virus, making the outbreak unpredictable [
