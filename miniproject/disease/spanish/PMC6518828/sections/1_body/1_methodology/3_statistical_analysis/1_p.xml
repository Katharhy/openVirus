<p>In order to analyse the monthly number of dengue cases in each city until 2015, seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) time series model was proposed since the SARIMA takes into account the seasonality, possible nonstationarity and all autocorrelations. To satisfy all the assumptions of the usual SARIMA model, as homoscedastic uncorrelated errors with Gaussian distribution and to include outliers in epidemic periods, the model was fitted to the logarithm of the number of cases plus 1 [

 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], summing 1 to the number of cases to avoid zero counts.
