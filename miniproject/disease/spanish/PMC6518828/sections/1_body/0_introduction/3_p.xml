<p>In the face of this scenario, obtaining detailed information on when and where dengue outbreaks occurred in the past can be a useful guide to predict the magnitude and severity of future epidemics and thus allow adequate allocation of resources to better public health interventions [

 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], malaria [
 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and influenza [
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Hence, the current study aims to analyse the temporal behaviour of dengue cases in the municipalities of Ribeirão Preto and São Paulo, in order to forecast the monthly number of dengue cases in 2016.
