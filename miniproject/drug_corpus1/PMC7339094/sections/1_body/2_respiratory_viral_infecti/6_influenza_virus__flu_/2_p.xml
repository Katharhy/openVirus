<p id="Par42">Several countries, including Germany, have carried out seroprevalence studies on their population with regard to influenza A and B viruses: a prevalence of antibody levels (IgG) against viruses A and B has been observed in 87% and 47% of 0â€“17-year-old subjects, respectively. In adulthood, the antibody prevalence is around 96% for virus A and 98% for B, with a decreasing trend for antibodies against virus A with aging. Vaccinated children have a significantly higher antibody level than unvaccinated ones [
