<p id="Par36">Respiratory syncytial virus is the most important causative agent of LRTI in infants and children worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Many children develop a primary infection within the first 2 years of life, but despite this permanent immunity is not acquired [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A Finnish study, evaluating serological IgG levels, showed that 37% of children had contracted an RSV infection in the first year of life, 68% within 2 years and 86% within 3 years of age. At least a third of these children then develop reinfection in subsequent years, confirming the fact that immunity in the first years of life is only partially protective [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The incidence rate of RSV infection in adult and pediatric hematologic subjects ranges between 1 and 50% (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This value ranges between 1 and 12% taking into account only adults [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]Â (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Although the mortality rate for pneumonia in healthy children and adults is low (0.5%), this can reach 60% in immunocompromised untreated children and adults [
