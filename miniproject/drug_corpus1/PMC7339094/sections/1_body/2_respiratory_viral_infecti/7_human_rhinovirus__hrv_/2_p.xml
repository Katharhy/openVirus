<p id="Par52">In children with hematological malignancies and/or HSCT, hRV was found in 23–62% of URTI [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and 65% of LRTI [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In this last work, the mean age of children was 6.9 years, and half of the patients affected by a respiratory virus had a diagnosis of leukemia or lymphoma (LL). hRV was the most detected virus in all the patients recruited in the study (hematological, with solid tumor or post-HSCT). In patients affected by leukemia or lymphoma and by a viral infection, hRV was detected in 65% of URTI and 59% of LRTI, while in children the virus represented 77% of URTI and 50% of LRTI in the post-HSCT period [
