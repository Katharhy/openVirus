<p id="Par11">The human influenza virus belongs to the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family, and its genome is characterized by a single-stranded RNA segment. Its surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuroaminidase (NA), play a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of infection and allow for the identification of different subtypes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Three influenza virus genera are identified (A, B, C); influenza A virus is divided into different subtypes on the basis of the antigenic drift and shift mechanisms, which lead to minor or major changes in the composition of HA and NA, respectively [
