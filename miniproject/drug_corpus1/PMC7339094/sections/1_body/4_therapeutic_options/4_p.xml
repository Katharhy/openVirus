<p id="Par87">Regarding RSV infection, ribavirin-based therapy has been associated with a significant reduction in the progression from URTI to LRTI [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Ribavirin has been proven effective in hindering the progression from URTI to LRTI (from 45 to 16%) and in reducing mortality (from 70 to 35%) in onco-hematological patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The lack of ribavirin aerosol therapy has increased the risk of mortality in patients with HSCT [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]; ribavirin aerosol is the only approved treatment for severe RSV-related LRTI in infants with underlying conditions such as prematurity, cardiopulmonary disease or immunosuppression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In patients with myeloma, routine treatment of RSV infection is not recommended [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Ribavirin therapy is recommended in patients with leukemia and patients with HSCT at high risk of complications [
