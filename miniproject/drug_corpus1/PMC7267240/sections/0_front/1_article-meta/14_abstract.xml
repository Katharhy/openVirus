 <p>SARS‐CoV‐2, a novel emerging coronavirus, has caused severe diseases (COVID‐19), and rapidly spread worldwide since the beginning of 2020. SARS‐CoV‐2 mainly spreads by cough, sneeze, droplet inhalation, and contact. SARS‐CoV‐2 has been detected in saliva samples, making saliva a potential transmission route for COVID‐19. Based on our experience of fighting against the COVID‐19 epidemic, some protective measures that can help reduce the risk of saliva‐related transmission are suggested, in order to avoid the potential spread of SARS‐CoV‐2 among patients, visitors, and dental practitioners.
