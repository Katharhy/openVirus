<p>The interaction between viruses and saliva is a complex biological process. Human saliva is abundant of biologically active components, such as proline‐rich proteins, mucins MG1 and MG2, and gp340. These components interact with pathogens and cause multiple influences on their biological behavior (de Almeida Pdel, Gregio, Machado, de Lima, &amp; Azevedo, 
 <xref rid="omi12289-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Moreover, pathogenic viruses in saliva have altered biological patterns such as increased aggregation and communicability (Anschau &amp; Sanjuan, 
 <xref rid="omi12289-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). According to a previous study on vesicular stomatitis virus, this pathogen has a strong aggregating ability in the presence of saliva, and some host factors, such as fibrinogen, could promote this saliva‐induced aggregation process, suggesting the important role saliva plays in the biological behavior of this virus (Anschau &amp; Sanjuan, 
 <xref rid="omi12289-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). According to another study, the biochemical components of saliva are closely associated with the presence of Zika virus (ZIKV), indicating complex interactions between the virus and saliva (Siqueira, Moffa, Mussi, &amp; Machado, 
 <xref rid="omi12289-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Hence investigation of the biological functions of saliva on the behavior of viruses, and the impact of virus on the composition of saliva, suggest the transmission of virus can be closely connected with saliva.
