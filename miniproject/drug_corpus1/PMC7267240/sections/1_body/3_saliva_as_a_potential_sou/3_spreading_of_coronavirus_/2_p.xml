<p>Coronavirus is a group of enveloped single‐stranded RNA viruses belonging to the order Nidovirales, the coronavirus family, and the coronavirus subfamily. It has 26 known species and can be divided into four genera (
 <italic>α</italic>, 
 <italic>β</italic>, 
 <italic>γ</italic>, and 
 <italic>δ</italic>). Only the 
 <italic>α</italic> and 
 <italic>β</italic> genus are human pathogenic strains. SARS‐CoV, SARS‐CoV‐2 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS‐CoV) all belong to the β subgroup. Studies have shown that early target cells for SARS‐CoV infection include ACE2‐positive cells/keratin epithelial cells in the salivary gland duct and other cells in the lungs, such as ACE2‐positive cells/keratin alveolar epithelial cells, which suggested the salivary gland epithelial cells may be infected in vivo after entry of the virus (Liu et al.,

 <xref rid="omi12289-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Study of the invading process of SARS‐CoV‐2 revealed this pathogen invades human cells through ACE2 which functions as a cell receptor. This process is similar to the invasion process of SARS‐CoV, suggesting a similar invasion mechanism of these two species of coronavirus. Therefore, salivary glands may also become a potential source of the transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2, which is not to be neglected (Wan, Shang, Graham, Baric, &amp; Li,
