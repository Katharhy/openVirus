<p>Real‐time RT‐PCR detection results of throat wash and saliva showed that the content of SARS‐CoV RNA in saliva was higher than that in throat wash, which supported the possibility of oral droplet transmission of SARS‐CoV (Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="omi12289-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). Studies have found viral RNA and live (culturable) viruses in air samples, and SARS‐CoV may be an opportunistic airborne pathogen (Booth et al., 
 <xref rid="omi12289-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>; Xiao et al., 
 <xref rid="omi12289-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). As a result, the virus has the potential to initiate disease through both short‐distance and long‐distance aerosol transmission, and there is at high risk of infection in people who have close and unprotected contact with SARS patients (Tuan et al., 
 <xref rid="omi12289-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). Evidence suggests that aerosols may be produced during endotracheal intubation or in combination with other procedures such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation or bronchoscopy, to increase the risk of SARS transmission (Seto, 
 <xref rid="omi12289-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). To et al reported that SARS‐CoV‐2 can be detected in 91.7% of the saliva samples studied, indicating that saliva as a potential source of SARS‐CoV‐2 spreading (To et al., 
 <xref rid="omi12289-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Therefore, dental clinicians in close contact with patients, salivary aerosols and blood need to be highly protected to reduce the risk of infection, particularly during the epidemic period of COVID‐19.
