<p>The salivary acquired pellicle that consist of salivary proteins such as acid proline‐rich protein, statherin and histatins, allow the oral bacteria to colonize on tooth surfaces, and provide nutrition for their survival, reproduction and metabolism (Kolenbrander, 
 <xref rid="omi12289-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Salivary mucins and glycosylated proteins can provide carbon and nitrogen sources for the growth and metabolism of oral microbiota. The binding between salivary proteins and oral microbes can not only help microbial adherence, but also cause the aggregation of oral microbiota and thus increase the clearance of bacteria from the oral cavity, including some pathogens. Therefore, saliva can act as a “gatekeeper”, and help prevent the spread of pathogens to the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts (Ruhl,
