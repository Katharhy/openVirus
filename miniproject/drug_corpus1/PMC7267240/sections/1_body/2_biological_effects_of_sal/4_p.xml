<p>In addition to providing a nutritional source for the growth of microorganisms, saliva contains a large number of antibacterial and antiviral proteins. The major antimicrobial components that have been identified in saliva include lysozyme, peroxidase, lactoferrin, and histatins (Tenovuo, 
 <xref rid="omi12289-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). Secretory IgA (sIgA) plays an important role in immunity by binding the surface molecules of pathogenic microorganisms and preventing adhesion and colonization (Balmaseda et al., 
 <xref rid="omi12289-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). Of interest, most of these antibacterial proteins, including cathelcidin (LL‐37), lactoferrin, lysozyme, mucins, peroxidase, salivary agglutinin (gp340, DMBT1), sIgA, SLPI, and α, β defensins, also display antiviral activities, typically against specific viral pathogens (Malamud et al., 
 <xref rid="omi12289-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). The mechanisms of viral inactivation include not only direct binding to the virus, but also indirect methods via intracellular modulation of viral replication, modulation of signaling pathways, and recruitment of immune cells that contribute to antiviral activity in vivo (Diamond, Beckloff, &amp; Ryan,
