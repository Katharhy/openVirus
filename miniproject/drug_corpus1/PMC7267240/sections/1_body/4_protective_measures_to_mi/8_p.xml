<p>Usually, splatters and droplets can contaminate a 3‐ft diameter range, while aerosols produced can spread further and cause long‐lasting contamination and potential transmission (Zemouri, de Soet, Crielaard, &amp; Laheij, 
 <xref rid="omi12289-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). A recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine demonstrated that aerosol and fomite transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 is plausible, since coronavirus remains viable and infectious in aerosols for hours, and on inanimate surfaces up to days (van Doremalen et al., 
 <xref rid="omi12289-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Aerosol‐generating dental procedures could spread saliva‐contaminated droplets/aerosols to various surfaces and equipment in the dental office, which requires specific disinfection tactics. Good ventilation is critical for the reduction of aerosols in the clinic setting. Strict and regular surface disinfection with alcohol or chlorine disinfectant is also important during the outbreak of COVID‐19. Of note, saliva‐containing waste generated by patients with suspected or confirmed contagious diseases is regarded as infectious medical waste and should be properly disposed accordingly.
