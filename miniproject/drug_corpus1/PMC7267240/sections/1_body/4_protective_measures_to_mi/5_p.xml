<p>A recent meta‐analysis has shown that a preprocedural mouthrinse can significantly reduce microbial load in dental aerosols (Marui et al., 
 <xref rid="omi12289-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). A preprocedural mouthrinse would be most useful in cases when rubber dam cannot be used. Of note, most of suggestions for preprocedural mouthrinse are based on bacteriology instead of virology. Limited evidence has shown that povidone solutions (0.23%~1%) are effective against SARS‐CoV, after 1‐min in vitro incubation (Kariwa, Fujii, &amp; Takashima, 
 <xref rid="omi12289-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). Hydrogen peroxide (0.5%) has also been shown to inactivate HCoV Strain 229E within 1 min of treatment in vitro (Kampf, Todt, Pfaender, &amp; Steinmann, 
 <xref rid="omi12289-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). However, clinical studies are still needed to evaluate their capability for reducing the salivary load of SARS‐CoV‐2 and saliva‐contaminated droplets/aerosols during dental procedures. When performing intraoral examinations, the use of three‐way syringe should be avoided in order to minimize splatter/droplets during the epidemic period of COVID‐19. Intraoral X‐ray examination will stimulate saliva secretion and coughing, and thus extraoral radiographies, such as panoramic radiography and cone‐beam CT could be alternatives (Meng et al.,
