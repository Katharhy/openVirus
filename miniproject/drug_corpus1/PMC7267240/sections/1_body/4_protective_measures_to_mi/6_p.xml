<p>The use of rubber dams can significantly minimize the production of saliva‐contaminated splatters, droplets and aerosols, particularly when high‐speed dental handpieces and ultrasonic devices are used. The application of a rubber dam can significantly reduce airborne particles in an approximately 3‐foot diameter of the operational field by 70% (Samaranayake, Reid, &amp; Evans, 
 <xref rid="omi12289-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">1989</xref>). When a rubber dam is applied, extra high‐volume evacuation should be used along with a regular saliva ejector to reduce splatters and droplets (Samaranayake &amp; Peiris, 
 <xref rid="omi12289-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>), and four‐hand operation is necessary (Figure 
 <xref rid="omi12289-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). If rubber dam isolation is not possible in some cases, manual devices such as Carisolv and hand scalers are recommended for caries removal and periodontal scaling, in order to minimize saliva contamination.
