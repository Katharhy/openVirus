A non‐invasive rapid screening test would be of great help to identify positive cases that warrant immediate quarantine or transfer to special clinic for further treatment.

Future development of saliva‐based rapid tests on either SARS‐CoV‐2 nucleic acid or antibodies may also have potential to help identify suspected cases in the dental clinic during the epidemic period.
