<p>The epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS‐CoV‐2), has become a major public health challenge around the world. In many cases, the infection of SARS‐CoV‐2 resulted from rapid human‐to‐human transmission, including direct contact with patients, and the transmission through droplets and aerosol particles (Xu et al., 
 <xref rid="omi12289-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). The respiratory syndrome caused by this virus is severe and even fatal (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="omi12289-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). It has been reported that angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the main host cell receptor of SARS‐CoV‐2 and plays a crucial role in the entry of virus into the cell (Zhou et al., 
 <xref rid="omi12289-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Interestingly, the results from our laboratory show that ACE2 is highly expressed on the epithelial cells of oral mucosa, suggesting that the oral cavity could be at high risk for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, and transmission‐based precautions should be taken in the dental clinic (Xu et al., 
 <xref rid="omi12289-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Since many viruses including SARS‐CoV‐2 can be detected in saliva (Kaczor‐Urbanowicz et al., 
 <xref rid="omi12289-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; To et al., 
 <xref rid="omi12289-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), the risk of transmission of viruses, especially those that cause respiratory infections, through saliva is non‐negligible in the dental clinic (Meng, Hua, &amp; Bian, 
 <xref rid="omi12289-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Therefore, based on our experience of fighting against the COVID‐19 epidemic, preventing the spread of disease through saliva in the dental clinic is critical to the health of both doctors and patients (Peng et al.,
