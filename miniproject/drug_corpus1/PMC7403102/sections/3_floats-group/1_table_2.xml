   <p>The table presents selected data on Covid-19 for Germany, based on data released from the Robert Koch Institute, a federal agency for disease control, on May 10th 2020. The data show that the two most southern states, Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg have much more cases of Covid-19 and Covid-19-related deaths (both in absolute numbers and per 100 000 people) than the two northern states Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Schleswig-Holstein. Within Bavaria, there are very strong differences between Tirschenreuth (one of the hotspots of Covid-19 in Germany, located in the north east of Bavaria on the border to the Czech republic) and its directly neighbouring districts Wunsiedel (in the north) and Neustadt/Waldnaab (Neustadt/WN) (in the south), compared to districts that are more distant to the hotspot (Oberallgäu in the north west corner, Main-Spessart in the south west corner and Regensburg in the center of Bavaria). Taken together, these data show the high efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 for spreading from a site of initial infection, but also the efficiency of adequate countermeasures taken. Abbreviations: Bad. Württ. = Baden Württemberg; Meckl.-Vorp. = Mecklenburg-Vorpommern; Schlesw.-Holst. = Schleswig-Holstein.</p>
