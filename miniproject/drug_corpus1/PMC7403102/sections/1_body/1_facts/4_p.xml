<p id="p0040">The relatively lower number of infected people as well as COVID-19-associated deaths in Germany seems to be due to strong differences in the percentage of infected people with clinical symptoms between the south and north of Germany (
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> ). It seems that measures taken after the first cases in Bavaria (a large state in the South East of Germany, which was first hit by the pandemics) were successful to prevent a strong spreading on the long run. Germany had the advantage to be affected by COVID-19 later than China and Italy. Getting valuable information from other countries was essential for slowing down and partially restricting the pandemics in Germany. Furthermore, the relatively high availability of equipment for intensive care reduced the death rate of infected people. Importantly, the picture of inhomogenous distribution of the disease and associated deaths as seen for the whole of Germany is also seen when the spreading of infections and deaths is analyzed within Bavaria, the state being affected the most (
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The detailed analysis of cases and deaths in districts points to hotspots of infection and death, from which the neighbouring areas seem to be reached out. This results in an overall picture with a relatively high number of cases and deaths in the hotspot (Tirschenreuth) that far exceeds the average number of cases / population and deaths / population of total Germany. The immediate neighbouring districts in the north and south show about half the cases / population and less than half the deaths / population than the hotspot, whereas districts distant of the hotspot are characterized much lower numbers. This picture points to strong initial effects from local infection events, but, importantly, it also indicates that further spreading had obviously been prevented through adequate measures.
