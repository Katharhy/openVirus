 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> also shows COVID-19 cases and deaths in Central Europe and East Asia. The numbers of cases (most of them with clinical symptoms) in Central European countries ranged from 1993 to 5359 per million people, whereas those of East Asian countries were in the range of 18 ~ 211. The ratio between the two was about 32. These numbers depend on the number of tests performed in individual countries, as well as on differences in the test strategy, resulting in a certain degree of uncertainty. To get a more precise picture of comparison, COVID-19-related deaths per nation’s total population (per million people) were calculated based on the total population of each country. As seen in 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the numbers of Central European countries were in the range of 391–548 deaths/million people, with the only exception being Germany’s lower number of 83. In contrast, deaths/million people in East Asian countries were in the range of 0.3–5, i. e. they were nearly 150 times lower than the values found for Central European countries. Importantly, also the death rate of infected people seems to be much lower in East Asian countries, compared to the Central European countries (except Germany).
