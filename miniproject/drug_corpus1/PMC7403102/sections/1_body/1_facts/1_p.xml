<p id="p0025">For the analysis of the difference regarding the number of infected people and the death tolls due to COVID-19 between Central European and East Asian countries, we have chosen Italy, Spain, France, Germany and UK from Central Europe and China, South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan from South East Asia. Mongolia and North Korea were excluded, since not sufficient information was available from both countries. For comparison, the United States, which have the highest number of infected and dead people due to COVID-19, were included into our analysis.</p>
