<p id="p0150">Very recently, Katoh et al. reported a possible association between lower rate of fatality induced by coronavirus and immunization rate against encephalitis 
 <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Artificial vaccines against Japanese encephalitis (JE) may result in relatively lower mortality rate in some countries. JE immunization is widespread or included in national programs in many Asian countries including China, South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. In all of these countries, the fatality rate due to COVID-19 is very low when compared with countries that donâ€™t immunize against JE. Also, a similar hypothesis has been proposed that the inoculation of BCG vaccine may be effective against infectious diseases caused by the new coronavirus 
 <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. It is thus very intriguing to find out the reason why recipients are cross-protected against COVID-19 conferring lower fatality rate in the countries where immunization is performed against some infectious diseases such as encephalitis or tuberculosis. It will be important to explore the underlying mechanism, such as whether this can be explained by mere nonspecific activation of immunity.
