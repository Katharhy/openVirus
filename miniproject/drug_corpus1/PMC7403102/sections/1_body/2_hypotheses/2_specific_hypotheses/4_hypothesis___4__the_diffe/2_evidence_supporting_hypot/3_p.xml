<p id="p0155">As the aspect of nonspecific activation of immunity is considered as one possible mechanism that counteracts SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the death rate of infected patients, it might seem worthwhile to ask the question whether the lower rate of infection and mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 in Germany, compared to other European countries, might be connected to differences in vaccination coverages. Unfortunately, such an analysis is difficult and has severe inherent limitations, as there is a very high degree of variability of vaccination coverage in Germany with respect to age, sex and geography 
 <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. This does not allow to consider Germany as one entity, but rather would require to focus on many different regions and groups, for which it seems difficult to obtain the required complete set of data. However, when the influence vaccination coverage for risk groups is compared between 11 European countries 
 <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> Germany is only on place 10 among 11 – certainly not in favour for a more advanced immunization profile of the country. Furthermore, the analysis of the national vaccination calendars of France, United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Portugal and Germany 
 <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> shows a large overlap of essential immunizations in these countries – a finding that is not in favour of assuming a specific aspect of immunization in Germany that might have a particular negative impact on SARS-CoV-2 infections and disease.
