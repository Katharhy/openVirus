<p id="p0145">A similar paradoxical seeming suggestion has been raised for childhood leukemia: the more often a child is infected during the first year of life, the less likely it seems to develop leukemia. Epidemiological studies performed by Kinlen

 <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> separately showed that high socioeconomic status and lack of contact with multiple infections early in life could be a risk factor. Based on these observations, zur Hausen and de Villiers made the following proposal by assuming the existence of a fairly universal lesser-known tumor virus such as TTV. Many viral infections during pregnancy and perinatal have a negative effect on the persistence and increase of this oncovirus. Intermittent viral infections, by inducing interferon, significantly reduce tumor virus load and reduce the risk of viral chromosomal alterations, prerequisites for malignant transformation
