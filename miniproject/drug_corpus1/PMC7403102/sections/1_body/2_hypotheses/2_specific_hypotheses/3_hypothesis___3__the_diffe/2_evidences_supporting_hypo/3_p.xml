<p id="p0115">Although humans are a fairly homogeneous group of species as viewed from the genome, the diversity of the genome is well maintained. It avoids all human species from suffering the same disease and is a means of survival as a species, even if some disease prevails. Although plague and people have been closely linked, one of the causes of human diversity is infectious disease. Many genetic diseases are unfavorable to survival, but in some cases they are also advantageous for survival, and in some cases mutations have given the power to survive from the diseases that have hit the ground in the past. In East Asia, where agriculture was established early on and urbanization has been achieved, plagues have been rushing to people in a messy environment since ancient times. We believe that it should be worth considering that individuals with advantageous gene mutations have been selected in relation to various epidemics, and have reached the present day.</p>
