<p id="p0130">Further evidence for our hypothesis is provided by results obtained through the study of other viral systems. There are a few lucky people who have escaped infection while being exposed to HIV-1. Individuals homozygous for CCR5-Δ32 show perfect resistance to HIV-1 
 <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Infection with Yersinia pestis or smallpox virus were suggested as potential selective pressures favoring CCR5-Δ32 
 <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Only European or Central Asians have this characteristic and in Norway, CCR5-Δ32 allele frequencies reaches nearly 20%. Since AIDS, smallpox and plague are, by nature, independent infectious diseases that should be completely unrelated, it is very intriguing if these infectious diseases are linked by this mutant gene. Indeed, in 1999, Lalani et al. showed that poxviruses, can exploit chemokine receptors, especially CCR5 to infect some cell types, notably migratory leukocytes 
 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. This further suggests a need searching for polymorphism and virological studies to see if there is a difference in the function of the ACE2 gene as a SARS-COV-2 entry receptor between Asians and Europeans.
