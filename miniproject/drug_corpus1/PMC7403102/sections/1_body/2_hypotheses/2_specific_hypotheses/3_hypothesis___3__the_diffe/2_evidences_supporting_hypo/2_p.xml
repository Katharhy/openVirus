<p id="p0110">Under the over-crowded and chaotic conditions, East Asians must have experienced overwhelmingly with many plagues including several zoonoses due to the encounter with strange animal species. It is natural to consider that such epidemics are related to the change, choice, and evolution of the people who live there. East Asians may have evolved to become more resistant against infectious agents in general including coronavirus. It is possible that difference of the past plagues could contribute to a difference in the susceptibility (and thus, pathogenicity) between Europeans and Asians against present new corona. Present COVID-19 is apparently derived from bats directly or via vector animals, and its appearance is closely related to Chinese food culture. Given this, it is not strange to consider the possibility that this area had been hit by coronavirus infections similar to this time before long ago. In fact, the country experienced similar endemics, SARS and MERS only 18 and 8Â years ago, respectively. This suggests that coronavirus infection itself is one of the most likely candidates for East Asian selection and evolution among the past plagues.</p>
