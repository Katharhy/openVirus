 <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Although less dramatic, it is speculated that the relationship between typhoid fever and cystic fibrosis, which is a recessive genetic disease commonly found in Europeans, is similar. There is also information regarding the relationship between human ABO blood type and disease, while AB type is strong against cholera and O type is resistant to tuberculosis 
 <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. However, our hypothesis suffers from the lack of analogous data available in other viral infections. In other words, if this theory is relevant, we should realize earlier that there is a difference in susceptibility and pathogenicity between Western and Asian people even in the case of other viral infections before this corona pandemic. Still, it is not impossible to explain with a claim that there was no report from the past because there was no appropriate viral pandemic involving Europe and East Asia in the past. If there is, it may be the Spanish Flu occurred at the beginning of the last century or some influenzas after that. However, in the case of Spanish Flu, it was before the identification of the influenza virus, and it was a special event taking place towards the end of World War I in Europe, so it is quite difficult to compare the difference in the pathogenicity of the influenza virus in both areas. Or is the new coronavirus indeed the first case to show such ethnic differences in terms of pathogenicity? It is hoped that this point will be answered when data in the comparative studies on new coronavirus infections in the United States, where many European and Asian immigrants live, will be accumulated in the very near future.
