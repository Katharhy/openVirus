<p id="p0100">Human hosts and their virus have co-evolved for millions of years, during which viruses have adapted to defense system of its host by regulating pathogenic mechanisms. Therefore, the possible genetic change and resulted selection of people living in East Asia should also be considered from an evolutional perspective. Thus, the difference in viral susceptibility and mortality of East Asian people to SARS-CoV-2 could also be explained if people living in East Asia may have evolved to be more resistant to viral infections, including those of novel corona viruses.</p>
