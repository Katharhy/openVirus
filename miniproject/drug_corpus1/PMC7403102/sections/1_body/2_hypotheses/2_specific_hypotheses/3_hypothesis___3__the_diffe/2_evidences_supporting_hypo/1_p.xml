<p id="p0105">In East Asia, especially in China, agriculture started about 13,000 years ago, maybe 3000 years ahead of Europe. This led to an explosive increase in population, urbanization, and population density with the supply of abundant food. As a matter of course, acute viral infections such as measles, rubella, mumps, which could not be established until then, are believed to have taken roots in the human population (in the case of measles, it requires a population more than 250,000 to settle). Unlike today, Asia had long been much richer than Europe before the Industrial Revolution.</p>
