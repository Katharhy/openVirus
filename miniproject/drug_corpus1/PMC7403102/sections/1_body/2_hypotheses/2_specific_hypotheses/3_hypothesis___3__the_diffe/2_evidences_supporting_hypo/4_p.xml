<p id="p0120">Several genes may be involved in the genetic predisposition to COVID-19, and the combination of multiple genes may be important for the severity of the infection. Among them, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to various diseases such as autoimmune diseases and infectious diseases. The composition ratio of HLA types varies greatly depending on the country and ethnic group. Since HLA is a protein of the immune system that is responsible for antigen presentation, HLA has been attracting attention in relation to disease susceptibility. Ellinghaus and colleagues performed GWAS on patients in Italy and Spain 
 <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. But, it was found that certain HLA types are unlikely to be associated with exacerbation of the novel coronavirus at least in Italy and Spain. Nevertheless, since HLA types, which are present only in Japan and other Asian countries, may show resistance to the novel coronavirus, further analysis is necessary.
