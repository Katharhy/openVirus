<p id="p0095">According to the classical models of virulence evolution of the virus, multiple infections select for raised virulence. To explain why so many people are dying of COVID-19 in New York City, sequence analysis of the viral genome has been performed. According to Zimmer, the virus mainly came from Asia through a small number of infected individuals in California, while in New York, more than 100 people initially brought the virus mainly from Europe, suggesting as if the European type viruses are more virulent in its pathogenicity and infectivity than the Asian type

A number of studies have supported that through collective actions leading to common good production and immune system impairment, viral cooperation can lead to increased levels of virulence. Researchers around the world have already sequenced over 3000 more of SARS-COV2, finding some of which carry distinctive mutations. Very recently, mutation has suggested to be directly linked with functional changes in viral pathogenicity. Yao et al. have characterized the functional properties of 11 viruses isolated from COVID-19 patients, all of which have at least one mutation. Importantly, these viral isolates show significant variation in cytopathic effects and viral load, up to 270-fold differences, when infecting Vero-E6 cells 
 <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Based on more molecular virological studies, Tan et al. proposed that SARS-CoV-2 can be divided into two major lineages (L and S). Intriguingly, the S and L lineages can be clearly defined by just two tightly linked SNPs at positions 8782 (

 <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. However, there was no evidence so far that this mutation produced a more virulent form of the virus. Moreover, the data examined up to now are still very limited, and follow-up analyses of a larger set of data are needed to have a better understanding of the evolution and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, further virological studies must focus on the relationship between differences in nucleotide sequences and infectivity/ pathogenicity of viruses since there is no firm evidence, so far, of the existence of European strains of the coronavirus or its pathogenicity being more virulent than the Asian strains.
