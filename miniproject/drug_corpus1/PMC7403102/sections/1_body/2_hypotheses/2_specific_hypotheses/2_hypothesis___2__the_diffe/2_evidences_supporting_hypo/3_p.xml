<p id="p0085">As to repeated infections, another possibility is also considered that is involvement of the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), which is a well-known phenomenon in the field of viral immunology. First, letâ€™s assume the situation of the individual who received a coronavirus infection followed by a second one. One week or so after initial infection, antibodies against the virus are elicited, and the second virus reacts with this antibody causing more serious effects. This phenomenon to increase viral infectivity and virulence has been observed with many viruses including several coronaviruses, HIV, Zika virus and mosquito-borne flaviviruses (dengue virus and Yellow fever virus). Indeed, Olsen and colleagues have shown antibody enhancement of infection with one of the animal coronaviruses, feline infectious peritonitis virus by a subset of specific monoclonal antibodies, especially those directed against specific sites on the spike protein

Further studies are necessary to experimentally verify whether the effects of repeated infections alone or together with the ADE are involved in the enhancement of viral pathogenicity.
