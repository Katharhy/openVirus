<p id="p0075">In Italy, the death toll from the new coronavirus was 25,085 by the April 22, the third highest in the world after the United States and Spain. Of these, more than 10,000 people were confirmed to be infected among medical staff. This finding shows that inadequate protection of medical staff from infection is a major issue. Many of the doctors who died were practitioners. They were fighting the new coronavirus without adequate protective equipment (sometimes due to unavailability of material) or underestimation of the contagiousity of the new virus, driven by the strong wish to help their patients. Thus, it is highly likely, especially during the medical collapse, that these doctors will have got infections repeatedly from the infected patients one after another. So the question is what would be expected if a person is infected with coronavirus multiple times.</p>
