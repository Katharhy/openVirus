<p id="p0090">These aspects may be particularly relevant for a limited number of people such as medical staff. Therefore, in addition to that, the emergence of more virulent virus due to mutation of the virus during the course of superinfection might also be assumed. RNA viruses are, in general, highly susceptible to mutations, and the base substitution rate, which indicates the degree of change, is estimated to be 7 + 2 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> nucleotide substitutions per site and per year on average in case of Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), an enteropathogenic coronavirus. This rate falls in the range reported for other RNA viruses 
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In addition, it is also known that coronavirus changes considerably easily due to gene recombination or part of gene loss (deletion). For example, the new strain of canine respiratory coronavirus identified in 2017 is reported to be a recombinant of the existing canine and bovine coronaviruses 
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In addition, it has been known that the deletion of part of the spike gene has caused the emergence of a PRCV from the ancestral porcine gastroenteritis virus 
 <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. It is possible that the doctor who actually examined many infected patients could be exposed to the coronavirus repeatedly, and among the multiple virus strains infected, more virulent virus strains suitable for spread may be selected and prevailed, at least initially.
