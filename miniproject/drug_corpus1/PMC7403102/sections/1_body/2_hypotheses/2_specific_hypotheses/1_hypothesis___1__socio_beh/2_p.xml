<p id="p0060">There is also a marked difference in obesity between Westerners and Asians, mainly due to differences in food culture. In addition, people wear shoes indoors in Western societies, while it is strictly forbidden to do so in East Asia. Although the weight of this habit in preventing virus infection is not clear at this moment, this difference indicates that Asians very clearly distinguish between outdoor and indoor in daily life. The habit of wearing a mask in case of a cold or fear of it also seems quite Asian-specific. Thus, it is very likely that differences with respect to these actions play an important role in the spread of infection.</p>
