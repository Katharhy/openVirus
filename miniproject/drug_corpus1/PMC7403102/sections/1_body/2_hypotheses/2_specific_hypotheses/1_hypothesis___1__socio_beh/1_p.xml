<p id="p0055">Hypothesis #1 is based on the difference in social behavior and customs of people in each area, i.e. in Europe and South East Asia. This might explain the difference to some extent. When comparing the lifestyles of European countries with that of Asia, the first noticeable difference is the closeness of direct human contact. In Asia, bowing is the mainstream greeting, and even with the spread of Western culture, shaking hands is still not very common. Of course, besides handshaking, there can be no hugs or kisses that are popular in Western culture (if any, those are performed only after building a very close relationship). It is easy to imagine that these common actions in Western societies help to spread respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 very efficiently. These differences between Europeans and Asians, considered from a perspective of the social science might be very important in the progress of the pandemic.</p>
