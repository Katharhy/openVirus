<p id="p0185">However, the pandemics have taught us some essentials for counteracting in the future. At the beginning of the outbreak of COVID-19 in Europe, the initial response, especially the delay in response to outbreaks (clusters), demographics, social behavior and lower testing capacity, etc. were sometimes very problematic in response to COVID-19. These experiences allowed states that were hit later by the pandemics, like Germany, to adjust countermeasures. In Germany, the federal and local governments have been involved in the fight against COVID-19 from an early stage, and especially with an emphasis on looking for signs of early onset, PCR testing of very large numbers of samples for free, and isolation of defined cases. The medical system had time to be prepared and intensive care beds equipped with artificial respirators were reserved for COVID-19 and increased in number. The needed specialized staff was trained. Social distancing guidelines were introduced and widely followed. This resulted in slow-down of the pandemic.</p>
