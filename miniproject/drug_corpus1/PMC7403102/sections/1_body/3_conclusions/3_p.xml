<p id="p0170">We are convinced that the behavioral difference in human contact in both areas of the world can be considered to have a very important influence on the spread of the SARS-COV-2, as seen by the impressive positive effect of social distancing on the control of COVID-19 in Europe. This shows that hypothesis # 1 seems to be relevant to a significant degree for the differences between East Asia and Central Europe. However, hypothesis # 1 cannot explain the complete picture observed, as it would only have an impact on the number of cases in relation to the population, but not on the death rate of cases. As the death rates per cases are also lower in East Asia compared to Central Europe, mechanisms suggested in hypothesis # 2â€“4 might also contribute to the overall effect. In addition, mechanisms not included into our hypothesis might play essential roles and await to be defined in the future.</p>
