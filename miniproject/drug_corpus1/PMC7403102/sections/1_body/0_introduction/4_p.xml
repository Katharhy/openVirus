<p id="p0020">Of particular note is the striking difference in the extent of medical impact caused by SARS-CoV-2 in Eastern Asia versus Central Europe 
 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. This difference is prominent, when i) the number of infected persons with clinical symptoms, ii) the ratio between infected people with clinical symptoms and the total population of the countries, iii) the number of deaths, or iv) the death ratios of infected people with symptoms are compared between Eastern Asia and Central Europe. In this communication, we compared selected countries from Central Europe and East Asia with respect to the medical impact of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. Based on this analysis, we propose four hypotheses that might explain the observed differences. For each one of these hypotheses, we present direct or indirect evidences to support them. None of these hypotheses by itself can explain the observed differences. Rather, the mechanisms defined in individual hypotheses seem to interact and thus cause the overall effect observed. We are aware that additional mechanisms, not covered by our analysis, may also contribute to the pandemics.
