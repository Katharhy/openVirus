<p id="p0010">Due to the test strategy used in nearly all countries, “people infected with SARS-CoV-2” or simply named “COVID-19 cases” are usually people with clinical symptoms or contacts to infected people. The number of infected people without clinical symptoms is therefore unknown. Further testing, including antibody tests, will most likely reveal that much more people around the world have been infected than the number of defined cases of COVID-19. This may upset modern societies on a scale never seen before. On the other side, it may be assumed that these infected people might contribute to herd immunity and slow down further spread of the virus, provided their antibody response is longer lasting and has neutralizing potential. These aspects need further experimentation and proof.</p>
