<p>Targeting viruses with drugs can utilize the fact that viruses lack basic metabolic processes and rather exploit their hostâ€™s metabolic machinery. Lipid metabolism is an important component of the virus life cycle as demonstrated previously; as a result, targeting the lipid metabolism pathways could constitute an early-intervention and exciting host-directed drug target. Yuan et al. utilized such a pathway and tested a lipid drug library and showed that AM580, a retinoid acid receptor alpha (RAR-a) agonist could interrupt the life cycle of MERS-CoV as well as influenza A virus [

SREBPs are basic helix loop helix transcription factors that play an important role in regulating lipid metabolism which was highlighted as the mechanism of action for the antiviral activity of AM580 [
