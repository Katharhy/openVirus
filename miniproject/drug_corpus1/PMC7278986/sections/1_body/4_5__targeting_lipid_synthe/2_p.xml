<p>Statinâ€™s beneficial impact on viral infection could be due to its lipid lowering effects that can potentially suppress coronavirus infection, as shown in other viruses where the cholesterol-lowering abilities disturb lipid rafts. Even though lipid-lowering capabilities might impact viral replication, statins can also help in mitigating the impact of viral infection through their immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties [

Taken together, these studies suggest a beneficial impact for statins and potentially other lipid-lowering drugs such as PCSK9 inhibitors for treatment of COVID-19, especially that of the most severely infected people which are suffering from cardiovascular disease and diabetes [
