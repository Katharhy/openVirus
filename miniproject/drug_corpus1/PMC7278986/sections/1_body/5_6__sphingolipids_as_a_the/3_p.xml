<p>On this basis, the FDA-approved immunomodulator FTY720 (Fingolimod), one of the best characterized “sphingomimetic” drugs [
 <xref rid="B75-ijms-21-03544" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], is currently on an ongoing Clinical Trial (NCT04280588 and NCT04276688—ClinicalTrials.gov) for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic [

 <xref rid="B77-ijms-21-03544" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Fingolimod acts as a nonspecific agonist of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors (S1PR) and as a selective functional antagonist of the S1P1 subtype by promoting receptor internalization and degradation [
 <xref rid="B78-ijms-21-03544" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Since S1P1 is critical in controlling lymphocyte trafficking, its downregulation causes relocation of the immune cells to secondary lymphoid tissues, causing a reduction from the circulation and henceforth immunosuppression [
 <xref rid="B78-ijms-21-03544" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. This will reduce the central inflammation response and may help since elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6, are thought to be associated with respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. However, it has been shown that the degree of lymphopenia is not associated with risk of infection, and generally, infectious complications were relatively low on S1P modulators [

 <xref rid="B79-ijms-21-03544" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. It has also been well documented that patients taking these drugs do not suffer from an increased risk of community-acquired viral infections [

 <xref rid="B80-ijms-21-03544" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. We have recently shown that a higher level of ANGPTL6 was associated with slow multiple sclerosis progression and good response to fingolimod treatment [
