Due to their higher specificity, these new treatments hold great potential for clinical advancements in a broad range of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. In addition to the immunomodulatory property of fingolimod, its anti-thrombotic and anti-coagulant actions [

Nevertheless, other “sphingomimetic” and “sphingomodulating” compounds, some of which are already in clinical trials for other clinical diseases, can be easily reused and possibly provide further therapeutic options for the management of this global pandemic crisis [
