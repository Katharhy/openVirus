<p>Currently, there is no effective vaccine or drug for SARS-CoV-2 except for supportive and empirical medications including non-specific antivirals such as interferons or monoclonal antibodies [

Convalescent plasma from recovered patients has been utilized with some success, but several clinical studies are ongoing to evaluate its efficacy. More than 50 vaccines based on different platforms are under development with some in phase I trials [

While understanding the diverse roles of lipids in viral replication has led to the discovery of lipid-active compounds as possible antiviral agents, current compounds mostly lack specificity and are hence excessively toxic. Clearly, there is a need for multiple therapies for COVID-19, and studies have shown that viral entry, release, and consequently replication could possibly be blocked by altering or targeting membrane lipid composition and/or lipid metabolism, depicting new possibilities for antiviral therapies [
