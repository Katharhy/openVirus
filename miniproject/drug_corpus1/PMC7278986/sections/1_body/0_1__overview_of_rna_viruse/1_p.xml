<p>The rapidly growing Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic represents a serious global challenge [

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has been manifested as the third revelation of a highly pathogenic coronavirus into the human population after the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 [

 <xref rid="B4-ijms-21-03544" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The factors that influence the survival of such viruses on various surfaces depend on several factors such as the viral load, type of surface, suspension medium, humidity, temperature, and others [

Following COVID-19 infection, SARS-CoV-2 can penetrate the mucous membranes of the nose, eye, and/or mouth and move on to other vital organs such as the lung. Infections with SARS-CoV-2 range from asymptomatic or mild infections restricted to the upper respiratory tract to severe respiratory syndromes manifested by disseminated spread to the lower airways leading to local inflammation and pneumonia, especially in patients with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) [

 <xref rid="B7-ijms-21-03544" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reported increased mortality in individuals with diabetes (2.3% for overall vs. 7.3% in patients with diabetes) from 72,314 cases of COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="B8-ijms-21-03544" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Severe obesity and hypertension are present in 15.5% and 68.4% of D.M. individuals, respectively. While most severe infections affect the elderly above 60 years, children on the contrary seem to be less affected by COVID-19 for reasons yet to be elucidated [
