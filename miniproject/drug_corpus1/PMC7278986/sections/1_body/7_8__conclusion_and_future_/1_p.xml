<p>Lipid metabolism plays an important role in the viral infection cycle. This role can be harnessed as anti-viral drugs that can constitute a broad-spectrum drug that can be utilized in a makeshift fashion that offers a first response drug. The best example of such drugs are statins that has shown promising beneficial effect in people with various viral infections alongside their main role as a lipid lowering therapy. As a result, more work is needed to focus on the role played by lipid species at the structure and signaling pathway level in the viral life cycle. This will allow us to establish new drug targets as well as enhance existing drugs. Such lipid-based therapies can be used alone or in combination with other drugs, but they will have the advantage of targeting multiple viruses.</p>
