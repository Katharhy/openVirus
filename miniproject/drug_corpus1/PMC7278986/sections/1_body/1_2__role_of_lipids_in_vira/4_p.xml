<p>Citrate, which is the main carbon source for fatty acid (F.A.) or cholesterol synthesis, can usually pass across the mitochondrial membrane and is cleaved into acetyl-CoA that gets carboxylated by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) to yield malonyl-CoA [

 <xref rid="B39-ijms-21-03544" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. On the other hand, F.A. synthase (FASN) catalyzes the production of palmitic acid (C16:0) from cytosolic acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA. The palmitic acid can then be further processed and used in the synthesis of cell membranes, storage in lipid droplets, or the palmitoylation of host and viral proteins. As for sterol biosynthesis, two units of acetyl-CoA are processed to make acetoacetyl-CoA, which then enters the metabolic 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) pathway for cholesterol production. Moreover, F.A.s can be metabolized by catabolic beta-oxidation to yield high amounts of ATP [
