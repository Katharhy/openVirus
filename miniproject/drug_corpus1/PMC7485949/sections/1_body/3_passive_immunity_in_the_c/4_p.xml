<p>H‐IG is a drug derived from convalescent plasma. H‐IG is produced following normal IG production processes, via a fractionation process that results in a purified mix of IgGs in subclass ratios that mimic human IgG subclass mixtures (in this case, to ratios in COVID‐19 convalescent patients). The product will have a diverse set of polyclonal antibodies against SARS‐CoV‐2, with a standard, measured neutralization titer prior to release. The final product is finished to a precise concentration of IgG (10% solution is common). As a drug, H‐IG is regulated by health authorities, and several biopharmaceutical companies with specific infrastructure to produce plasma‐derived therapies have announced H‐IG programs.</p>
