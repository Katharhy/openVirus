<p>CP has been used compassionately in this pandemic and is currently in clinical trials via an expanded access program in the United States, managed by the COVID‐19 Convalescent Plasma Project (CCPP19.org). In a published report of 10 critically ill patients in China, 200 mL of plasma with titers of at least 1:640 on top of supportive care improved signs and symptoms in critically ill patients.

 </xref> Assuming an average normal level of IgG, 200 mL equates to ~ 2 g of IgG, or 0.03 g/kg in a 70 kg adult. The process for using CP as a therapy is straightforward and efficient: one or two units of fresh, frozen, and virus‐inactivated plasma (~ 250–500 mL, or up to ~ 5 g of IgG) collected from individual convalescent patient(s) is administered to blood group‐matched patients. Although CP is screened for neutralization titers, the titers are not standardized, and the dose of antibodies (including IgG) and other immune factors is unknown. The FDA recommends that CP neutralization titers are at least 1:160.
