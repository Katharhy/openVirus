 </xref> The short time of maximum plasma concentration (T
 <sub>max</sub>) and long T1‐2 suggest that a single infusion of H‐IG may be sufficient for treatment in the acute disease settings. In upcoming studies, it is important to confirm that the PK of SARS‐CoV‐2 specific antibodies administered therapeutically in an active disease state is similar the PK of IG (i.v.).
