<p>In general, i.v. IgG is well‐tolerated and the safety profile is well known. Common adverse reactions are mild and self‐limiting, but severe adverse effects, including thrombosis, renal dysfunction, and death, are known to occur in high‐risk patients. Little is known about the safety of CP or H‐IGs when used to manage coronavirus infections. There is a theoretical concern that H‐IG against coronavirus, including SARS‐CoV‐2, may potentiate disease via a mechanism called antibody‐dependent enhancement (ADE), and earlier studies of H‐IG in SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have not provided enough information to extrapolate to COVID‐19.</p>
