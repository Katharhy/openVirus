<p id="Par7">The psychosocial conditions which fuel these interlocking health epidemics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] are central for both understanding the drivers of severe COVID-19 infection in PLWH and for developing effective medical and public health interventions as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. PLWH have an increased likelihood of mental health burden, illicit drug use, and other STIs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], all catalyzed by psychosocial burdens experienced at elevated rates in marginalized populations including sexual and gender minorities, racial and ethnic minorities, and/or the poor and underserved. While there is no standard set of psychosocial factors that are prescribed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], burdens such as medical mistrust, loneliness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], stigma [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], and hopelessness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] have been implicated in the propagation of disease. In fact, at the Infectious Diseases Practice (IDP) at the New Jersey Medical School in Newark, where we collaborate, clinical staff who are managing patients via telephone conversations amidst the COVID-19 pandemic indicate many individuals are extremely stressed, anxious, and unable to sleep.
