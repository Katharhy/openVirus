<p id="Par8">Physical distancing or social isolation recommended by the CDC to reduce the spread of COVID-19 may add additional burden to already highly burdened lives. Physical distancing is described as avoiding crowds, canceling large events, closing schools, staying at and working from home; these measures have been shown to reduce the rate of new COVID-19 infections. However, we know very little about how physical distancing enforced by a pandemic such as COVID-19 continues to impact PLWH. Older PLWH already experience heightened rates of loneliness and social isolation [

Moreover, for individuals from underserved communities and communities of color who constitute the majority of patients we see at the IDP, physical distancing may not be possible due to financial conditions or work circumstances. Economic disparities, associated with worse health conditions and underlying health conditions [
