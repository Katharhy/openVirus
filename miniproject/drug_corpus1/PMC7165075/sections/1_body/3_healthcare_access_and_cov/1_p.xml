<p id="Par10">PLWH require regular engagement with the healthcare system to maintain viral suppression, which provides optimal clinical benefits and drastic reductions in HIV transmission [

ART implementation and consistent adherence have improved the long-term health outcomes among PLWH, but they are vulnerable if interruptions in treatment occur due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Interactions with health providers, access to medications, and adherence are undermined by physical distancing imposed by many states and municipalities. Findings drawn from 9/11 indicate that in times of crisis, adherence to ART may be severely compromised for PLWH, creating an additional level of concern [
