<p id="Par13">As COVID-19 emerges in the population of PLWH, we must contextualize the health challenges that will emerge within a syndemic frameworkâ€”one that is more of a conceptualization [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] than a theory per se that prescribes specific elements of the paradigm [

To protect PLWH from COVID-19 and future pandemics, programming to address COVID-19 disease in light of the multiple mutually reinforcing health burdens faced by PLWH is imperative. While healthcare providers often attend to the biological, behavioral, and occasionally psychological drivers of health, public health focuses on the structural drivers of disease and disease surveillance, neither fully embraces the psychosocial burdens and stressors that diminish well-being as delineated in a conceptualization such as that of a syndemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Effective treatment for HIV-COVID-19 coinfection must be designed to address these viral interactions as well as the psychosocial burdens that both exacerbate co-infection and increase the likelihood of mortality.
