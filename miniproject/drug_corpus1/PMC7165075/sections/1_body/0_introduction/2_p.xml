<p id="Par3">A syndemic is defined as two or more epidemics interacting synergistically to produce an increased burden of disease in a population [

In this perspective, infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19, is assumed to function in tandem with a myriad of health challenges faced by PLWH, including HIV itself, chronic non-communicable diseases, mental health burden, substance abuse, and other infections, all of which are catalyzed by biological, behavioral, psychosocial and structural drivers of disease as posited by Halkitis et al
