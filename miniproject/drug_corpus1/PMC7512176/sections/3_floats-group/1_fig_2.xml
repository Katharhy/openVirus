  <p>Viral load is calculated from the number of sequencing reads. (A) The data and linear regression model estimates for the viral load standards. The narrow shaded area is the 95% confidence interval for the regression curve, and the dashed lines are 95% prediction intervals for measurements. The mean squared error of prediction was 0.324 log
   <sub>10</sub> copies/ml. (B) Distribution of independently measured clinical viral loads in a subset of 146 samples used to assess model performance. (C) Relationship between the clinical viral load and the sequence-derived viral load from the model shown in panel A for these 146 samples. (D) Frequency of sequence-derived viral load estimates for all 1,620 samples.
