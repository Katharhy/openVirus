<p>The patterns of read depth were reproducible between individuals, with similar patterns of high and low coverage across the genome (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Importantly, we did not observe a drop-off in coverage below five reads to be systematically associated with particular parts of the genome (Fig. S4).
