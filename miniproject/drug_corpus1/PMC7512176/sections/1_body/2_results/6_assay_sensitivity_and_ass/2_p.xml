<p>Whole HIV genomes, defined as having a sequence length over 8,000 bp with a minimum read depth of five deduplicated reads, were obtained from all 1,204 samples with a viral load greater than 10,000 copies/ml and from 1,297/1,424 samples (91%) with a viral load greater than 1,000 (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The lowest viral load for which a whole genome was obtained was 4,300 copies/ml and 97% of samples above this threshold produced a whole genome (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). The majority of commercially available HIV-genotyping tests require a viral load of over 1,000 copies/ml. In this data set, 6% of samples had viral loads within the range of 1,000 to 4,300 copies/ml; at this range, the average length of genome covered was 4,172 bp (
