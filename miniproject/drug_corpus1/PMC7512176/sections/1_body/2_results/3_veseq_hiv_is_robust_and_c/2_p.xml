<p>Like most high-throughput NGS protocols, veSEQ-HIV requires fragmentation of the virus RNA into so-called “inserts.” In previous work, we found that inserts of 350 bp or more offer useful insights into within-host phylogenetic diversity (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>); we therefore sought to optimize the length of these inserts to be as long as possible within the limits compatible with the Illumina sequencing platform (350 to 600bp). After reducing preenrichment PCR cycles from 18 to 12 and introducing a size-selective bead cleanup to remove shorter fragments, over 40% of inserts within each sequencing library were in the desirable size range (Fig. S1).
