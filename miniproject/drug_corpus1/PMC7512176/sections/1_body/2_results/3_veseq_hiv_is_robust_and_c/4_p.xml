<p>The cost of implementing a high-throughput virus genomics system will vary by setting. In our laboratory in Oxford, the reagent, consumables, and labor costs of the entire assay, from frozen blood to final data, is approximately 30 GBP in 2020, 3 times lower than the WHO budget recommendations for HIV pol sequencing in low-income settings (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Costs were reduced by concentrating total nucleic acid extractions to allow library preparations with one-quarter reagent volumes without losses in sequencing sensitivity (Fig. S1). With a throughput of 10,000 to 15,000 samples per year, 30 GBP per sample covers the salary of a UK technician processing 350 samples per week. Laboratory set-up costs (ground rental, equipment, and maintenance costs) are not included in this calculation.
