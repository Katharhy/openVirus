<p>The development of veSEQ-HIV was achieved by optimizing veSEQ, our sequencing method for hepatitis C virus (HCV) (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Our aims were to increase sensitivity and throughput, while minimizing cost, processing time, and protocol complexity. Compared to the enzymatic method for adapter ligation used in the original veSEQ protocol, the SMARTer protocol (
 <underline>S</underline>witching 
 <underline>m</underline>echanism 
 <underline>a</underline>t 5â€² end of 
 <underline>R</underline>NA 
 <underline>t</underline>emplate) produced more unique (PCR deduplicated) sequences per sample, required fewer protocol steps and disposable plastics, and required no pre-PCR buffer exchanges (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). By concentrating extracted nucleic acids, (RNAClean XP) SMARTer reagent volumes could be reduced 4-fold without loss in library complexity. Automation was achieved in 96- and 384-well formats using 96-channel pipettes (PlateMaster, Gilson). The steps of the final protocol are listed in Table S1.
