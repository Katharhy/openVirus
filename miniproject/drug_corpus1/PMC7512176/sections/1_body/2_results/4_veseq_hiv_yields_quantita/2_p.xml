<p>In a previous study of hepatitis C, we found that in contrast to amplicon-based sequencing, veSEQ was quantitative, in that total Illumina read-pairs correlated with clinical viral loads (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> shows the correlation between the routine clinically validated viral load and number of viral fragments recovered during sequencing, along with the
