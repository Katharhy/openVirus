<p>Specificity for all known HIV subtypes circulating in Zambia was achieved using a probe-based, rather than a primer-based, amplification step (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). HIV subtypes were inferred by sequence similarity to HIV reference genomes from the Los Alamos HIV database or by using the REGA HIV-1 subtyping tool (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The predominant subtype was C, for which 86% (1,282/1,498) of samples yielded complete genomes. Eighteen nonsubtype C complete genomes included subtypes A (A1 and A2), D, G, and J, as well as the subtype B standards, demonstrating good probe affinity across HIV diversity. Given that partial genotypes are relatively harder to genotype correctly, it was unsurprising that 68% of ungenotyped sequences were incomplete (13/19), and those that were complete had features suggesting recombination.
