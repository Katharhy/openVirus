<p>Large-scale NGS sequencing of HIV genomes using virus-specific PCR (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) has been used to produce whole viral genomes for European samples (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), but the methodâ€™s performance was found to be far from optimal for analysis of sub-Saharan African samples, with amplification failures resulting in biased genome coverage (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). We previously described veSEQ, a probe-based enrichment method, free of virus-specific PCR, which can be used to sequence viruses directly from clinical samples (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Here, we describe veSEQ-HIV, a comprehensive laboratory and computational protocol specifically developed to support clinical management and public health programs in low-income settings.
