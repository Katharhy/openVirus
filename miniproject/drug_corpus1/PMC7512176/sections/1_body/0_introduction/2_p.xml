<p>Both the spread of drug resistance and transmission patterns can be better understood by analyzing viral sequence data (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). To date, clinical drug resistance testing has primarily relied on Sanger consensus sequencing of HIV 
 <italic>pol</italic> genes. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) also produces detailed minority variant information, which can detect low-frequency drug resistant viral variants. However, despite its benefits, adoption of NGS for HIV drug resistance testing has been slow, in part due to technical difficulties in obtaining whole-genome sequences for all genotypes, particularly at low viral loads, and uncertainty over distinguishing low-frequency mutations from the sequencing artifacts and contamination that occur during massive parallel sequencing. Recently, the FDA approved the first NGS assay for HIV drug resistance using 
 <italic>pol</italic>-specific PCR that can sequence up to 15 samples in parallel (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>); however, demand remains for more high-throughput, low-cost options for use clinically and as a surveillance tool in high-prevalence settings. In addition, within an appropriate ethical framework, NGS enhances resolution in transmission analyses, indicating transmission direction and thus revealing population characteristics of transmitters and recipients (
