<p>Finally, both the consensus sequence and the cleaned reads were analyzed with the Stanford drug resistance tool (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) to determine consensus and minority drug resistance levels. Aggregated drug resistance predictions, accounting for mutations linked on the same read pair, were calculated as the maximum level of resistance (susceptible &lt; potential low-level &lt; low-level &lt; intermediate &lt; high-level) observed in at least 20% of merged read pairs spanning each position.
