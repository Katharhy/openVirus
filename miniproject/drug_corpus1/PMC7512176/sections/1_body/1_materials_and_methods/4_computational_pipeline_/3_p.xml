<p>Contaminant reads were identified and removed using 
 <italic>phyloscanner</italic> for in-depth analyses of 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequencing data. 
 <italic>Phyloscanner</italic> contains several procedures not only for detecting contaminant reads in NGS data sets (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), but also for “blacklisting” them (specifically removing them from consideration for further analysis). Blacklisting works by identifying reads in a sample that are either (i) identical to those from a second sample but present in much smaller numbers, or (ii) are phylogenetically distant from the majority of the sample’s reads and are relatively few in number. A total of 373 overlapping genomic windows, each of length 340 bp, were selected, staggering the starting positions by 5 bp. For each 340-bp window, a phylogeny was inferred for all read pairs that fully spanned that window, and ancestral state reconstruction divided the reads for each sample into distinct groups (subgraphs), with the 
 <italic>phyloscanner</italic> Sankoff k parameter set to 12.5. A group of reads was flagged as likely contamination if it contained three or fewer reads, or less than 0.1% of the total number of reads from the sample in that window. The consensus sequence and minority base frequencies were then recalculated from the resulting cleaned mapped reads using 
 <italic>shiver</italic> (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The complete workflow is included within 
 <italic>phyloscanner</italic> (“phyloscanner clean”). “Phyloscanner clean” can be further optimized where the approximate proportion of expected contaminant reads is known, e.g., from laboratory controls.
