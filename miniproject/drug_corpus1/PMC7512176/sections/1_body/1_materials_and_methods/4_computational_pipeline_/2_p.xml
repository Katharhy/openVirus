<p>A panel of quantification standards was used to ensure quantitativity and guard against batch effects. The standards comprised five dilutions of subtype B virus spiked into plasma (AcroMetrix HIV-1 Panel copies/ml, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and either one or two negative plasma controls. These were grouped with each batch of 90 HPTN 071-2 (PopART phylogenetics) samples at the point of RNA extraction. We first introduced these standards in batch 6, and have been using these to monitor the quantitativity of each batch.</p>
