<p>The veSEQ-HIV protocol is tuned for high-throughput applications, and so is ideally suited for laboratories that process a large number of samples. Capital investments are modest, and the protocol is simple for technicians to adopt. However, maintenance and supply issues could be problematic in low- and middle-income countries, where the need is greatest. In such settings, centralized laboratory infrastructure could serve a number of districts. The computational component of the method is currently optimized for our local cluster infrastructure and will be streamlined and made platform-independent. Our current aim is for clinical accreditation of a complete laboratory and bioinformatics pipeline, operated by a single technician, data/lab manager, and clinical microbiologist, with remotely provided technical support, training, and quality assurance.</p>
