<p>Future areas for improvement might include increasing automation, reducing initial capital expenditure costs, and reducing the reliance on regular supply chains of consumables. We did not explore the extent to which the bait capture step could be shortened or simplified; such improvements would further simplify the implementation of our method and would be needed to achieve a high-throughput protocol that could turn around sequence data in a single working day. Extending the length of individual sequences to capture whole viral haplotypes would improve applications in epidemiology and pathogenesis research.</p>
