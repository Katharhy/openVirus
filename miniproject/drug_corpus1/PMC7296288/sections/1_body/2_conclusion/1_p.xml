 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>•], a good many antimicrobial agents are now on the market (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) as well as new anti-tuberculosis and antiviral medications (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) since our last paper was published. Opening up new indications for old antibiotics becomes an increasingly important topic (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>) with a few stories of success over the years—anti-community MRSA armamentarium includes doxycycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, while the new research focuses on testing old antibiotics for

 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). Unfortunately, if the history is any guide, only select few will become available for use for an Emergency Physician any time soon [
