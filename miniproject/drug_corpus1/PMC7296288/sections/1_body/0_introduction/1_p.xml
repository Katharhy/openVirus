<p id="Par4">Antibiotics play a critical role in pharmacological management of Emergency Department patients presenting with apparent infectious disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Antibiotic resistance development is a constant threat whether bacterial, viral, or fungal infections are concerned [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>•, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>••, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. As the new agents emerge and become available for clinical use, some antimicrobials lose effectiveness in some areas, while others become repurposed for a new indication. As multidrug resistant organisms increase in prevalence so is the need for antimicrobial polypharmacy early on in the management of the critically ill infected patients as well as prolonged courses of antibiotics, increasingly done on an outpatient basis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>•, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Whether the Emergency Physician initiates treatment with an antimicrobial or is faced with a patient already taking one, a good understanding of shifting indications and contraindications for their use as well as drug-drug interactions and side effects continues to be important. Thus, staying abreast of new developments in infectious disease pharmaceutical armamentarium is a must for Emergency Medicine providers.
