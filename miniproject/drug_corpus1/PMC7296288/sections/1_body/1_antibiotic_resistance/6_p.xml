<p id="Par10">Infections caused by resistant bacteria cause up to two-fold increase in adverse outcomes, even when the pathogen remains susceptible to the antibiotic but a higher minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) is present [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>•], especially if septic shock develops [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This contributes to the need to use antibiotics in higher doses and for longer courses. There is evidence that even β-lactams in high concentrations can produce a range of organ toxicity especially in the critically ill, including neurologic, hepatic, renal, and hematological side effects whose frequency may be currently underestimated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Cephalosporins, including novel ones, appear to be proconvulsive, especially in patients with epilepsy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Not only are resistant bacteria more difficult to control in case of infection, but surgical antibiotic prophylaxis has also become less effective, as evidenced for example by an increase in bacteremia after invasive urological procedures despite fluoroquinolone prophylaxis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>•]. This is an important point to keep in mind for Emergency Department doctors when these patients present.
