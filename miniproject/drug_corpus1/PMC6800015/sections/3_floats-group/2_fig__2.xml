   <bold>a</bold>, Pertussis case notifications, pertussis deaths and the percentage of children completing the full course of vaccines by their second birthday in England and Wales, 1968–2000. A case series describing children with suspected neurological damage from the whole-cell pertussis vaccine was published in 1974 and received widespread media attention. Subsequently, the National Childhood Encephalopathy Study published in 1981 clarified the risks, which motivated public health efforts to boost vaccine uptake. The whole-cell pertussis vaccine was replaced with an acellular formulation in 1996. 
   <bold>b</bold>, Pertussis case notifications and percentage change in vaccine uptake in successive years during the recovery phase, 1977–1994. Vaccine uptake appears to be entrained by surges in infection incidence. Mathematical models can capture the interplay between natural and human dynamics exemplified in this dataset and a wide variety of other study systems.
