  <title>Data-driven model prediction to evaluate the impact of manipulatable policy variables.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold>, Data from a variety of sources, including surveillance reports, experiments and epidemiological studies, can inform model parameters. 
   <bold>b</bold>, Rather than extracting single point estimates, modellers can use data more powerfully by constructing data-driven distributions for parameters from which values are sampled for each simulation. 
   <bold>c</bold>, Every simulation yields a projection, such that multiple runs based on drawing probabilistically from empirical distributions generate a probabilistic distribution of projections. Types of projection that can be generated include outbreak trajectories, disease burdens and economic impact. 
   <bold>d</bold>, Probabilistic uncertainty analyses convey not only model projections of policy outcomes, but also quantification of confidence in the projections. 
   <bold>e</bold>, As policies are adopted and the microbiological system is influenced accordingly, the model can be iteratively updated to reflect the shifting status quo, thereby progressively optimizing policies within an evolving system.
