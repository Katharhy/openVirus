<p id="Par37">The role for modelling in supporting epidemiologists, public health officials and microbiologists has progressively expanded since the foundational publications forty years ago, in concert with the growing abundance and granularity of data as well as the refinement of quantitative approaches. Models have now been developed for virtually every human infectious disease, as well as in many that affect animals and plants, and have been applied across the globe. Interdisciplinary collaboration among empiricists, policymakers and modellers facilitates the development of scientifically grounded models for specific settings and generates results that will be actionable in the real world. Reciprocally, modelling results may guide the design of experiments and field studies by revealing key gaps in our understanding of microbiological systems. Furthermore, modelling is a feasible and cost-effective approach for identifying impactful policies prior to implementation decisions. Through all these avenues, epidemiological modelling galvanizes evidence-based action to alleviate disease burden and improve global health.</p>
