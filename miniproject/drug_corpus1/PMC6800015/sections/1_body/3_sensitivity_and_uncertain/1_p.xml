<p id="Par28">During the initial phase of an outbreak, the predictive power of models is often constrained by data scarcity. This challenge is exacerbated for outbreaks of novel emerging diseases given that our understanding of the disease will rely on the unfolding epidemic (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Not only can the absence of data constrain model design, but sparse data requires extensive sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of conclusions. Univariate sensitivity analyses, in which individual parameters are varied incrementally above and below a point estimate, can identify which parameters most influence model output (Box

As an outbreak progresses, each day has the potential to provide more information about the new disease, including its duration of latency, the symptomatic period, infectiousness, transmission modalities, underreporting and the case-fatality rate. However, collecting detailed data to inform each of these parameters can strain resources when they are thinly spread during an emergency response. Sensitivity analysis can support clinicians and epidemiologists in prioritizing data collection efforts
