<p id="Par29">Parameterization challenges are compounded for complicated disease systems, such as vector-borne diseases. For example, models of Zika virus infection span both species and scales, as the disease trajectory is influenced by factors ranging from mosquito seasonality and mosquito abundance down to viral and immunological dynamics within human and mosquito hosts

 </sup>. Adding to this complexity, the ecological parameters vary seasonally and geographically—heterogeneities that may be amplified by socioeconomic factors modulating human exposure to infected mosquitoes

 </sup>. In the absence of the high-resolution data that would be ideal to tailor a mosquito-driven disease system to a given setting, uncertainty analysis can unify parameterization from disparate data sources. In contrast to univariate sensitivity analyses, uncertainty analysis simultaneously samples from empirical- or expert-informed distributions for many or all input parameters. Collaboration between modellers and disease experts is thus instrumental to ensuring the biological plausibility of these parameter distributions

 </sup>. The uncertainty analysis produces both a central point estimate and a range for each outcome, a combination which can inform stakeholders about the best-case and worst-case scenarios as well as the likelihood that an intervention will be successful
