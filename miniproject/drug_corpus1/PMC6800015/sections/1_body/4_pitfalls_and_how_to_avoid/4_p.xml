<p id="Par33">Another pitfall concerns the quality of data used to inform the model. Incompleteness of data has been an issue since 1766, when Daniel Bernoulli published a compartmental model of smallpox and acknowledged that more extended analyses would have been possible if the data had been age-stratified

 </sup>. Even today, using data to develop models without knowledge of how the data were collected or the limitations of the data can be risky. Data collected for an alternative purpose can contain gaps or biases that are acceptable for the original research question, yet lead to incorrect conclusions when incorporated for another purpose in a specific model. In ideal circumstances, modellers would be involved in the design of the original study, ensuring both seamless integration of the results into the model and awareness on the part of the modeller with regard to data limitations. Failing that, it is very helpful for modellers to collaborate with scientists familiar with the details of empirical studies on which their results might depend.
