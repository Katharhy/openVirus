<p id="Par34">This lack of familiarity with the biases or incompleteness of data sources may be particularly dangerous in the era of digital data. ‘Big data hubris’ can blind researchers to the limitations of the dataset, such as being a large but unrepresentative sample of the general population, or the alteration of search engine algorithms partway through the data collection process

 </sup>. Some of these limitations can be addressed by using digital data as a complement to traditional data sources. In this way, the weakness of one data source (for example, low sample size of traditional surveys or bias in large digital data) can be compensated by the strengths of another data source (for example, balanced representation in small survey versus large scale of digital data).
