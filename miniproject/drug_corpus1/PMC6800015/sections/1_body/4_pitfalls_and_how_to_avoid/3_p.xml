<p id="Par32">To guide appropriate model complexity and parameterization, modellers have used the mathematical theory of information to develop criteria which quantify the balance between realism and simplicity. Such criteria penalize additional parameters but reward substantial improvements in fit, thereby identifying the simplest model that can adequately fit the data

 </sup>. These methods can be applied to select among models or alternatively to calculate weighted average predictions across models. In a similar vein, modelling consortiums serve to address uncertainty surrounding model design
