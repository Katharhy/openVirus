<p id="Par31">A pervasive pitfall is the incorporation of excessive model complexity, particularly through inclusion of more parameters than can be reliably parameterized from data. Intuition might suggest that a complex representation of a microbiological system would more closely represent reality. However, the predictive power of a model can be degraded if incorporating additional parameters only marginally improves the fit to data. This tendency results in complicated transmission models that overfit data in much the same way that complicated statistical regressions can overfit data, replicating not only the relevant trends but also the noise in a particular data set. These overfit models thus become less useful for prediction and generalization
