<p id="Par35">A final pitfall that often arises in the midst of an ongoing outbreak concerns the interpretation of epidemic projections. Initial models may assume an absence of intervention as a way to assess the potential consequences of inaction. Such projections may contribute to the mobilization of government resources towards control, as was the case during the West African Ebola outbreak

 </sup>. In this respect, the projections are intended to make themselves obsolete

 </sup>. Additionally, people living in outbreak zones often change their behaviour to reduce infection risks, thereby mitigating disease spread through, for example, reducing social interactions or increasing vaccine uptake (Fig.

 </sup>. Thus, risk assessment constitutes a ‘moving target’

 </sup>. For example, input parameters estimated from contact tracing early in an outbreak could require adjustments to reflect these behaviour changes and accurately predict subsequent dynamics
