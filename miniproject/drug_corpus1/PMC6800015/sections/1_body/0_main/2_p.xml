<p id="Par3">The persistent global threat posed by microbial pathogens arises from the nonlinear mechanisms of disease transmission. That is, as the prevalence of a disease is reduced, the density of immune individuals drops, the density of susceptible individuals rises and disease is more likely to rebound. The resultant temporal trajectories are difficult to predict without considering this nonlinear interplay. For instance, many microbial diseases exhibit periodic spikes in the number of cases that are unexplainable by pathogen natural history or environmental phenomena. By explicitly defining the nonlinear processes underlying infectious disease spread, transmission models illuminate these otherwise opaque systems.</p>
