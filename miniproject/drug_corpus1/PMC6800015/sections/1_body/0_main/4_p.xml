 </sup>, we reflect on contributions that transmission modelling has made to infectious disease science and control. Through a series of case studies, we illustrate the overarching principles and challenges related to model design. With expanding computational capacity and new types of data, myriad opportunities have opened for transmission modelling to bolster evidence-based policy (Box

 </sup>. In all pursuits, modelling is most informative when conducted collaboratively with microbiologists, immunologists and epidemiologists. We offer this Perspective as an entry point for non-modelling scientists to understand the power and flexibility of modelling, and as a foundation for the transdisciplinary conversations that bolster the field.
