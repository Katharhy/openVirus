 <label>Box 1 Modelling infectious disease transmission for evidence-based policy</label>
 <p id="Par6">There are the three principal objectives of modelling, all of which can inform public health policy.</p>
 <p id="Par7">
  <bold>Predicting disease spread</bold>. Models can be used to estimate the infectiousness of a pathogen within a given population. A fundamental concept is that of 
  <italic>R</italic>
  <sub>0</sub>, the basic reproduction number, which quantifies the number of infections that would result from a single index case in a susceptible population. 
  <italic>R</italic>
  <sub>0</sub> governs the temporal trajectory of an outbreak and the scale of interventions required for its containment. Models may be used to infer 
  <italic>R</italic>
  <sub>0</sub> as well as forecast changes in 
  <italic>R</italic>
  <sub>0</sub> that could drive transitions in epidemic dynamics, such as the shift from sporadic outbreaks to sustained chains of transmission. Example: assessing real-time Zika risk in Texas

  <bold>Selecting among alternative control strategies</bold>. Simultaneous field trials of multiple infectious disease control options are often infeasible. Models can simulate a wide range of control strategies and thus optimize public health policies according to translational objectives and real-world constraints. Modelling can also extrapolate from the individual clinical outcomes of interventions or novel therapeutics to the population-level impacts. Extrapolating to the population level is essential to evaluate the indirect benefits of interventions, including a reduction in transmission, or unanticipated repercussions, such as evolution of resistance. Example: comparing antibiotic ‘cycling’ versus ‘mixing’ to minimize the evolution of antimicrobial resistance

  <bold>Hypothesis testing</bold>. It is often logistically or ethically infeasible to empirically test scientific hypotheses in the field or experimentally. Modelling can identify parsimonious explanations of observed phenomena, including complex outcomes that can arise from the nonlinear processes common in microbiological systems. Even simple models can be useful to help us understand dynamics that are common to many microbiological systems through identification of basic mechanisms that apply across a range of infections. By examining a new infectious agent through the lens of previously characterized systems, models provide insight into the ways that a particular microbial infection might follow or break from typical patterns. Example: investigating whether individual heterogeneity within social networks significantly impacts disease spread
