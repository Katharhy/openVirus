<p id="Par15">Metapopulation models represent disease transmission at dual scales, considering not just the interactions of individuals, but also the relationships between groups of individuals, which are typically defined geographically (Table

 </sup>. The study suggested that HIV prevention resources could be most effectively targeted to provinces with the greatest initial incidence, as rising incidence in other provinces is driven more by migration from the high-burden provinces than by local transmission. Given that the Chinese provinces with employment opportunities for migrants are also those with the heaviest burden of HIV, migrant workers who acquire HIV often do so in the province where they work. However, government policy requires migrants to return to their home province for treatment. The movement of these workers perpetuates the disease cycle, as new migrants move to fill the vacated jobs and themselves become exposed to elevated HIV risk. These results therefore call for reconsideration of provincial treatment restrictions.
