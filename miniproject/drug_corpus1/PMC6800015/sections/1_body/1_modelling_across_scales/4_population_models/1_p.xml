<p id="Par13">Most commonly, models are created at the population scale, capturing the spread of a pathogen through a large group (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). At this scale, compartmental models shift in focus from the pathogen to the host. Unlike individual-based models, compartmental models will aggregate individuals with a similar epidemiological status. For instance, the archetypical ‘S–I–R’ model separates the entire population of interest into one of three categories: S, susceptible to infection; I, infected and infectious; or R, recovered and protected

 </sup>. In practice, most models will have additional compartments or stratification beyond this simple structure. Age stratification is essential when either the disease risk or the intervention is age-specific. As an example, an age-stratified multi-pathogen model demonstrated that schistosomiasis prevention targeted to Zimbabwean schoolchildren could cost-effectively reduce HIV acquisition later in life

 </sup>. This framework was extended to additional countries with a range of age-specific disease prevalence and co-infection rates to assess the potential value of treating schistosomiasis in adults. Although adult treatment is not usually considered efficient, the model showed that it could be cost-effective in settings with high HIV prevalence
