<p id="Par16">Global policies, such as the treatment goals set by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), have been modelled on a global scale (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) by considering the effectiveness of the policies for each nation. For example, a compartmental model was used to evaluate the potential impact of a partially efficacious HIV vaccine on the epidemiological trajectories in 127 countries that together constitute over 99% of the global burden

 </sup>. The model was tailored to each country by fitting to country-specific incidence trends as well as diagnosis, treatment and viral suppression data. This model revealed that, even with efficacy as low as 50%, a HIV vaccine would avert millions of new infections worldwide, irrespective of whether ambitious treatment goals are met. These results identify the synergies between vaccination and treatment-as-prevention, and provide evidence to support continued investment in vaccine development
