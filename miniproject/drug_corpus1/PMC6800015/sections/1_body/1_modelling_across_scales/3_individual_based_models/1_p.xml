 </sup>. Individual-based models are often used to explore the interplay between disease transmission and individual-level risk factors, such as comorbidities, sexual behaviours and age. Such models are capable of incorporating data with individual-level granularity, including those regarding contact patterns, patient treatment cascades and clinical outcomes. Individual-based models are uniquely suited for representing overlap in individual-level risk factors and translating the implications of this overlap for public health policy. For example, an individual-based model was recently used to demonstrate that the majority of HIV transmission among people who inject drugs in New York City is attributable to undiagnosed infections
