<p id="Par22">In contrast to the unexpected emergence of Ebola in a new setting, the influenza virus has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to cause pandemics. A pandemic is an event in which a pathogen creates epidemics across the entire globe. The 1918 pandemic killed an estimated 50 million people worldwide

 </sup>, exceeding the combined military and civilian casualties of World War 1. While the 2% case-fatality rate of the 1918 strain was approximately 40 times higher than is typical for influenza

 </sup>, pathogenic strains with case-fatality rates exceeding 50% periodically emerge

 </sup>. Modelling has illustrated how repeated zoonotic introductions impose selection for elevated human-to-human transmissibility, which thereby exacerbates the threat of a devastating influenza pandemic
 <sup>

 </sup>. Such threats underscore the importance of surveillance systems and preparedness plans, which can be informed by modelling (Box

 </sup>. For example, a spatial model integrating a variety of surveillance data streams and embedded in a user-friendly platform is currently implemented by the Texas Department of State Health Services to generate real-time influenza forecasts (

Modelling has also motivated the development of dynamic preparedness plans, which adapt in response to the unfolding events of a pandemic, as models identified that adaptive efforts would be more likely to contain an influenza pandemic than static policies chosen a priori

 </sup>. Other pandemic influenza analyses used age-structured compartmental models to study the trade-off between targeting influenza vaccination to groups that transmit many infections but experience relatively low health burdens (for example, schoolchildren) versus groups that transmit fewer infections but experience greater health burdens (for example, the elderly)

 </sup>. Such examples illustrate the insights that modelling has provided to the decision makers charged with maintaining readiness against simultaneously rare but catastrophic situations.
