 </sup>. For instance, signals that vaccine refusal is compromising elimination can be detected months or years in advance of disease resurgence by applying mathematical analysis of tipping points to social media data that have been classified on the basis of sentiment using machine learning algorithms

 </sup>. These and other data science techniques might help public health authorities identify the specific communities that are at increased risk of future outbreaks. On shorter timescales, the near-instantaneous availability of social media data facilitates its integration into models developed for outbreak response

 </sup>. Other behavioural factors that have been incorporated into transmission models include attendance at social gatherings, sexual behaviour and commuting patternsâ€”elements which are also often affected by perceived infection risk
