<p id="Par23">Modelling has also examined the impact of human behaviour, including vaccination decisions and social interactions, on the course of an epidemic. Public health interventions are not always sufficient to ensure disease control, as behavioural factors can thwart progress

 </sup>. For example, reports in 1974 of potential neurological side effects from the whole-cell pertussis vaccine led to a steep decline in vaccine uptake throughout the UK, followed by a slow recovery (Fig.

 </sup>. Compartmental models analysing the interplay between vaccine uptake and disease dynamics confirmed the hypothesis that increases in vaccination were a response to the pertussis infection risk

 </sup>, and showed that incorporating this interplay can improve epidemiological forecasts. Network models extending these coupled disease–behaviour analyses have illustrated how the perceived risk of vaccination can have greater influence on vaccine uptake than disease incidence
