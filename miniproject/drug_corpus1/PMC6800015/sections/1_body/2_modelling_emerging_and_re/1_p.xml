 </sup>. When diseases emerge in new settings, such as Ebola in West Africa and SARS in China, modelling can be rapidly deployed to inform and support response efforts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Unfortunately, the urgency of public health decisions during such outbreaks tends to be accompanied by a sparsity of data with which to parameterize, calibrate and validate models. As detailed below, uncertainty analysis—a method of analysing how uncertainty in input parameters translates to uncertainty in model outcome variables—becomes all the more vital in these situations. Media attention regarding model predictions is often heightened during outbreaks, ironically at a time when modelling results are apt to be less robust than for well-characterized endemic diseases. We discuss the importance of careful communication regarding model recommendations and associated uncertainty to inform the public without fuelling excessive alarm. Despite these challenges, and especially if these challenges can be navigated, the timely assessment of a wide range of intervention scenarios made possible by modelling would be particularly valuable during infectious disease emergencies.
