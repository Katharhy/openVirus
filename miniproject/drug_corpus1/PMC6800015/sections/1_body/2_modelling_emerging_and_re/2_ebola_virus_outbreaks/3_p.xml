<p id="Par21">In 2018, two independent outbreaks of Ebola erupted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. During the initial outbreak in Ã‰quateur province, modellers combined case reports with time series from previous outbreaks to generate projections of final epidemic size that could inform preparedness planning and allocation of resources

 </sup>. Ring vaccination was again deployed, this time within two weeks of detecting the outbreak. A spatial model quantified the impact of vaccine on both the ultimate burden and geographic spread of Ebola, highlighting how even one week of additional delay would have substantially reduced the ability of vaccination to contain this outbreak

 </sup>. The second outbreak was reported in August in the North Kivu province. Armed conflict in this region has interfered with the ability of healthcare workers to conduct the necessary contact tracing, vaccination and treatment. As conditions make routine data collection difficult and even dangerous, modelling has the potential to provide crucial insights into the otherwise unobservable characteristics of this outbreak.
