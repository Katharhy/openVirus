<p id="Par19">The 2014 Ebola virus outbreak struck a populous region near the border of Guinea and Sierra Leone, sparking a crisis in a resource-constrained area that had no prior experience with the virus. As the caseload mounted and disseminated geographically, it became apparent that the West African outbreak would be unprecedented in its devastation. Models were developed to estimate the potential size of the epidemic in the absence of intervention, demonstrating the urgent need for expanded action by the international community

 </sup>. Initial control efforts included a militarily enforced quarantine of a Liberian neighbourhood in which Ebola was spreading. Modelling analysis in collaboration with the Liberian Ministry of Health demonstrated that the quarantine was ineffective and possibly even counterproductive

 </sup>. Connecting the microbiological and population scales, another modelling study integrated within-host viral load data over the course of Ebola infection and between-host transmission parameterized by contact-tracing data. The resulting dynamics highlighted the imperative to hospitalize most cases in isolation facilities within four days of symptom onset
