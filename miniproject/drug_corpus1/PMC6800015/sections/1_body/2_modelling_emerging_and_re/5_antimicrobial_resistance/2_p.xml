 </sup>. High-performance computing now permits the rapid exploration of multidimensional parameter space. Models can thereby narrow an array of possible interventions down to a subset likely to have the highest impact or optimize between trade-offs, such as effectiveness and cost (Box

 <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">1</xref>). Not only can models identify the optimal strategy for a given parameter set, but they can generate the probability that this intervention remains optimal across variation in the parameters. For example, an optimization routine combined with simulation of hospital-based interventions identified combination therapy as most likely to reduce antibiotic resistance

 </sup>. As a complementary approach, modelling can incorporate economic considerations into these evaluations. A stochastic compartmental model showed that infection control specialists dedicated to promoting hand hygiene in hospitals are cost-effective for limiting the spread of antibiotic resistance
