Specifically, a 50% increase of high risk partnership (say, from 6% to 9%) generated about 10% increase in the annual number of newly diagnosed, newly infected and diagnosed prevalence cases. The resultant annual increase of new infections would be at least 5% higher in female compared to males since 2003. The impact of changing the proportional distribution of risk ranking of sexual partnership since 2012 on the epidemic growth (
