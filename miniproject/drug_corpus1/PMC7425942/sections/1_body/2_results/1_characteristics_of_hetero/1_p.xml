<p>Between 1984 and 2012, 2174 (48%) of 4508 patients aged 18 or above at diagnosis in the cohort database had contracted HIV through heterosexual contacts. Of these, 1844 (85%) were diagnosed in or after 1997, when ART became regularly offered to patients under a CD4-guided approach. The male-to-female ratio of these patients was 2:1. CRF01_AE was the commonest HIV subtype, accounting for 66% of patients whose virus had been genotyped. The patients’ characteristics were compared by gender using univariate analyses (odds ratio) and Mann-Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test (
 <italic>U</italic>-test). Females were more likely to be non-Chinese and were younger at diagnosis compared to males (33 year-old vs 40 year-old, p&lt;0.001). (

 </bold>) Overall, males were at a poorer clinical state at diagnosis with a lower median CD4 count (116/μL vs 205/μL, p&lt;0.001) and higher viral load (median log
 <sub>10</sub> 4.9/mL vs log
 <sub>10</sub> 4.6/mL, p&lt;0.01). A higher proportion of male had progressed to AIDS at HIV diagnosis, or that the diagnosis was made within three months of AIDS (defined as late diagnosis in this study).
