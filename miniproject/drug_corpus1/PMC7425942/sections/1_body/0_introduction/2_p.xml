<p>Partner concurrency could be a driver of the generalized heterosexual HIV epidemics in Africa, though such proposition has continued to be hotly debated. [

 <xref rid="pone.0237433.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The predicted impacts of interventions targeting concurrency were however moderate. [
 <xref rid="pone.0237433.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The existence of small networks, impacted by concurrency, has been examined through stochastic modelling to understand the sustained transmission of the virus in the community. [
 <xref rid="pone.0237433.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] To explain the sustained heterosexual transmission, non-locally acquired infections were suggested to be another key parameter. In Europe, migrants accounted for 41% of new HIV diagnoses in 2017. The declining trend of reported heterosexual cases was affected by the falling number of heterosexual migrant cases originating from generalized HIV epidemic countries. [
 <xref rid="pone.0237433.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In Australia, 35% of heterosexual HIV diagnoses in 2002–2011 were attributable to non-local exposure. [
 <xref rid="pone.0237433.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Some HIV epidemic modelling studies have also focussed the influence of migration on local epidemic growth, the impact of which varied by local context. [
