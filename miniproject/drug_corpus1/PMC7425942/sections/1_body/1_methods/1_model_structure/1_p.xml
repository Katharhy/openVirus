<p>A deterministic compartmental model was constructed in R3.5.1, composing of a heterosexual male and a heterosexual female sub-model, with interactions between but not within the two. Bisexual and transgender sub-models were not separately constructed but subsumed under MSM, the epidemiology of whom was not modelled in this study. Each sub-model was structured by compartments of susceptible (sexually active adults aged 15–64 for female and aged 15–84 for male) and infected individuals progressing through the following disease stages–acute infection, chronic infection categorized by CD4 levels of ≤200/μL, 201-350/μL, 351-500/μL, &gt;500/μL, and AIDS–and along the cascade of HIV care (undiagnosed, diagnosed, treatment initiated and lost to follow-up) (
