<p>To describe the clustering pattern of cases, collected HIV-1 sequences (protease and partial reverse transcriptase of pol gene) were aligned by MUSCLE and analysed by neighbour-joining tree in MEGA6 to identify clusters with bootstrap value â‰¥90, 1000 times simulation. A total of 1229 sequences of patients were analysed (976 for heterosexual contacts, 18 for contaminated blood transfusion contacts, 204 for injection drug use, and 31 for undefined transmission mode). Among them, 142 sequences (12%) were genetically connected with 1 other sequence, forming 71 dyads, and another 60 sequences (5%) were connected with 2 other sequences in 20 small triads, 164 sequences (13%) were connected with at least 3 other sequences in 23 clusters (

 <xref rid="pone.0237433.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] most of the sequences were isolates, dyads or triads for HIV-infected heterosexuals. In this model, there were no further delineation of population in heterosexual male and female submodels. Instead, sexual partnership was ranked in our model. A susceptible individual was assumed to be at 1) high risk of HIV transmission if he/she and his/her sex partners were in concurrent partnership; 2) medium risk if one was in serial monogamy while the other in concurrent partnership; 3) low risk if both partners were in serial monogamy. We further assumed that the risk decreased by one level after HIV diagnosis, as a result of ART and/or reduction of behavioural risk. [
