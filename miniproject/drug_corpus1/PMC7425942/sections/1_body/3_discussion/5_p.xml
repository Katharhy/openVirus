<p>As regards parametrization, our study has included non-locally acquired infection as a key parameter. Our approach of not separating overseas infections and those from non-local people in Hong Kong was constrained by data availability. The transmission hazard for high risk sexual partnership was estimated by the formula of random mixing, so as to minimize model uncertainty. This might have underestimated the transmission risk as defined in other studies. [

 <xref rid="pone.0237433.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] We only stratified non-locally acquired individuals by ethnicity, but not for locally acquired individuals, assuming that there was no significant difference of infection risk by ethnicity in local population. This may however not be true, and adjustment is needed in settings with significant difference. Furthermore, model estimation might vary by the different units of hazard estimation. For example, the transmission hazard could be expressed in per-act basis instead of unit of partnership in this study, the results of which are not comparable. The assignment for partnership duration was arbitrary, due to the lack of relevant local data for the definitions. Nonetheless, model estimation on the annual number of new diagnoses and prevalent cases were close to the reported numbers.
