<p>In conclusion, enhancing retention in care, launching periodic HIV testing campaign, and offering immediate treatment for all diagnosed persons would be most beneficial for controlling the heterosexual spread of HIV in Hong Kong. Such approach would also be most feasible for introduction within the existing healthcare system. To monitor the epidemic growth in conjunction with the implementation of new interventions, it would be desirable to include indicators reflecting the cascade of care. On the other hand, in view of the potentially high influence of non-locally acquired infections on the heterosexual epidemic, more related information would need to be collected from newly diagnosed cases. To improve our understanding of sexual partnership (concurrent and serial monogamy) and partner exchange rate among heterosexuals, tailored behavioural study regularly conducted locally would be most useful. Finally, while our models were designed for Hong Kong, we believe that the methods and results are applicable for areas with similar socio-ethnic background, HIV epidemic condition and HIV care and surveillance system, such as some Mainland Chinese cities and Taiwan.</p>
