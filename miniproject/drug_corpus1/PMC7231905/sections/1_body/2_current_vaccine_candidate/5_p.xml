<p>As well as the more traditional techniques being used, such as live-attenuated and recombinant vaccines, RNA vaccines are being used to develop a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. These are faster and cheaper to develop than the more traditional vaccines, as there is no requirement to grow large amounts of the virus in the lab, which overcomes manufacturing hurdles. However, no RNA vaccine has to date been approved for use, and the safety of such vaccines is unknown at present. Moderna administered the first dose of their novel RNA vaccine to a human participant on 16 March and currently has 45 participants enrolled in clinical trials.

 </sup> However, they expect the trials to continue into next year. Although the vaccine may have been quicker to develop, they cannot circumvent the necessary steps to show the vaccine is safe and effective.
