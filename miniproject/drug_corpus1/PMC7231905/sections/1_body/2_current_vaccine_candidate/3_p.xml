<p>Another way of accelerating the development process is to run trials in parallel. Researchers at the University of Oxford have begun testing a vaccine candidate that uses a chimpanzee adenovirus vector in healthy human volunteers.

 </sup> The same vaccine underwent animal trials during the recruitment phase of the human study. This is unusual, as animal studies should normally be completed before human trials can begin. However, the chimpanzee adenovirus vector has been studied extensively and used safely in thousands of subjects in vaccines targeting more than 10 different disease types.

 </sup> This makes it easier to justify the accelerated move to human testing. Regulatory approval can also be accelerated if similar products have previously been approved.
