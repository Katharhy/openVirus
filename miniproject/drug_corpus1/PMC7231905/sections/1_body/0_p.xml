<p>Vaccines can take more than a decade to develop in a safe and effective manner. Candidate vaccines must first demonstrate efficacy in laboratory-based studies prior to toxicity testing in animals. In early-phase clinical trials, the vaccine must be tested for safety (Phase I), and efficacy and adverse events (Phase II) before entering large-scale clinical trials (Phase III). There is a high level of attrition as vaccines pass through the various stages of clinical trials because of either safety concerns or lack of efficacy, or both. It is thus difficult to fast-track vaccine development.</p>
