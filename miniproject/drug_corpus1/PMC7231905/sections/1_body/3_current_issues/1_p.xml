<p>Researchers in Beijing studied the viral genome from 103 infected patients and identified two types of the virus: S and L.

 </sup> At present, scientists do not know how the underlying genetic differences in the two strains relate to disease severity. Genetic analysis from a man in the USA who tested positive in January has shown that it is possible to be infected by both strains. Any vaccine candidate will have to target features present in both strains in order to be effective. The genetic differences between the two strains are small at present and unlikely to affect the production of proteins that act as antigens to promote an immune response. Genetic diversity does not necessarily mean the virus is changing. However, we can expect more strains to emerge. It is generally agreed that once infected, individuals are unlikely to be infected again, unless the virus mutates to overcome host immunity. It is possible that this selection process will lead to an outbreak of a new strain in a similar fashion to seasonal influenza. As is the case with influenza, new variants can emerge that infect individuals, whether or not they have been infected in the past. This will clearly have an impact on the long-term efficacy of vaccines currently in development.
