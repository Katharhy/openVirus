  <p>Model of the role DENV RNA in its pathogenesis using the mice model. DENV RNA is translated into three structural proteins and seven non-structural proteins. In the DENV serotypes 1, 2, and 4, the CD8+ T cell responses have been shown to be specific for the nonstructural proteins including NS3, NS4B, and NS5. In DENV3 serotype, the CD8+ T cell responses are specific both for the structural and nonstructural proteins; and the CD4+ T cells are reactive against structural protein, capsid, and the nonstructural proteins, NS3 and NS5 proteins. DENV: Dengue virus</p>
