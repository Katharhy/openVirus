<p>In response to DENV infection, several cytokines and chemokines are released along with the action of monocytes, macrophages, dendritic, T cells, mastocytes, the IFN regulatory factors, and different IFNs. Usually, the NS3-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells from the patients with severe dengue reveal an elevated level of tumor necrosis factor over the cytokine IFN-Î³ in children with mild dengue [

 <sup>+</sup> T cells, CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, and CD69
 <sup>+</sup> T cells) and humoral immune responses (antibodies) are induced by the primary infection with any of the DENV serotypes. The specific prototype of immune dominance is dependent on the T cell type, the infecting DENV serotype, and on the infected person's previous history of infection [
