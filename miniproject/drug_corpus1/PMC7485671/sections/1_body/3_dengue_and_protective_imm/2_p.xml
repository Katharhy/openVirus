<p>Indeed, the cell-mediated immunity and the humoral responses are expected to impart long-lived protection against the same serotype [

 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. On the contrary, the booster infection with a different serotype may evoke the elevated risk of developing severe dengue. Hence, the primary infection brings out the cross-reactive immunity which is actually protective; nevertheless, it may be oppositely pathogenic depending on the context of the subsequent infection [
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Thus, both humoral and cellular immunity against DENV appear to contribute to the pathogenesis of dengue. In case of antibody (Ab)-dependent enhancement (ADE), the preexisting cross-reactive antibodies escalate the viral burden upon the successive heterotypic infection through the enhancement of FcÎ³ receptor-mediated cellular uptake [

 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Hence, there is a direct role for DENV serotype cross-reactive antibodies in severe dengue outbreak [
 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In case of the secondary DENV infection, there is the role of the cross-reactive T cells accordingly, where the activated T cells during acute infection are cross-reactive with a previously encountered serotype (s) together with a relatively low affinity for the currently infecting serotype, which, in turn, leads to the pathogenesis of the disease [
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. This is to be mentioned that, currently, there is strong support for the protective role of the cross-reactive T cells over their pathogenic role during the DENV infection [

 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, more comprehensive analyses involving the precise phenotype and epitope specificity of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells during the acute and convalescence phases of DENV infection are required for a clear understanding of the role of T cells serving for the protective immunity or for the pathogenic immunity.
