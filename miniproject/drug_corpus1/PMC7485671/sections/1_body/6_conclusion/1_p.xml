<p>In Bangladesh, the survey data on the emerging and reemerging diseases are actually sufficient, but the major problem relies on the technical expertise on disease management, which is the most important aspect to accurately control any disease outbreak. Such expertise principally depends on the complete knowledge on the mechanism of disease progression and also on the genomic and immunologic properties of the corresponding infecting agent. Such knowledge-based attitude, especially of the relevant health professionals including the physicians and the health workers, would go a long way to regulate the disease outbreak. DENV infection has now blasted in Bangladesh mainly due to the lack of public awareness on hygiene and the home-based management of health conditions as well. As discussed in this review, the pathogenesis of dengue augmented by the blended action of the genetic components of the DENV particle accompanied with the host cell T cell-mediated immunity would be of interest to precisely characterize the disease during an outbreak.</p>
