<p>Approximately 3.9 billion people in 128 countries are at risk of dengue infection with around 22,000 deaths each year [

 <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Indeed, there is no defined diagnostic biomarker, particularly in those patients who have caught the secondary infection. However, because DENV infection exhibits a broad range of clinical symptoms, accurate laboratory diagnosis is vital for patient supervision. In Bangladesh, dengue management is principally based mostly on the supportive fluid therapy, together with the serological tests including nonstructural protein 1 (NS1 antigen), IgM and IgG levels, HCT levels, and platelet counts. However, recently, the application of the multiplexed adaptive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction has been reported for the detection of not only DENV but also ZIKV and CHIKV [
