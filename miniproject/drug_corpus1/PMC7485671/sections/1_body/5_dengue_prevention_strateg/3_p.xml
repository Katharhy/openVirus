<p>Bangladesh has already encountered the ZIKV infection and CHIKV infection and most importantly currently is undergoing the DENV secondary disease outbreak [
 <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The average symptoms have been noticed to be nearly overlapping to those of dengue or chikungunya. Such a clinical dilemma imposes great fatality on the mass public health. Therefore, to control the DENV infection, besides the regular monitoring of the antibody titers (i.e., the IgG and IgM levels) and the platelet counts as well as the plasma leakage during the secondary infection, more emphasis should be given on some other aspects such as (a) launching the novel detection methods for the serotype-specific DENV detection; (b) gaining knowledge on the dengue viral genomics, precise serotyping, epidemiological tools, as well as accurate surveillance and protective immunity; (c) examining the sociobehavioral activities; and (d) setting the environmental indicators, as discussed in this literature are important for effective management of dengue situation in Bangladesh.
