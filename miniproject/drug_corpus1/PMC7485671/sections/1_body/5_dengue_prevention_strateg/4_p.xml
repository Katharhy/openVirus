Up to 50â€“100 million infections are taking place annually in over 100 endemic countries, which actually puts almost half of the world's population at risk; and very unfortunately, Bangladesh is one of those countries with an alarming risk of morbidity and mortality due to dengue. Such a situation definitely demands perfect diagnosis and control of the reemerging diseases such as DENV infection.
