<p>For a researcher conducting study on dengue infection, it is important to know that the mosquito vector 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> gets DENV by biting the infected persons, and the first symptoms occur within 5â€“7 days. The mosquito usually remains indoors and in the cool and shaded places outside. The female mosquito lays eggs in water containers which breed within 10 days. Such information must be disseminated among the general people. Thus, the mass community people may be concerned of the problems of stagnant waters inside drums, jars, pots, buckets, flower vases, plant saucers, tanks, discarded bottles, tins, tires, water cooler, etc., and of the places where rainwater is stored [

Therefore, it is strongly suggested to drain out water from the coolers, tanks, barrels, drums buckets, etc., to take out water from refrigerator drip pans regularly; to maintain the stored water containers in covered condition; and to discard the solid wastes/objects where water may be trapped (e.g., bottles, tins, tires, etc.); as well as rainfall flushing [

Wearing full-sleeve clothes and long dresses, massaging repellents, using mosquito coils and electric vapor mats all the day in the house or office, using mosquito nets even at the day time, and treating the curtains with insecticides could be effective remedies [
