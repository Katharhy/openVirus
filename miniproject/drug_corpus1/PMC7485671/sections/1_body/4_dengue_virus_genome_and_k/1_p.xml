<p>It is already known that the DENV genome encodes (i) three structural proteins including capsid, the precursor membrane, and the envelope and (ii) seven nonstructural proteins including NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5 [
 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The immune genetic study on the mice model revealed that the CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses are specific for the nonstructural proteins including NS3, NS4B, and NS5 (in DENV serotype 1, 2, and 4) and both structural and nonstructural proteins in case of DENV3 serotype, whereas CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells choose epitopes in the capsid and the NS3 and NS5 proteins [
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The serotype-specific T cells dominate the primary infection, whereas in case of the secondary infection, the memory T cells (recognizing the conserved epitopes) may increase together with naïve serotype [Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>]. Interestingly, the involvement of the microRNAs has also been reported [
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Deducing the immunodominant T cell epitopes in each flaviviral proteome, parameters influencing the immunodominance, and understanding the extent to which each epitope induces the T cell cross-reactivity to the different serotypes are important parameters for designing the appropriate vaccine [
 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, the only licensed DENV vaccine, Dengvaxia
 <sup>®</sup> (Manufacturer: Sanofi Pasteur), is known to elicit suboptimal antibody responses against all the serotypes; however, unfortunately, the vaccine-induced antibody responses are very much likely to diminish within 3–4 years after vaccination [

 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The application of the vaccine within Asian-Pacific and Latin American regions revealed that the children within 2–5 years of age who had never been exposed to DENV got an elevated risk for developing severe dengue upon vaccination [
