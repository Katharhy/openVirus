<p>Infection with DENV results in an assorted range of symptoms including mild fever to life-threatening hemorrhagic fever, neuroinflammation, and even shock. The main targets include the specific serotype detection, the cross-reactivity of antibody responses (immunoglobulin M or IgM), and detecting the viral nonstructural protein 1 (NS1 antigen through ELISA), the so-called principal infection marker [

Dengue diagnosis by antidengue antibodies has not been that much useful because the IgM antibodies are quite likely to appear in the late stage of infection, and the high titer of IgG (typically a four-fold increase) is only a sort of demonstrative substantiation [

That is the reason why most of the clinicians principally depend on the clinical diagnosis based on the serial changes in the hematological parameters (complete blood count, CBC; hematocrit, HCT levels, etc.), which is actually not that specific. Thus, the reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) has become suggestive of dengue diagnosis [
