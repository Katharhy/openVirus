<p>Four antigenically distinct but immunologically cross-reactive serotypes of DENV particles (DENV-1–DENV-4) are widely known so far. Infection with any of the serotypes of DENV may be long term; unfortunately, a second attack is not unlikely to the running primary infection, which results in DHF or dengue shock syndrome (DSS). DENV-3 has so far been reported to be the most pathogenic serotype; DENV-1 and DENV-2 have been noticed to be nearly similar in their pathogenic traits, whereas DENV-4 is probably the least pathogenic serotype [

Experiments considering the preseason total binding antibody levels, measured by the nonserotype-specific indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA), revealed that the “undetectable” and the “low-to-medium” levels of iELISA titers were associated with increased risk of secondary DENV infection. Moreover, followed by the primary infection, the risk of the secondary infection during the 2
 <sup>nd</sup> year may be similar to that of during the 1
 <sup>st</sup> year; in the next year and afterward, the infection risk may gradually decline [
