<p>The primary dengue symptoms are usually noticed as headache, retro-orbital pain, arthralgia, myalgia, and appearance of rashes, whereas the secondary infection symptoms include hemorrhagic manifestations, leukopenia (decrease in white blood cells &lt;5000 cell/mm
 <sup>3</sup> and platelet count &lt;150,000 cell/mm
 <sup>3</sup>), and an increasing HCT levels by 5%–10%. The secondary attack can be apparently understood by the continuous high fever for 2–7 days accompanied with severe and continuous pain in the abdomen; bleeding from the nose, mouth, and gums; skin bruising; frequent vomiting (sometimes with blood); liver enlargement, coal tar-like black stools, excessive thirst (dry mouth); pale and cold skin; and through restlessness or excessive sleepiness. DHF and DSS may be considered as the plasma leakage as well as the disruption in homeostasis followed by death. In the course of plasma leakage, the protein-rich fluid component of the blood seeps out of the blood vessels into the surrounding tissues, and hence, this is regarded as the trickiest situation resulting in the severe dengue. Unfortunately, the detection of plasma leakage in the secondary dengue often appears to be difficult [
