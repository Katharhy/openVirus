<p>The DENV particle consists of a positive-sense single-stranded RNA molecule of approximately 11 Kb of genomic size. Although a plenty of researches showed how the RNA signals function during the flavivirus infections, their molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis are still obscure [

 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Indeed, the 3’ UTR of the DENV genome is being thought to be responsible for the DENV evolution. A study of the organization of the DENV 3′ UTR is important because it is similar to that in the other flaviviruses (CHIKV, ZIKV, YFV, and WNV). The DENV 3′ UTR has been shown to consist of necessary elements for the replication of viral particles; it harbors the accessory RNAs (noncoding regulatory RNAs), which may play important roles in modulating the viral processes and in the control of the host antiviral responses [

 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Indeed, such noncoding subgenomic flaviviral RNA (sfRNA), especially from the DENV2 serotype, may disrupt the antiviral response in the salivary gland of the Aedes mosquito vector, which, in turn, triggers the disease outbreak [

 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. RNA structures within the proximal segment of the DENV 3′ UTR have been found to be resistant against the host nuclease activity, thereby producing an elevated level of sfRNA during infection; hence, the 3’UTRs appear to be the most important determinants of DENV fitness in human–mosquito cycles [
