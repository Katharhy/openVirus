<p>Indeed, DENV RNA elements (existing within the 5’ and 3’ UTRs and within the viral coding sequence) have long been known to play an active role in accelerating or silencing the replication of DENV [
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Earlier, the cis-acting RNA motif, a small hairpin structure within the 3’-UTR region, has been shown to be stringently required for the DENV replication in the vector [
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This is interesting to ponder that the viral RNA coexists both in linear and in the circular conformations (imparting flexibility to the viral genome), and such a dynamic trait of RNAs are essential for DENV replication [

 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Among all serotypes, so far, DENV1 B has been known to possess the highest replication efficiency possibly due to the capacity of its nonstructural proteins to suppress the host interferon (IFN) signaling as well as due to the relatively high enzymatic activity of the NS2B3 protease [
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thus, the DENV genome, the single-stranded RNA molecule, contains huge information that acts as signals to induce, repress, or promote the viral replication, which, in turn, may pose the dengue epidemics.
