<p>Besides the knowledge on the clinical signs and symptoms as well as on the environmental factors such as global warming effect on the viral disease outbreaks, it is also important to study the viral genomics in order to completely realize the evolutionary pattern of the viruses. The detection of the possible functions and variations in the RNA sequence in DENV may be important to understand how the viral RNA structures can influence the epidemiological potential of the virus, including the pathogenesis, host adaptation, and the viral transmission between the vectors and humans. Therefore, the molecular mechanism of the DENV epidemics should be brought into focus of the current research by the physicians and the molecular biologists round the globe. The current review focused on the present condition of dengue infection in Bangladesh, the general idea on the pathogenesis mechanism of the DENV particle as well its symptoms, the protective immunity against the disease, and to some extent discussed about the genetic system of DENV augmenting its pathogenesis. The surprising role of T cell-mediated immunity in disease progression is also discussed in brief.</p>
