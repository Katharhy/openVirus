<p>Along with the research priorities, the pathogenesis and epidemiology of any emerging disease needs to be fully understood in order to find the way to control and eradicate that specific disease. It is already well known that the genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> consists of a large number of emerging and reemerging human pathogens, including dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Zika virus (ZIKV), yellow fever (YFV), and West Nile (WNV) viruses and Japanese encephalitis viruses transmitted by the mosquito vectors, 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>. Among them, DENV is the most prevalent viral particle round the globe. Many researches on dengue infection have already been accomplished; now, it is quite clear that the dengue infection (i.e., the endemic and the sporadic local transmission of DENV) is largely influenced by the environmental factors including the geographical location, global warming and climate changes, irregular precipitation, and unplanned urbanization, triggering the distribution of the major mosquito vector 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The Eastern Mediterranean, American, South-East Asian, Western Pacific, and African regions were subjected to the endemic transmission of the virus, whereas the sporadic local transmission was known within Europe and the United States where 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic>, a secondary vector, may also prevail together with the primary vector 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].
