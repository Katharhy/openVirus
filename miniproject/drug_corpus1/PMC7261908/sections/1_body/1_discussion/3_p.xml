<p>Moreover, by learning from the design strategies of inactivators against enveloped viruses, we can now design and develop viral inactivators targeting key proteins involved in the entry process of non-enveloped viruses. The entry process of a non-enveloped virion is initiated by binding of the viral capsid protein to the cell receptor, followed by entry of the virion into endosomes in the host cell through clathrin- or caveolae-mediated endocytosis or macropinocytosis. The low pH environment causes conformational change of the virus capsid, leading to the externalization of membrane-penetrating peptides (MPPs) in endosomal compartments. Finally, MPPs are integrated or associated with endosomal membranes, leading to distortion and disruption of the membrane and allowing the release of nucleocapsid or genome into the cytosol (

Considering that most complicated fusion steps occur in the cell endosome, the receptor-binding domains in the viral capsid protein seem to be the best targets for design of PPVIs against non-enveloped viruses. However, the structure and function of the receptor-binding domains in their capsid proteins have not been well studied (
