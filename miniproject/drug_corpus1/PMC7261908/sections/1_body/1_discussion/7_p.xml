<p>In particular, the disadvantages of PPVIs mentioned above may not be the problems for the urgent treatment of the highly pathogenic emerging and re-emerging virus infections, e.g., Ebola virus or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Drugs are especially key in the first aid, when several days later, protective antibodies are produced in the body to combat viruses, but lives may be taken away at any time (

In fact, characteristics of medication against these viral infections are short-term use (1â€“3 weeks), rapid application and high safety for the infirm patients, therefore the cost may not be a problem to consider. Besides, the need of rapid application parallels to the injection requirement of PPVIs, which takes effect faster than oral administration. Also, protein-based drugs are intrinsically safe (

In sum, PPVIs may be a good choice when facing the pandemic of the highly pathogenic newly emerging and re-emerging viruses.
