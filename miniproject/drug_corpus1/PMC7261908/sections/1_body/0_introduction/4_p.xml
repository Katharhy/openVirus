<p>Different from fusion inhibitors and receptor antagonist blockers that must act in the presence of target cells, virus inactivators can actively attack and inactivate cell-free virions in the blood, through interaction with one or more sites in Envs on virions. The mechanisms of virus inactivators vary: they can bind and block the RBS on viral Envs (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2014</xref>), or induce the conformational change of Env, causing virions to lose the ability to enter the host cell (
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2012</xref>). Some other inactivators may bind to the Env stem or the viral lipid membrane, to disrupt the integrity of the viral envelope or lead to the release of viral genetic materials (
 <xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2017</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Because they can actively attack and then inactivate cell-free virions anywhere they meet in the blood, they should have higher utilization rate than the current antiviral drugs. They are expected to be much safer for 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> human application than the chemical-based virus inactivators (e.g., detergents), most of which can non-specifically lyse lipid membranes of viruses and cells (
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">Polsky et al., 1988</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">Phillips et al., 2000</xref>). PPVIs also have potential for further development as novel antiviral drugs for the urgent treatment of infection by the highly pathogenic emerging and re-emerging viruses.
