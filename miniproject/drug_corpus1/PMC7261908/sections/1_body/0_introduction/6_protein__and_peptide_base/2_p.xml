<p>Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein is originally expressed as the gp160 glycoprotein precursor, approximately 850 amino acids in length (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), which is cleaved by viral protease to form a highly glycosylated trimer of heterodimers, non-covalently associated by three gp120 and three gp41 subunits (
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2008</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). The surface subunit gp120 is approximately 500 amino acids in length, composed of several variable regions V1–V5 and the remaining more conserved regions (
 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">Starcich et al., 1986</xref>). A conserved binding site to the cellular receptor CD4 (CD4bs) is found on the surface of the gp120 subunit, which contains the conserved hydrophobic Phe-43 pocket (residues 362–372). The transmembrane subunit gp41, approximately 350 amino acids in length, is comprised of the fusion peptide (FP), N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR), C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR), membrane-proximal external region (MPER), transmembrane region (TM), and cytoplasmic region (CP). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, HIV-1 entry is originated by gp120 binding to the CD4 molecule on the target cell, resulting in its conformational change to expose the coreceptor-binding site (CoRbs) on gp120, further allowing gp120 binding to the coreceptor CCR5 or CXCR4 (

 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">Melikyan, 2008</xref>). Then, NHRs and CHRs of the three gp41 subunits interact with each other to form a six-helix bundle (6-HB) core structure, bringing the viral envelope and cell membrane into close proximity to achieve fusion (

Therefore, the HIV-1 Env composed of gp120 and gp41 subunits is a key component responsible for mediating entry of the virion into the target cell, and also an important target for development of the protein- and peptide-based HIV-1 inactivators (
