 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Allaway et al. (1995)</xref> constructed a fusion protein CD4-IgG2 comprised of human IgG2 in which the Fv portions of both heavy and light chains were replaced by D1D2 domains of CD4. They found that CD4-IgG2 bound gp120 with high affinity and was much more potent than sCD4 to inhibit HIV-1 fusion and infection. Unlike sCD4, CD4-IgG2 could not enhance HIV-1 infection in CD4- CCR5+ cells. Like the broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), IgG1b12, 2G12, and 2F5, CD4-IgG2 could effectively neutralize a panel of laboratory-adapted strains and primary isolates of HIV-1 with different subtypes with IC50s from 5 to 80 nM (
