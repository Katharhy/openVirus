<p>Most recently, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Chaiken and Rashad (2015)</xref> designed and engineered a recombinant chimera, denoted DAVEI (dual-acting virucidal entry inhibitor), composed of the lectin cyanovirin-N (CVN) and the HIV-1 gp41 MPER sequence, which could effectively inactivate the HIV-1 pseudovirus Bal.01 with an EC50 value of 28.3 nM. They found that DAVEI exhibited potent and irreversible inactivation of HIV-1 virions by dual engagement of gp120 and gp41, while CVN or MPER alone had no HIV-1 inactivation activity (
