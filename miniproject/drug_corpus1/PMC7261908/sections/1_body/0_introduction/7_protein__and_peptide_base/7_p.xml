<p>In sum, two conserved sites on HA protein, including the receptor-binding pocket and the conserved stem, have been the promising targets of influenza virus inactivators. Although HA protein itself does not belong to the range of inactivators we discuss here for not acting on cell-free virions, it can function through other two ways. It can be the possible receptor antagonist, which binds to the cell receptor to inhibit viral infection. Also, it has been the key immunogen of currently licensed influenza vaccines (

 <xref rid="B157" ref-type="bibr">Yamada et al., 2019</xref>), which could elicit strain-specific anti-HA antibodies to neutralize the virus and prevent or control infection. Moreover, since most agents mentioned above have not been testified to possess inactivation activities against influenza virus with a standard assay, there still remains a long way to put them into practice.
