<p>In addition to the conserved stem of HA, the receptor-binding pocket mentioned above is also a promising target of IAV inactivators (

 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">Matsubara et al. (2010)</xref> identified several 15-mer sialic acid-mimic peptides that could bind the RBSs in H1 and H3 HAs and inhibit infection by the A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) and A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) strains of IAV with IC50 at low μM level. Later, they identified a series of 7-mer sialic acid-mimic peptides (
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Matsubara et al., 2016</xref>) by screening another phage-displayed random peptide library. They found that these peptides could also bind H1 and H3 HAs and that the binding could be inhibited in the presence of sialic acid. Plaque assays indicated that one of these peptides, C18-LVRPLAL, could strongly inhibit infection by the A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) strain with an IC50 value of 6.4 μM. However, none of the above peptides have been tested for their virus inactivation activities using a virus inactivation assay.
