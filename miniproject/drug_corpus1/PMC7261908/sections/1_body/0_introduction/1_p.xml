<p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza virus and many other viruses are enveloped viruses (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Harrison, 2008</xref>). In most cases, viral envelope derives from the host cell membrane, while in some cases, it derives from the organelle membrane. For example, the envelope of both DENV and ZIKV derives from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">Kuhn et al., 2002</xref>). One or more envelope glycoproteins (Envs) are expressed on the surface of the viral envelope and can play important roles in viral entry into the target cell, including attaching the virus to surface receptor of the host cell and mediating virus-cell membrane fusion, allowing the viral genome to enter the host cell for replication (
