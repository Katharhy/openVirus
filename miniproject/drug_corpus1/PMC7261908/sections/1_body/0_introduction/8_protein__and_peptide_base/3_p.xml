<p>The particle structure and genomic organization are similar among all flaviviruses, with 180 E proteins and 180 M proteins forming 90 heterodimers, covering most surface area of a virion (
 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">Slon Campos et al., 2018</xref>). Taking DENV as an example, the ectodomain of each E protein monomer consists of three domains I, II, and III. Domain II contains a highly hydrophobic fusion loop capable of mediating fusion, and domain III contains RBSs. The C-terminus of domain III is the stem, a membrane anchoring region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), which is highly conserved in flaviviruses and forms a helix-loop-helix structure located below the E protein ectodomain and partially embedded in the viral envelope (

 <xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). The M protein, consisting of 75 amino acids, includes a 40-amino acid ectodomain and a 35-amino acid transmembrane region. The ectodomain includes a hydrophobic loop structure, followed by an amphipathic helix, which may interact with the E protein on the virion surface (
 <xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Analysis of the interaction between E and M proteins on the DENV surface revealed that M protein, functioning as a pH-sensitive chaperone, plays a vital role during the process of viral infection and maturation (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, DENV infection is initiated by binding of domain III of E protein to the receptors on the target cell (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Huerta et al., 2008</xref>), followed by entry of the virion into the endosome in the host cell via endocytosis. Under the acidic environment in the endosome, the E protein dimer dissociates, resulting in the individual subunits swinging outward. The exposed fusion loops insert into the endosomal membrane, promoting reassembly of the subunits to form the extended, trimeric intermediate. Subsequently, domain III in each subunit is reversely folded, bringing the viral envelope and the endosomal membrane into close proximity for fusion (
