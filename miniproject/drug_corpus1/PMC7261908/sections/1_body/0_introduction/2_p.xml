<p>The outbreak of infectious diseases caused by highly pathogenic enveloped viruses, such as HIV, has posed threat to public health worldwide. Thus, it is essential to develop safe and effective antiviral drugs to combat these infectious diseases (
 <xref rid="B148" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Since the first antiviral drug for treatment of HIV infection, zidovudine, was approved for clinical use in 1987, the United States FDA has approved &gt;80 antiviral drugs so far. They are mainly applied to treat and prevent infection of HIV, herpes simplex virus (HSV), influenza virus, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) (

Consequently, they have the weakness of relatively low utilization rate because most part of a drug remaining outside the infected cells does not participate in inhibition of viral infection.
