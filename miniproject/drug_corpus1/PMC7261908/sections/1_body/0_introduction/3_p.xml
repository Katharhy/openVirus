<p>In contrast to “passive defenders,” some antiviral agents used in clinics or under development serve as “gate keepers” to combat viruses outside cells. As mentioned above, viral entry can be divided into two steps: viral attachment to cell receptor(s) and then viral fusion with the target cell. Therefore, “gate keepers” can be classified into three groups: attachment inhibitors that inhibiting the attachment of virions to the target cell by blocking binding of viral Env (e.g., gp120) to cellular the receptor (e.g., soluble CD4) (

 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">Lalezari et al., 2003</xref>). In general, attachment inhibitors possess some virus inactivation abilities in mechanism, more or less, due to their ability to block the receptor-binding site (RBS) on viral Envs (
