<p>As mentioned above, the fusion process is mediated by a set of interactions between gD, gH/gL, and gB, and between these glycoproteins and their receptors (

 <xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">Weed and Nicola, 2017</xref>), thus multiple glycoprotein or RBSs are potential to be targets of HSV inactivators. Taking the potent gH/gL-specific neutralizing antibody as the example, it could inhibit the formation of the gB-gH/gL complex, suggesting that the gB binding site in gH/gL may locate in the vicinity of the neutralizing epitope (

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Bohm et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, the neutralizing epitope in gH/gL may serve as one of the targets. Similarly, glycoprotein-binding sites or RBSs on gD (

 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Cairns et al., 2019</xref>) also prompt the design of HSV inactivators, just like the CD4bs in HIV gp120. Therefore, more comprehensive studies on the crystal structures of these glycoproteins and the mechanism of the fusion process are essential for the design of protein- and peptide-based HSV inactivators.
