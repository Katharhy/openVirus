<p>Herpes simplex virus may enter cells through endocytosis or direct fusion of the viral envelope with cellular membrane, relying on the target cell type (
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">Nicola, 2016</xref>); notably, both routes require the same set of viral glycoproteins (
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">Nicola and Straus, 2004</xref>). HSV entry through direct fusion is a coordinated process that involves a cascade of events, which can be briefly divided into (1) binding to specific cell receptors, (2) intracellular signaling, and (3) fusion of the viral envelope with host cell membrane (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Connolly et al., 2011</xref>). At the beginning of entry process, binding of glycoprotein D to one of its cognate receptors is significant. Four gD receptors of HSV-1 and HSV-2 have been confirmed: a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family, herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM); the poliovirus receptor family, including nectin-1 and nectin-2, belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily; and a modified form of heparan sulfate, 3-

 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Krummenacher et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Gallagher et al., 2013</xref>). Recent studies demonstrated gB may also bind to specific cell receptors, such as paired immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptor (PILR)α (
 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">Satoh et al., 2008</xref>), myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) (
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">Suenaga et al., 2010</xref>), non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIA (NMHC-IIA) (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Arii et al., 2010</xref>) or non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIB (NMHC-IIB) (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Arii et al., 2015</xref>). Meanwhile, gH/gL may be facilitated by the activated form of gD to convert into a conformation able to interact with gB (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Atanasiu et al., 2007</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2010a</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), triggering the prefusion form of gB transforming into a fusogenic state. Next, Akt (protein kinase B) may be triggered to translocate to the outer leaflet microdomains of the plasma membrane to interact with gB (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Cheshenko et al., 2013</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), which further induces Akt phosphorylation and intracellular calcium release. Subsequently gB inserts the fusion loop into the target cell membrane (
 <xref rid="B161" ref-type="bibr">Zeev-Ben-Mordehai et al., 2016</xref>) to form the extended, trimeric intermediate, which results in fusion of the two membranes and release of the capsid into the cell (
