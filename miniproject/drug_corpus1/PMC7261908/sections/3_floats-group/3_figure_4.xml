  <p>The structure of DENV E protein in the native and fusion-intermediate states, which serve as sources and targets of the protein- and peptide-based DENV inactivators. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Schematic representation of E protein composition, including domains Iâ€“III (colored red, yellow and blue, respectively), stem and transmembrane region (TM). 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Attachment of DENV E protein to the cellular receptor(s) and fusion of viral envelope with the endosome membrane. Binding of E protein domain III with the receptor on the target cell is followed by entry of the virion into endosomes of the host cell via endocytosis. Under the acidic environment in the endosome, E protein dimer dissociates, resulting in the individual subunits swinging outward. The exposed fusion loops insert into the endosomal membrane, which facilitates the reassembling of the subunits to form the extended, trimeric intermediate. Subsequently, domain III in each subunit is reversely folded to promote the viral envelope and the endosomal membrane into close proximity for fusion. The pre-fusion dimer is highlighted in a red box, which is shown in more detail in 
   <bold>(C)</bold>. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Side view of the pre-fusion, dimeric conformation of E protein present on the virion surface (modified from PDB ID: 1OAN). Names and sequences of inactivators are listed in the three boxes, and the arrows depict their target sites, including the lateral loop of domain III and the viral lipid membrane. Notably, potential inactivators remaining to be tested are listed in the box with a dashed arrow.
