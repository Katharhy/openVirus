<p>The prevalence of COVID-19 in the community is uncertain as it appears a number of persons may not show symptoms. It would appear that the mortality may be as low as 0.6% (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>). It is clear that older persons are at a much higher risk of mortality (about 15%) than younger persons (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>). Persons with comorbidity are at an increased risk. It is suggested that the FRAIL screen is used to detect persons at increased risk (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>). Persons with hypertension and diabetes mellitus are at increased risk possibly due to alterations in the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) receptor produced by ACE 1 inhibitors.
