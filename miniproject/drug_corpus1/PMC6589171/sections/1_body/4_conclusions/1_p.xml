<p id="Par33">In conclusion, we observed that the proportion of single, young MSMs significantly increased in newly reported HIV-positive cases in Shenzhen City, which will provide additional information for HIV prevention and behavior intervention. The identification of many HIV subtypes circulating in Shenzhen City will provide more information that may be utilized for HIV vaccine design. Furthermore, the close phylogenetic relationship of HIV strains between Shenzhen and many other areas in China suggests that the Shenzhen HIV epidemic might be useful for the prediction of HIV prevalence in the entire country. This study also highlights the importance of more comparable cross-sectional studies, which will be cost-effective for surveillance of the HIV epidemic in China.</p>
