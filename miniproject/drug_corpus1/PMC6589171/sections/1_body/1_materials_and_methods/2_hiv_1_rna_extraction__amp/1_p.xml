<p id="Par15">Viral RNA was extracted from 500 μL HIV-1 positive plasma specimens after being concentrated using a High Pure Viral RNA kit (Roche, USA). Viral full-length 
 <italic>gag</italic> (nucleotides 790–2292 using HXB2 as calibrator) and partial 
 <italic>pol</italic> genes encompassing the entire protease and partial reverse transcriptase regions (nucleotides 2085–5096 using HXB2 as calibrator) were amplified separately using reverse transcriptional nested PCR as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Briefly, the first round of PCR was fulfilled using a TaKaRa one-step RT-PCR kit, and the second round PCR using High Fidelity Taq (Invitrogen, USA) with primers and thermal cycling conditions as described elsewhere [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Positive PCR products were subjected to Sanger sequencing after purification with a variety of internal specific primers (available on request).
