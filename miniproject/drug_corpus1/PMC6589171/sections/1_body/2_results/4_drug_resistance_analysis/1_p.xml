 <italic>pol</italic> genes obtained in the study were submitted online to screen for transmitted drug resistance mutations as described in Materials and Methods. Drug resistance mutations were identified in two samples from 2013 (0.4) and seven samples from 2015 (2.8%), which were both below the WHO HIVDR Threshold Surveillance threshold of 5%, indicating that the local ART programs were functioning well. A total of nine mutations (three NRTI-resistant mutations, two NNRTI-resistant mutations, and four PI-resistant mutations) were identified and are listed in TableÂ
