<p id="Par20">A total of 345 full-length 
 <italic>gag</italic> genes (69.0%) and 410 partial 
 <italic>pol</italic> genes (82.0%) were successfully obtained from 500 samples. No evidence of sample contamination was found. Quality control of sequences showed that all of the gene structures were normal and with the correct open reading frames (ORFs). The subtypes of the HIV variants from 440 participants were finally determined. 160 strains were CRF07_BC (36.4%), 150 strains were CRF01_AE (34.1%), 45 strains were CRF55_01B (10.2%), 28 strains were subtype B (6.4%), 15 strains were CRF08_BC (3.4%), 4 strains were CRF59_01B (0.9%), 3 strains were subtype C (0.7%), 1 strain was subtype D (0.2%), 1 strain was CRF68_01B (0.2%), 1 strain was CRF67_01B (0.2%), and 32 strains were unique recombinant forms (URFs, 7.3%) (Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2. The subtypes were further assessed using phylogenetic trees that were constructed using the sequences and the reference sequences representing subtypes A-D, F-H, J, K, and CRFs epidemic in China (including CRF01_AE, CRF07_BC, CRF08_BC, CRF31_BC, CRF55_01B, CRF57_BC, CRF59_01B, CRF61_BC, CRF62_BC, CRF64_BC, CRF65_cpx, CRF67_01B, and CRF68_01B), with subtype O as outgroup (

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). By comparing the proportions of each subtype in 2013 and 2015, we found that the predominant strains shifted from CRF01_AE (36.10% vs. 31.96%) to CRF07_BC (34.84% vs. 37.90%). However, no statistical significance was observed (Fig.
