<p id="Par21">A total of 32 URFs were identified in Shenzhen City among newly reported HIV-positive individuals. The compositions of the genomes of each URF were further determined. Four patterns of genomes of URFs were distinguished, including B/C/CRF01_AE, C/CRF01_AE, B/CRF01_AE, and B/C recombinant forms. Considering that CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC are the predominant strains prevalent in Shenzhen City, it is unsurprising to find that the genomes of the highest proportion of URFs comprised B, C, and CRF01_AE (Fig.
