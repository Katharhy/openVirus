<p id="Par19">Two hundred and fifty newly reported HIV-positive participants were enrolled in 2013 and 2015 separately. All of the subjects were not registered permanent residents of Shenzhen City. The geographic distribution of these HIV-positive ‘floating’ migrants are depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The socio-demographic characteristics of 500 participants are summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The median age of the participants was 35.1 years old in 2013 and 33.4 years old in 2015 separately (range: 19–57 years old in 2013 and 18–75 years old in 2015). Distinct shifts found in age distribution, transmission routes, and marital status were observed in the study cohort (

 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0017). Further detailed analysis showed that the proportion of single, young MSMs dramatically increased from 14.0% in 2013 to 26.4% in 2015. (
