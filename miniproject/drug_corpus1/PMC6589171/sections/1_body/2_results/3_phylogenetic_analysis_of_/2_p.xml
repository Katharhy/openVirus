<p id="Par23">To explore the phylogenetic relationship of HIV strains with strains prevalent in other areas of China, we further aligned our sequences of CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC subtypes with references from the whole country. In the ML trees, the strains from Shenzhen were distributed in the phylogenetic trees equally, and no significant local cluster within the Shenzhen area could be identified (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The results revealed a close relationship between the HIV prevalence in Shenzhen and other areas. Therefore, the floating population in Shenzhen City might serve as a bridge for HIV epidemics that have spread to different areas in China.
