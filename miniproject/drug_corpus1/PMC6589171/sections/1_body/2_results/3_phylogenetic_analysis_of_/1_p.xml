<p id="Par22">To estimate the diversity of the sequences in this study within their respective subtypes, we calculated the genetic distances of different subtype sequences using the Kimura 2-parameter model based on the 
 <italic>gag</italic> and 
 <italic>pol</italic> genes (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The largest mean genetic distance was found in subtype B (8.6% ± 0.4%) within the 
 <italic>gag</italic> gene. Relatively smaller mean genetic distances were found in CRF55_01B (3.9% ± 0.2%) and CRF07_BC (0.4% ± 0.2%).
