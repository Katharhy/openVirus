<p id="Par24">Significant differences in topology structures of phylogenetic trees constructed with CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC sequences were observed. In the CRF07_BC tree, no large clusters containing more than 10 sequences were observed. However, in the CRF01_AE tree, at least four clusters were distinguished, with high bootstrap values. (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Cluster I (55.26%) is the most popular group, followed by clusters III (21.05%), IV (14.91%), and II (8.77%). Comparing the percentages of each cluster in 2013 and 2015 indicated that the percentage of cluster I increased from 50.91 to 59.32%, whereas cluster III decreased from 29.09 to 13.56%. Although no statistical significance was observed, the change in the ratio predict a change in CRF01_AE epidemic tendency in Shenzhen City. Further analysis of demographic information showed that the compositions of transmission routes of each cluster were significantly different (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Cluster I was mainly composed of sequences from MSMs (73.02%). Cluster II contained only strains obtained from heterosexual transmitted individuals (100%). Cluster III was mainly composed of strains from heterosexual transmission (83.33%) and IDUs (12.50%). Cluster IV was mainly composed of strains from heterosexual transmissions (58.82%) and MSMs (35.29%). Since the single, young MSMs became a high risk population for HIV infection in Shenzhen City, we further checked whether there were transmissions primarily confined to the population. The location of the sequences obtained from them was labeled in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). No epidemic cluster that mainly comprised sequences from single young MSMs could be identified, indicating that there were no HIV strains that were confined to the specific population.
