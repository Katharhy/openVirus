<p id="Par25">To understand the HIV transmission dynamics of young, single MSMs and other populations in Shenzhen City, we further evaluated the phylogenetic clustering and determined demographic, behavioral, and geographic characteristics of persons in transmission clusters that included young, single MSMs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Clusters with bootstrap values higher than 95% and mean genetic distances less than 0.015 were selected as transmission clusters or pairs. A total of 20 transmission clusters or pairs were identified, which contained 44 sequences. Among all of the sequences, five sequences were from young, single MSMs. No transmission cluster or pair only containing young, single MSMs was identified. All of the young single MSMs were involved in clusters containing old MSMs or heterosexually transmitted individuals (Fig.
