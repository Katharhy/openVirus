<p id="Par28">Public awareness, early initiation, and adherence to highly active antiretroviral treatment in index cases, and effective prevention strategies are all known to be important in the control of HIV epidemics. However, the vulnerable groups need to be specified as targets for intervention. It will be more cost-effective to use the limited HIV/AIDS resources available for target groups of people who are at the highest risk of infection. In this study, by comparing the characterizations of newly reported HIV-positive cases in Shenzhen City between 2013 and 2015, we have found that the population with the highest risk of HIV infection had changed. The proportion of single, young MSMs had significantly increased, underscoring the need to evaluate and intensify prevention efforts for this population.</p>
