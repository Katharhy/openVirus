<p id="Par30">Multiple subtypes of HIV were found in Shenzhen City. We identified 11 HIV subtypes or CRFs in Shenzhen City. The emergence of many subtypes of HIV in the same city might be due to its high level of floating population. The floating population brings back and forth the HIV strains prevalent in different areas of China. To some extent, the HIV epidemic in Shenzhen even can profile HIV epidemics in the whole country. In this study, we found that the ratio of CRF07_BC strains increased in 2015 compared to 2013. The tendency is in accordance with a previous study that focused on MSMs in Shenzhen City [

Multiple subtypes of HIV circulating in the same population always predict the emergence of recombinant. A high level of URFs (11.2%) was observed in Shenzhen City. In 2015, CRF55_01B was reported to be formed in Shenzhen City and rapidly spread in MSMs outside Shenzhen City [
