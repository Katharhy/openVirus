<p id="Par27">We compared the characterizations of newly reported HIV-positive cases in Shenzhen City between 2013 and 2015. A shift in HIV-positive populations was observed. Single, young MSMs were responsible for the observed higher number of HIV infections in 2015 compared to those in 2013. No HIV epidemic confined to single, young MSMs was identified. Close phylogenetic relationships among HIV strains between Shenzhen and other areas in China were observed both in 2013 and 2015. The results are important and helpful in terms of developing accurate preventive strategies for HIV control in Shenzhen City. It also highlights the importance of HIV surveillance, considering the rapid shifts in HIV-positive populations.</p>
