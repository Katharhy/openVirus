<p id="Par32">This study has some limitations. The two cross-sectional studies are based on newly reported HIV positive cases collected in 2013 and 2015. The time period is only 2 years, which is relatively short for monitoring changes in large HIV-positive populations. However, some shifted characterizations of HIV-positive populations have been selected. If the time is long enough, then more changing characteristics on HIV epidemiological trends could be distinguished and may explain why no statistical significance was observed on HIV subtype distribution and even transmitted drug resistant mutations. In addition, although all of the participants were newly reported HIV positive cases, it is difficult to estimate the exact infection time. Hence, it was considered that the mean interval time for an individual to be detected after being infected was the same between 2013 and 2015.</p>
