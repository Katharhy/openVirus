<p id="Par29">Explore the origin of HIV epidemics in the target population is important for understanding the transmission dynamics, which in turn may provide clues for behavior intervention. Therefore, we further tested the relationship between HIV strains in epidemics in single, young MSMs and other populations. No epidemic or transmission clusters could be identified in single, young MSMs, indicating that there were no close connections among them. More interconnections might happen between single, young MSMs and old MSMs or heterosexually transmitted populations. Behavioral intervention confined only to single, young MSMs may be insufficient in controlling further transmissions. This undoubtedly will make it more difficult for HIV prevention in Shenzhen City. More comprehensive studies are necessary to distinguish individuals connected to the population.</p>
