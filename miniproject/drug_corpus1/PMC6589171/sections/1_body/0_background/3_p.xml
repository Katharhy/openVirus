 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Distinguishing high-risk populations and understanding the spreading dynamic of HIV strains among different populations would be meaningful for prevention. Cohort studies are a good method for serial surveillance; however, large populations are not feasible for cohort studies due to their related high cost and uncontrollable loss ratio at follow-up. Serial cross-sectional studies are helpful for the prediction of epidemiological trends. Furthermore, changes in HIV high-risk populations can be distinguished, which will be important for HIV prevention and behavior intervention. This study aimed to identify changes in the molecular epidemiology of HIV in Shenzhen City to facilitate the development of preventive strategies.
