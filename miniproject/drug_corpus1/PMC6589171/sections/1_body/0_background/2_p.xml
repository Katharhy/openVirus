<p id="Par12">Shenzhen, which is located in Guangdong Province in southern China, is a rapidly growing area with a population of approximately 13.8 million. More than 80% of the populations of Shenzhen are ‘non-local residents’ who have household registrations in other regions. Hence, Shenzhen is a city with large-scale migrations of ‘floating’ individuals, which has become a major challenge in the prevention and control of HIV epidemics in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The migration of the floating populations always makes the intervention strategies for these groups ineffective [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In recent years, the overall HIV prevalence among these migrants throughout China has been rapidly increasing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Another big problem caused by ‘floating’ populations is that they are often associated with local epidemics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and changes in the distribution of circulating HIV-1 subtypes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Therefore, it is necessary to characterize HIV epidemics in Shenzhen City.
