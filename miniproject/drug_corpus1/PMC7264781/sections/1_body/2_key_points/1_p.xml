     <p>To avoid the risk of transfusion‐related acute lung injury (TRALI), preference should be given to use of plasma from male donors or from female donors who have never been pregnant including abortions. This measure lowers the possibility of presence in the plasma of the antibodies to HLA or granulocyte antigens that cause TRALI. Testing for these antibodies in female donors who have been pregnant is desirable as an added precaution where feasible. TRALI occurs within 6 h after transfusion of implicated plasma and can be severe [
