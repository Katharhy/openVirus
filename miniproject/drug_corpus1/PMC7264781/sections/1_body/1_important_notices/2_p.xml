<p>Intentional collection of convalescent plasma should be performed only by apheresis in order to avoid unnecessary red cell loss in the donor and to optimize the volume of plasma that can be generated for investigational use. In instances of routine whole blood donation by a previously infected person who meets current suitability criteria, COVID‚Äê19 convalescent plasma can be prepared by component separation and considered for investigational use if not critically needed for general patient care. Transfusion of whole blood to provide convalescent plasma should be avoided unless use of whole blood is clinically indicated.</p>
