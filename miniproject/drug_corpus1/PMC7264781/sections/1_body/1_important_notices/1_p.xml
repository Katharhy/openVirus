   <p>Because the safety and efficacy of convalescent COVID‐19 plasma as a treatment for COVID‐19 are unproven at this time, clinical use of this product should be managed as an experimental therapy consistent with ethical and legal safeguards (informed consent of donors and patients, institutional approval, special labelling as an investigational product, compliance with applicable regulatory requirements).</p>

   <p>Ideally, COVID‐19 plasma should be used in the context of an organized research study designed to determine its safety and efficacy in comparison with standard of care or other therapeutic interventions. Even if used empirically, it is vital to ensure monitoring of patient outcomes including clinical and laboratory indicators of safety and efficacy to maximize the knowledge that might be gained.</p>

   <p>Collection and retention of blood specimens from both donors and recipients (pre‐ and post‐treatment) should be performed to permit retrospective determination of the characteristics of an effective product and dosage regimen, and the characteristics of patients most likely to benefit.</p>
