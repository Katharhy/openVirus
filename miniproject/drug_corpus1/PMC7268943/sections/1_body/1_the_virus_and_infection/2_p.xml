 </sup> The patterns of the clinical course of infection are divided into: (a) mild upper respiratory tract illness; (b) non-life-threatening pneumonia; (c) and severe pneumonia, with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which begins with slight symptoms (for 7–8 days) that rapidly progress to ARDS, requiring support ventilation. The average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 6.4 days, ranging from 0 to 24 days.

 </sup> The elderly and those with comorbidities (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension and cancers) are at risk of more severe infection and present higher case fatality rates (10.5, 7.3, 6.5, 6.0 and 5.6%, respectively) than those without comorbidities (0.9%).

 </sup> SARS-CoV-2 may also cause damage to other organs such as heart, liver and kidneys, as well as to organ systems such as the blood and the immune system.

Particular attention should be devoted to smokers, in whom there is evidence of high susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.
