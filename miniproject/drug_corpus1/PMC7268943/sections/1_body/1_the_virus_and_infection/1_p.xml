 </sup> The spread of SARS-CoV-2 illustrates two important modes of disease transmission in the modern era. The first modus is local transmission, at each local epicentre, while the second is transmission via international travellers which favours the global spread of the infection, fuelling the pandemic of COVID-19. Large outbreaks were reported in closed communities and hospitals, raising the possibility of ‘superspreading’ events, a situation observed in previous coronavirus outbreaks.

 </sup> The transmission of the virus occurs person-to-person, primarily through respiratory droplets, but also by contact and fomites, nosocomial transmission

 </sup> and possible aerosol and faecal–oral transmission.

 </sup> Person-to-person transmission is being evidenced by family clusters of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus.

 </sup> Research also indicates that SARS-CoV-2 can have pre-symptomatic transmission during the prodromal period

 </sup> and that viral shedding appears to occur in individuals with minor clinical manifestations.

 </sup> Data concerning transmission during the disease course is scarce; a small study, among 25 asymptomatic COVID-19 cases, considered a communicable period up to three weeks.

  <xref rid="bibr13-2050640620920157" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
 </sup> All these particularities contribute to the extensive community transmission that is being registered. As SARS-CoV-2 can remain viable and infectious in aerosols (for hours) and on surfaces (up to days), aerosol fomite transmission is plausible and is a key aspect to consider while developing pandemic mitigation plans.
