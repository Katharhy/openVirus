<p>From the public-health perspective, the priority is now the development of antiviral therapeutics to stop the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and of an effective vaccine to prevent future epidemics. Efforts are ramping up to the development of new therapeutics. Remdesivir, an investigational antiviral drug developed to treat Ebola and Marburg haemorrhagic fevers, showed activity against SARS-CoV-2,

 </sup> This drug has been used in a few patients, on a compassionate-use basis, outside of a clinical trial setting. It is a nucleotide analogue and, like other drugs of that class, it disrupts nucleic acid production. Chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine (used for Lupus and rheumatoid arthritis) also showed activity against the virus.

 <italic>In-vitro</italic> studies evidenced that hydroxychloroquine was more potent than chloroquine in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2.

 </sup> Hydroxychloroquine treatment was significantly associated with viral-load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients and its effect was reinforced by azithromycin, in a small sample size population.

 </sup> Lopinavir and ritonavir are also being studied in this context, but, in hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19, no benefit was observed beyond standard care.

 </sup> Another potential treatment option is coronavirus sera prepared from the blood of patients in convalescence (convalescent sera). Passive immunization is well established in viral infection prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B virus and varicella-zoster virus. Although, the appropriate titre of convalescent sera antibody required for therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 remains to be determined. From past experience, the success of this strategy is not guaranteed. For instance, research with MERS-CoV showed that sera from patients recovering from the disease did not contain sufficient antibody titres for therapeutic use.
