<p>Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated, in Saudi Arabia, from a man who died from acute pneumonia and renal failure. The infection was responsible for 2494 cases and 858 deaths in 27 countries (case-fatality rate of 34.4%).

 </sup> The third coronavirus epidemic was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019, where a cluster of patients, with pneumonia of unknown cause, was identified. Zhu and collaborators isolated a novel coronavirus from the bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid of three of these patients.

 </sup> The researchers used next-generation sequencing and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to characterize the virus which falls within the subgenus

 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>. This new strain, called SARS-CoV-2, has cytopathic effects (structural changes in host cells)

 </sup> and, like SARS-CoV, probably originated from wild animals. The homology between coronavirus isolated from bats, snakes and pangolins, and SARS-CoV-2 isolated from infected humans makes these animals potential carriers.
