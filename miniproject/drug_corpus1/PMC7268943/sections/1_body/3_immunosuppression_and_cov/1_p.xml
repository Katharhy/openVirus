<p>Data collected from more than 200,000 IBD patients from IBD referral centres in China do not evidence a particular susceptibility of patients on immunosuppressants or biologics to SARS-CoV-2 infection,

 </sup> and as a consequence, none of the three largest tertiary IBD centres in Wuhan published any report on this topic.

 </sup> Nevertheless, in February the Chinese IBD Society made practical recommendations concerning this group of patients and listed the potential risk factors for SARS-CoV-2: immunosuppressive therapy, diabetes, hypertension, older age, malnutrition and pregnancy. Until now, research could not identify reasons to stop current treatment in stable patients, including those on anti-TNF, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, immunomodulators (azathioprine, methotrexate), JAK-inhibitors and salicylates. For patients with active/severe COVID-19 infection, the risk must be individualized. However, all biologics have long half-lives and will be in circulation during the infection period, with a slow and reduced impact on the IBD clinical situation. On the other hand, the interruption of treatments with corticosteroids, methotrexate or JAK-inhibitors can induce a fast decrease of their serum levels, with possible reflex in the clinical situation. Particular attention should be paid to corticosteroids, especially in doses above 20 mg. Even though current evidence does not suggest the switch from infliximab to adalimumab (to avoid hospital visits), this hypothesis should be considered in high pandemic areas where the local infusion centre cannot afford appropriate treatments anymore. However, these situations must be carefully followed since elective switching from infliximab to adalimumab is associated with a loss of tolerance and efficacy within 1 year.
