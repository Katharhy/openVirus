<p>Many gaps still remain in the overall knowledge on this ongoing pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 virus, although very similar to MERS-CoV virus, has much higher transmission rates, has inter-family transmission and can cause a severe and long disease. We cannot rely on previous knowledge and experience on influenza, although they are both respiratory viruses. The absence of an effective treatment, along with the lack of vaccines, are obstacles we need to go through. A reduction in mortality must definitely be a major objective.</p>
