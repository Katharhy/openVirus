<p id="Par30">Despite these limitations, to our knowledge this is the first study to show such rapid viral suppression in PWID by introducing an expanded and integrated model of care delivery based at an SSP. The SSP played a central role in testing and surveillance due to the trusted relationship with the PWID population. Unfortunately, previously diagnosed cases among persons living with HIV did not have equivalent clinical outcomes, suggesting the importance of early engagement at an SSP, linkage, and navigation in this population. Implementation of universal HIV/HCV testing at the SSP provided a high yield venue to aid in the rapid identification of HIV seroconversions among PWID. The SSP thus played a formative role in response to a number of recent HIV seroconversions in Miami. Other jurisdictions experiencing HIV seroconversions could benefit from partnerships between their local SSPs, health departments and medical systems in order to bring timely and appropriate linkage to medical care and disease intervention. In Miami, the early diagnosis, linkage to care, and viral suppression potentially averted new HIV transmissions in this network as well as within the surrounding community given the complex network dynamics involved.</p>
