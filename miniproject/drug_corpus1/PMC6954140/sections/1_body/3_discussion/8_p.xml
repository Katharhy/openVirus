<p id="Par29">One limitation was the inability to obtain genotypes for two of the seven individuals with HIV seroconversion and five of the eight epi-linked partners, which might have led to missed potential linkages within the SSP network and had to be supplemented with HIV-1 resistance patterns. However, the scarcity of molecular linkages between the individuals with seroconversion and persons with diagnosed HIV and a reported genotype using the SSP, despite epidemiologic connections, suggests that these seroconversions among PWID are likely transmissions occurring outside the SSP network. Secondly, due to the small number of HIV cases, the outcomes of our patient navigation model need to be validated among a larger cohort over a longer timeframe. However, the goal of this investigation was to limit the number of new HIV transmissions and mitigate ongoing HIV transmission by rapidly applying and adapting interventions during the investigation. Lastly, the epi-linkages are all based on self-report and could be subject to social desirability bias. Embedding the DIS within the SSP likely facilitated patient ease and mitigated bias during the partner services interviews.</p>
