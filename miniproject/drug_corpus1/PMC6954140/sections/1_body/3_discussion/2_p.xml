<p id="Par23">Our investigation yielded a complex HIV transmission network that included multiple modes of HIV exposure (sexual and syringe/works sharing) and transmission, both within and outside the SSP network, that could not be defined through either traditional epidemiological practices or molecular analyses alone as each source was incomplete in defining relationships within the network. This is in contrast to the Scott County, Indiana investigation where nearly 99% of the cases were highly-related by phylogenetic analysis but similar to a national level molecular evaluation where only 34% of high-risk partners were determined to be potential transmission partners [

The proportion of individuals in the identified network reporting both sexual and IDU HIV exposure risk is one explanation for the lack of molecularly-linked cases through the SSP. The attributable fraction each of these exposure methods represents is unknown in this network but previous studies suggest that sexual risk in this cohort could have an increased impact on transmission and acquisition of HIV [
