<p id="Par25">In Miami, response efforts were coordinated in collaboration between the SSP and the Department which led to the organized response being delivered through the SSP. Early diagnosis and immediate ART initiation was prioritized to rapidly decrease viral transmission, reduce the impact of a potential outbreak, and improve quality of life [

The high linkage to care and viral suppression rates among the seven individuals with seroconversion were much greater compared to previous outbreaks of HIV among PWID. For example, during an HIV outbreak among PWID in Greece, linkage to care and initiation of ART through a “Test and ‘Treat”-like program was only 48.4% and 24.5%, respectively [

However, PWID with previously diagnosed HIV may require a more intensive intervention to achieve similar outcomes as PWID with recent HIV seroconversions.
