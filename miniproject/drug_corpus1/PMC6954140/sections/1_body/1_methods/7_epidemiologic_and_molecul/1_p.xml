<p id="Par15">Connections between individuals with HIV seroconversion and epidemiologic linkages as well as other SSP participants with a previous HIV diagnosis were visualized using the Harel-Koren Fast Multiscale algorithm in NodeXL Basic (Social Media Research Foundation) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Molecular linkages, using the first reported nucleotide sequences after diagnosis within the reverse transcriptase and protease section of the Pol region of the HIV genome, were assessed at the 1.5% and 0.5% genetic distance thresholds using DOH local access to the Secure HIV Transmission Cluster Engine (TRACE) as previously outlined by Oster et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Case nucleotide sequences were compared to 38,395 molecular sequences from Florida HIV diagnoses uploaded to Secure HIV TRACE. Importantly, although molecular HIV surveillance can identify HIV transmission networks experiencing recent and rapid HIV transmission, directionality (who transmitted the virus to whom) cannot be determined using molecular data.
