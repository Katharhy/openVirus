<p id="Par12">Individuals were screened for HIV infection using a point-of-care rapid HIV test (OraQuick ADVANCE
 <sup>®</sup> Rapid HIV-1/2 Antibody Test, OraSure Technologies). Individuals with reactive rapid tests received confidential antibody screening (HIV-1/2 enzyme immunoassay) and confirmatory HIV tests (HIV-1/2 type-differentiating immunoassay). Other clinical labs including HIV-1 RNA/DNA NAAT (quantitative viral load), HIV-1 Genotype (protease/reverse transcriptase nucleotide sequence), and CD4 T-lymphocyte count were conducted. For persons who were virally suppressed (&lt; 200 copies/mL), an HIV-1 resistance, proviral DNA (protease, reverse transcriptase, integrase inhibitors) test was performed.
