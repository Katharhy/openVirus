<p id="Par11">Anonymous HIV testing results at the IDEA SSP were recorded under an anonymous participant number, but reactive tests were not reportable to the state. Individuals with a suspected seroconversion identified by the SSP were verified following confidential testing to meet the CSTE case definition as a new HIV diagnosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Individuals with a confirmed seroconversion were assigned to a DIS embedded at the SSP for contact tracing and partner elicitation. Blood specimens for individuals with confirmed seroconversion were obtained, tested, and analyzed for molecular linkage. Epidemiologically-linked partners whose HIV status was negative or unknown were offered screening tests. For persons with a previous diagnosis of HIV, blood samples for those missing molecular sequences were collected. In the affected area, the SSP conducted daily outreach, increased syringe distribution, and collaborated with DOH to provide routine control measures such as rapid access to ART and screening of persons for HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and hepatitis B and C.
