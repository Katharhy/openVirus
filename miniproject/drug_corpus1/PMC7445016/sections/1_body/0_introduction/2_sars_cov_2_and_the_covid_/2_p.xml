<p id="Par4">This disease can remain asymptomatic during around 14 days incubation period of SARS-CoV-2. The SARS and MERS CoVs evade immune responses during longer incubation periods. The spectrum of COVID-19 disease is broad—most commonly reported symptoms of are fever, myalgia or fatigue, dry cough, and dyspnea. Around 80% of infections are mild, resolving within a week without any specific treatment or hospitalization. Amongst hospitalized cases, pneumonia, sepsis, respiratory failure, and ARDS are frequently encountered complications, and in severe cases, progressive respiratory failure can be fatal [
