<p id="Par27">Since its emergence, SARS-CoV-2 has drawn well-deserved attention. It led to a pandemic that has shocked and devastated the human world, shattering its economy—massive economic recession is predicted. It is likely that these coronaviruses will continue to emerge and evolve, causing both human and veterinary outbreaks due to their ability to recombine, mutate, and infect multiple species and cell types, including humans. The future of human CoV outbreaks will depend not only on how the viruses will evolve but also on the development of efficient prevention, treatment strategies, and our preparedness to deal with them. Priority funding for research on mechanistic basis of transmission of coronaviruses from one species to other, their reservoirs, zoonotic diseases, possible role of environmental changes, and pollution in leading to such epidemics is needed to face the imminent challenge of such repeated outbreaks. Very rapid and efficient human-to-human transmission is confirmed which is of immense concern necessitating speedy development of therapeutic modalities. Neutralizing antibodies and vaccines could play significant roles in controlling COVID-19. Studies on human–coronavirus interactome developing suitable therapeutic agents and vaccines are needed. Research at accelerated pace is needed to translate into therapies and vaccines.
