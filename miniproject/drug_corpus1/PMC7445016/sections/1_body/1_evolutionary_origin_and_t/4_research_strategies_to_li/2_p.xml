<p id="Par10">In 2016, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) warned that zoonotic diseases are related to the health of ecosystems. 
 <italic>Zoonoses</italic> are opportunistic and increase with changes in animal or human hosts, environment, or pathogen itself. Pathogens have passed between animals and humans in the last century due to reduction in ecosystems by human intervention and population growth. Humans have encroached into animal habitats and disturbed natural buffer zones between animals and humans leading to emergence of zoonosis. Livestock serves as a bridge between wildlife and human infections and forms a part of 
 <italic>wildlife–livestock–human interface</italic>. Consumer demand for livestock has increased due to economic growth leading to rigorous livestock farming near and around cities, thereby, expanding chances of zoonotic diseases. In addition, natural source of disease resistance is genetic diversity but “intensive livestock rearing” often produces genetic similarities within herds and flocks, making them susceptible to pathogen spillover from wild animals. Consumption of wild animals in wet markets can also facilitate animal to human transmission. Frequent climate change tells upon the survival of microbes in the environment, suggesting the more frequency of pandemics due to rapid change in climate [
