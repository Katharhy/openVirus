<p id="Par13">A crucial need to counteract the COVID-19 pandemic has arisen; no specific drug or vaccine is available as yet. For effective therapeutics and vaccine development elucidation of genetic features and molecular constituents of CoVs including SARS-CoV-2, unravelling the mechanisms of infection, molecular basis of virus–host interaction, its regulation, and host responses is needed. Global efforts are being undertaken—biotechnological, molecular, and bioinformatic advances have been helpful in making available details related to the genomics and proteomics of these CoVs, especially SARS-CoV-2 in a very short time [
