<p id="Par15">RNA of CoVs codes for four major structural proteins involved in its replication as well, termed as spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Some beta coronaviruses also code for protein hemagglutinin esterase (HE). The S, M, and E proteins lie in the viral envelope. The S protein is heavily glycosylated forming homotrimeric spikes on the surface of the viral particle required for binding and entry into host cells. Amongst the four, M protein is the most abundant and important protein giving the virion primarily its shape; besides, it interacts with other structural proteins to perform various functions. Interaction of S proteins with M proteins is needed for its incorporation into new virions [

In the same way, M protein along with the smallest one E protein which is found in small quantities is involved in virus assembly, forming of mature viral envelopes, and release of viral particles from host cells. E protein is mostly expressed in the infected cell; it is important for production and maturation of the virus, and its interaction with PSD95/DLG/ZO-1(PDZ) proteins involved in host cell processes is important for viral infection. The N protein is located in the core of the viral particle forming the nucleocapsid of viral RNA and is involved in replication [
