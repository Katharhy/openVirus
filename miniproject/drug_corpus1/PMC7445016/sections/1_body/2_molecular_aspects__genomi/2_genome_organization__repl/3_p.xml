<p id="Par16">Generally, the transcription and replication of CoVs take place in the host cell cytoplasm following viral entry. Spike proteins of the virus bind with the host receptor, structural changes occur followed by endocytosis, which is pH dependent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], and the virus releases its RNA inside the host cell cytoplasm. Translation of the 5′ end of viral RNA produces the RdRP, which uses viral RNA as a template to generate series of virus-specific mRNAs or sub-genomic mRNAs from sub-genomic negative strand intermediates. Translation of sub-genomic mRNAs leads to production of structural and nonstructural viral proteins; they share the same 3′ ends and the same leader sequence of 70–90 nucleotides at their 5′ ends [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Once sufficient, structural proteins and genomic viral RNA are synthesized; viral assembly and budding occur in smooth-walled vesicles in the endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) [
