<p id="Par21">The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to hACE2 which is highly expressed in the lungs and heart. Studies suggest that there is an elevation in angiotensin II in COVID-19 patients which advocates that binding of COVID-19 to ACE2 leads to enhanced conversion of angiotensin II from angiotensin I through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) thereby increasing cardio-myocyte hypertrophy and high blood pressure leading to myocardial injury, myocarditis, and cardiac arrhythmias [

In case of diabetics, there is an altered production of cytokine, impaired T cellâ€“mediated immune response, inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis, ineffective microbial clearance, and phagocytic cell dysfunction which together with the entry of coronavirus into host pneumocytes mediated by ACE2 receptor adds to the severity of COVID-19 in patients with diabetes mellitus. So, ACE2 may play a key role in the severity of COVID-19 infection in diabetic patients [
