<p id="Par20">Varied CoVs bind to diverse receptors on host cells. MERS-CoV binds to dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4, also known as CD26) receptor. Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), a zinc-dependent carboxypeptidase, responsible for regulating blood pressure, also acts as a receptor of entry for SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, and SARS-CoV-2 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. As per a recent study, S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has higher affinity to ACE2 receptor as compared with S protein of SARS-CoV which might be attributed to the N501T mutation in spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.
