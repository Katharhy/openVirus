<p id="Par25">There is an upregulation of ACE2 in diabetes and hypertension as they are being treated by ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARBs). ACE2 is also increased by drugs such as thiazolidinediones and ibuprofen. Consequently, the increased expression of ACE2 would facilitate infection with COVID-19 and increase the risk of developing severe fatal COVID-19 viral infection. A further aspect that should be investigated is the genetic predisposition for an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which might be due to ACE2 polymorphisms that have been linked to diabetes mellitus, cerebral stroke, and hypertension, specifically in Asian populations. Summarizing this information, the sensitivity of an individual might result from a combination of both therapy and ACE2 polymorphism [
