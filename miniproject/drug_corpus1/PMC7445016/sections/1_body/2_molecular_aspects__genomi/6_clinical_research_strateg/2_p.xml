<p id="Par24">A crucial need for a clinical research and therapeutic strategy to counteract this epidemiological outbreak remains. We have no empirical enveloped cure or vaccine for this potentially fatal disease; coordinated international efforts for developing therapeutics and vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are needed. Although several clinical trials are currently underway to test possible therapies, current response to the COVID-19 outbreak has been largely limited to monitoring/containment. Various biotechnological, molecular tools, and advances in bioinformatics have been instrumental in making available details related to the genomics and proteomics of this virus. Some light has been shed on genetic features, molecular constituents, and mechanisms of infection. Armed with this information research is progressing at a rapid pace to develop therapeutic strategies, neutralizing antibodies and vaccines to address this disease COVID-19 which has spread as a pandemic of mammoth proportions. A wide variety of therapeutic options are being evaluated in an earnest attempt to find a cure. A drug, from time of its inception to qualifying all three phases of clinical trials, can take years to reach market; nevertheless, coordinated international efforts and adequate funding can make drugs against COVID-19 available within a record time. Bioinformatics and in silico drug modelling, a boon for speedy drug development, are being exploited. Recent in silico master regulator analysis has shed light on SARS-CoV-2/human interactome detailing the host receptor recognition. Features of the human interactome most affected by the infection including apoptotic and mitochondrial mechanisms and downregulation of the ACE2 protein receptor have been propounded [
