<p id="Par22">X-ray crystallography has determined the crystal structures of CoV–human interactomes to fully understand the initial step of infection at molecular level. For the first time, crystalline structure for HCoV-NL63 S1-CTD complexed with human ACE2 was discovered followed by SARS-CoV S1-CTD complexed with ACE2, displaying common receptors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>] which was followed by MERS-CoV S1-CTD complexed with human DPP4 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. Overall binding mode of ACE2 with SARS-CoV-2–RBD is nearly identical to that of the SARS-CoV–RBD as per the recent elucidation of their crystal structure. There are amino acid residues in RBD of SARS-Co-V, majority of which are highly conserved, or share alike side chain properties with RBD of SARS-CoV. Crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2–RBD complexed with ACE2 is available at protein data bank (PDB) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>].
