<p>CoVID-19 may present with a range of symptoms in humans, varying from mild cold-like symptoms to severe life-threatening respiratory tract infections. The infection begins with the gradual onset of symptoms following an incubation period of 2â€“14 days after exposure [

 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. On the basis of disease severity, clinical manifestations can be categorized as mild (81%), severe (14%), and critical (5%), as noted in the CoVID-19 positive patients [

 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. With the number of cases increasing worldwide, other symptoms have also been reported, which are ever evolving and differ depending on the population studies. However, the question whether these symptoms are directly correlated with CoVID-19 manifestation, remains elusive and requires further scientific and clinical evidence.
