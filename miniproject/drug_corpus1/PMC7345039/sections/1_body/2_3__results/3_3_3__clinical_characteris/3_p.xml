<p>Following an antecedent of 5â€“9 days of primary viral manifestations, these initially mild symptoms manifest as a progressively advanced disease accompanied by pneumonia and ARDS, which is the most ominous feature of this infection [

 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Other secondary manifestations, which could be present, are RNAemia as a continuum of ARDS, chronic dyspnea, tachypnea, hypoxia, diarrhea, abdominal pain, metabolic acidosis, and coagulation dysfunction [

 <xref rid="B48-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Moreover, in critical cases, the virus can also trigger severe complications such as sepsis and septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction, and acute cardiac and renal injury [

 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. These complications are also linked with high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines [
