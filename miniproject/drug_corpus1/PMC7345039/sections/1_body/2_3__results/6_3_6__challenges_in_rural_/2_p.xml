<p>Apart from the potential significant impact of CoVID-19 on the aging population in rural America, the rural healthcare delivery system remains relatively under-resourced. Rural areas across the world have been greatly impacted by pandemics in the past, and it is clear with CoVID-19 that there are on-going issues related to the infrastructure in these communities that have not been addressed. Previous pandemics such as the H1N1, Influenza A caused high mortality rates in rural Turkey, and these deaths were directly linked to lack of advanced intensive care unit (ICU) facilities with preliminary ventilator support [

The limited availability of ICU facilities is still an issue in rural areas, particularly in the United States. Although there has been a trend of an increasing number of ICU beds being added to hospitals, these ICU beds have been found to be concentrated in large, urban hospitals while small-to-medium hospitals had decreased ICU capacity [

With rural populations having less access to these resources, the mortality rate can rise. Besides a lack of ICU availability, the healthcare in rural America has noted a significant disparity in terms of the distribution of professional resources, such as lack of healthcare workers, major healthcare institutions, and overwhelming financial burden, as compared to urban settings [

Limited physicians, healthcare training opportunities, delayed care, disparities in patient demographics (older population), and substandard quality of healthcare are already reflected in overall health outcomes as the mortality is higher in rural populations [
 <xref rid="B90-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. These observations suggest lack of pandemic preparedness in rural America; hence, the global spread of CoVID-19 may significantly impact rural communities to a greater extent.
