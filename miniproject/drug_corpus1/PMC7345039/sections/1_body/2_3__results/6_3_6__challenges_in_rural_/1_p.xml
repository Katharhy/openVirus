<p>The worldwide escalation and clinical manifestation of CoVID-19, despite constant efforts from the healthcare workers and respective governments to minimize its impact, may still be underdiagnosed. Studies have demonstrated that the risk of mortality from CoVID-19 is significantly higher in the aging population, including patients with pre-existing comorbidities. Reflecting on earlier data, 80% of the mortality related to CoVID-19 was noted among adults aged â‰¥60 years [

This is important as there are indications that a possible reason for a higher mortality rate for CoVID-19 in Italy compared to China could be the fact that there is a higher percentage of obesity in older adults in Italy, noting a similar pattern that occurred with the H1N1 pandemic [

CoVID-19 being a respiratory illness, individuals with a smoking history have higher chances of being affected by the virus and having a severe case that requires ventilation is compounded. While several strategies have been adopted to prevent the spread in urban populations, preventing the transmission dynamics and the spread of CoVID-19 in rural regions have received limited attention. Although rural regions have limited human mobility and relatively lower population densities than urban settings [
