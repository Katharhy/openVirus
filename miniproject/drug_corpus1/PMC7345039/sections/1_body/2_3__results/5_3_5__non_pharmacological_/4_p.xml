Therefore, non-pharmacological interventions suggested by WHO and used by other countries possess potential defense against the spread of this infection, even when drugs and vaccines will be available. These measures can provide protection to the individuals exposed to the virus, by limiting the symptomatic complications arising from CoVID-19, eventually reducing the overall mortality rate. Future studies are recommended to provide valid and reliable containment measures to control the local transmission of this infection.
