<p>Further studies have also shown that infectious viruses, including CoVs, can survive for long periods outside of the host organism, increasing the opportunity for transmission via touch [

 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Despite these evidences, this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads (CDC). Apart from that, CoVs were previously reported to remain infectious in water and sewage for days to weeks [

However, the mode of transmission for CoVID-19 through contaminated water does not have enough scientific evidence, hence, requires further studies to validate it.
