<p>As the first cases of the CoVID-19 were linked to direct exposure to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market of Wuhan, China, animal-to-human transmission was initially presumed [

 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, subsequent cases revealed the scope of human-to-human transmission through the individuals in the incubation stage or showing symptoms. Through the widespread information available and recent increase in understanding of the SARS-CoV-2, the virus appears to have an incubation time ranging from 2 to 14 days [

 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. A recent report suggested that the symptomatic patients had higher viral loads, detected in the nose and throat, following the onset of their symptoms [
 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These viral loads peaked around 5â€“6 days following the symptoms onset [
 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Consequently, the asymptomatic patients had a viral load similar to symptomatic patients [
 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Hence, such human-to-human transmission through symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers caused the epidemic to gradually grow over weeks, eventually becoming a global pandemic. The human-to-human transmission is mainly through the inhalation of respiratory droplets from coughing and sneezing and through contact of infected surfaces, then mediating the infection through the mouth, nose, or eyes [
 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Transmission via the inhalation of exhaled respiratory droplets may occur as aerosol droplets that can survive for prolonged periods, mediating long-range human-to-human transmission via air movement. Inhalation of virus-laden fine particles could transport the virus into deeper alveolar and tracheobronchial regions, which could increase the chance of infective transmission and oxidant pollutants in air can impair the immune function and attenuate the efficiency of the lung to clear the virus in the lungs. Pro-inflammation, injury, and fibrosis from inhaled airborne particulate matters combined with an immune response or cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection could enhance the infection severity [
 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-17-04279" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Since human-to-human transmission is the primary mode of transmission of the virus, the international public health response toward mitigating CoVID-19 has largely been based on social/physical distancing, isolation of cases, and quarantine measures [
