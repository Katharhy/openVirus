    "In December 2019, suddenly 54 cases of viral pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China, caused by some unknown microorganism. The virus responsible for these pneumonia infections was identified as novel coronavirus of the family Coronaviridae. The novel coronavirus was renamed as COVID-19 by WHO. Infection from the virus has since increased exponentially and has spread all over the world in more than 196 countries. The WHO has declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern due to the outbreak of COVID-19. The virus is highly infectious and can cause human-to-human transmission. Every 24 h, cases of COVID-19 increase severalfolds. The WHO is monitoring the SARS-CoV-2 spread very closely via a global surveillance system. The current situation demands the enforcement of strict laws which would help in inhibiting the further spread of COVID-19. Social distancing, international travel restrictions to affected countries, and hygiene are three important ways to nullify SARS-CoV-2.Government and private organizations need to come forward and work together during this pandemic. Public awareness, social distancing, and sterilization must be maintained to neutralize the viral infection, especially in major hot spots."
