<p>After SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV‑2 is the third zootic betacoronavirus of the 21st century that imposes a serious threat to human health. The outcome of a SARS-CoV‑2 infection is highly variable and dependent on multiple factors, including SARS-CoV‑2 genotype, infectious dose, genetic background, health status, immunological readiness and age. While COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory disease and mostly has a mild course, in severe cases other organs are also affected, including the heart and vasculature. To what extent the cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 are due to direct viral injury of cardiovascular cells or are an indirect consequence of the extensive lung pathology and accompanying (hyper)inflammation remains to be determined. The COVID-19 pandemic has once again alerted us to the high adaptive potential of RNA viruses and the downsides of globalisation. At the same time, international collaboration between medical professionals, scientists and politicians will be instrumental in tackling the current and foreseeable future (corona)virus outbreaks.</p>
