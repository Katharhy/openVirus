<p>Recently, a new human CoV has emerged in Wuhan, People’s Republic of China, which appears genetically very closely related to several bat CoV isolates and somewhat more distantly to SARS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Based on phylogenetic considerations, the new virus was named SARS-CoV‑2, which stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and the accompanying disease was designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV‑2 is assumed to be a zoonotic virus with bats serving as reservoir hosts. Transmission of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV from bats to humans likely occurred via intermediate hosts (presumably civet cats in the case of SARS-CoV and dromedary camels for MERS-CoV) to allow these viruses to adapt in a stepwise fashion to their new host species. Spillover of SARS-CoV‑2 from bats to humans probably also involved an intermediate host. Whether pangolins have acted as such, as initially proposed, is, however, doubtful [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The extraordinary ability of RNA viruses to adapt to changing selective pressures and to invade new hosts stems from the low fidelity with which they replicate their genome (i.e. genetic material) in combination with their high replication rate (i.e. short generation time). As a consequence, the genomes of RNA viruses are highly heterogeneous, consisting of dynamic populations of genetically related variants, also known as mutant swarms or quasispecies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This not only allows RNA viruses to infect new host species but also to escape immune surveillance and to become resistant to antiviral drugs.
