<p>A treacherous aspect of SARS-CoV‑2 infections is the presymptomatic transmission of the virus, which may have played an important role in the (rapid) spreading of the virus around the globe. By studying 77 transmission pairs and based on a mean incubation time of 5.2 (95% CI 4.1–7.0) days, He et al. inferred that infectiousness started from 2.3 (95% CI 0.8–3.0) days before symptom onset and peaked at 0.7 (95% CI −0.2–2.0) days before onset of illness to gradually decline afterwards [
