<p>Since the first report on SARS-CoV‑2 on 31 December 2019 by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, the virus has spread rapidly across the globe, creating a pandemic with a colossal socioeconomic impact affecting all continents except Antarctica. As of 7 July 2020, John Hopkins University had registered 11,626,759 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 538,190 COVID-19-related deaths, which would correspond to a global case-fatality rate of ~6%. Due to the limited testing capacity in many countries, especially at the beginning of the pandemic, and the existence of many asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic COVID-19 patients, the true incidence of SARS-CoV‑2 is presumably much higher. As a consequence, the true fatality rate will be lower too. Yet, excess mortality data indicate that the number of COVID-19-related deaths is also considerably higher than the reported death count (

For the well-characterised COVID-19 outbreak in February 2020 on the cruise ship Diamond Princess, case-fatality and infection-fatality rates for SARS-CoV‑2 of 2.6% and 1.3%, respectively, were calculated [

However, these figures may also not be fully representative of the global situation because of the relatively old age of the passengers, on the one hand, and the relatively high-quality care provided to the patients, on the other. Indeed, demographic differences as well as differences in health status, health care, COVID-19 treatment and cause of death assessment (i.e. did a person die with or die from COVID-19?), may explain the differences in reported case-fatality rates between different countries. By comparison, the global case-fatality rate associated with seasonal influenza epidemics is ~0.1%. The risk of COVID-19 hospital death is positively correlated with age, body-mass index and socioeconomic deprivation, e.g. in people ≥80 years of age an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 12.64 has been reported [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Recently, blood group has also been identified as a risk factor for acquiring COVID-19 with respiratory failure, i.e. blood group O and A are associated with, respectively, a lower and higher risk of acquiring severe COVID-19 than the other blood groups [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Most comorbidities are associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 hospital death, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, (haematological) cancer, hypertension and respiratory disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] although after adjustment for multiple variables the association with high blood pressure was lost and with chronic heart disease was rather weak (HR 1.27) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This illustrates the fact that care should be taken in interpreting the results of univariate analyses.
