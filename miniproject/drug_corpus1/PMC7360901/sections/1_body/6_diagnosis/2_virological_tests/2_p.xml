<p>The preferred specimens for the detection of SARS-CoV‑2 RNA by RT-qPCR are nasopharyngeal samples collected with a flocked swap and preserved in an appropriate transport medium. Besides in airway samples, SARS-CoV‑2 RNA is also frequently detected in faeces (reflecting infection of the gastrointestinal tract), occasionally in blood samples (indicative of viraemia) and rarely in urine.</p>
