<p>Although detailed knowledge about the interactions between the innate immune system and SARS-CoV‑2 is still scarce, innate immune responses are thought to play an important role in limiting the viral infection (to the upper respiratory tract). Based on previous research on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and various animal models of virus-induced acute lung injury as well as haematological and biochemical laboratory findings in COVID-19 patients, the following scenarios can be envisioned [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Infection of upper airway epithelial cells, recognition/uptake of SARS-CoV‑2 particles by dendritic cells and resident macrophages and activation of the complement system in the upper airways trigger the local production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. These proteins induce chemotaxis of neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells and lymphocytes to the site(s) of infection and participate in the activation of these immune cells. In the case of an adequate immune response, the virus infection is subsequently cleared by the concerted action of innate immune cells, the complement system, T and B lymphocytes and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. However, when the immune response overshoots, a viscous cycle is induced of further pulmonary accumulation of immune cells, production of more pro-inflammatory factors and aggravated immune-mediated lung injury.
