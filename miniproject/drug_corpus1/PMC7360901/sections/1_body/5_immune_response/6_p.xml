<p>Relatively little is known about the cellular immune response to SARS-CoV‑2. Using a large pool of peptides representing predicted T‑cell epitopes, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> and CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes were identified in ~70 and 100% of COVID-19 convalescent patients, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. The majority of the THs and CTLs were directed against the highly expressed S, M and N proteins of SARS-CoV‑2. THs to the S protein were robust and showed a positive correlation with SARS-CoV‑2 IgG and IgA titres. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes were detected in ~50% of unexposed individuals, indicative of possible cross-reactive T‑cell recognition between endemic CoVs and SARS-CoV‑2. In another study of 14 COVID-19 convalescent patients, variable numbers of nsp5-, S‑ and N‑specific T cells were detected and a direct correlation between the neutralising antibody titre and the strength of the N‑specific T‑cell response was found [
