<p>The specific B‑cell responses (i.e. antibody production) to SARS-CoV‑2 have been studied in detail by Long et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] in 285 patients. At 2–4 days after onset of symptoms, SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G and/or IgM antibodies were detected in 6% of the serum samples. After 17–19 days all patients had SARS-CoV-2-specific IgGs, while virus-specific IgMs reached a peak of 94.1% at 20–22 days after symptom onset. During the first 3 weeks after onset of illness, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgM levels gradually increased. Severely diseased patients had significantly higher virus-specific IgG titres than mildly affected individuals at 2 weeks after symptom onset. The median day of seroconversion for both IgG and IgM was 13 days after onset of illness. Padoan and colleagues studied the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies for 6 weeks after the onset of fever in 19 adult patients with RT-qPCR-confirmed COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Average SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA (i.e. mucosal antibody) and IgM levels above background started to be detected at 6 and 8 days after the onset of COVID-19, respectively. The average level of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies was higher for IgA than for IgM for the whole observation period. The average IgG titre peaked at day 20–22 and remained fairly constant for 1 month, while the average IgM level peaked at 10–12 days and gradually dropped thereafter.
