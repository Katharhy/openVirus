<p>In general, in patients at risk of developing severe disease following infection with SARS-CoV‑2, antiviral drug therapy should be started as soon as possible to minimise virus-induced damage of airway epithelium and to avoid the subsequent development of hypercytokinaemia. In addition, COVID-19 patients receiving antiviral drugs must be closely monitored for possible adverse effects and potential interactions with other drugs should be reckoned with. Similar to what has been found for HIV and hepatitis C virus, combining different antiviral drugs may have additive or synergistic effects. Antiviral drug cocktails will also lower the risk of the selection of SARS-CoV‑2 variants with mutations that resist antiviral drug therapy. Antiviral drugs may also be employed as prophylactics to prevent infection or to reduce virus shedding and thereby the risk of virus spreading.</p>
