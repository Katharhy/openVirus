<p>Other pharmacological targets could be nsp3 and nsp5, the papain- and chymotrypsin-like proteases encoded by ORF 1a and involved in the processing of the SARS-CoV‑2 polyproteins that produce the viral replication and transcription complexes (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Accordingly, clinical trials have been initiated with the human immunodeficiency (HIV) protease inhibitor combination lopinavir/ritonavir. The in vivo effectiveness of these drugs against SARS-CoV‑2 remains to be seen as the HIV protease belongs to the family of aspartyl proteases and nsp3 and nsp5 are cysteine proteases.
