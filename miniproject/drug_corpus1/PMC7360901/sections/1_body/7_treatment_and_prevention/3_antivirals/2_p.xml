<p>Recombinant soluble human ACE2 (sACE2) is being evaluated for its ability to block the interaction between SARS-CoV‑2 and target cells. sACE2 could also compensate for the SARS-CoV-2-related reduction of surface ACE2 levels and consequential disturbance of angiotensin II/angiotensin-(1–7) balance [

S‑protein-specific neutralising monoclonal antibodies can either interfere with the binding of the virus to target cells or prevent fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane or the membrane of endosomes. Merging of viral and cellular membranes and subsequent release of the viral genome into the host cell cytoplasm may also be inhibited using peptidomimetic fusion inhibitors or the influenza virus entry inhibitor arbidol (umifenovir). Several studies have also suggested a possible beneficial effect of the antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine on COVID-19 progression, which may at least in part be related to their ability to inhibit endosomal acidification and thereby membrane fusion of internalised virus particles [

Apart from using monoclonal antibodies for passive immunisation purposes (blood-group-matched) convalescent plasma of recovered COVID-19 patients could also be employed to protect newly infected individuals from developing severe disease [
