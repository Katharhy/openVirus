<p>A highly specific way to inhibit SARS-CoV‑2 would be by RNA interference. This method is based on the delivery to virus-infected/target cells of small (modified) RNA molecules (so-called small interfering RNAs or siRNAs) that are binding/complementary to the viral genome and promote its degradation. By simultaneous treatment of COVID-19 with multiple siRNAs targeting different parts of the SARS-CoV‑2 genome, it will be very hard for the virus to escape from this antiviral mechanism by changing its genetic code through mutation.</p>
