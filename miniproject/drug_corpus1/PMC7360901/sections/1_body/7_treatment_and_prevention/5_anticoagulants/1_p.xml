<p>Multiple recent studies have identified venous and arterial thrombosis secondary to SARS-CoV‑2 infection as a major complication of COVID-19, which likely contributes to its relatively high mortality rate [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. The pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the COVID-19-associated coagulopathy are incompletely understood. Factors that may contribute to the thrombophilia observed in severely ill COVID-19 patients include the following: (1) a disturbed balance between pro- and anticoagulant activities due to excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines, activation of complement, formation of neutrophil extracellular traps and activation of platelets; (2) inflammation-related endothelial activation; (3) death of SARS-CoV-2-infected endothelial cells; (4) endothelial dysfunction caused by unbalanced angiotensin II-angiotensin II type‑1 receptor signalling; (5) formation of prothrombotic antiphospholipid antibodies; (6) immobility-associated reduction of blood flow; (7) hypoxia due to respiratory impairment resulting from SARS-CoV-2-induced lung injury [

Based on the high incidence of venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction and stroke among COVID-19 patients and the mortality-reducing effect of empirical therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin in COVID-19 patients with a sepsis-induced coagulopathy score ≥4 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. In addition, recommendations have been formulated for (tailored) prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation therapy in specific patient groups (see, for example, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]). In COVID-19 patients receiving antiviral therapy possible interactions with anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs could occur, which preclude the use of certain drug combinations or require dose adjustments. If use of pharmacological antithrombotics is contraindicated, mechanical therapy could be considered. As heparin not only inhibits blood clotting but also possesses anti-inflammatory and anti-arrhythmic effects and may block SARS-CoV‑2 host-cell interactions, it could benefit COVID-19 patients in multiple ways [
