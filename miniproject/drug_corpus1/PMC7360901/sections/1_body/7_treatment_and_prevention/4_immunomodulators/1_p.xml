<p>COVID-19 severity and COVID-19-associated mortality are positively correlated with the serum levels of (1) positive acute phase proteins (e.g. C‑reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and the fibrin degradation product D‑dimer), (2) inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interferon γ (INFγ), interleukin (IL) 1β, 6 and 7 and tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα)) and chemokines (e.g. C‑C motif chemokine 2 (CCL2), also known as monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1); and C‑X‑C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10), also known as interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10)) and (3) with the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio [

In view of the essential role of both innate and adaptive immune responses in the clearance of (corona)viral infections, timing and dosing of the immunomodulatory therapy will have a large impact on the outcome of these studies. This is nicely illustrated by the fact that both inhibition and stimulation of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor are considered as therapy for COVID-19 patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Other targets of immunomodulation include the IL1β, IL6, INFγ and TNFα signalling pathways. Inhibition of these signalling pathways is in most cases accomplished by therapeutic antibodies directed against the cytokine itself or its receptor. In addition, small molecule inhibitors of C‑C chemokine receptor type 2 and 5, the IL1 receptor and Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription protein (STAT) signalling are being evaluated in clinical studies. Other immunomodulatory therapies that are currently being investigated include the administration of mesenchymal stem cells, NK cells, high doses of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) or recombinant human surfactant protein D and the inhibition, by a small molecule drug and monoclonal antibody, of the processing of complement factors C3 and C5, respectively [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>], while there are some indications for a suppressive effect of statins on the likelihood of developing COVID-19 symptoms in the elderly [
