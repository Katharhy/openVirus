<p>Despite the urgent need for a SARS-CoV‑2 vaccine, the safety aspects should not be neglected. One potential danger is that a SARS-CoV‑2 vaccine induces (poorly neutralising) antibodies, which facilitate subsequent virus uptake by myeloid cells via antibody or complement receptors present at their surface. This antibody-dependent enhancement of infection has previously been observed for feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) in cats vaccinated with a recombinant poxvirus expressing the FIPV S protein [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Another risk is the induction, by vaccination, of a skewed type 2 TH (Th2) response, resulting in Th2-driven immunopathology accompanied by pulmonary eosinophilia, as observed with certain experimental SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Moreover, since studies on endemic human CoVs have suggested immunity against these viruses to be short-lived [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], it will be important to establish the duration of protection from disease following vaccination against COVID-19. Finally, one has to consider the possibility that a vaccine based on current SARS-CoV‑2 variants will provide no or only partial protection against future strains of the virus or other novel human CoVs. Nonetheless, active immunisation using an effective vaccine in combination with a rigorous surveillance and containment programme can lead to the complete eradication of a viral disease, as demonstrated for smallpox. Which type(s) of vaccine will eventually be used to combat COVID-19 will be determined by a combination of factors including safety, efficacy and time-to-market introduction.
