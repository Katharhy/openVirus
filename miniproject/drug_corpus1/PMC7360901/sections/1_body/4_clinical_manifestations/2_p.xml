 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In a study of 41 hospitalised COVID-19 patients, 22 developed dyspnoea with a median time from illness onset to dyspnoea of 8.0 days (interquartile range (IQR) 5.0–13.0 days). In the same study, medium times from onset of symptoms to hospital admission, ARDS, mechanical ventilation and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) were 7.0 (IQR 4.0–8.0), 9.0 (IQR 8.0–14.0), 10.5 (IQR 7.0–14.0) and 10.5 (IQR 8.0-17.0) days, respectively [

In another study of 191 inpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, median times from illness onset to dyspnoea, ARDS, ICU admission and death or discharge were 7.0 (IQR 4.0–7.0), 12.0 (IQR 8.0–15.0), 12.0 (IQR 8.0–15.0) and 21.0 (IQR 17.0–25.0) days, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The median duration of virus shedding after onset of symptoms was 20.0 (IQR 16.0–23.0) days in this study.
