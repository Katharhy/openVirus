<p>As already mentioned above, albeit patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) may not be more susceptible to contracting SARS-CoV‑2 than healthy individuals, they have a higher chance of developing severe COVID-19 and are more likely to die from SARS-CoV‑2 infection. The higher COVID-19-related mortality of CVD patients may be directly related to or coincident with their cardiovascular comorbidities. Although COVID-19 primarily disrupts the respiratory system, the disease frequently affects the cardiovascular system as well, especially in more severe cases. The currently available data suggest that some 20–30% of hospitalised COVID-19 patients display cardiac complications [
