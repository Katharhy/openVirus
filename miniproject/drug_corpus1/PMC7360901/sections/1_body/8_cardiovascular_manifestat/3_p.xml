<p>The most common cardiac complication of COVID-19 is acute myocardial injury, as evinced by increased plasma levels of cardiac troponin and echo-/electrocardiographic abnormalities. In a retrospective study of 416 inpatients, 19.7% displayed cardiac injury defined as high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) levels above the 99th percentile of a healthy reference population. The mortality rate among patients with elevated hs-cTnI levels was 51.2% versus 4.5% in patients without myocardial injury [

Interestingly, in another study, plasma troponin T levels demonstrated a high and significantly positive linear correlation with plasma high-sensitivity CRP levels and N‑terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels [

Multiple mechanisms may be responsible for the myocardial injury observed in COVID-19 patients. It could be the result of atherosclerotic plaque erosion/rupture (i.e. obstructive coronary artery disease) induced by COVID-19-related hypoxaemia, systemic hyperinflammation or angiotensin-2/angiotensin-(1–7) misbalance [

The myocardial injury could also be caused by virus- or immune-mediated myocarditis, stress-induced cardiomyopathy or oxygen supply and demand mismatch resulting in type 2 myocardial infarction (i.e. myocardial infarction without acute coronary syndrome), possible linked to respiratory insufficiency and/or sepsis. Sepsis and the sepsis-related cytokine storm together with myocardial injury and ischaemia are likely involved in the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias in COVID-19 patients. The cytokine storm is also thought to be largely responsible for the hypercoagulable state and consequential disseminated intravascular coagulation /thrombotic microangiopathy and venous thrombosis including pulmonary embolism often seen in (severely ill/deceased) COVID-19 patients. Other factors contributing to the coagulopathy could be endothelial damage due to (1) the hyperinflammatory response typical of severe COVID-19 cases, (2) disturbance of the angiotensin-2/angiotensin-(1–7) balance and (3) SARS-CoV‑2 infection of endothelial cells [
