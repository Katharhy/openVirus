<p>CoV particles are roughly spherical, have a diameter of 120–160 nm and consist of a core (also called nucleocapsid) surrounded by a protective coat or envelope (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]). The core contains the viral genome complexed with the nucleocapsid (N) protein. CoV genomes consist of a single RNA molecule of positive polarity with a length of ~26.4 to ~31.7 kilobases (kb). The envelope is composed of a lipid bilayer (like the one found at the surface of cells) in which several transmembrane proteins are inserted. For SARS-CoV‑2 the major envelope proteins are the spike (S) protein, the membrane (M) protein and the envelope (E) protein. The S protein is involved in the binding of the virus to target cells and has a crucial role in the penetration of these cells by mediating membrane fusion. After binding of SARS-CoV‑2 particles to its cellular receptor angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and cleavage of the S protein by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), the viral envelope fuses with the plasma membrane of the target cell, resulting in the delivery of the viral genome inside the cell (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]). Alternatively, upon binding of their S protein to ACE2, SARS-CoV‑2 particles are taken up by the target cell in small vesicles called endosomes. Next, the S protein is cleaved by the endosomal protease cathepsin L, which initiates the fusion of the viral envelope with the lipid bilayer of the endosome, causing the release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm of the cell. A recent paper suggested that SARS may utilise CD147 (also known as basigin or EMMPRIN) as an alternative attachment receptor to enter target cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. After the CoV genome, which is actually a very long mRNA [(+)gRNA], is set free inside the cell, it is immediately translated to produce two large polyproteins designated pp1a and pp1ab (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Synthesis of pp1ab requires the translation machinery to switch reading frame before encountering the stop codon of open reading frame (ORF) 1a by a process called ribosomal frameshifting. Autoproteolytic cleavage of pp1a and pp1ab produces 16 different nonstructural proteins (nsps), which together form the viral replicase complex [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This complex makes a complementary copy of the viral RNA genome called the antigenome [(−)gRNA], which serves as a template for the synthesis of new CoV genomes (replication) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These (+)gRNA molecules, in turn, form the templates for the generation of a nested set of so-called subgenomic (sg) RNAs of negative polarity [(−)sgRNAs] with a common leader sequence complementary to the 5’ (i.e. left) end of the viral genome. These negative-strand sgRNAs are subsequently transcribed to produce a nested set of positive-strand sgRNAs (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Translation of these (+)sgRNAs yields the major structural proteins (i.e. the S, M, E and N protein in the case of SARS-CoV-2) and a number of accessory proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The accessory proteins of CoVs are involved in the modulation of different cellular processes for the benefit of the virus. Most accessory proteins perform multiple functions and several of them are incorporated into virus particles as minor structural proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The N protein binds the newly synthesised positive-strand RNA genomes. The resulting ribonucleoprotein complexes (i.e. nucleocapsids) associate with membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) in which the S, M and E proteins are inserted. Subsequently, virus particles are formed by budding of the capsids through the ERGIC membranes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These virus particles are then transported in vesicles (i.e. exosomes) to the surface of the cell, where they fuse with the plasma membrane, leading to the release of the newly assembled virus particles in the extracellular space (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). From there they can spread to new target cells to initiate additional rounds of virus production.
