 </sup> provide clear guidance on therapeutic strategies for Covid-19 along with insights into the pathogenesis of the disease. Remdesivir, a directly acting antiviral drug, has its most favorable effect in hospitalized patients with Covid-19 who have modest pulmonary disease. This effect probably correlates to a time in the infection when viral replication is driving the pathogenic process. In contrast, the antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive dexamethasone has its greatest therapeutic effect in patients who have more advanced disease, a time during which pathogenic effects may be driven by the immune and inflammatory responses.
