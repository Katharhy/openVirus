<p>It was once widely held that the setting of an outbreak is not an appropriate venue for conducting rigorous clinical research because when people are dying, any and all possible therapies should be “given a chance,” rather than studied in rigorous ways. Such was the case during the 2014–2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, when many small studies were launched and few, if any, provided conclusive results. A thorough review of that situation by the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine concluded that “randomized, controlled trials are the most reliable way to identify the relative benefits and risks of investigational products, and ... every effort should be made to implement them during epidemics.”

 </sup> These findings were endorsed by the global research community and led to an adequately powered randomized, controlled trial during the 2018–2020 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo that clearly identified two effective therapies.
