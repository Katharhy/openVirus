<p>The RECOVERY trial takes an approach to clinical research popularized in the field of cardiovascular disease by enrolling large numbers of patients into a simple trial as opposed to smaller numbers of patients into a more complex, rigid, and granular study.

 </sup> Both approaches have strengths and weaknesses. Large simple trials are especially useful for addressing questions such as whether a repurposed drug or standard procedure is of value, whereas the latter approach is more suited to the study of novel agents whose mechanisms of therapeutic effect may be unclear. In addition, the RECOVERY trial is using a platform or master-protocol approach in which agents can be added or subtracted from the randomization as data emerge from the trial or as new agents become available. In addition to the current report of efficacy of dexamethasone, RECOVERY investigators have reported a lack of efficacy for hydroxychloroquine and for lopinavirâ€“ritonavir and continue to study the role of dexamethasone in children, as well as the roles of azithromycin, tocilizumab, and convalescent plasma.

 </sup> The key to the success of the RECOVERY trial has been its pace of enrollment. The ability to rapidly enroll thousands of patients into the trial no doubt was facilitated by the National Health Service in the United Kingdom and the fact that the trial was available to essentially the entire patient population of the country. As noted by the authors, 15% of all the patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19 in the United Kingdom were enrolled in the trial.
