<p>In the RECOVERY trial, the benefit of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone for patients with Covid-19 who were receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of randomization was clearly shown. A 28-day mortality of 29.3% was reported for patients in the dexamethasone group as compared with 41.4% in the usual care group. In contrast, no benefit for dexamethasone was seen in patients not requiring oxygen at the time of randomization, with 28-day mortality of 17.8% and 14.0% for the dexamethasone group and the usual care group, respectively. For the heterogeneous group of patients receiving oxygen without invasive mechanical ventilation, mortality was 23.3% in the dexamethasone group and 26.2% in the usual care group. These findings, while limited to patients with Covid-19, provides clarity to an area of therapeutic controversy and probably will result in many lives saved. The use of dexamethasone already has been endorsed by several treatment-guideline panels, including that convened by the U.S. National Institutes of Health.
