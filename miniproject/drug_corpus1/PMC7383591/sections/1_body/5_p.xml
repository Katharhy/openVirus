<p>Despite the decreases in death and complications that are likely to result from appropriate treatment of patients with remdesivir and dexamethasone, far too many people with Covid-19 will die. It is our responsibility in the global medical research community to rapidly design, implement, and complete studies of the most promising therapeutic agents and vaccines against this disease. These agents include monoclonal antibodies, more selective immunosuppressive agents, and vaccines built on platforms ranging from nucleic acids to proteins to recombinant viruses. Such efforts will benefit from national and global coordination and publicâ€“private partnerships, including Accelerating Covid-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) in the United States,
