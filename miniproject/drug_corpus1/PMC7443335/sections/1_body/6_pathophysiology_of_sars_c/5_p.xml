<p id="p0110">SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein binds with ACE-2 receptor and it is a crucial step for the virus entry in to host cells. Homotrimers (S1 and S2) of S proteins assists the attachment to the host receptors. The S2 subunit of SARS-Cov-2 is highly conserved and serves as a target for antiviral therapeutics. Several therapeutics approaches of virus-receptor binding affinity are under investigation. Systematic detection of Î²-CoV receptors showed that human cells expressing ACE-2 was enhanced the detection of entry of SARS-CoV-2 but human Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) or APN (Aminopeptidase N) had not enhanced entry of SARS-CoV-2. While, another study showed that S protein of SARS-CoV2 and ACE-2 binding efficiency is 10- to 20- fold higher than that of SARS-CoV. It is evidenced by Cryo-TEM Structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike in the prefusion conformation [
