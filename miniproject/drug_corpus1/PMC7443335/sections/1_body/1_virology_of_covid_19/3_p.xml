<p id="p0055">In brief, n-CoV consists of four proteins three associated with envelope and one nucleocapsid protein (N) to pack the genome as shown in 
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> . The three structural proteins include membrane protein (M), envelope protein (E) and spike protein (S). In which, M determines the shape of the viral envelope and forms the central organizer of n-CoV assembly. Protein E interacts with M protein to form the viral envelope. The crown like appearance of the n-CoV is due to the large protrusions of S protein from the virus envelope. The S protein is a critical determinant of viral host range, tissue tropism and a major inducer of host immune responses [
