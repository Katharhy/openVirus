<p id="p0250">To produce inhalable SLMs with stealth effect and deep lung deposition, cisplatin microcrystals were prepared by high pressure homogenization (HPH) in isopropanol (IPA) then embedded into solubilized lipid (Tristearin, TS) and/or PEGylated components (DSPE-methyl-PEG conjugate-2000, DSPE-mPEG-2000) or D-Î±-Tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) via spray-drying technique. SLMs was explained by the increased solubilization of un-entrapped cisplatin microcrystals on SLM surface by PEGylated fractions leading to initial burst effect followed by retarded dissolution from the encapsulated microcrystals. Use of biocompatible phospholipids that imitate lung surfactants including dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine methoxy (polyethylene glycol) (DPPE-PEG). These surfactants could possibly minimize the surface tension of particles thus facilitating particle migration deeply to peripheral regions of lungs. Moreover, PEGylation using muco-penetrating DPPE-PEG provided stealth effect, which enabled escape from opsonization by alveolar macrophages and ensured longer residence time in the lungs [
