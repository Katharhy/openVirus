<p id="p0240">LPMP represent an outstanding approach to improve deep lung deposition and to bypass macrophage uptake. LPMP are light particles, with an appropriate aerodynamic diameter of 1–3 μm, large geometric diameter of 5–30 μm and density of &lt;0.4 g/cm3. The high porosity of LPMP allows them to penetrate deeply into lungs by inhalation. However, particles of 1–5 μm tend to aggregate via van der Waals attraction and 1–3 μm particles are captured by lung macrophages thus reducing their effect. Therefore, longer residence time was observed with MP of geometric diameter ≥ 20 μm being too large to be phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages. Therefore, particles should be light with large geometric diameter and low aerodynamic diameter to achieve deep delivery into lungs [
