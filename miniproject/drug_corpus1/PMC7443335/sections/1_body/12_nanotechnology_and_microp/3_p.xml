<p id="p0215">Major obstacles in drug delivery to upper respiratory tract are smaller surface area, lower blood flow, mucus layer (traps inhaled substances) and filtration of foreign objects [
 <xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The large surface area, ciliated cells of lower respiratory tract may be ideal area for delivery as it is connected directly to systemic circulation via pulmonary circulation with few challenges like branched nature alveolar macrophages and pulmonary surfactant (phospholipids, proteins and mucins) decrease delivery efficiencies [
