<p id="p0390">Animal models, mimic aspects of a diseased condition found in humans are used to evaluate the disease. To evaluate the potential of vaccine, standardize animal models are to be developed to understand the enhanced disease after vaccination. Therefore, a validated animal model should be developed to extrapolate the human conditions prior to large scale efficacy studies. Development and standardization of assay in support the immune responses and clinical case to support the research in the field of vaccine research. Developing of master protocols in determining the safety and efficacy before widespread distribution of vaccine for COVID-19 pandemic [
