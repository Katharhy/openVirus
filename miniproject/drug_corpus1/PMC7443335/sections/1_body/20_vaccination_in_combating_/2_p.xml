<p id="p0385">Vaccines serve as therapeutic and prophylactic agent to combat any infection. One of the major challenges is to handle the enhanced diseased condition occurring in immunized animals upon exposure to virus, studied in case of SARS and MERS-CoV vaccine candidates in mice. First step in the vaccine research includes the design of the target product profile (TPP) to provide guidance for the formulators. Animal model development, assay development, vaccine trial design, manufacturing processes can be regarded as the key areas of research in the “safe and effective” vaccine development. A list of vaccine candidates developed to combat COVID-19 with a particular focus on vaccine status and development is described in
