This study presents the current status of the deadly infectious COVID-19 with special emphasis on the research agenda to fighting against COVID-19.The current review focuses on the possible particulate delivery approaches and the research agenda to combat COVID-19.The research agenda discussed in this context covers all the areas such as ground work, epidemiology, immunology, viral therapeutics and vaccine. The challenges, knowledge gaps and the research efforts are discussed in the specified areas. The major goals to combat COVID-19 are to identify, diagnose, treat and stop the transmission of virus due to its sudden spill over globally. Future perspective should focus on repurposing of antiviral drugs, development of animal models, in-vitro in-vivo studies to aid the screening of antiviral drugs, prevent transmission of disease, and develop vaccine as early as possible.</p>
