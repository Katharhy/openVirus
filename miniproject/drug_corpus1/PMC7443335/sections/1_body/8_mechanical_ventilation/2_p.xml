<p id="p0125">When respiratory failure is occurred in COVID-19 patients, mechanical ventilation becomes the necessary treatment. In addition, hemodynamic support is also required for managing septic shock. Mechanical ventilation should be with lower tidal volumes (4 to 6 ml/kg predicted body weight; PBW) and lower inspiratory pressures, reaching a plateau pressure (Pplat) &lt; 28 to 30 cm H
 <sub>2</sub>O [

Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) must be as high as possible to maintain the driving pressure (Pplat-PEEP) and as low as possible (&lt;14 cmH2O). Moreover, one must always remember that avoiding disconnections from the ventilator for preventing loss of PEEP and atelectasis. Finally, the use of paralytics is not recommended unless PaO2/FiO2 (partial oxygen pressure/fraction of inspired oxygen) &lt; 150 mmHg. The prone ventilation for &gt;12 h per day, and the use of a conservative fluid management strategy for ARDS patients without tissue hypo perfusion (strong recommendation) are emphasized [
