This trial will decide that these treatments should be used or not in the COVID-19 patients in future. If the treatment will become effective, total 10,000 units of convalescent plasma will be supplied to the patients in a scaled-up national programme that enabling the treatment of 5000 patients per week [

It was observed that anti-bodies levels were sudden increased and reduced the concentration of reactive proteins in COVID-19 patients. The clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxy-hemoglobin saturation within 3 days without any adverse effects [
