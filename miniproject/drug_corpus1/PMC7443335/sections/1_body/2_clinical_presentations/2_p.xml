 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The clinical manifestations of the disease were divided into three categories by authors of Chinese CDC report. First, mild pneumonia and non-pneumonia are in mild category (81% of cases). Second, dyspnea, blood oxygen saturation (SpO
 <sub>2</sub>) ≤ 93%, PaO
 <sub>2</sub>/FiO
 <sub>2</sub> ratio or P/F [the ratio between the blood pressure of the oxygen (partial pressure of oxygen, PaO
 <sub>2</sub>), respiratory frequency ≥ 30/min, and the percentage of oxygen supplied (fraction of inspired oxygen, FiO
 <sub>2</sub>)] &lt; 300, and/or lung infiltrates &gt;50% within 24 to 48 h in severe disease category in approximately 14% of cases, and third respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure in critical condition, as seen in 5% of cases [
