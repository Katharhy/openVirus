<p id="p0265">Literature on anti-viral activity of gold nanoparticles (AuNP) is inadequate to apply it for COVID-19. However, AuNP stabilized with certain biocompatible polymer work as an effective anti-viral agent against HIV-1, H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, dengue virus, bovine viral diarrhea virus and Foot-and-mouth disease virus [

Carbon based nanocarriers such as fullerenes, carbon nano-tubes have gained much attention due to optical, electronic, mechanical and thermal properties in past decade. They possess many advantages but their applications in the field of virology are limited to some viruses. Antiviral or virucidal activities of these carbon-based nanomaterials have been evaluated against some viruses such as herpes simplex virus type 1(HIV-1) [
