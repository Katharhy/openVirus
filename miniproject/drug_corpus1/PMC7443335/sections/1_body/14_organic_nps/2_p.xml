<p id="p0285">The use of organic NPs (ONP) over INPs is well studied in biomedical field due to various safety issues [
 <xref rid="bb0475" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. ONP possess many advantages over other nanoparticles platforms, such as self-assembly in physiologically mild conditions, and chemical diversity for accommodating a variety of modalities, sizes, surface functionalization, shapes, and compositions [
