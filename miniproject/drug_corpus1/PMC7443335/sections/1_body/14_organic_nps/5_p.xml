<p id="p0300">Polymeric MP and NP (PNP) has shown the exciting features such as flexible properties, viable synthetic protocols, and biocompatibility, making it an interesting candidate for biomedical applications. PNP can be synthesized with the help of polymers such as linear, branched, and 3D networks (i.e. highly branched) of natural or synthetic origin [

 <italic>co</italic>-glycolic acid) (PLGA) is the well explored polymer approved by FDA due to biocompatibility and biodegradability in the human body [

Inhalable PLGA, PCL or PLA MPs were successfully fabricated by spray-drying of mixed organic solution. But their uses either for development or for improvement of an anti-viral have been investigated only for some pathogenic viruses like influenza, HIV and rabies virus [
