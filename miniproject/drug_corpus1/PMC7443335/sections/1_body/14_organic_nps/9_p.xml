As defined by Nanoviricides Inc., nanoviricide is a polymeric single chemical chain with covalently attached ligands that specify the virus target. The attached ligands determine the anti-viral activity of the drug [
 <xref rid="bb0545" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Nanoviricide binds to specific virus type at several points, coat the virus particles and dismantle the virus particle and attack the viral genome optionally to destroy virus completely. Nanoviricides complete the task of destroying the virus particles without immune system assistance. Currently nanoviricides drug candidates are in preclinical studies with planned clinical trials [
 <xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The Company has worked on developing an animal model to test anti-coronavirus effectiveness in vivo using a model coronavirus that binds to the same ACE-2 receptor as SARS-CoV-2, namely human coronavirus NL-63 (hCoV-NL63). The researcher anticipates using this animal model to obtain indications of effectiveness of the nano-viricide test drug candidates against the model coronavirus in vivo. Nanoviricides represent the next great advance in anti-viral strategies in “Immunotherapeutic” (antibodies and vaccines) [
