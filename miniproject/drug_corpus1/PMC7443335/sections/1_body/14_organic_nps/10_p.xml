<p id="p0325">NPs possess the ability to deliver a wide range of antigenic moieties to the antigen-presenting cells by safeguarding the native structure of the antigen in order to enhance the safety and the efficacy of the vaccine. NPs can target both adaptive and innate immune systems. Nanosize and flexibility are the key advantages of nanocarriers in vaccine development. NPs can be administered by oral, intranasal routes, subcutaneous and intramuscular injections by overcoming tissue barriers and targeting key locations like epithelial, mucosal barriers and lymph nodes [
