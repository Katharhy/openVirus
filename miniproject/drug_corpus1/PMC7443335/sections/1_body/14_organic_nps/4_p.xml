<p id="p0295">The pH-sensitive or thermo sensitive linkers can be used to release the drug payload in response to environmental conditions for prolonged stimulation of immune response. Modifying surface charge of liposomes can also be used to enhance the bioavailability to explore the negative charge of mucosal membrane and escape form the clearance mechanism of mucosal cilia [
