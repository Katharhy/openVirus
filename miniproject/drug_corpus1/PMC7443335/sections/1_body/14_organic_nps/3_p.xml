<p id="p0290">NP made from lipids is unique class for biomedical applications comprised of outer biodegradable phospholipid bilayer and an inner hydrophilic core designed to hold aqueous therapeutic agents. The flexibility of liposome is to hold both hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules. A major advantage of liposomal NP is the versatility of the lipid bilayer, which can be functionalized with targeting moieties. Chemical diversity, high loading capacity, and intrinsic bio-degradability are the characteristics beneficial to drug delivery [
