<p id="p0080">The basic reproductive number (R0) measures the transmissibility of a virus, representing the average number of new infections generated by an infectious person in a fully susceptible population. Therefore, R0 can be used to understand the transmissibility of SARS-CoV for predicting the transmission. The number infected is likely to increase with stronger transmission potential, if R0 &gt; 1 and transmission is likely to die out eventually, if R0 &lt; 1 [
