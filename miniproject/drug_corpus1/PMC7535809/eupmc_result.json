    "Viral respiratory infections are risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Underlying CVD is also associated with an increased risk of complications following viral respiratory infections, including increased morbidity, mortality, and health care utilization. Globally, these phenomena are observed with seasonal influenza and with the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Persons with CVD represent an important target population for respiratory virus vaccines, with capacity developed within 3 large ongoing influenza vaccine cardiovascular outcomes trials to determine the potential cardioprotective effects of influenza vaccines. In the context of COVID-19, these international trial networks may be uniquely positioned to redeploy infrastructure to study therapies for primary and secondary prevention of COVID-19. Here, we describe mechanistic links between influenza and COVID-19 infection and the risk of acute cardiovascular events, summarize the data to date on the potential cardioprotective effects of influenza vaccines, and describe the ongoing influenza vaccine cardiovascular outcomes trials, highlighting important lessons learned that are applicable to COVID-19. Central Illustration  Highlights • Viral respiratory infections, such as seasonal influenza and COVID-19, are associated with elevated risks of cardiovascular events.• Several international CVOTs are investigating whether seasonal influenza vaccine reduces the risk of cardiovascular events among patients with HF or coronary artery disease.• Existing trial networks may provide an opportunity to assess primary and secondary prevention strategies for patients with CVD at risk of complications from COVID-19."
