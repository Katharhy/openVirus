   <tr>
    <td align="left">Centralised model (eg, tuberculosis)</td>
    <td align="left">A physical biobank of clinical specimens and strains collected from different sites worldwide</td>
    <td align="left">Single inventory; easy to assemble evaluation panels and distribute specimens to aid test development</td>
    <td align="left">Most expensive model because of storage and shipping costs; risk of losing shipments or specimen quality, or both, during shipping</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align="left">Regional model (eg, dengue)</td>
    <td align="left">Set up regional hubs: specimens are collected at different sites and then shipped to the hub in their region for characterisation and storage</td>
    <td align="left">Tests are evaluated at the two regional hubs using samples from different endemic backgrounds or from people with different comorbidities</td>
    <td align="left">Requires shipping from three-to-four sites in each region to a regional hub; difficult to aliquot samples from children for shipping; more organisation required to assemble regional panels</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align="left">Decentralised network model (eg, leishmaniasis, syphilis)</td>
    <td align="left">All samples are collected, characterised, and stored at the site of collection; companies with tests under evaluation ship tests to the sites that have specimens required for evaluation; all sites use a common evaluation protocol</td>
    <td align="left">Least expensive as no shipping is involved; tests are evaluated at each site using appropriate specimens from a range of endemic conditions; empower more countries to do evaluations and post-marketing surveillance</td>
    <td align="left">Potentially more sample heterogeneity from site to site</td>
