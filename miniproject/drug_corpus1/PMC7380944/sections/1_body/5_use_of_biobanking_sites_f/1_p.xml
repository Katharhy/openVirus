<p id="para310">For Zika evaluations, protocols were developed for the collection, storage, and characterisation of specimens at each site to ensure compliance with ethics and national laws. Generic protocols were used so that each site could adapt to local requirements as needed but maintain the key parameters. Once the evaluation panel composition was developed and approved by the biobank steering group, calls for contributions to the evaluation panel went out to the biobank network and the panel was assembled virtually with specimens from within the network and from laboratories outside the ZikaPLAN network, as needed. Companies with tests for evaluation sent their tests to the sites for evaluation. The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, in collaboration with the International Diagnostics Centre, functioned as the coordinating body to drive protocol development and panel consensus; furthermore, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine oversaw the network logistics and analysed the results.</p>
