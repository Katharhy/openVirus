<p id="para260">For dengue, a regional model with a regional hub in Asia and another in the Americas was established. Specimens collected from sites in each region were shipped to the hub in their region. The dengue biobank samples were used for test evaluation. Common protocols for specimen collection, characterisation, shipping, archiving, and evaluation were developed. Test kits submitted by companies were sent to the two regional hubs for evaluation using an evaluation panel assembled at each hub. The results were analysed separately to determine if test performance was affected by endemic conditions in each region and in aggregate.
