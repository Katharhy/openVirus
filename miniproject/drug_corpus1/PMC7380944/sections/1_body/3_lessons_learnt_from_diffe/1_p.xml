<p id="para250">Depending on funding available, location of laboratory expertise and biobanking facilities, and the advice of expert working groups for different diseases within the TDR diagnostics research programme, different models for biobanking were developed (

 </xref> However, many countries have strict laws prohibiting the export of specimens and the shipment of samples; even when shipment of specimens is permitted, there are still many challenges and great costs to do so. The advantage was that specimens requested for test development were assembled from a single inventory and sent out from one location. As the samples were a precious resource, any specimen request has to be reviewed by a Specimen Bank Advisory Committee with regards to its scientific merit. A small panel of 20 specimens would be sent on approval. Larger panels would be sent subsequently if results were promising. The single inventory also made it easier to assemble specimens for evaluation. An evaluation of 19 serology tests for tuberculosis was done using specimens from the tuberculosis specimen bank.
