 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table</xref> shows the advantages and disadvantages of each model. Lessons learnt included that minimising specimen transport across national borders should be a top priority and that the network model is the least costly and the most sustainable. In the network model, building capacity at each site for test evaluation allowed each site to continue to evaluate tests that might be available locally or regionally and to do post-marketing surveillance of tests that are approved for sale. The specimens at the biobanking sites can also be used as quality control materials and proficiency panels to ensure the quality of tests and testing.
