<p id="para390">Epidemics of viral infectious diseases are increasing in frequency and severity. The rapid development, evaluation, and deployment of diagnostics that can accurately and quickly identify pathogens as part of epidemic preparedness is urgently needed. Despite advances on data sharing and commitment towards collaborative research to enable disease control and prevention for the COVID-19 pandemic, the sharing of well-characterised specimens remains a major challenge for accelerating test development and evaluation. Establishing a sustainable biobanking mechanism for the standardised collection, characterisation, and archiving of specimens, and sharing these specimens to facilitate and accelerate diagnostic test development and evaluation for diseases of epidemic potential using the principles outlined by the Nagoya Protocol, is needed now. Sustainable biobanking networks for diseases of epidemic potential were needed yesterday, are needed today, and will be needed tomorrow.</p>
