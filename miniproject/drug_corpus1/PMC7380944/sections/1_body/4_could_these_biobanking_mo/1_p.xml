 </xref> The International Diagnostics Centre was established at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine to accelerate market entry of quality diagnostics by working across all stages, including development, evaluation, regulatory approval, and implementation. The International Diagnostics Centre has regional coordinating centres and, through its efforts to coordinate multisite evaluations, has established a network of biobanking and evaluation sites for dengue and other infectious diseases, in partnership with TDR. These sites were used within ZikaPLAN and have also become part of other collaborative biobanking and evaluation initiatives.
