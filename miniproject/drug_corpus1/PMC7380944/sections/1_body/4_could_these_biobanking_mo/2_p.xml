<p id="para300">In setting up a Zika biobank, the ZikaPLAN diagnostic work package members reviewed the governance for biobanks, different models, and lessons learnt, and decided on the decentralised network model. Although the TDR guiding principles and quality criteria for biobanking site selection can be used for diseases of epidemic potential, the first attribute for establishing a biobank network for diseases of epidemic potential is the speed with which the sites should be selected and the specimens made available for development and evaluation. In particular, preference was given to sites that already have a mechanism for the approval of collection of clinical specimens with informed consent and for their use in diagnostic research such as evaluations. In some countries, including the USA, the use of left-over clinical specimens for research is permitted as long as the specimens are anonymised and cannot be traced back to its origins.

  <p id="para110">The biobank should have a set of guiding principles; specimens should be collected with informed consent and a steering committee should provide oversight on requests for specimens for test development or evaluation.</p>

  <p id="para130">All sites must agree to use the same collection, characterisation, and evaluation protocols so that evaluation results across all the sites can be aggregated.</p>

  <p id="para150">Clinics and laboratories within the network need to be compliant with the Good Clinical Practice and the Good Clinical Laboratory Practice and have facilities to maintain specimen integrity and quality.</p>
