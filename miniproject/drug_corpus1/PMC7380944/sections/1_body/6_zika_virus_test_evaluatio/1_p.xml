<p id="para330">Because well-characterised specimens are a precious resource and the network evaluation laboratories are very busy, often serving national surveillance programmes, a two-phased approach was used for the evaluation process. Tests were first evaluated against a small number of specimens that challenge the test specificity, because cross-reactivity is a major concern of Zika tests. If the Zika test failed the specificity challenge (&lt;80%), the full evaluation would not be allowed to proceed, hence the term, sudden death. The use of a sudden death panel conserved precious resources, saved time, and expedited the evaluation process.</p>
