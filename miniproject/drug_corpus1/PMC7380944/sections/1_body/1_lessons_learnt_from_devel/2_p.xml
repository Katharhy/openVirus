<p id="para220">The most useful format for rapid POC tests at community level is a single-use disposable test that comes with all the supplies required for testing in the test kit. Millions of such rapid POC tests are sold each year for HIV and malaria, most of which are based on the principles of immunochromatography, either in a lateral flow or a flow-through format. Although the expertise to develop these types of rapid POC tests is widely available, the main barrier to the development of a rapid antigen or antibody POC test for a novel pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2 is the lack of knowledge on the dynamics of the immune response to the infection, such as when different types of antibodies are produced over the course of infection and against which viral proteins. The identification of immunodominant viral proteins as marker of acute COVID-19 infection and host antibodies that can be used as markers of acute and past infection requires access to well-characterised patient specimens at different stages of infection, including convalescent blood samples in those who have recovered. Access to these specimens is also important for evaluation of test performance once a test has been developed. Given the rapid spread of COVID-19 around the world, accelerating test development and evaluation is an urgent priority.
