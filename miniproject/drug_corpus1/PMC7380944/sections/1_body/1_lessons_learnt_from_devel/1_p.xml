<p id="para210">Rapid tests that can be used at the POC include sample-in-answer-out molecular assays to detect viral RNA, antigen detection tests to detect viral proteins, and serology tests to detect antibodies produced in response to the infection. The US Food and Drug Administration approved for emergency use the first rapid COVID-19 molecular assay that can be done on nasal or throat swabs with hands-on time of a few minutes and that gives a result in 5â€“45 min. Other POC molecular assays are undergoing clinical trials and several of them will soon receive emergency use approval. Although these rapid assays are highly sensitive and specific, and some of these devices are already in use in low-income and middle-income countries for diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis, they are expensive and difficult to scale for use at community level.</p>
