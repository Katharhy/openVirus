<p id="para360">At the laboratory training workshops in Africa in February, 2020, lead laboratory scientists from more than 30 countries were trained not only in molecular methods to detect COVID-19 but also in providing real-time molecular testing data to an online platform established at the Institut Pasteur Dakar (IPD).

 </xref> The need for setting up a biobank of well-characterised specimens to facilitate and accelerate the development and evaluation of antigen and serology tests for COVID-19 was explained to the laboratories at the workshops. The Africa CDC Laboratory Working Group reviewed the lessons learnt and decided to adopt the decentralised network model for the Africa CDC COVID-19 biobank. The ZikaPLAN biobanking guiding principles, governance, criteria for recruitment of biobank sites, mechanism for specimen collection, characterisation and archiving, and access of specimens for test development and evaluation, as described above, were reviewed by Africa CDC and adapted for COVID-19 (

The research done includes sequencing of positive specimens for genomic surveillance. This procedure is currently done at IPD and the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa but will soon be expanded to six other sites across the continent. This research enables Africa CDC to have a real-time surveillance system for tracking the emergence of COVID-19 on the continent and a virtual biobanking network for COVID-19 and other infectious iseases of pandemic potential in future. The quality management of the COVID-19 network, which includes the ensuring of the proficiency of the sites in using reference methods for characterising the specimens, are being done by IPD and the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases in collaboration with the Africa CDC Laboratory Working Group.
