<p id="para190">A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified as the cause of the outbreak of severe acute respiratory infections in Wuhan, China, on Jan 7, 2020. Within days the sequence of the virus was published to allow scientists from all around the world to develop molecular assays to detect the virus in patients' specimens.

 </xref> This openness and willingness to share data and key information for test development, as John Nkengasong, the Director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) pointed out, is in stark contrast to the SARS outbreak when the development and validation of diagnostic tests to confirm cases hampered international efforts to develop evidence-based control strategies.

 </xref> Within days, many protocols for detecting SARS-CoV-2 were developed and shared, so that laboratories around the world could start testing for this new pathogen. However, scaling up molecular testing is not easy as these assays require sophisticated equipment, well-trained personnel, and cold storage for reagents. In countries with inadequate laboratory infrastructure, testing is centralised at a few sites with specimens being transported from clinics and hospitals all over the country. At some point, some countries are left helpless with few means of controlling a growing epidemic when they face long backlogs for confirming cases or when testing has come to a halt because of a lack of access to reagents or supplies such as swabs. The sole reliance on molecular testing has led to a global competition for test reagents and supplies that brought to the forefront the inequity of access to key lifesaving technologies across low-income, middle-income, and high-income countries.
