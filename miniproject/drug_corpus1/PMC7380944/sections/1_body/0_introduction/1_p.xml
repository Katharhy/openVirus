 </xref> A triad of diagnostic tests are crucially needed. This triad includes a highly sensitive and specific molecular assay to detect the pathogen to confirm the diagnosis and guide clinical management and public health measures, such as isolation or quarantine; a rapid simple-to-use antigen detection test that can be used to triage suspect cases at the point of care (POC) or in community settings; and an antibody assay that can be used to detect past exposure to the pathogen to understand the true extent of the outbreak, so that prevention and control strategies can be informed, at-risk populations identified, the attack rate estimated, and the effectiveness of control interventions assessed.
