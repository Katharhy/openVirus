<p id="p0135">Critical acute neurologic pathologies infrequently characterize ECoV; in one study, status epilepticus (SE) has shown to be the manifesto of the entrance of SARS CoV within the Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Further, SE is recognized to be a seizure lasting for 5–30 min or longer without annulling automatically, or either as seizures repeatedly reappearing with no full consciousness restoration amid succeeding events. In one case, five days post-admission in 59 years lady, SE presented with reappearing seizures not responding to phenytoin treatment and extended episodes up to 30 min accompanied with confusion. RT-PCR repeated twice tested positive for both CSF and serum specimen, while the CSF viral load was 6884 copies/mL and serum viral load was 6750 copies/mL. Besides, chances of metabolic disarrangements, renal failure, stroke, cranial trauma, and hypoxia excluded
