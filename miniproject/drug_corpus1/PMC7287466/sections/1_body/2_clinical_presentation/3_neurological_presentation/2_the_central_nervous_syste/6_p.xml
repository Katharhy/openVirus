<p id="p0155">Moreover, in trying to rule out possibilities of CNS ECoV manifestation, repeated MRI checkup is mandatory. In a retrospective study involving ICU MERS-CoV cases, the initial CT of the 74 years man with comorbidities (DM, HTN, and dyslipidemia) revealed no acute changes rather than multiple chronic small vessels (lacunar) strokes. Surprisingly the MRI repeated three weeks later had remarkable findings of various bilateral patchy regions of signal anomaly that appeared high on T2/ FLAIR images observed in the peri-ventricular, deep white matter, subcortical region. The observation implied an acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). Of note, this case presented with high-grade fever, altered mental level, with ataxia and focal motor deficits. Ended up into coma and died 30 days post-admission, importantly, CSF protein and leucocyte are usually raised in ADEM. However, negative CSF MERS-CoV RT-PCR rose another diagnostic challenge in these cases
