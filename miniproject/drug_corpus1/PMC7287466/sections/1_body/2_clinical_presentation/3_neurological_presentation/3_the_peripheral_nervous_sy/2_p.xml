<p id="p0170">Peripheral nerve dysfunctions regularly induced by dysfunction of the peripheral motor, sensory, or autonomic nerves. Similar to CNS ECoV related disorders, peripheral nervous system (PNS) disorders does not coincide with the onset of SARS; instead, symptoms tend to appear 21–25 days later. Further, neuromuscular disorders (NMD) in these cases observed to fall under critical-illness polyneuropathy (CIP), myopathy (CIM), or both. Amongst the cases exhibited polyneuropathy, the NCSs revealed decreased CMAP amplitudes. Never the less, diminishing of nerve conduction velocity, temporal dispersion or conduction block, does not appear to be the peculiarity of SARS-NMD. On the other side, the EMG explicated acute denervation. Of note, large doses of intravenous corticosteroid treatment may generate acute steroid myopathy
