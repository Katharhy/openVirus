<p>Due to his symptoms of new‐onset fever and coughing, he was tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for COVID‐19. This was positive, within 24 hours, for both the child and his asymptomatic mother. They classified as cases of local spread of COVID‐19. Nasal prong oxygen and oral co‐amoxiclav were commenced. The 4‐drug antituberculous treatment regimen, including rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, was continued and adjuvant oral prednisone 2 mg/kg was added before the diagnosis of COVID‐19, interrupted at COVID‐19 diagnosis, and restarted again at discharge. Improvement was rapid with discharge on day 5, followed by self‐isolation. He received two doses of oral prednisone before the diagnosis of COVID‐19. The airway obstruction will be re‐evaluated 4 weeks postdischarge. Consent was given by the patient's parents for publication of this case and permission for the report was granted by the Institutional Review Board of the Health Science Faculty of Stellenbosch University.</p>
