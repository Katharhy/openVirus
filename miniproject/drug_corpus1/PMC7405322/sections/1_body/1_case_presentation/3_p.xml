<p>On clinical examination, the saturations were 100% on nasal prong oxygen and respiratory rate was 30 breaths per minute. He had a blocked nose, subcostal recession, and dullness to percussion in the right upper lobe. On auscultation, wheezing was detected, more significant on the right. He was hemodynamically stable. A supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrated confluent air‐space disease in the right upper and middle lobes with a small focus of breakdown corresponding to the dullness on percussion elicited clinically. Airway narrowing of the left main bronchus and the bronchus intermedius are surrogate representations of hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which in conjunction with the air‐space disease, support a diagnosis of primary PTB. A lateral chest radiograph performed during the same admission confirmed the area of parenchymal breakdown (presumably in the right middle lobe) and also confirmed the presence of lymphadenopathy posteroinferiorly to the bronchus intermedius (for both frontal and lateral views, see Figure 
 <xref rid="ppul24927-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). He had a white cell count of 8.03 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L, neutrophils 3.56 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L, lymphocytes 3.45 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L, and C‐reactive protein of 11 mg/L.
