<p>Other abnormalities were detected in COVID-19 patients, such as lymphopenia, increased levels of C reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and D-dimer [

In addition to low levels of serum albumin, increased values of total bilirubin, creatinine, cardiac troponins, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), prothrombin time (PT), and procalcitonin were detected and found of prognostic significance [

Hematological parameters, such as leukocytosis, neutrophilia (indicative of bacterial superinfection), and lymphopenia (indicative of reduced immune response to the virus), are predictors of progression toward severe respiratory distress in COVID-19 infected people. Lippi et al. (2020) [
 <xref rid="B27-ijms-21-05145" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] discovered significantly increased values of MDW (monocyte volume distribution widthâ€”DxH 900 hematology analyzer, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) in all COVID-19 patients, especially with severe manifestations. As for severe and/or systemic infectious diseases, consumption (disseminated) coagulopathy may be one of the most severe complications of patients with COVID-19 as assessed by hemostasis testing PT and D-dimer values [
