<p>SARS-CoV2 has recently emerged as a novel unknown virus. Today, we are facing the health and economic consequences of its rapid diffusion worldwide. In a guarded optimistic view, we hope that the undertaken preventive and treatment measures will at least contribute to contain diffusion, attenuate activity or even eliminate the virus. Although today there are no specific treatments for COVID-19, early diagnosis and improved management of severe patients may reduce mortality. As above underlined an effective measure is to treat a cytokine storm by administering anti-inflammatory drugs, such as tocilizumab, at early stage of the infection for timely control of the disease and to avoid the risk of mortality. Modern technologies may subside in a near future to validate vaccination strategies in eradicating viral infection from humans. In this regard, reverse vaccinology based on computational identification of immunodominant epitopes may contribute to novel preventive strategies for COVID-19. In providing examples, indeed, epitope-based immune-derived vaccines (IDV) are generally considered to be safe when compared to other vectored or attenuated live vaccines. These may also provide essential T-cell help for antibody-directed vaccines [

Several platforms have being explored; results on their preclinical efficacy due to generated humoral T cell and reduced viral load responses are already available. Development and optimization of recent technologies, such as multimer staining for flow cytometry analysis, offer potential in characterizing COVID-19-specific HLA class I and II CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses and eventually correlate their frequency with disease severity and outcome. This may open the pathway to novel diagnostic strategies [

 <xref rid="B93-ijms-21-05145" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], this approach may lead to elucidate mechanisms governing viral infection and clearance at the different stages of disease and advance effective immunotherapies based on monoclonal antibodies discovery.
