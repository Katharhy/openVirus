<p>In this review, we discuss emerging perspectives for the appropriate preventive and treatment strategies to tackle COVID-19 infection. These include vaccine development based on definition of immunodominant viral epitopes, passive immunization, several anti-viral therapeutics, and anti-inflammatories. We also highlight tools that may elucidate mechanisms governing viral infection and clearance at the different stages of disease and advance effective immunotherapies based on monoclonal antibodies discovery.</p>
