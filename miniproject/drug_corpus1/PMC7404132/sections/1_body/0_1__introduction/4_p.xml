<p>ACE2 is widely expressed from fish to amphibians, birds, and reptiles to mammals; all these animal species can be natural hosts of SARS-CoV2. Since ACE2 is highly expressed in the lung, intestine, testis, and kidney, in addition to salivary droplets, other routes of transmission of the viral infection are possible [
