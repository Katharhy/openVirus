<p>Wang et al. (2020) [
 <xref rid="B13-ijms-21-05145" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] first described the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of COVID-19 infectious syndrome. From a pathogenetic point of view, the infection begins when the virus passes the nasal and larynx mucosa to enter the respiratory tract and reach the lung. Early symptoms include fever and cough [
 <xref rid="B14-ijms-21-05145" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. From the lung, the virus enters the peripheral blood, causing viremia and targeting organs that express ACE2, including the heart and renal and gastrointestinal tract [
 <xref rid="B14-ijms-21-05145" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This explains why the virus is found in the fecal samples [

 <xref rid="B15-ijms-21-05145" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Usually 8 days occur from the symptomsâ€™ onset to the respiratory syndrome, leading to exacerbation until 14 days from the onset. Blood cell counts in peripheral blood is normal or slightly low at the beginning, with eventual lymphopenia [

If in the acute pneumonia phase, the immune system is effective, and the patient is not affected by underlying conditions, the virus is suppressed, and recovery occurs. Instead, if the patient is in advanced age, the disease will become severe. Non-survivors were found to exhibit higher neutrophils counts, D-dimer levels, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and inflammatory cytokines than survivors [
