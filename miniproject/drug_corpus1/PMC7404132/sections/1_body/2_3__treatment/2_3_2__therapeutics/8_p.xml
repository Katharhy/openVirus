<p>Regarding the antiviral activity of Type 1 interferons (IFN-1), their beneficial effects are at an early stage of infection. At a later stage, their administration may worsen the cytokine storm and exacerbate inflammation [
 <xref rid="B59-ijms-21-05145" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Type 1 interferons designate a group of cytokines, including α, β, ε, ω, and κ subtypes secreted by various cell types, especially plasmacytoid dendritic cells upon recognition by pattern recognition receptors (PRR). Since Type 1 interferons play a role in antiviral response and low or delayed IFN response associated with poor outcome, IFN α-β have emerged as potentially effective drugs against CoV2. Type 1 interferons are most often used in combination with other antiviral drugs, such as lopinavir, ritonavir, or ribavirin [

 <xref rid="B60-ijms-21-05145" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], the efficacy and safety of IFN β1b, lopinavir, ritonavir, and ribavirin was assessed in a multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized, phase II trial in adults. Zhou et al. (2020) [
 <xref rid="B61-ijms-21-05145" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] compared 77 adults affected by COVID-19 treated with either nebulized IFN α2b and umifenovir or a combination of both. Treatment with IFN α2b (with or without umifenovir) significantly reduced the duration of detectable virus in the upper respiratory tract and the duration of elevated inflammatory markers. The study had limitations, which are the absence of a control group and the exclusive enrollment of moderate forms of COVID-19. IFN β1a in combination with hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir was effective in reducing disease symptoms at a low dose of 44 μg administered subcutaneously every other day up to 10 days [
