<p>Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been used for prevention and treatment of malaria [
 <xref rid="B63-ijms-21-05145" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. They have immunomodulatory, rather than suppressive, characteristics that were revealed valid in the management of rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus. These drugs apparently act by preventing antigen processing and presentation to the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecules due to increased pH and inhibition of lysosomal activities in antigen presenting cells [
 <xref rid="B64-ijms-21-05145" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. As a consequence, T cell activation is compromised, as well as the expression of costimulatory molecules by T and B lymphocytes and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL1, IL6, TNF) [
 <xref rid="B65-ijms-21-05145" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The drug blocks binding of Toll-like receptor (TLR) and DNA/RNA ligand; therefore, it blocks the TLR signaling cascade and the binding of cytosolic DNA with cGAMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphateâ€“adenosine monophosphate) synthase, thus inhibiting cytokines secretion [

 <xref rid="B70-ijms-21-05145" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Furthermore, evidence is provided for chloroquine-wide antiviral activities; the drug indeed increased endosomal pH requested for virus/cell fusion and interfered with the glycosylation of cellular receptors for SARS-CoV [

 <xref rid="B70-ijms-21-05145" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. A number of clinical trials conducted in China demonstrated apparent efficacy and acceptable safety of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 associated pneumonia [
 <xref rid="B70-ijms-21-05145" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Regarding potential side effects, CQ and HCQ are not immunosuppressant; therefore, they are not without risk of infectious complications. Both can produce gastrointestinal side effects of vomiting and diarrhea. Long-term treatment with CQ and HCQ can produce retinopathy and cardiomyopathy [
 <xref rid="B71-ijms-21-05145" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. HCQ has a lower level of tissue accumulation; therefore, its usage is associated with lower adverse effects [
