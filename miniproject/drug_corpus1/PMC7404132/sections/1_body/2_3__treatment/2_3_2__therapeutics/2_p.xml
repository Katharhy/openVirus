<p>To date, there is a full spectrum of potential drugs for COVID-19 infections that affects virus binding or enzymatic activities involved in viral replication and transcription. Essential viral proteins may be target of small molecule inhibitors i.e., helicase, proteases, inhibitors of host cell proteases, and endocytosis and fusion core blockers. Furthermore, anti-sense RNA (siRNAs), ribozyme, neutralizing antibodies, mAbs binding host receptor or that affect S1 RBD interaction, antiviral peptides that act on S2, and other natural products can be exploited [
