<p>The future use of mAbs could overcome many drawbacks that are associated with the administration of plasma and intravenous immunoglobulin preparations, as above outlined, especially in terms of specificity, safety, purity, and low risk of transmission from blood-borne pathogens [

We need, however, to underline that in spite of the promising results obtained with mAbs in neutralizing SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections their generation and subsequent large-scale production could be time consuming, laborious, and expensive. This limits their applicability against emerging pathogens, such as SARS-CoV2, in respect to CP transfusion [
