<p>Another possible route of investigation is the safe passive immunization of exposed individuals and patients throughout the use of human single chain antibodies (Hu-scFvs) or humanized nanobodies (single-domain antibodies (sdAb)). These molecules or transbodies directed to CoV intracellular pathways/non-structural proteins can go across the membrane of virally infected cells thus leading to block viral replication and transcription. Transbodies have already being experimented for the treatment of other infections, including those caused by influenza, hepatitis C, Ebola, and Dengue viruses [
