<p id="par0105">Kaplanâ€“Meier curves were used to estimate the probability of in-hospital death. The time-to event was calculated from the date of hospital admission to the date of death or last day of hospitalisation or to June 17th, whichever occurred first. We evaluated the possible association between burden of comorbidities and time to in-hospital death using 2 Cox-proportional hazard regression models with 2 different definitions of the exposure: age-unadjusted Charlson index (Model 1) or individual comorbidities (Model 2). We also evaluated the possible association of other variables at admission including demographics, period of admission, disease severity; CRP, 
 <sc>d</sc>-dimer; use of anti-Covid-19 drug combinations. A sensitivity analysis in the patients undergoing mechanical ventilation was performed.
