<p id="par0235">In conclusion, we showed a high rate of in-hospital death in patients with COVID-19 disease in a University hospital in Milan, the first European city to be overwhelmed by the epidemic of SARS CoV-2 infection in Europe. The severity of disease at presentation, the advanced age of patients, the level of inflammation, and the presence of comorbidities, together with the small number of ICU beds are the most likely explanations for the outcome observed. These findings may be useful to better allocate resources of the national healthcare systems, in case of re-intensification of COVID-19 epidemics.</p>
