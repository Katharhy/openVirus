<p id="par0160">A severe burden of comorbidity as by age unadjusted Charlson index (Model 1) and not individual comorbidities (Model 2) was independently associated with the risk of in-hospital death (
 <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> ). A number of other variables were independently associated with risk of time to in-hospital death: age, with every 10 years older showing 53% higher risk (AHR 1.53, 95% CI: 1.32–1.78); CRP &gt;60 mg/dL (AHR 2.14,95% CI:1.49–3.08); 
 <sc>d</sc>-dimer &gt;1000 ng/mL (AHR 1.67; 95% CI:1.12–2.46), severe and critical COVID-19 disease at presentation (AHR: 1.77, 95%CI: 1.24–2.53 and AHR 5.27, 95% CI: 2.82–9.85); finally, the use of most of the drugs combinations was associated with reduced risk of in-hospital death (
 <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, Model 1). Data were similar when individual comorbidities replaced Charlson index in the model (
