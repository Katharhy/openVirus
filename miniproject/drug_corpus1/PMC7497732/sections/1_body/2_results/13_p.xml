<p id="par0175">We then studied the dynamics of COVID-19 disease, by investigating patients admitted and disease severity in the 2-week time frames. We observed a first peak of deaths in patients hospitalised in the 2nd–3rd week of March (36.5%), and a second one in the last two weeks of April (32.5%). While during the first peak most of the patients presented with severe disease (55.4%) but only 13% were older than 79, during the second peak the disease was less frequently severe (35%) but more than half of the patients (55%) were aged ≥80 and 30% acquired the infection in long-term facilities residency (
