<p id="Par22">In the present study, we identified 27 highly related clusters within the CRF55_01B outbreak, including two large clusters detected among MSM and heterosexual men and women in Guangdong (Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). Among the 27 highly related clusters, 22 included sequences from a single province (19 from Guangdong and 3 from Hebei). These clusters ranged in size from 2 to 15 sequences, and included sequences from persons with MSM and heterosexual risk. The other 5 clusters included sequences from two provinces (e.g. Guangdong and Hebei/Shanghai) exclusively from persons with MSM risk. These clusters ranged in size from 2 to 3 sequences. We acknowledge that large clusters are theoretically more likely to include sequences from multiple origins and that these larger clusters may have been identified because of a more intense sampling in a specific region or during a specific period. These results supported a complex scenario of CRF55_01B that was introduced into epidemiologically linked, high-risk groups in China. Such knowledge can be used to help identify new outbreaks of HIV or specific CRFs in near real-time. Since HIV-1 CRF55_01B is primarily exclusive to China, sequences that did not cluster likely represent missed links from inadequate sampling, which is an issue for all molecular epidemiology studies using real world data. Sequences without these links could not be assessed for their origin, therefore we cannot exclude that the possibility that sampling depth hindered our network inferences. Further deep and wide sampling might reveal the presence of additional CRF55_01B clusters. As more sequences are characterized within other provinces of China, more local, regional, and national clusters are likely to emerge, presenting a challenge to HIV control.
