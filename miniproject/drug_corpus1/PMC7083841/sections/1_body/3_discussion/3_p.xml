<p id="Par21">Our phylogeographic reconstruction for this data set demonstrated that the origin of CRF55_01B was located among MSM in Guangdong between April 2000 and April 2005 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). However, we found that Guangdong was the most important hub of dissemination of CRF55_01B outbreak, fueling the origin of new local epidemics in Shanghai and other provinces (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). We also identified one bidirectional transition event between Shanghai and Guangdong. These results indicate the complex spatial dynamics of CRF55_01B.
