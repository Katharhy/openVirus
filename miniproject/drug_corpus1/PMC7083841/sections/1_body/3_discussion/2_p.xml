<p id="Par20">Coalescent-based demographic inference revealed a rapidly increasing population size for CRF55_01B from initial phase during 2005–2010, consistent with the outbreak during this period of time. However, we also detected a subsequent phase of rapid declining population size during 2011–2013 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Furthermore, we found that province was indeed having a significant influence on the complex transmission dynamics of CRF55_01B (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Phylogeny of CRF55_01B was more likely structured by discrete geographic location traits, especially for Guangdong and Hebei provinces. However, phylogeny of CRF55_01B did not structure by risk group traits, especially for MSM and Hetero risk groups, indicating that MSM and Hetero were mixing with each other (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). This may be explained by that many men in China who reported heterosexual exposure were actually bisexual with ongoing risk exposures to men and women, but they did not report their male sexual contact due to HIV/AIDS-related stigmatization and discrimination

 </sup>. Our results showed that all sequences from persons of unknown risk clustered within groups who reported MSM risk. This could be because Chinese MSM may not report such risk due to HIV/AIDS-related stigmatization and discrimination.
