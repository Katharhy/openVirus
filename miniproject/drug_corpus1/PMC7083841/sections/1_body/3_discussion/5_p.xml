<p id="Par23">Taken together, our results shed light on the spatial and temporal origins of HIV-1 CRF55_01B, and its mode of spread across comparable geographic areas, and suggest that socio-cultural factors (e.g. HIV/AIDS-related stigmatization and discrimination) should attract enough attention in China and beyond. Peopleâ€™s attitudes and practices concerning HIV/AIDS have an important influence on prevention and control HIV spread. Our results also emphasize the importance of using phylodynamic analyses and transmission networks to provide insights into the role of MSM in the spread of HIV in China. These efforts, combined with epidemiological investigation, are needed to track changes in HIV epidemics. Understanding these epidemic dynamics in real time is increasingly public health importance in terms of guiding prevention efforts.</p>
