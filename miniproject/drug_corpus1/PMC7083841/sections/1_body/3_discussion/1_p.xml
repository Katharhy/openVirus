<p id="Par19">Our evolutionary analyses, based on 209 partial 
 <italic>pol</italic> gene sequences of HIV-1 CRF55_01B that included province of origin and year of sampling, confirmed that this subtype had spread widely within China (Supplementary Table

 </sup>. Our estimates of the evolutionary rate for CRF55_01B was reassuringly consistent across different methods and models. Further, our estimate of the 95% HPD interval of the evolutionary rate for CRF55_01B (1.33 × 10

 <sup>−3</sup>) had a very narrow range and also included in those obtained from previous study

 </sup>. Our estimate of the 95% HPD interval of tMRCA for CRF55_01B (April 2000–April 2005) was overlapping with, but not similar to, the reported estimates from two previously studies, which ranged from February 1996 to June 2004

 </sup> and from June 1996 to January 2004

 </sup>. The uncertainty in our estimate is much smaller than those of previous estimates because of the wider temporal span and more provinces of the samples included in our data set.
