 </sup> to infer transmission network clusters for this data set (e.g. closely related sequences inferring a transmission network). All pairwise distances were calculated and a putative linkage between each pair of two sequences was considered whenever their divergent was â‰¤0.02 substitutions/site (TN93 substitution model). When calculating pairwise genetic distance, all nucleotide ambiguities were resolved and only sequences with less than 0.2% ambiguities were retained. Multiple linkages were then combined into putative transmission clusters. Clusters comprised of only two linked nodes were identified as dyads. This approach detected clusters of recent transmission in which the clustering viruses are genetically similar, implying a direct or indirect epidemiological connection
