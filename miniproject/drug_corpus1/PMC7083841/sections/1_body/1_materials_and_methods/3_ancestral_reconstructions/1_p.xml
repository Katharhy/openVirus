<p id="Par7">We employed a Bayesian phylogenetic method to infer the ancestral discrete traits for this data set. To do this, we modelled two types of traits (e.g. geographic location and risk group) as a diffusion process among discrete states

 </sup> in BEAST v1.8.2

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>. Diffusion among discrete traits was modelled using a non-reversible continuous-time Markov chain
