<p id="Par6">To test the hypothesis that a tip with a province or risk group is more likely to share that discrete-trait with a neighboring adjoining tip than would be expected by chance, we calculated the association index (AI), Fitch parsimony score (PS), and monophyletic clade size (MC) statistics for each discrete-trait using Bayesian Tip-Significance Testing (BaTS) v0.9 beta
