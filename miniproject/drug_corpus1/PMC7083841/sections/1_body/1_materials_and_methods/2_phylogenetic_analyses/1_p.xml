<p id="Par5">To examine the phylogenetic signal for this data set, a likelihood-mapping analysis
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup> was performed using TREE-PUZZLE v5.3.rc16
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>. To evaluate the temporal structure for this data set, we performed root-to-tip genetic distance against year of sampling using TempEst v1.5
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>. We then employed a Bayesian phylogenetic approach to estimate the rate of evolution and the time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) for this data using a GTR + G substitution model with an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed-clock model
