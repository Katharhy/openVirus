<p id="Par10">To identify putative genetic linkage between 2 individuals, we first performed a sensitivity analysis across a plausible range of genetic distance threshold ranging from 0.1% to 2.0%. We found that transmission clusters started to coalesce and the transmission network lost resolution when the genetic distance &gt;0.2% for this data set (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Therefore, we considered individuals as being genetically linked when the genetic distance between HIV-1 CRF55_01B 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences was &lt;0.2%. This allowed us identify 27 clusters that included 98/209 (46.89%) sequences. Clusters ranged in size from 2 to 15 sequences, and 13 (48.15%) had 3 or more sequences (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>; Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). Two clusters included at least 10 sequences, and were considered ‘large’ clusters. Both of the two large clusters included sequences exclusively from Guangdong, ranging in size from 10 to 15 sequences (Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). The largest cluster of 15 sequences included exclusively from MSM. However, the other large cluster of 10 sequences included both from MSM and Hetero, and was a predominantly comprised of sequences from people with ‘Hetero’ risk (Supplementary Fig.
