<p id="Par17">Based on the AI and PS statistics of geographic location and risk group traits, we rejected the null hypothesis with 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). For the MC statistic of geographic location trait, we also rejected the null hypothesis (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), with the exception of the MC (Anhui) and MC (Shanghai) statistics (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). However, for the MC statistic of risk group trait, we accepted the null hypothesis (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Both the transmission network and MC statistic model analyses showed mixed between risk group (e.g. MSM and Hetero).
