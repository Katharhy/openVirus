<p id="Par18">Our phylogeographic analysis revealed that the most probable root location of CRF55_01B ancestor was in Guangdong among MSM in January 2003 (posterior state probability = 1.0) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). Our results also revealed that Guangdong acted as a diffusion center to other provinces (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). After the introduction of the virus from Guangdong to Shanghai, Shanghai acted as a secondary diffusion province. In addition, there were one bidirectional transition event from the Shanghai to Guangdong (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Most viral transitions between epidemiologically linked provinces were from Guangdong to Shanghai (mean estimate 14.81; 95% HPD interval: 11.70–17.67; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). Our results also showed that the estimated of the most posterior probability of all of 12 sequences with unknown risk were grouped into MSM ranging from 0.67 to 0.93.
