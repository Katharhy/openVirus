<p id="Par2">The prevalence of HIV-1 among men who have sex with men (MSM) continues to increase in China, especially in its big cities, like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Shenyang, Shijiazhuang

 </sup>. Interestingly, CRF 55_01B was first reported in 2013 among MSM from Changsha city of Hunan province and Dongguan city of Guangdong province in China and it was composed of CRF01_AE and subtype B
