<p id="Par3">In the present study, we employed state-of-the-art methods to define the spatiotemporal dynamics, transmission networks, geographic origins, and migration patterns of CRF55_01B based on 209 partial 
 <italic>pol</italic> gene sequences of CRF55_01B with known sampling dates (2007â€“2015) and geographic locations (7 provinces) primarily among MSM in China. We also estimated the maximum posterior probability risk group for each sequence with unknown risk, for the first time, to uncover the key socio-cultural factors (e.g. HIV/AIDS-related stigmatization and discrimination) behind it. Our study provides insights into the origin and evolutionary history of CRF55_01B epidemic in China. The methods developed in this study may be critical for designing effective HIV prevention strategies in China and beyond.
