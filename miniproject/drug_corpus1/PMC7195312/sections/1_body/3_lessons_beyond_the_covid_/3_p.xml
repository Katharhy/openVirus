<p id="p0050">We would like to emphasize how in an emerging infectious disease epidemic ophthalmologists may be the first specialists to alert the entire medical society. We have to consider that sometimes the ophthalmologist may be the first specialist to diagnose a still-unknown systemic disease starting from ophthalmological clinical signs. For example, uveitis – characterized by eye pain, red eyes, blurry vision, floaters, and sensitivity to light – may be the first sign of an associated and still-undiagnosed underlying systemic disease. Indeed, uveitis is caused by inflammatory responses of the body and it may be a result of an underlying autoimmune disease, tumors occurring within the eye or in other parts of the body, or infections.</p>
