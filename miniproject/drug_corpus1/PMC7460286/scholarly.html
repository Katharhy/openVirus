Abstract</div> <p>Lately, myriad of novel viruses have emerged causing epidemics such as SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2, leading to high mortality rates worldwide. Thus, these viruses represented a challenging threat to mankind, especially considering the miniscule data available at our disposal regarding these novel viruses. The entire world established coordinative relations in research projects regarding drug and vaccine development on the external range, whereas on the internal range, all countries declared it an emergency case through imposing different restrictions related to their border control, large gatherings, school attendance, and most social activities. Pandemic combating plans prioritized all sectors including normal people, medical staff politicians, and scientists collectively shouldered the burden. Through planning and learning the previous lessons from SARS and MERS, healthcare systems could succeed in combating the viral spread and implications of these new pandemics. Different management strategies including social distance, social awareness and isolation represented successful ways to slow down the spread of the pandemic. Furthermore, pre-preparedness of some countries for emergencies is crucial to minimize the consequences of the crisis.</p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="kwd" title="kwd">

1. Introduction</div> <p>Infectious diseases of new emerging pathogens or recurrent known ones lead to deaths among both human and animal populations. Infections can be transferred directly from human to human by respiratory droplets (i.e., measles), via flies (i.e., trypanosomiasis), or mosquitos (i.e., malaria), body secretions (i.e., chlamydia), or contamination via food or water (i.e., cholera) [<a href="#B1-ijerph-17-05813">1</a>]. Some of the most devastating infectious diseases are brought about by viruses, including influenza, measles, and West Nile fever; furthermore, bacteria cause anthrax, salmonellosis, chlamydia, and cholera, and protozoa can cause malaria and trypanosomiasis.</p> <p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) are serious pathogens to humans and vertebrates affecting the hepatic, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and central nervous systems [<a href="#B2-ijerph-17-05813">2</a>]. Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae subfamily of the Nidovirales family. This subfamily is comprised of four genera: Î±-coronaviruses, Î²-coronaviruses, Î³-coronaviruses, and Î´-coronaviruses [<a href="#B3-ijerph-17-05813">3</a>]. Various CoVs exhibit broad host ranges and tropism of tissue. Mammals typically get infected by Î±- and Î²-coronaviruses, whereas Î³- and Î´-coronaviruses typically affect birds and fish but only occasionally mammals [<a href="#B4-ijerph-17-05813">4</a>]. The world has witnessed a series of coronavirus waves during the past two decades, triggering pandemics that have their perturbations on global health. The first one, named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), had its last outbreak reported in September 2003 after infecting more than 8000 persons and causing 774 deaths with a fatality rate of 9.5 percent [<a href="#B5-ijerph-17-05813">5</a>]. Nine years later, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) triggered a respiratory disease in the Middle East. Even so; MERS-CoV is still ongoing compared to SARS-CoV, and the fatality rate was much higher (about 35%). Since December 2019 a third one called COVID-19 has emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province in China. COVID-19 is widely dispersed in humans and its genome is detached from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. China classified COVID-19 as a B-infectious disease according to the surveillance system of infectious diseases, which was updated in 2004, and categorized infectious diseases into classes A, B, and C [<a href="#B6-ijerph-17-05813">6</a>]. Class A is highly infectious and causes massive epidemics within very short timespans, and includes plaque and cholera only. B-infectious diseases might cause epidemics and include acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), viral hepatitis, poliomyelitis, highly pathogenic avian influenza, epidemic hemorrhagic fever, measles, epidemic encephalitis B, rabies, anthrax, bacillary and amebic dysentery, dengue fever, epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, pertussis, diphtheria, neonatal tetanus, scarlet fever, brucellosis, gonorrhea, syphilis, leptospirosis, schistosomiasis, malaria, influenza A (H1N1), and typhoid fever. Class C involves less serious and fewer infectious diseases such as rubella, leprosy, mumps, leishmaniasis, and acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis [<a href="#B7-ijerph-17-05813">7</a>]. The new COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has prevailed rapidly and infected around 17 million individuals worldwide (July 31, 2020) [<a href="#B8-ijerph-17-05813">8</a>]. The basic reproduction or transmission number (R0 value) was estimated to be between 2 and 3.5, meaning that one patient can transfer the disease to 2 or 3 other individuals with a fatality rate of about 2 to 3%. SARS-CoV-2 caused many more deaths than its coronaviral relatives, while the mortality rates are considerably lower than MERS-CoV infections. The largest contributing factor towards enabling the control of MERS-CoV is the a low basic reproduction number (R0 around 1), indicating that each person transmits it to just one other individual (SARS-CoV R0 was around 4) [<a href="#B9-ijerph-17-05813">9</a>]. The COVID-19 pandemic has posed an eminent threat to many countries. China took into consideration the surveillance role to control and manage epidemics. These rules include: Illustrating the natural history of pathogens, identifying case spread, initiating disease control measures, tracking infection epidemics, forecasting and preventing epidemics, and providing bases for strategy adaptation. Despite the measures, this epidemic caused health (<a href="#ijerph-17-05813-f001">Figure 1</a> and <a href="#ijerph-17-05813-f002">Figure 2</a>) [<a href="#B10-ijerph-17-05813">10</a>] and economic losses and led to isolation among the countries of the world and between peoples inside the same state. In response to that crisis, there is an urgent requirement to figure out different impacts of COVID-19 to public health.</p> <p>Our review aims to evaluate strategies of the most affected countries from different continents all over the world (China, Italy, Germany, France, Spain, America, Canada, Brazil, UK, India, Japan, Singapore, Iran, Korea, and Australia) for confronting the epidemic as it explains the best practices that could help other countries to overcome current or any upcoming pandemic.</p> </div> <div class="2.publichealthresponsestocovid-19" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
2. Public Health Responses to COVID-19</div> <p>Most countries were forced to announce emergency measures to protect vulnerable people and block ways of transmission due to the continuous increase in confirmed cases by time as reported in <a href="#ijerph-17-05813-f003">Figure 3</a> [<a href="#B11-ijerph-17-05813">11</a>,<a href="#B12-ijerph-17-05813">12</a>,<a href="#B13-ijerph-17-05813">13</a>,<a href="#B14-ijerph-17-05813">14</a>,<a href="#B15-ijerph-17-05813">15</a>,<a href="#B16-ijerph-17-05813">16</a>]. With regard to this escalating situation, governments have begun to develop strategies to resolve the pandemic cooperatively with international health agencies, i.e., Centers of Disease Control (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) that declared many precautions based on previous lessons from MERS and SARS diseases, as will be outlined in this section.</p> <div class="2.1.chineseresponse" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
2.1. Chinese Response</div> <p>The Chinese Lunar New Year holiday, which synchronized with the outbreak of COVID-19, is the most celebrative time of year in China. Usually, a large global migration takes place, as individuals travel back to their homes. Around five million people had left Wuhan [<a href="#B17-ijerph-17-05813">17</a>]. Around a third of those people travelled outside the province of Hubei. Restricting peopleâ€™s social contacts was critical to COVID-19 regulation. Key elements of such social distancing initiatives included that the Chinese government promoted people to stay home, dissuaded mass gathering, postponed or cancelled major events, and closed universities, factories, museums, libraries, schools, and governmental offices. Chinese people began to take steps to shield themselves from COVID-19, i.e., wearing protective masks, if they had to commute in public. Social distancing has been successful in limiting human to human transmission and cutting morbidity and mortality. More stringent steps are introduced such as isolation and quarantine. The Lunar New Year holiday was expanded by Chinese government. The holiday deadline was shifted to 10 March for Hubei province and 9 Feb for other provinces, so that the holiday duration was long enough to cover the alleged COVID-19 incubation time. Diagnosed people were segregated in hospitals. In Wuhan, in which a large number of infected people resided, people with mild or asymptomatic infections were quarantined at shelters called <i>Fang Cang</i> hospitals, which were public open areas, i.e., stadiums and convention centers that had been retooled for medical treatment. The Chinese government promoted and funded grassroots screening for contact tracking and early detection and encouraged hand-washing and surface sanitization. Home-based quarantine of people who were at the epicenters of epidemic and travelled to other places in China to curb the spread of virus to boarder populations.

The government declared a state of emergency lockdown that began in Northern Italy and spread throughout the world. The fatality rate (7.2) was much higher than that of China (3.8). All Italian regions were known as â€œred zonesâ€� with extreme limits imposed on every public event. Italy responded to the situation with screening even for those without symptoms. Italy faced a persistent shortage of health care staff. The government announced a proposal to recruit 20,000 new doctors, nurses, and health workers to meet demand. Retired doctors and students who had finished their medical degree and are in the final year of specialist training, were called upon [<a href="#B19-ijerph-17-05813">19</a>]. Coordinated intensive care units were equipped for COVID-19 positive patients. Continuous training for health care staff was crucial with applying dedicated protocols and full isolation [<a href="#B20-ijerph-17-05813">20</a>]. The rules initially laid down approximately one month for schoolsâ€™ closures and restrictions on peopleâ€™s right to leave homes and two weeks for the suspension of business activities. The Italian government proposed an extension of lockdown steps [<a href="#B21-ijerph-17-05813">21</a>]. To curb viral transmission, air travels were banned from China and Italian passengers were quarantined in China. Suspected cases were moved to pre-defined hospitals where the check for SARS-CoV-2 was available and infectious disease divisions were willing to isolate confirmed cases. Emergency Medical System of Milan Metropolitan area formed COVID-19 response team with main goal of resolving the viral pandemic without encumbering regular Emergency Medical System activities. The response team examined the health and clinical conditions of persons being screened to evaluate the need for hospitalization or home testing and subsequent isolation. This response team designed algorithm to identify COVID-19 suspected cases.

President Macron clarified that only collective national campaign can prevent the spread of infection, restrict deaths, and avoid the submergence of health service. French PIP aimed to alleviate pandemic by minimizing the number of civilian casualties and preserving machinations in particular economic activities. PIP included 4 stages: The 1st stage was to impede the introduction of outbreak to the world, 2nd stage to restrict viral growth and distribution in France, 3rd stage to attenuate the potential outbreak to minimum and 4th stage was returning to normalcy. First reported cases were Chinese nationals visiting France, so steps were rapidly taken to keep these cases in isolation. Contact tracing was held to identify people at risk of infection. The government cancelled all sporting events and schools were also closed. Authorities have repeatedly pronounced individual habits and requested protective masks for those who show signs of infections and for health workers so, public and private sectors were mustered to produce masks and disinfectants. To prevent viral transmission, France pressured the European Union to close the Schengen Treaty zone for all non-European citizens.

He assured the importance of application of distance learning as much as possible to slow down viral spread. They reduced non-essential work to conserve support to different sectors including the vulnerable categories, the elderly, families with the lowest resources, and small business owners. Their strategy included increasing the awareness that each person in the community has a role in combating the virus; elderly people receive intensive care and the young follow the safety measures and social distancing.

On 22 January 2020, the health surveillance secretariat together with the ministry of health activated an emergency health operation center with low alerting level, which was raised later on 27 January when the first suspected corona virus case appeared. National Contingency Plan (NCP) for the COVID-19 and guidelines; based on information received from WHO were announced to be applied in all states. Quarantine law was imposed for protecting people. Isolation and exceptional restrictions on travelling was applied even before the appearance of the first case.</p> <p>Currently, there is a rapid growth in cases in Brazil; 3904 cases and 114 deaths were registered only one month after the first confirmed case [<a href="#B30-ijerph-17-05813">30</a>]. Trials to reduce cases were implemented and huge attention was paid towards availability of intensive care units (ICUs), diagnostic tests and ventilators needed for patients with COVID-19 [<a href="#B30-ijerph-17-05813">30</a>]. Brazil suffered from political flounder, which constituted distraction in the middle of crisis. The government restricted the use of RT-PCR examinations to people with more severe symptoms leading to higher mortality rates. This was due to high cost of materials and shortage in qualified people and labs able to do the RT-PCR test and the needed transportation for samples to places, where tests are performed. Thus, people with mild symptoms or the asymptomatic caused the transmission of infection.</p> <p>Dense populations on favelas made it impossible to follow the social distance. Moreover, illegal mining and logging in Amazon forests may have brought infections to remote areas. Scientific organizations, such as the Brazilian Academy of Sciences opposed Bolsonaro due to the decreased science budget, general security, and shortage of public services.

Any confirmed cases of COVID-19 should be moved to an airborne high impact infectious disease center such as the two major centers in England (Royal Free Hospital in London and Newcastle Royal Victoria Infirmary). U.K. Chief Medical Officers told individuals who had toured Wuhan or Hubei Province over the past 14 days to stay at home and call National Health Service number 111.

A huge budget of about US $2.1 billion was endowed for health sector to combat COVID-19. The Department of Science and Technology, Government of India tried to promote research in university institutes and started working in various directions to control the virus during the countryâ€™s lockdown. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) launched private labs with suitable safety regulations to test COVID-19 samples. ICMR reported that about 579,957 tests (as of 25 April 2020) were performed in India. Blood plasma therapy using the plasma of recovered patients with immunity against COVID-19 was applied to infected individuals.

Therefore, a multi-ministerial task force was established to provide central leadership for all government crisis management, before Singapore had its first COVID-19 incident. An intensified surveillance system was developed to monitor COVID-19 cases between hospital and primary care pneumonia patients. To promote this system, COVID-19 RT-PCR laboratory tests were rapidly expanded to all Singapore hospitals with 2200 tests per day for 5.7 million persons. Suspected and confirmed cases were isolated in hospitals immediately to avoid further transmission. Contact tracing was also started to determine their past locomotion before isolation to identify potential sources of infections. More than 800 Public Health Preparedness Clinics has been set up to facilitate the control of primary care of respiratory diseases. Incoming travelers were subjected to temperature and health checks at all airports and suspicious cases sent immediately to hospitals. Singaporeâ€™s community approach focused on social responsibilities while precautionary life kept going as usual. Social education was a key empowerment strategy and carried out through print, broadcast, and social media. Workers are empowered to continuously monitoring temperature and health and organizations are motivated to step forward their business plans. Schools remained opened with precautions.

2.15. Australian Response</div> <p>Australia built its response to COVID-19 on the basis of its powerful healthcare system. Australia realized that people involved in primary care, elderly care, home care, and disability care need the same degree of support and safety as people working in hospitals in attempt to preserve both public and vital health care system to sustain the workplace of services. Good, coherent contact with the primary care staff and general public was very critical for the needed steps. Borders were shut down, non-essential facilities were closed, precautionary measures were in the places with infection risk, stringent social distancing were enforced together with quarantining of individuals with suspected infection or confirmed infection. The prime minister of Australia stated the implementation of the novel coronavirus emergency response program for Australian medical sector. The four strategic goals of the targeted plan were: protecting people from COVID-19 effects, maintain health care functional capacity, facilitate the most appropriate treatment of people with symptoms, manage, and control personal protective equipment. The Australian government introduced 2.4 billion primary care packages to safeguard all Australians. Primary care approach has main components: Telemedicine services, online infection control training provided to all caregivers, institution of general practice-led primary healthcare respiratory clinics (200 clinic) to transfer affected people away from other general practices [<a href="#B51-ijerph-17-05813">51</a>]. Most governmental strategies are summarized in <a href="#ijerph-17-05813-f004">Figure 4</a>.</p> <p>Collectively, demographic diversity, standard of living of each countryâ€™s citizens, political state and health systems in addition to other factors led to various strategies being implemented across the globe trying to cope with the crisis. However, the collaboration and sharing of responsibility for controlling the pandemic through exchange of information between countries was the most important step. Taken together, countries facing COVID-19 or any other pandemic should consider control or closure periods and whether required or compulsory closure of unneeded workplaces and public entities as a first line of social distance measures can reduce transmission rate. The closure times should be adapted to the unique characteristics of the novel disease, i.e., the incubation duration and transmission routes, and the nature of these outbreaks. The main purpose of the pandemic control closure phase is to avoid the spread of disease by people with asymptomatic infections. Governments should use closure times to optimize effect, promotions, group screening, active communication, monitoring, isolation, and quarantine. Some countries have promoted their peopleâ€™s consciousness across many channels, e.g., television, newspapers, and conferences. They have been resorting to the use of more modern health and education technologies i.e., E-learning and telemedicine to reduce the urge to go outside. Such a hybrid strategy is also backed up by analyses of responses to previous pandemics, which have shown that average attack rate reductions were more noticeable if social distance policies and other disease prevention steps were combined to prevent transmission.</p> </div> </div> <div class="conclusions" title="conclusions"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
3. Conclusions</div> <p>SARS-Cov-2 spreads at an astonishing speed across the globe. On 30 January 2020, WHO announced the outbreak of COVID-19 an international public health emergency which impacted 77 countries (status: 4 March 2020) [<a href="#B52-ijerph-17-05813">52</a>]. The speed and extent of pandemic detection, particularly early diagnosis and notification of new cases, is an important measure to monitor this infectious disease. Countries that have previous experience with viral infectious diseases (most commonly SARS), powerful primary care systems with helpful infrastructures, guidance rules and instructions, and community awareness with social responsibilities prove to be more effective in controlling the spread of infection and reducing its deleterious impacts. Numerous countries endeavor to construct an info-structure of national digital health in order to improve disease surveillance and link public health and clinical intelligence programs. Clear and open contact between governments and healthcare staff would be pivotal. It was the time for hospitals or agencies that engage in healthcare delivery to audit its protocols and consumables for all selected patients. Heads of State, global health leaders, private sector partners, and other stakeholders have accelerated global partnership to speed up the production of COVID-19 diagnostic and preventive tools. All governments should prepare the public for a second wave or another outbreak. National policy discussions about the future of the respective society should be initiated. COVID-19 is a tragedy for us all collectively, but it is also an opportunity to ask ourselves what kind of society we want after the pandemic fades away.</p> </div> </div> <div class="back" title="back"> <div class="ack" title="ack"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
