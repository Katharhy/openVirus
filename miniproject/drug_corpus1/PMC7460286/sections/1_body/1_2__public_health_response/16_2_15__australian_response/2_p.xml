<p>Collectively, demographic diversity, standard of living of each country’s citizens, political state and health systems in addition to other factors led to various strategies being implemented across the globe trying to cope with the crisis. However, the collaboration and sharing of responsibility for controlling the pandemic through exchange of information between countries was the most important step. Taken together, countries facing COVID-19 or any other pandemic should consider control or closure periods and whether required or compulsory closure of unneeded workplaces and public entities as a first line of social distance measures can reduce transmission rate. The closure times should be adapted to the unique characteristics of the novel disease, i.e., the incubation duration and transmission routes, and the nature of these outbreaks. The main purpose of the pandemic control closure phase is to avoid the spread of disease by people with asymptomatic infections. Governments should use closure times to optimize effect, promotions, group screening, active communication, monitoring, isolation, and quarantine. Some countries have promoted their people’s consciousness across many channels, e.g., television, newspapers, and conferences. They have been resorting to the use of more modern health and education technologies i.e., E-learning and telemedicine to reduce the urge to go outside. Such a hybrid strategy is also backed up by analyses of responses to previous pandemics, which have shown that average attack rate reductions were more noticeable if social distance policies and other disease prevention steps were combined to prevent transmission.</p>
