  <p>Machine learning analysis of COVID-19 dynamics. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Protein unfolding prediction. The first step is a multiple sequence alignment that compares a protein’s sequence with a similar one, suggesting a close location in the folded protein. The neural network learns to accurately predict the distance by training on precisely measured distances in proteins. In parallel, another neural network is trained to predict the angles of the joints in the folded protein chain. Finally, gradient descent is used to find a physically possible folding of a protein; (
   <bold>b</bold>) A deep-learning framework on a CT scan. First, the lung region is extracted using a segmentation method. Then, the corresponding image of the lung region is passed onto the deep-learning model that predicts the risk value based on the CT scan; (
   <bold>c</bold>) Machine Learning pipeline for patient risk forecasting; (
   <bold>d</bold>) Pandemic forecasting using machine learning under various quarantine rules. The model predicted the infected case count of the US with quarantine control and the exponential increase of cases if there were no quarantine measures. It also shows predicted case counts under various quarantine measures, as implemented in Wuhan, Italy, and South Korea. All of them led to a plateau of cases sooner than the US model; (
   <bold>e</bold>) COVID Scholar website for scientific article search. Searching for the term “rapid test” gives all journal articles related to the term. This can be further filtered depending on the year, the type of document, whether they were peer-reviewed, and whether they are specific to COVID-19.
