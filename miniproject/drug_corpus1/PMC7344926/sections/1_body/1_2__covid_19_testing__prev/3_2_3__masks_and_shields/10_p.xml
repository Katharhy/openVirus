<p>Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) and Emory University worked together to design a DIY shield frame that can be mass-produced using injection molding (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="diagnostics-10-00409-f003">Figure 3</xref>j). The Georgia Tech team produced up to 2000 rigid frames per day, 3000 rigid shields per day, and 3000 disposable shields per day for hospitals all around Atlanta [

Additionally, The Project Manus team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed a single-sheet, disposable face-shield design that can be mass-produced using die-cutting (

The Project Manus team produced 50,000 shields per day to be shipped out to hospitals where healthcare professionals can easily store and assemble the disposable face shields. Teams at the University of Cambridge and the University of Queensland have also designed HappyShield, which is a curved-crease origami face-shield for infection control [
