<p>However, using PPE that fails to comply with the FDA, NIOSH, and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)-approved tools poses a threat to the health of healthcare and essential workers. To best filter aerosols and droplets, the FDA requires masks to pass the ASTM F 1862 fluid resistance test, the ASTM F 1215-89 particle challenge study, ASTM F2101-01 bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE), Mil- M369454C breathability, and CPSC CS-191-53 flammability [

The FDA cautions about the dangers of using 3D-printed PPE, and specifically 3D-printed masks and respirators, because while the PPE may provide a physical barrier, it might not be able to safely provide fluid resistance, bacterial filtration, and breathability. Moreover, 3D-printed PPE may not be face-fitting or function as properly as those manufactured by a medical company. Open-source 3D models from the same STL file, in theory, produce the same device, but in reality, these 3D files can result in an unexpected variation in the product, due to differences in g-code variables when translated across different devices. Likewise, different 3D printers have different thermoplastic filaments that vary in composition and properties. 3D-printed PPE can pose a possible threat if the filament is prone to retaining moisture in the environment, which can inadvertently transmit virus particles [
