<p>Masks for COVID-19 Management: N95 masks (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="diagnostics-10-00409-f003">Figure 3</xref>a) were the first form of PPE to be at risk of running out in hospitals because of their ability to filter out at least 95% of airborne non-oil aerosols and smaller particle aerosols. These masks, made by the 3M Company, were approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and, when worn properly, are face-fitting to reduce the wearerâ€™s chance of inadvertently inhaling virus particles. Naturally, Good Samaritan health centers, communities, and businesses responded to this PPE deficit. These innovators attempted to slow the spread of COVID-19 by modifying the original surgical mask design to mass-producing face shields around the world to develop environmental precautions for safe social distancing to ensue. For example, because surgical masks (
