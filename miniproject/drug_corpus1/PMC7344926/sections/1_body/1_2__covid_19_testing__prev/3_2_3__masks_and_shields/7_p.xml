<p>Most regulations regarding the donation of PPE stem from the Good Samaritan Drug and Medical Supply Donation Act [
 <xref rid="B61-diagnostics-10-00409" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. This law puts into place the basis for donating medical supplies to hospitals and medical professionals. Those who donate medical supplies must be able to describe the conditions under which the equipment was made, so as to ensure medical-grade quality. Importantly, as long as the donator makes sure the medical group is aware of these conditions and does not withhold any information about them, the medical group and any patient may not be able to sue the donator for any injury or loss of life sustained while the donated equipment is being used.
