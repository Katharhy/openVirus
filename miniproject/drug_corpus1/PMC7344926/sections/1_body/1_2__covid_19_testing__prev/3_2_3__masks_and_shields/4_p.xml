<p>High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA)-based air-conditioning filters are also a cause for concern. HEPA filters are effective in filtering particles larger than 0.3 microns that cannot pass through the filter, as well as smaller particles that bounce off other particles and cling to the filter [

HEPA filters would seem to be an adequate solution when an N95 respirator is unavailable, yet the dangers of using HEPA filters for face masks is that glass fibers in masks could be inhaled and cause throat and facial irritation unless the air is filtered properly.
