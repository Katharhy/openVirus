<p>Smartphone-based COVID Monitoring: There are many smartphone applications developed and deployed around the world, with a few of them being supported by the official government in countries like China, Singapore, and India. Different approaches have been taken by different countries; for example, many countries require citizens to enter their personal information and allow location tracking, while others use law enforcement monitoring authorities to automatically track the movement of citizens. Most COVID-19 contact tracing applications use Bluetooth to locate phones nearby that use the same application (

These Bluetooth signals can contain information about the distance between people and the number of times where individuals were close to each other. When a person tests positive, the result is uploaded to the app which then notifies other people who may have been exposed to the virus, based on how close individuals were to the person.
