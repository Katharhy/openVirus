<p>One of the key concerns regarding using a smartphone app for contact tracing is the issue of privacy [
 <xref rid="B110-diagnostics-10-00409" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Individuals are reluctant to share their private information with other individuals, public health professionals, the government, or cell service providers. This issue has been considered and there are a few privacy-sensitive apps, such as TraceTogether [

 <xref rid="B112-diagnostics-10-00409" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>], an app developed by the University of Washington and Microsoft, which uses Bluetooth communications between devices to track contact (

 <xref rid="B113-diagnostics-10-00409" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>], which identifies people who are at risk of COVID-19 infection in an anonymous and location-independent manner by using Bluetooth communication between cell phones in proximity. While the technology has been tested at the laboratory, large-scale use has yet to be implemented. A major initiative in this area is the Google and Apple contact tracing project which combines Bluetooth Low Energy technology with privacy-preserving cryptography to create an exposure notification system. Being a collaborative effort between Google and Apple, the Exposure Notification application programming interface (API) works across both Android and iOS devices. Using the API, app developers working on behalf of public health authorities can build applications for smartphones according to their specifications. In the future, there will be an integration of this system with Google’s Android and Apple’s iOS operating systems to rely less on apps.
