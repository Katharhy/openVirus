<p>Online Search Method for COVID-19 Tracking: Another method of digitally monitoring the spread of the disease involves studying online search behavior [
 <xref rid="B114-diagnostics-10-00409" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. A study by researchers from University College London, in collaboration with Public Health England, Microsoft Research, and Harvard Medical School, uses machine learning to track COVID-19 by using keywords from Google search queries and COVID-19-related news coverage daily. Google search data is collected from the Google Health Trends API. It includes queries about COVID-19-related symptoms, as identified by the NHS FF100 survey, and other coronavirus-related terms. Their current model uses online search frequency time-series to predict the prevalence of COVID-19 in a few countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States of America (USA), Australia, Canada, and Italy. This research can help identify potential positive cases who are otherwise not tested and help understand the true extent of community spread.
