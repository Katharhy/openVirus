<p>For the rapid diagnosis of current infection, COVID-19 testing stations use molecular tests to determine the presence of SARS-CoV-2. These tests rely on the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and use PCR (

Under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), many labs can utilize their existing machines for detection, which vary in terms of multiplexing, complexity, throughput, and turnaround times. For example, Genmark’s ePlex Respiratory Pathogen instrument can detect common pathogens in the nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Cobas
 <sup>®</sup> SARS-CoV-2 on the cobas
 <sup>®</sup> 6800 [

 <sup>®</sup> Xpress SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="B40-diagnostics-10-00409" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) give high-volume and automated throughput using the Lightmix
 <sup>®</sup> Kit. While these devices can use specimens other than nasopharyngeal swabs, the Cobas
 <sup>®</sup> 6800 takes 3.5 h and the Xpert
 <sup>®</sup> Xpress SARS-CoV-2 takes 45 min. Currently, Abbott’s ID Now, a rapid molecular in vitro diagnostic test utilizing an isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology, has a COVID-19 feature for testing, which takes less than 13 min [
 <xref rid="B41-diagnostics-10-00409" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A nasopharyngeal, throat, and nasal swab can be used. Although there is considered to be a sensitivity of 90% with these molecular tests, there still stands the risk and repercussions of false-negative tests with these current devices.
