<p>With COVID-19 being considered a respiratory infection, several studies focus on using medical screening lung scans to track the progress of the disease in central healthcare infrastructures. One study in Wuhan, China focused on the progression of COVID-19 in the lungs of 81 patients, and used CT scans to track the progress [

All patients with and without symptoms of the “viral pneumonia” showed abnormal chest CTs, specifically as bilateral, subpleural, ground-glass opacities with air bronchograms, ill-defined margins, and a slight predominance in the lower right lobe. As the patient heals, the patient’s lungs show improvements in the lung lesions. This medical screening was considered to be quicker and more sensitive than the RT-PCR test. A safer way to test for changes in the lungs is via ultrasonography, because the evolution of the disease can be tracked to inform clinical decision-making. Ultrasounds still cannot detect lesions deep within the lung, in which case a CT scan would be needed. However, lung ultrasonography can be the first detection step because it does not use radiation and the detection would be repeatable with lower costs. These techniques should be used to evaluate treatment or as a diagnostic test in conjunction with the molecular tests. CT scans and ultrasounds require trained personnel and enclosed space, making it challenging to consider it as the main diagnostic test.
