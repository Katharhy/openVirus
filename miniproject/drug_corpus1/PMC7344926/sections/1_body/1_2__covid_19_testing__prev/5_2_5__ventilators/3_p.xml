<p>As the demand for low-cost, compact, and sanitary ventilators are rising, teams of engineers from universities and the private sector are making new designs (

 <xref rid="B80-diagnostics-10-00409" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Their design is an adaptation of bag-valve-mask resuscitators, with manual tidal volume adjustment and dual patient usage. A team of both NASA and California Institute of Technology engineers developed a device named the Ventilator Intervention Technology Administered Locally (VITAL) [
 <xref rid="B81-diagnostics-10-00409" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Their device is capable of handling outdoor terrains, and has a device sterilization procedure to sterilize between patients. The device was developed in only 37 days. The low-cost devices are termed “bridge” ventilators or automatic resuscitators that are meant to be used before a critically ill patient is put on a “standard” ventilator (
