<p>The FDA employed the EUA as of 24 March 2020 for ventilators to fast-track new approvals for designs that are not currently legally manufactured (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="diagnostics-10-00409-f004">Figure 4</xref>(b4)). The Act states the FDA will aid in the development and distribution of the newly approved devices. Approval reduces the number of requirements for the device. The Act only approves the ventilators for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, while the EUA is in effect. The FDAâ€™s aid and the global need for ventilators have decreased the cost of manufacturing ventilators and increased the number of new designs. Medtronic already had a compact, lightweight, and portable ventilator that is termed the Puritan Bennett 560. The company plans on introducing the device in the USA under the EUA, and to ramp up production to 25,000 units by the end of the summer. Medtronic, the MIT team, and NASA are all licensing their blueprints for free or at a reduced cost to other manufacturers.
