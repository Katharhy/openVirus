<p>Computational Resources for COVID-19 Simulations: Another set of simulations in the fight against COVID-19 involves running calculations in epidemiology, bioinformatics, and molecular modeling to study the virus’ spread and its dynamics. High-performance computing and distributed computing are a few approaches that have been demonstrated to run experiments that would take months or years to complete on a traditional computing platform at a faster pace. The COVID-19 High-Performance Computing (HPC) Consortium combines the computing capabilities of advanced and powerful computers to allow researchers to run projects related to the disease which require high computing power [

This consortium includes a range of computers from small clusters to supercomputers from the U.S. Department of Energy national laboratories, companies like IBM, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services, federal agencies such as NASA and National Science Foundation (NSF), and various academic institutions, such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Texas at Austin. Currently, there are 36 active projects on topics such as social modeling and forecasting based on epidemiology models, understanding the structure of the virus at the molecular level, analyzing the viral RNA, studying the DNA of the patients infected, and suchlike. As an example of the potential of this approach, using the world’s most powerful supercomputer Summit built by IBM, researchers were able to simulate more than 8000 small-molecule medications and natural product compounds within days and identified 77 compounds that had the potential to bind to the virus’ spike protein [

This project is a crowdsourcing initiative that accepts submissions of designs of potential drugs from chemists and uses machine learning to screen them and select the most promising candidates for synthesis and testing [
