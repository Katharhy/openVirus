<p>COVID-19 Data Collection: Since the outbreak of COVID-19, WHO and most countries around the world have been trying to overcome the disease over the past few months by extensive testing and simulations that predict the degree to which the world would be affected. This is achieved by the data collected by healthcare and government institutions around the world. The simulation models have multiple sources of data that come from the WHO, National Health Commission of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China (NHC), the COVID Tracking Project, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and CDC. Notable websites on pandemic data include 1point3acres, Worldometers.info, and BNO news. COVID-19 is prone to community transmission, and is therefore harder to track and to control its spread. Epidemic curves are often plotted in an attempt to understand the extent of infections and the implications of preventative measures. The CDC suggested that adhering to strict preventative measures would make it possible to flatten the epidemic curve, which is illustrated by a cartoon rendition (

The simulation models are implemented by taking the current level of threat that is posed to society into consideration, as well as the adverseness of the measures that need to be taken. The results of the models are usually analyzed by governing institutions, while implementing appropriate measures such that it minimizes economic and financial distress, as depicted in the flowchart (
