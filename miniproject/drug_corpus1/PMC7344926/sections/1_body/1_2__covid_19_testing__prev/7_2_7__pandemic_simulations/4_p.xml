<p>There are several simplified online simulators available to the general public to experiment with and gain an understanding of the importance of social distancing to minimize the damage caused. The Washington post also simulated a COVID-19 model based on a billiard ball model that conceptualizes many spherical structures that locomote within a bounded rectangular region, of which a rendition is displayed (
