<p>Folding@Home is a distributed computing project based at Washington University in the St. Louis School of Medicine [
 <xref rid="B96-diagnostics-10-00409" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. It focuses on disease research, connecting the unused processing power of laptops and desktop computers around the world to create a virtual supercomputer. This project aims to understand how the spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 works and how therapeutics can be designed to stop it from infecting host cells, using computer simulations to understand the proteinâ€™s folding process, considering the structures obtained from experiments as the starting point. These simulations yield the structures that are otherwise hidden and identify potential sites to act as drug targets. Such a simulation has shown to be useful in the case of the Ebola virus, uncovering a previously unknown structure of the viral protein with a druggable site [

 <xref rid="B98-diagnostics-10-00409" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Unlike Folding@Home which models the nature of protein folding, Rosetta studies only the final protein structure. These projects can help access the structure and function of the proteins in the fight against the virus.
