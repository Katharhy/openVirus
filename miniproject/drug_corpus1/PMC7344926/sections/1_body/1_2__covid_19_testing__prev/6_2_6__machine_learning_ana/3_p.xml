<p>Large-Scale Analysis of COVID-19 CT Scans: From a clinical perspective, ML can be used to detect COVID-19 and predict patient outcomes. Pathogenic laboratory testing is the standard for screening suspected cases, but this process is time-consuming, with significant false-negative results. Therefore, alternative diagnostic methods that are both accurate and rapid to combat the disease using machine learning to support diagnosis from CT scans are needed. This is because of the virus exhibiting radiological signs and image patterns that can be observed in CT scans, but identifying these signs remain difficult and time-consuming, even for radiologists. Therefore, because of the complexity of the imaging data, researchers developed a deep-learning-based model for automatic screening and diagnosis of COVID-19 detection, based on CT chest scans [

The inputs are pre-processed CT pictures from which the model first extracts a region of interest (ROI) before passing it on to a convolutional neural network that classifies each ROI using ensemble methods. Three-dimensional CT volumes can be used to detect COVID-19 and its transmission patterns [

Then, the segmented region is fed into a 3D deep neural network and predicts the infection rate. Taking 3D space information for a weakly-supervised deep-learning model improved the prediction for infection (
