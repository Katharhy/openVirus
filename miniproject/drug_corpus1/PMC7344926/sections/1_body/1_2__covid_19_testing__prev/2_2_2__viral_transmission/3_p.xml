<p>Seasonal COVID-19 Transmission: Concerns have arisen as to whether a second wave of the coronavirus will return and whether the virus is seasonal. As societies start to lift lockdown regulations, social distancing rules must still be followed until the seasonality of the virus is confirmed. Current studies and previous research on SARS-CoV, influenza, and MERS-CoV shows that high temperatures and high humidity decrease the spread and transmission of the virus. For example, SARS is likely to stay on surfaces longer when the temperature is below 38 °C and humidity is below 95% [

This data suggests that COVID-19 is likely to occur during colder seasons, such as fall and winter, and stay longer in colder climates; these studies only show correlations between temperature and humidity as a function of mean viral replication rate (

After determining the presence of SARS-CoV-2 over all seasons, countries will be well-informed and prepared to enforce the necessary regulations.
