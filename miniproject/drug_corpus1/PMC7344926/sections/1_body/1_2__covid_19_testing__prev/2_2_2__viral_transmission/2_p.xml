<p>Masks in COVID-19 Transmission: Individuals have resorted to wearing masks for protection against various viruses, but there is much controversy on whether these masks help. Masks might help keep people with COVID-19 from unknowingly transmitting the virus to others, and even though there is no harm in wearing masks, there is also no clear and significant benefit. When patients were asked to cough without masks, while wearing a disposable surgical mask and again wearing a 100% cotton mask, neither mask meaningfully decreased the viral load coughed onto the Petri dishes [

The virus was found in respiratory droplets in 3 out of 10 samples from participants not wearing masks, and in aerosols in 4 out of 10 samples taken without masks (

There was no detection of any virus in respiratory droplets or aerosols collected from participants wearing face masks that showed a trend toward reduced detection in respiratory droplets with the use of a mask. Thus, surgical masks reduced the droplets of the virus, but not the viral load that gets transmitted. To avoid spreading the virus before individuals experience symptoms, masks should be used in public venues.
