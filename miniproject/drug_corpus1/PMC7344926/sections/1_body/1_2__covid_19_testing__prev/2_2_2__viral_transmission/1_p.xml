<p>COVID-19 Transmission: The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets that are generated by infected individuals during coughing, sneezing, or speaking. While it was initially believed that since these droplets are too heavy to stay in the air, the coronavirus is not airborne. Viruses may be airborne in the form of aerosols, which are fine particles that are able to stay in the air for a sustained amount of time. A recent study on aerosol and surface stability found that SARS-COV-2 was stable for three hours in its aerosol form [

While aerosolized viral particles cannot travel far from an infected patient breathing normally, coughing and sneezing can lead to traveling distances up to an estimated 20 feet [

Once these particles have attached to various surfaces, the length over which these particulates remain viable depends on the material of the surface. Under experimental conditions, it was found that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 had similar stability times. For SARS-CoV-2, the half lifetimes are aerosol (1 h), copper (1 h), cardboard (3 h), stainless steel (5 h), and plastic (7 h).
