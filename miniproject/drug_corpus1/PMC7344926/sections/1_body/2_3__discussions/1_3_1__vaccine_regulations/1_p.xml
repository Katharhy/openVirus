<p>As of now, vaccines are under development to prevent COVID-19 in healthy individuals. A vaccine has an integral role in protecting society and removing current social distancing protocols. Currently, multiple pharmaceutical companies and university labs are working on the creation of the vaccine in collaboration or independently. These partnerships are utilizing existing vaccine technologies that include inactivated viruses, virus-like particles, protein nanoparticles in matrix-M, non-replicating or replicating viral vectors, RNA- or DNA-based vaccines, and protein subunits. Along with researching the platform for the vaccines, different routes of administration are useful in the development of these vaccines. With the four phases of clinical trials necessary for FDA approval, COVID-19 vaccines are projected to be available to the public in 12â€“18 months [
