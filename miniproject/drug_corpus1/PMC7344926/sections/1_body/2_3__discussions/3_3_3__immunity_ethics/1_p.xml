<p>Several countries are considering giving an immunity passport via antibody test results in place of a vaccination certificate to identify which individuals are ready to go back into society. An immunity passport would allow individuals to return to their workplaces and schools, as well as other aspects of daily activities; it could act as the first step in society returning to its status quo. There is a gap in understanding the time frame for which IgG antibodies last, as well as the number of antibodies needed to prevent infection, which would be critical to assigning citizens the immunity passport. Antibody tests still need to have acceptable specificities and sensitivities, as well as optimize false negatives and positives. If an individual is false-positive and gets an immunity passport, then the individual could unknowingly infect others. These passports cannot be given based on self-reporting of COVID-19 either just because a couple of individuals did not get tested. With these current gaps in knowledge, the antibody test field needs to be researched further before an immunity passport becomes an adopted policy.</p>
