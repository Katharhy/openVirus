<p>In addition to hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, Remdesivir (GS-5734) is another drug that is being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19. Remdesivir, as an inhibitor of the viral RNA polymerases, has broad-spectrum activity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and has been identified as a potential candidate for the treatment of COVID-19. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was performed on patients that were hospitalized with COVID-19 and showed the benefits of Remdesivir in improving time to recovery and lowering respiratory tract infection. However, the trial was implemented in restricted locations and during a time of restricted travel. Since safety procedures limit the resources, research staff often monitored the visits remotely [

Although the compassionate treatment program in another preliminary report for evaluating the efficacy of Remdesivir demonstrated 68% of clinical improvement, the results were not comparable to that of the other reports due to the lack of randomized trials. The interpretation of the results is limited by the lack of viral load data collection, a non-uniform duration of therapy, and the small size of the cohort [

Therefore, these preliminary reports can only provide clinicians the option of Remdesivir, and further assessments on the safety and efficacy of Remdesivir and potential combinations with other therapeutic agents are required via randomized, placebo-controlled trials.
