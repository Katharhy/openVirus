<p>Vaccine Development: Another method to eliminate this pandemic is through vaccines that can solve the problem from its roots by protecting healthy individuals from catching and transferring infections. Since the genomic data of the novel SARS-CoV-2 became available in January 2020, there has been an increasing global interest in vaccine development. As of April 2020, there have been 115 vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 worldwide [

Another successful vaccine candidate is Ad5-nCoV from CanSino that is an adenovirus vector encoding for the S protein [
