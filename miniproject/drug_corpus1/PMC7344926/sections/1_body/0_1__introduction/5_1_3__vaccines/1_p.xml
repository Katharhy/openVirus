<p>Drug Repurposing Against COVID-19: Recent drug discovery efforts have repurposed drugs that were previously used for other health conditions to treat COVID-19, and in particular, the combination of anti-malaria drugs, including Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine [

 <xref rid="B11-diagnostics-10-00409" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, these drugs may not be suitable for COVID-19 treatment because of their narrow therapeutic window, such that the difference between the effective dose and the toxic dose is significantly small. Given that there is not enough strong clinical data to support the alleged benefits from these drugs, it can worsen symptoms associated with COVID-19. There have been prior attempts to use antimalarial drugs in controlling other viral infections, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C. For example, the antimalarial drug, ferroquine was proven to be a strong inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus, while another antimalarial drug, chloroquine showed weak efficacy against HIV infection [

Although antimalarial drugs can be effective against a number of viral infections, their response varies for all viruses and conditions. Thereby, more clinical trials are needed to judge the ability of antimalarial drugs in treating COVID-19 patients to further understand the potential benefits and risks of these drugs. For example, the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis recently launched a clinical trial to test the efficacy of the antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine alone and in combination with another drug, the antibiotic azithromycin [
