<p>This paper presents diagnostic and prevention tools to control the novel COVID-19 pandemic. Herein, we discuss the biological basis of the disease progression and transmission routes, along with the historical background of similar viral infections. Similarities and differences between the novel SARS-CoV and other viruses from the coronavirus family are analyzed. Distinct methods by which the virus gets transmitted between carriers are discussed. Strategies to eliminate the current pandemic are analyzed by herd immunity, shield immunity, vaccine development, and proactive screening. An overview of the preventive tools and measures that can decrease the likelihood of the virus transmission are presented to highlight the proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE), including the masks, face shields, gloves, and ventilators. Three-dimensional printing for designing and manufacturing do-it-yourself (DIY) protective tools are discussed to rapidly democratize and deliver health-related equipment and supplies at a low cost. Interdisciplinary approaches are discussed to leverage machine learning, digital monitoring, and statistical simulations for modeling and predicting the spatialâ€“temporal dynamics of COVID-19. Policies that regulate the process of reporting COVID-19 patients, developing vaccines, and categorizing the population based on immunity are investigated. The presented biological, technical, analytical, and regulatory framework will shed light on the strategies to diagnose, prevent, and regulate the impacts of COVID-19.</p>
