<p>Previous studies indicated that some areas in China were moderate endemic areas with HFRS incidences between 5.0 and 30.0 per 100,000 population from 1994 to 1998.

 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In the present study, the key climatic drivers of HFRS transmission were identified by the GAMs, a descriptive analysis of HFRS with a spatiotemporal distribution was explored, and the optimal seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model for predicting HFRS incidences was developed for Anqiu City, a major administrative region in Shandong Providence in East China. The results of this study can help predict the future trends of HFRS to prevent and control HFRS more accurately.
