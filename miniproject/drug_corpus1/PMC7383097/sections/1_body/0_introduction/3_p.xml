<p>Many studies have suggested that epidemic modelling and forecasting can be essential and effective tools to prevent and control HFRS.

 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The development and application of an HFRS incidence forecasting model are effective for improving the understanding of the epidemic characteristics of HFRS and can be helpful for the prevention and control of HFRS. Currently, statistical models used to predict the epidemics of HFRS include linear regression models,

 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> generalized additive models (GAMs),

 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Among those methods, the ARIMA models are the most common and useful method for modelling the temporal dependence structure of the time series of HFRS. The ARIMA models can take into account changing trends, periodic changes, and random disturbances in a time series. In epidemiology, ARIMA models have been successfully used to predict the incidence of tuberculosis,
