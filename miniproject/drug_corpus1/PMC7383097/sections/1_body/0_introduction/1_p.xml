<p>Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is an acute viral syndrome caused by infection with one variety of hantavirus. Hantaviruses are transmitted by rodents and can be exposed to humans through infected urine, droppings, or saliva. Patients with HFRS are mainly treated through supportive therapy, with the management of the patientâ€™s vitals and treatment of secondary infections. A decrease in illness and death from HFRS has been showed with the use of intravenous ribavirin, an antiviral drug. HFRS is a critical infectious disease in developing countries, with major epidemics erupting in eastern Asia.
