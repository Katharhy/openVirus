<p>In mainland China, HFRS remains a serious public health problem, with approximately 20,000â€“50,000 human cases reported annually, approximately 90% of the total cases worldwide.

 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Currently, HFRS is endemic in 28 of the 31 provinces in mainland China, and the highest incidence was reported in the middle and eastern part of China. Shandong Province, a developed coastal province in East China, is one of the most severely affected provinces in China.

 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In order to effectively prevent the spread of HFRS, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) established a surveillance system for HFRS in 2004 and created educational programs for the general public. It is challenging to eliminate HFRS completely because many factors, such as diverse animal reservoirs and climate factors, may influence the control effects.
