<p>Some studies predicted HFRS epidemics using ARIMA models and obtained a basis for targeted prevention and control measures.

However, there was still inconsistency in how to use the ARIMA models and apply them to a particular region, making it difficult for researchers to choose the appropriate model to predict an HFRS epidemic. This inconsistency may be due to the fact that there are many influencing factors, such as immunization, temperature, humidity, elevation, and the local rat species.

 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> This prevents the HFRS prediction model constructed from a particular region from being universal. As a result, a specific prediction model based on the actual data of the region needs to be constructed to predict the epidemics of HFRS in a region accurately.
