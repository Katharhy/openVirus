<p>In our study, the GAMs were fit to further explore how the environmental factors affect HFRS incidence. The analysis results given by the GAMs support an irregular nonlinear association between temperature and HFRS incidence. Yet, a previous study identified a negative association between temperature and HFRS incidence.
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> This may be due to the fact that high temperatures can limit the time available to farmers for outdoor activity and work, thereby reducing the opportunity for contact between people and field mice, one of the most common agricultural pests and a natural vector of hantavirus. Also, some studies have suggested that the breeding rate of rodents is highest at temperatures between 50 and 77°F, which are favorable conditions for outdoor activity and work.
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> However, inconsistent findings have been reported in other studies that indicated a positive association between temperature and the incidence of HFRS.

 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> These discrepancies may be due to different local conditions, such as different rodent compositions, hantavirus serotypes, environments, and climates in the study regions, and also due to the strong assumption on a linear association between temperature and the incidence of HFRS. Our data indicate that precipitation is negatively associated with the incidence of HFRS. This finding is consistent with the findings of two previous studies.

 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Abundant precipitation could harm rodents by destroying their habitats. Furthermore, frequent rainfall may decrease the likelihood of rodent-to-human contact, rodent-to-rodent contact, and virus transmission due to decreased rodent activity and reduced human exposure. However, several previous studies showed inconsistent findings on the positive association between precipitation and HFRS incidence.

 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> There is no clear explanation for such differences, which may reflect the heterogeneity in local climate conditions. Further studies should be conducted in different regions to gain a better understanding of the impact of precipitation on HFRS. The analysis results given by the GAMs show that sunshine time and humidity are positively associated with the monthly numbers of HFRS cases. In addition, the HFRS incidence increases until wind speed increases to a peak at approximately 4.0 m/s, and atmospheric pressure increases to a peak at approximately 1018 hPa, and then decreases. This is consistent with the results in a previous study.
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Our investigation provides practical evidence for the usefulness of GAMs in HFRS prediction, with the optimum predictive climate variables being determined for different regions.
