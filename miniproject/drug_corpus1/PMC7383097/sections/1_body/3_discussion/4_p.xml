<p>The SARIMA models with external covariates are named “SARIMAX” models. It is ideal to analyze the HFRS incidence using the SARIMAX models with flexible nonparametric representations of the covariates.
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> However, we found in the literature the developed SARIMAX models only include the external covariates in a parametric additive linear fashion, and such semiparametric SARIMAX models and their implementation procedures have not been developed.
