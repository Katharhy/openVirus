<p>Our study showed that the incidence of HFRS presented apparent seasonality and that there were two annual peaks in Anqiu City in East China: the smaller peak occurred in spring between April and June, and the larger peak occurred in winter between October and November. Our results support the need to carry out deratization campaigns in spring and winter around the City as well as enhance population immunity by vaccination throughout the year. In addition, we applied a

 </inline-formula> model is reliable with high prediction accuracy and can be used to predict the HFRS incidence in the City in the subsequent year. The prediction results suggested that the HFRS SARIMA model has a strong ability to forecast and predict the incidence of HFRS. Therefore, it is imperative and necessary to learn about the knowledge of HFRS forecasts, which can help health agencies to allocate health resources reasonably.
