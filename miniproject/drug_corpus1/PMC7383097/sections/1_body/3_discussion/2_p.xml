<p>Our study also indicated that HFRS incidence was high from 2000 to 2002 and remained low until in 2012 (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The slight rebound from 2012 may be triggered by the reconstruction and renovation of some areas of the City in recent years, which included the renovation of a large number of houses, destroyed the rodent habitat, and made rats move frequently. These renovations also decreased the quality of the living environments of villagers and increased the chances of coming in contact with hantavirus, which further caused an increase in HFRS incidence. Based on our results, the government can allocate more health resources to high-risk areas and reduce the number of these resources used in low-risk areas to improve the effectiveness of interventions and the allocation of medical resources.
