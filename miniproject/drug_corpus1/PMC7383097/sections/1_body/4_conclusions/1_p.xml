<p>Our study results can provide a quantitative basis for local disease control authorities to identify and potentially mitigate the risks associated with HFRS. This can be achieved by accurately predicting the fluctuation of HFRS with the SARIMA models and analysis approaches presented here. Such prediction can help improve the prevention and control of HFRS.
