<p>In this study, the augmented Dickey-Fuller Unit Root (ADF) test was applied to estimate the stationarity of the time series.

 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> If the time series is not stationary, an appropriate difference can be used to make the series stationary. The Box and Jenkins method was used to construct the SARIMA model in this study.
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The autocorrelation functions (ACF) and partial autocorrelation functions (PACF) of the transformed data were utilized to determine the seasonal and non-seasonal orders and identify an appropriate SARIMA model. The conditional least squares method was applied to estimate the model parameters. In model diagnosis, white-noise test methods were employed to check whether the residuals were independent and normally distributed.
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Several models can be constructed, and the selection of an optimal SARIMA model is necessary. The model selection was conducted based on normalized Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and Ljung-Box Q test. In addition, coefficient of determination (
