<p>Univariate and multivariate generalized additive models (GAMs) with a logarithm link assuming that the HFRS incidence conditionally follows a Poisson distribution were fit to determine on how the meteorological factors affect the monthly HFRS incidence. The meteorological factors utilized in this study included monthly average temperature, precipitation, sunshine time, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and wind speed. Spatial distribution maps were created for the study area across the 18-year study period. All of these analyses were conducted by statistical software SPSS (Version 17.0, SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA) and R (Version 3.6.1, R Core Team, Vienna, Austria). This study conformed to the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of Weifang Medical University (No. 2019SL059). The data in this study were accessed from the Anqiu City Center for Disease Control and Prevention and are freely available upon request.</p>
