<p>A multivariate GAM was fit to data, with the monthly cases of HFRS as the response variable and the meteorological factors, monthly average temperature, precipitation, sunshine time, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and wind speed, as the covariates. 
 <xref rid="T0005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> reports the estimated effects from fitting the multivariate GAM, in terms of effective degrees of freedom (EDFs), reference degrees of freedom (RDFs), chi-square statistics, the corresponding

The analysis results indicate that the six meteorological factors are statistically significant factors to influence the monthly HFRS incidence. Estimated smooth functions of six meteorological factors on monthly HFRS incidence are plotted in

The reported EDFs show that sunshine time is linearly correlated with the HFRS incidence, but the other five meteorological factors are nonlinearly associated with the incidence with the EDFs that are much greater than one. These results also indicate that the HFRS incidence increases as sunshine time and humidity increase and decrease as precipitation increases. In addition, the HFRS incidence increases until wind speed increases to a peak at approximately 4.0 m/s (meters per second), and atmospheric pressure increases to a peak at approximately 1018 hPa (hectopascals), and then decreases.
