<p>To visualize the spatial and temporal variations in the HFRS incidence rates in the study area across the 18-year study period, the annualized average incidence of HFRS per 100,000 population was calculated for each town in the City over the 18-year period. Then, the annualized average incidences for each town were mapped in gradient colors in spatial distributions maps (

 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(A</xref>-
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">R</xref>) show that the annual incidence of HFRS gradually decreased from 2000 to 2006, and the lowest incidence of 1.15 cases per 100,000 population occurred in 2006. Since 2007, the annual incidence of HFRS has increased gradually. 
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(S</xref>) shows the annualized average incidence for 14 towns within the City from 2000 to 2017. The annual average incidence at the town level ranged from 1.68 to 6.31 per 100 000 population.
