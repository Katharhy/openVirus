<p>A total of 794 cases were registered in the study area during the 18-year period. The highest average incidence rate was 15.05 per 100,000 population in 2000, and the lowest average incidence rate was 1.15 per 100,000 population in 2006, with an annual incidence rate of 4.36 per 100,000 population. Among the total cases, 69.50% were male, and 30.50% were female, with a gender ratio (male vs female) of 2.28. Among those patients, about 1.26% were children under 15 years old, 7.05% were older adults over the age of 64 years, and others were between 15 and 64 years of age. Regarding occupation, 1.01% were outdoor workers that include migrant workers and construction workers, 5.67% were students, and farmers accounted for 83.00%. The monthly HFRS cases for the 18 years from 2000 to 2017 are shown in 
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, which indicates that the incidence of HFRS presented apparent seasonal character. There were two high peaks every year, the smaller epidemic peak occurred in spring between March and April, and the larger peak occurred in late fall and early winter between October and November.
