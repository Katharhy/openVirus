<p>Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain influenza triggering arrhythmias, among them severe systemic, arterial, and myocardial inflammatory reaction seems to be one of the most plausible. Moreover, influenza is known to exacerbate congestive heart failure (CHF) and increase CHF‚Äêrelated hospital admissions.

 </xref> Decompensated CHF, besides leading to hospitalization, is related to electrical myocardial homeostasis impairment, causing ventricular tachycardias (VTs) treated with shock or ATP therapy. In patients with underlying ischemic cardiomyopathy, the worsening of ischemia by increased oxygen demand and potential acute coronary syndromes led by influenza can also have a role in the increase of arrhythmic events.
