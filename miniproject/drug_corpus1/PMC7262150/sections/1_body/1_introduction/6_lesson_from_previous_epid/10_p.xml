<p>An interesting survey conducted by Madjid et al tested the possible effect of seasonal influenza on the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias (VA) requiring shock or antitachycardia pacing (ATP) treatment in patients with implantable cardiac defibrillator or cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator. The results indicated that more shocks were delivered during influenza season than during other periods of the year, suggesting a correlation between higher arrhythmia burden and influenza season. The multivariate generalized linear model showed that during high influenza activity, patients were more likely to have a VA treated with shock (odds ratio [OR]: 1.06; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) or ATP (OR: 1.06; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001).
