<p>These concepts were strengthened by a nationwide Denmark studied, which showed a strong relationship between yearly influenza vaccination and mortality in patients with HF. In this study, annual influenza vaccination was associated with 18% reduction in the adjusted risk of all‐cause death and 18% reduction in the adjusted risk of cardiovascular death (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001, for both). Remarkably, those who received more than one seasonal vaccination also had a more pronounced reduction in atrial fibrillation incidence (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.94; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .009). According to this study, influenza infection may result in increased metabolic demand, hypoxia, and adrenergic surges, which may lead to acute decompensation or exacerbation of HF. Additionally, the infection may induce a hypercoagulable state and trigger acute coronary syndromes, resulting in further left ventricular function deterioration, or it could cause direct myocardial depression. Based on these results, the authors advocated that influenza vaccination may be a valuable treatment strategy to improve survival in patients with HF.
