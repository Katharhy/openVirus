 </xref> In a cohort of 121 patients, Yu et al demonstrated that sinus tachycardia was the commonest cardiovascular SARS‐CoV finding with an overall incidence of 72%. Persistent tachycardia mean duration was 12.7 days with a mean heart rate of 117 beats/min (range: 102‐150 beats/min) and the tachycardia remained persistent in nearly 40% of patients within 30 days after hospital discharge. The incidence of tachycardia during the third hospitalization week, when most patients were afebrile, could be related to drug treatment, such corticosteroid and ribavirin. However, corticosteroid therapy was not associated with persistent tachycardia during follow‐up. Hence, longstanding tachycardia could eventually be due to autonomic tone changing. Or, alternatively, sinus tachycardia secondary to cardiopulmonary or peripheral deconditioning since this disease resulted in prolonged bed rest.
