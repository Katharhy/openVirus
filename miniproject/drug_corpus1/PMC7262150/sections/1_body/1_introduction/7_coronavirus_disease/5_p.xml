<p>In a study by Guo et al, 187 patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 positive were analyzed, stratified by the level of troponin, which was elevated in 27.8%. During hospitalization, patients with elevated troponin T (TnT) levels developed more frequently complications as acute respiratory distress syndrome (57.7% vs 11.9%), malignant VAs (11.5% vs 5.2%), acute coagulopathy (65.8% vs 20.0%), and acute kidney injury (36.8% vs 4.7%), compared with those with normal TnT levels. But the most impressive observation is that mortality was markedly higher in patients with elevated plasma TnT levels than in patients with normal TnT levels (59.6% vs 8.9%).
