<p>A study from Shi et al evaluated a single‐center cohort of 416 patients hospitalized due to COVID‐19. He observed that cardiac lesion, defined by hs‐cTnI &gt;99th percentile of on admission, was present in 19.7%, with median value of 0.19 (0.08‐1.12) μg/L in this group. Compared with those without cardiac injury, patients with cardiac injury required more noninvasive ventilation (46.3% vs 3.9%; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and invasive mechanical ventilation (22.0% vs 4.2%; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), and also had a higher mortality (51.2% vs 4.5%; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). It is remarkable that the elevated troponin group was older and significantly more ill, but after adjustment for all the possible confounding factors, still the cardiac injury was a predictor of mortality (HR: 4.26; 95% CI: 1.92‐9.49).
