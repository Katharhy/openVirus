<p>HCQ can also induce QT interval prolongation, an extremely rare but potential fatal side effect, due to the risk of induced polymorphic VT and SCD. The proposed mechanism by which HCQ causes QT interval prolongation is not well understood. In 2015, Capel et al demonstrated, in guinea pig sinoatrial node myocytes, an inhibitory effect of the HCQ on the hyperpolarization‐activated current ion channels (also known as “funny current” channels), along with delayed rectifier potassium currents, and L‐type calcium ion currents.

 </xref> Inhibitory effects on pacemaker cells were shown to cause delayed rates in depolarization leading to decreased heart rates. These findings may correlate with a proposed mechanism by which refractory action potentials in cardiac myocytes may lead to prolongation of QT interval due to delayed depolarization and repolarization from abnormal ion currents.

 </xref> QT prolongation in individual medical therapy is not always predictable, dose adjustments and/or additional monitoring with electrocardiograms may be appropriate in some cases. HCQ proarrhythmic risk must be monitored in patients with underlying cardiovascular or renal disorders, and high caution should be posed in the case of electrolyte imbalance, dysrhythmias or concurrent use of QTc‐prolonging drugs.
