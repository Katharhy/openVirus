<p>In the previous studies, the dosing of CP is highly variable. In clinical trials, one unit of plasma (200 mL) has been planned for use for prophylaxis and one to two units have been planned for treatment. The antibodies' duration of efficacy is unknown but is estimated to last in weeks to a few months.

 </xref> In previous use of CP therapy in SARS, 5 mL/kg of plasma at a titer of 1:160 was used.

 </xref> A quarter or half of the treatment dose was used for prophylactic purposes in earlier studies. According to linear proportionality, 3.125 mL/kg of plasma with a titer of &gt;1:64 would provide an equivalent immunoglobulin level to one‐quarter of 5 mL/kg plasma with a titer of 1:160.
