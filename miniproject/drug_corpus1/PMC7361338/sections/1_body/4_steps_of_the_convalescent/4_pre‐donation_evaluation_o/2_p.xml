<p>Real‐time reverse transcriptase‐PCR (RT‐PCR) is currently a favored assay for the detection of coronavirus. However, RNA detectability was low in samples collected before day‐7 and during days 15‐39. For this reason, coronavirus pre‐donation screening tests should be supported by antibody detecting tests.

 </xref> Each donor must meet all eligibility criteria and be evaluated by all test required for normal blood donation. Female donors with a history of pregnancy should be screened for HLA antibodies to minimize the risk of transfusion‐related acute lung injury (TRALI). In addition, a blood sample should be obtained for antibody testing before referring the donor to an apheresis procedure. Unfortunately, neutralizing antibody assays are not available in most centers. Quantitative assays (eg, ELISA) are available but commercially available assays have not been optimally validated. In addition, the relationship between total anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 antibodies and neutralizing anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 antibodies is not clear. There is also uncertainty as to whether total antibodies or subclasses (eg, IgM, IgG, or IgA) are the optimal measures, and which antigen is most informative.

 </xref> Limited data are currently available on the ELISAs. In a previous study, the efficacy of the antibody test for the detection of IgM and IgG, has shown a sensitivity and specificity of 88.7% and 90.6%, respectively. The antibody titer will differ according to the duration between the collection time and onset of infection. In previous studies, seroconversion has been observed to occur between 8 and 21 days after the onset of symptoms.

 </xref> In a study conducted in 173 patients with COVID‐19, the seroconversion rate for total antibodies (Ab), IgM and IgG was 93.1%, 82.7%, and 64.7%, respectively. The median seroconversion time for total Ab, IgM and then IgG were day‐11, day‐12 and day‐14, separately. The presence of antibodies was &lt;40% within 1‐week since onset but rapidly increased to 100.0% (total Ab), 94.3% (IgM), and 79.8% (IgG) since day‐15 after onset. RNA detectability decreased from 66.7% in samples collected before day‐7 to 45.5% during days 15‐39. The authors suggested that combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of diagnosis for COVID‐19 in the first 1‐week since onset.

 </xref> Currently, the findings that have been reported suggest that CPs that are collected ≥14 days after resolution of symptoms contain high titers of antibodies.

 </xref> According to FDA if testing can be conducted, neutralizing antibody titers should be at least 1:160 but a titer of 1:80 may be considered acceptable if an alternative matched unit is not available.
