<p>CP has been used in the recent global outbreak for the treatment of patients with COVID‐19 in China. In the study conducted by Shen et al, 5 critically ill COVID‐19 patients refractory to steroid and antiviral treatment, received 400 mL CP from 5 different donors. All the donors had SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific ELISA antibody titer higher than 1:1000; and neutralizing antibody titer greater than 40. After CP transfusion; in 4 (80%) of 5 patients, the body temperature normalized within 3 days; the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score decreased, and PaO
 <sub>2</sub>/FiO
 <sub>2</sub> increased within 12 days (range, first 172‐276 and then 284‐366); viral loads decreased and became negative within 12 days; ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers increased. After 12 days, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) improved in 4 patients (80%); after 2 weeks, 3 patients extubated; 3 of the 5 patients (60%) were discharged from the hospital and the other two patients were stable after 37 days.

 </xref> In a recent study, researchers treated 10 critically ill COVID‐19 patients with antiviral therapy and steroid, plus a dose of 200 mL CP that had a neutralized antibody titer of at least 1:640. Researchers prospectively compared symptoms and laboratory findings 3 days after CP infusion. Among all patients, CP was well tolerated. It significantly increased neutralizing antibodies at a high level; within 7 days, viremia disappeared; clinical symptoms resolved rapidly in 3 days. There was an improvement in lymphocyte count and in SaO
 <sub>2</sub>; on radiological examination, they reported that lung lesions changed significantly within 7 days.

 </xref> Although these studies involve a small number of patients, available information suggests that CP administration is safe and reduces the viral load.
