<p>The risks of CP administration are similar to those of standard plasma. Infection with another infectious disease agent (viral transmission or bacterial contamination), immunological reactions such as serum disease, non‐hemolytic transfusion reactions (tremors, fever, urticaria), transfusion‐associated circulatory overload and TRALI can be observed.

 </xref> No serious adverse events have been reported in any study of CP. Two observational studies during the SARS‐CoV‐1 outbreak did not report any complications related to CP.

 </xref> In developed countries, for HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses, the risk of transfusion‐transmissible infection is less than one infection per two million donations.

 </xref> The risk of TRALI is generally less than one for every 5000 transfused units, but in COVID‐19, the risk of TRALI is one of the major concerns about CP because most of the critically ill patients have ARDS and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Both of these situations are risk factors for the development of TRALI.

 </xref> Specific risk about Anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 CP is transfusion‐transmitted SARS‐CoV‐2. This remains theoretical because there has been no report of SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission by blood transfusion. This risk is particularly important in prophylactic use since critically ill patients are already infected. In addition, only 1% of symptomatic patients have been reported to have detectable SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA in their blood.

 </xref> Between January 25 to March 4, 2020; 2430 blood donations were screened in Wuhan and only one (0.04%) donor was found to be positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA. Between December 21 to January 22, 2020; 4995 blood donations were screened and a second (0.02%) donor was found to be positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA.

 </xref> The other theoretical risk of CP is an antibody‐dependent enhancement (ADE). Antibodies that developed during a previous infectious disease caused by a different viral serotype may exacerbate clinical severity.
 <xref rid="jca21806-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">
  <sup>39</sup>
 </xref> Previous infection with other types of coronavirus may arise the concern about the risk of ADE in COVID‐19 and the geographic variation in disease severity may be attributed to this mechanism.

  <sup>40</sup>
 </xref> In the current pandemic, there has been no report about the worsening of the clinical situation that has been attributed to ADE after CP infusion. Similarly, there has been no report about ADE after the use of CP for SARS and MERS. The other theoretical risk of CP is the attenuation of the development of a natural immune response, especially when administered for prophylaxis. CP treatment is recommended only in academic or comprehensive centers that can manage potential treatment‐related complications, such as TRALI.
