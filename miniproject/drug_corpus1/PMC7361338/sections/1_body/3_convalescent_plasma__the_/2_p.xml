<p>The exact mechanism of CP in COVID‐19 has not been clearly identified yet. However, previous studies revealed that the mechanism of action of CP in other viral infections such as Ebola virus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus is mainly viral neutralization. The other mechanisms are antibody‐induced cellular cytotoxicity, complement activation and phagocytosis. Neutralizing antibodies delivered with CP can provide control of the viral load. Non‐neutralizing antibodies may also contribute to prophylaxis and/or enhance recovery.
