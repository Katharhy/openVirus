<p id="par0180">Many in vitro experiments reported anti-coronavirus effects of traditional herbs or natural products and clinical trials on traditional herbal medicine for COVID-19 are currently ongoing. In addition to establishing research evidence, KM community should train and produce public health professionals among KMDs by improving KM college education programs and official participation in public healthcare system should be ensured in terms of regulation and policy. In the post-COVID-19 era, it also should be allowed by regulations for KMDs to utilize newly developed herbal medicine/natural products for viral infectious diseases so that such research and relevant education can be motivated in KM community.</p>
