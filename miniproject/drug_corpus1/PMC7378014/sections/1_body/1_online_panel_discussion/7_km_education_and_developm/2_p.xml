If you look at the definitions of herbal medicine and medicinal herbs, they are mostly of animal, plant, and the mineral origin and then dried, cut and purified in its original form. In practice, there are indeed many mineral-based medicines besides plants and animals such as single element minerals of Gold foil and sulfur. So, the most important thing in the definition of herbal medicine and medicinal herb is that it is defined by the principles of KM. Aside from the ones used in the past, newly discovered or developed ones, whether it be a medicinal herb, an extract, or a single component, if it can be analyzed based on the principles of KM, then it can certainly be used in clinical practice. In other words, are Western herbs, plant-based remedies commonly used in the lay community, medicinal herbs because they are all plants? Not really. It can only be defined as medicinal herb after it has been analyzed in terms of KM on the type, specifications, and dryness or dampness pattern it can be used for. Therefore, the 4 properties and 5 flavors of herbs are present in not only natural products, but all medicines, even the ones chemically synthesized. For example, many herbs such as Olibanum, Myrrha, Styrax, Benzonium, Croci Stigma, Sennae Folium, Panacis Quinquefolii Radix, Rhinoceri Cornu, and Draconis Sanguis are not from China. Some were imported even from Africa to China and are used as medicinal herbs today. New herbs have been established as herbal medicines over time, and similarly, in Korea, various herbs, surely including Western herbs, may be used as herbal medicines.
