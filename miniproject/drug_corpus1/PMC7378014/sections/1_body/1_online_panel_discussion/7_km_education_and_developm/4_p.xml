<p id="par0160">Research on herbal medicine treatment is accomplished by the various efforts of researchers, trained and working in the field of KM, so the findings must be applied in human health for sure, as well as KM clinical practice. Currently, however, various research findings cannot be used in KM clinical practice due to legal or regulatory barriers. For example, Shinbaro tablet (GCSB-5), which was developed by the Jaseng Hospital of KM, cannot be used by KMDs, and only WM doctors are allowed to use it. While it is beneficial for human health, the KM community is facing many difficulties, as the results of KM community's hard work and large investment are not permitted to be applied to the field of KM. For the COVID-19, it is a crucial factor whether KMDs can use research findings in their practice to treat various symptoms of the COVID-19. Therefore, research is essential, but I think legal and regulatory improvements are also necessary.</p>
