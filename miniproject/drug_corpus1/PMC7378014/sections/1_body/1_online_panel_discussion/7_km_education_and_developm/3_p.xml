<p id="par0155">Now on KM education, various courses on infectious diseases should be reinforced. Most importantly, students must realize that the knowledge and training experience acquired through such courses should be part of their work as KMDs in the future so that they are motivated to study hard in colleges. They will study even harder at school and work harder after graduation if these topics are reflected in the national examination. If not, then I think students will not be as persistent or interested, even if the courses are provided.</p>
