 <bold>Lee:</bold> Thank you so much for sharing your valuable experiences and opinions. There were many good comments, and no one expects the answers to be found in this one encounter. The world is rapidly changing amidst many other problems and I think the most critical task is to establish the basis so that we can argue for the role of KM in academics and clinical practice, and of KMDs as healthcare professionals. And as prof. Hahm said, such a task should begin with education. I also believe that although the work in each field is different, the evidence from each area will eventually accumulate to establish the supporting background. There should still be many more discussions in each field, and I hope that even more sound evidence be established through our efforts. Thank you.
