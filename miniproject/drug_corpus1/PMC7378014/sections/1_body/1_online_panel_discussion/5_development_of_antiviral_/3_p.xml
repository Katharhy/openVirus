 <bold>Kwon:</bold> Our team use the human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) strain from the same beta coronavirus genera to investigate the antiviral effects of natural products. These substances are alkaloids from the root of 
 <italic>Stephania tetrandra</italic> S. Moore (Menispermaceae) and other related species. 
 <italic>S. tetrandra</italic> is known for analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects in patients with arthritis and edema.

 </xref> We could confirm the antiviral effect by concentration, using the cell-survival rates and the levels of viral M-protein RNA have decreased post-treatment of 
 <italic>S. tetrandra</italic>. The release of inflammatory cytokines has also decreased post-treatment.
