<p id="par0105">Under these circumstances, let me tell you my opinion on the future direction of the development of a preventive treatment based on KM for novel and mutant virus infections. With regards to KM for prevention and treatment of not only COVID-19 but also new mutant viral infections that may emerge in the future, KM may have potential in increasing herd immunity and vaccine adjuvants for prevention of adverse effects, on the prevention side. On the treatment side, it has the potential for preventing complications, providing immunomodulators that improve resilience and therapeutics for the management of complications. Unlike China, Korea is rarely using KM for infectious disease management. In the future, we should enhance the research infrastructure and our capacity to obtain scientific evidence and quickly reflect it in the clinical practice guideline, to provide information via public promotion, while continuing to request to include KM in the national policy on infectious diseases (
