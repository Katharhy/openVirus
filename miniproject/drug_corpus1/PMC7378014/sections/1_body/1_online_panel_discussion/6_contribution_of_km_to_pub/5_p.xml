 </xref> Thinking back, we need to establish in advance a data collection/utilization system that works even in emergencies.

As the president Moon mentioned in his 3rd inaugural anniversary speech establishing a national research center for infectious diseases, I hope that the KM community can take part in it as well. And lastly, we should continue to explore ways for the KM community to participate in public healthcare and think about our role in it.
