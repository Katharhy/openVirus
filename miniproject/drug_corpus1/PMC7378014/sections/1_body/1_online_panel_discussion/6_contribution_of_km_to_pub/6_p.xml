<p id="par0135">Next, in terms of education, students of colleges of KM are educated and trained in epidemiology and medical statistics, but they are not well-aware of their importance, and thus, engagement is rather limited. I think we should focus on education to emphasize the importance of these subjects and reinforce the utilization plan. Of course, they are already included in the curriculum and taught in colleges, but I think education, related to the public sector, must also be reinforced. Students should fully grasp the characteristics and role of public healthcare in their undergraduate studies, and their sense of commitment to society should be nurtured as well.</p>
