<p id="par0075">Our 2nd paper was published in 2010. There, we reported on our 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments wherein Sophorae radix, Acanthopanacis cortex, Sanguisorbae radix, and Torilis fructus inhibited replication of the coronavirus. Ribavirin is a commonly used drug against RNA viruses. We observed that Sophorae radix, Acanthopanacis cortex, Sanguisorbae radix, and Torilis fructus markedly inhibited replication of the coronavirus as much as ribavirin. In the end, we completed the paper hypothesizing that while Sophorae radix, Acanthopanacis cortex, and Torilis fructus inhibit RNA dependent RNA polymerase replication, Sanguisorbae radix inhibits viral replication by inhibiting not RNA synthesis but later steps of the viral replication.
