<p id="par0070">We evaluated the virus titer wherein the baseline is 100, and a decrease below 10 is considered effective as an antiviral treatment. As you can see, Cimicifuga rhizoma, Meliae cortex, Coptidis rhizoma, and Phellodendron cortex showed values much lower than 10, demonstrating a marked inhibition of viral replication to the point where there was almost no RNA expression. Sophora subprostrata radix also had an antiviral effect (â‰¤10, meaning that it was effective) and we assume that they inhibit RNA basically by inhibiting RNA polymerase, protease, or replication.
