<p id="par0050">Second, I think we need to take this opportunity to change education programs on infectious diseases in the colleges of KM. For one, the proportion of infectious diseases in KM university programs is not high. I hope today's discussion includes directions for some basic research that can provide the basis for KM treatment for infectious diseases. And, I also see the need for KM education to transform the conventional notion about the importance of KM in viral infection. It would be nice to exchange thoughts with you on these two topics. Thank you.</p>
