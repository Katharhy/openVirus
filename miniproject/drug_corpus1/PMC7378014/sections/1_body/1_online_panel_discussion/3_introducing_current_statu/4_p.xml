<p id="par0040">The KM community could not participate in prevention measures related to the recent outbreak of COVID-19. KMDs were not allowed to participate, but they still contributed a lot to help patients overcome the COVID-19 via teleconsultation center.

 </xref> Looking at the current situation, I pose questions like: “Why are Korean people largely not interested in that KMDs are not officially allowed by the government to participate in treating COVID-19 patients?”, “Why do people talk about vaccines and antiviral treatments, but not about KM treatments?” I think it is, probably, because of the common notion that KM and infectious diseases are not entirely related.
