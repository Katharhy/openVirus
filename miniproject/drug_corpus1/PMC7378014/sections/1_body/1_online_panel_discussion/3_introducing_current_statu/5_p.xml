<p id="par0045">Therefore, why not address infectious diseases in terms of KM in the first place? More specifically, although there is a treatment for infectious diseases in KM, I think it would be great if we design and perform a study, providing guidelines on a specific treatment, effective against influenza virus, and likewise against coronavirus infection. I think it would be essential if there were studies presenting a specific KM treatment that is effective for viral diseases critical to public health. Then, people's perspective and view on KM, as well as the notion that KM is irrelevant to viral infections, might change.</p>
