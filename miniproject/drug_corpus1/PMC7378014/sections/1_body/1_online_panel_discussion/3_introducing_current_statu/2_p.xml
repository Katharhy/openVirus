 <bold>Joo:</bold> In 2015, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection was a great challenge for us. The last time the MERS epidemic occurred, the medical community seemed to function in great chaos, but fortunately, this time they seem to be coping well. The KM community is also contributing significantly to the struggle of overcoming COVID-19. Before starting the main discussion, I would like to discuss the current situation briefly and facilitate a discussion about the role of KM in basic research and education in overcoming a potential future outbreak of COVID-19 or similar viral diseases. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) first emerged in 2002. Before that, it was simply thought of as a benign virus, causing a common cold. In 2002, it was identified as a virus causing SARS. It peaked mostly around April–May, and 8000 people around the world were infected. The case fatality rate (CFR) was 11%, and there were three confirmed cases in Korea but no deaths.

 </xref> Five years later, last December, SARS-CoV-2 emerged for the first time. Unlike the previous two beta viruses, this coronavirus has spread worldwide. It caused a pandemic, and as of the 30th of April, the CFR prediction interval is 0.82–9.64% – the lowest end of the current prediction is 0.82% and in line with several other estimates.

 </xref> As I said earlier, coronaviruses were not highly dangerous in the past. This pattern changed in the late 2000s when a coronavirus infection started causing SARS. There are no specific treatments or vaccines. China reported that the combination of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine (WM) and CheongPyeBaeDok decoction (QingFeiPaiDu-tang in Chinese, Seihaihaidokuto in Japanese) was effective in treating SARS in 2002 and influenza later. They reported that it was also effective for COVID-19. In Korea, unfortunately, there are no reports of effective coronavirus or influenza infection treatment applying KM. As of March 2020, there are ongoing clinical trials on about 20 drugs, mainly in the U.S. and China, and it is impressive that a considerable number of TCM herbal medications are included in the list.
