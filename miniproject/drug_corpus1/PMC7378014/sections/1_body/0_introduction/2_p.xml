<p id="par0005">In contrast to Korea's proactive responses to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Korean Medicine (KM) community was not able to take part in any stage of responses to COVID-19 including testing or screening, epidemiological investigation, quarantine, treatment or prevention due to various reasons including political and regulatory barriers. Because Korean Medicine Doctors (KMDs) had no way to participate or volunteer in any activities by the Central Disease Control Headquarters, the Association of Korean Medicine, by self-help, opened a KM teleconsultation center for COVID-19 which was operated by KMD volunteers. As of April 22, 2020, approximately 20% of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Korea who were self-isolated because they could not be admitted to a hospital or quarantine facility received KM treatment via phone calls to KM teleconsultation center.</p>
