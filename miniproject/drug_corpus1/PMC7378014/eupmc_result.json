    "Background:Experiencing difficulties and challenges though COVID-19 pandemic, there are voices that it needs to be discussed to seek direction of basic research and college education of Korean Medicine (KM) so that KM community can play a significant role in the future infectious disease outbreaks. Methods:This paper summarizes the edited highlights of an online video meeting by Google meet on May 19, 2020, organized by the Korean Medicine Convergence Research Information Center. Five researchers specialized in immunology, microbiology, virology, preventive medicine, and herbology, respectively, presented what KM community should prepare for the future acute infectious disease outbreaks by learning from the previous research on antiviral effect of herbs for coronavirus and the experiences of the present COVID-19 pandemic. Results:There are a lot of herbs or natural products with potential anti-coronavirus effects reported from in vitro experiments and despite criticism, many clinical trials on traditional herbal medicine for COVID-19 are being conducted. In addition to establishing research evidence, KM community should train and produce public health professionals among Korean Medicine Doctors (KMDs) and official participation in public healthcare system should be ensured in terms of regulation and policy. Newly developed KM treatments can be interpreted by the KM theories and also should be allowed by regulations for KMDs to utilize them. Conclusion:The present online discussion suggested directions of basic research for acute viral infections diseases utilizing KM and how to enforce relevant education and regulations in the post-COVID-19 era."
