<p id="Par42">Influenza viruses attenuated by means of truncated or deleted NS1 or by other attenuation markers have proven to be safe vaccines in clinical studies and have promising characteristics for use as oncolytic agents. Various factors governing their immunogenicity have been described, and strategies for optimizing their oncolytic effects established. Arming viruses with cytokines or checkpoint inhibitors appears to enhance their therapeutic effect. These insights into the immunomodulatory properties of such viruses may help further refine choices and design of viruses to be used in clinical trials. The future challenge is bringing this promising novel immunotherapeutic agent into clinical routine. Open questions remain the impact of preexisting immunity and combination with other anti-cancer drugs.</p>
