<p id="Par21">In order to create a virus that initiates potent anti-cancer-immune responses without causing an infectious disease, it is necessary to target them to cancer cells. Mammalian cells react to viral infections by secreting type I IFN. Most viruses develop strategies to circumvent these immunogenic effects. It was shown, that the influenza A virus lacking NS1 (delNS1) generated by Egorov et al.

 </sup>, attenuation of the NS1 protein appeared to be an attractive strategy for targeting growth of influenza A viruses to malignant tissue. We were able to show that deletions of various lengths within the NS1 gene of an influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) based H1N1 virus yielded potent anti-cancer effects in IFN resistant human melanoma (SK-MEL1) xenografts
