<p id="Par17">However, influenza A viruses have a two-sided relationship to apoptosis

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup>. There is evidence, that growth of influenza viruses is dependent on apoptosis
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>
 </sup>. Specifically, caspase 3 appears important for viral replication
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>
 </sup>. In this line, the influenza A virus can actively induce apoptosis. Apoptotic signaling may be initiated intrinsically through the viral protein PB1-F2
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>
 </sup>. A further major inducer of apoptosis during influenza A virus infections is the viral nucleoprotein (NP), interacting with the host’s Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) inhibitor clusterin, leading to Bax induced apoptosis
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>
 </sup>. Extrinsic induction of cell death, which inhibits viral replication at a late stage of viral life cycles, has been reported to occur through the release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor ligands, depending on nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells (NF-κB) activation
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>
 </sup>. This process is counterbalanced by NF-κB inactivation through NS1
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>
 </sup>. The viral surface glycoprotein neuraminidase (NA) can also be involved in induction of cell death, as it enhances apoptosis through activation of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)
