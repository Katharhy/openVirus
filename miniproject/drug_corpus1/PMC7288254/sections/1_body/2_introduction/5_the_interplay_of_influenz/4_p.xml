<p id="Par18">There are multiple theories, why influenza A virus may actively induce apoptosis. Overall, there seems to be a fine, time-dependent balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic stimuli, which are tightly controlled by the virus. Upon overexpression of anti-apoptotic molecules influenza A virus titers are reduced due to viral RNA-protein complexes being retained in the nucleus

 </sup>. Interestingly, caspase activation has been shown to enable diffusion of nuclear proteins into the cytoplasm

 </sup>. This suggests that inhibition of both apoptosis and innate anti-viral responses through NS1 is necessary for viral propagation, especially in the initial phases of infection. In the late phase, activated caspases are needed to release viral RNA from the nucleus (Fig.
