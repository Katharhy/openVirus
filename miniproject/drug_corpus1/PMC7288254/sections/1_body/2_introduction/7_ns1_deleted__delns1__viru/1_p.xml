<p id="Par24">Apart from the conditionally replicating phenotype in malignant cells influenza A viruses with NS1 deletions are associated with a more potent stimulation of the innate immune system than wild-type viruses. This is due to the fact that the attenuation is linked to deletions in the viral inhibitor of the innate immune system. The inhibitory effect of NS1 on the immune system is based on its polyfunctional nature (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). With respect to cellular innate immune mediators, NS1 was shown to inhibit interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and NF-ÎºB

 </sup>. Since NS1 deleted influenza A viruses are capable of inducing strong PKR pathway upregulation, it seems plausible that known downstream signaling might lead to calreticulin (CALR) exposure on the cell membrane
