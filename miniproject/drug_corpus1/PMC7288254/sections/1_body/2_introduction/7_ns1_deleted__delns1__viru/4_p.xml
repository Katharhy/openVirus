<p id="Par27">The immunogenic character of the delNS1 virus had also been explored in the context of potential vaccination agents. In a preclinical study the use of complete or partial NS1 deleted H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 subtypes as vaccines induced potent T cell and B cell responses, protecting mice and ferrets against influenza A virus challenge
