 </sup>. Full NS1 deletion results in viruses characterized by an abortive infection. Thus, the level of pro-inflammatory immune stimulation and the level of attenuation can be titrated by the length of the deletion. Correspondingly, we observed that partial NS1 deletion to 80 or 116 remaining amino acids (AA; removing the effector domain, but leaving the RNA binding domain and one nuclear locating sequence) induced an optimal balance between attenuation and the oncolytic effect
