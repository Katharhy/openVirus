<p id="Par25">A transcriptional profiling confirmed that a delNS1 virus infection caused a much more potent induction of an immuno-stimulatory gene pattern compared with wild-type virus

 </sup>. Correspondingly, infection of macrophages with the delNS1 virus is not only associated with an ICD, but also with a more potent stimulation of innate cytokines as compared with wild-type viruses
