<p id="Par37">Necroptosis but also necrosis might be induced by specific influenza subtypes. Examples are the avian H5N1 and a reconstructed 1908 pandemic H1N1

 <italic>et al</italic>. recently described varying potential of different flu virus strains to cause necroptosis, specifically describing seasonal NC/99 H1N1 influenza A viruses as inducers and pandemic Cal/09 as inhibitors of necroptosis
