<p id="Par30">Many clinical and preclinical studies have shown effectiveness of “non-armed” oncolytic viruses in cancer treatment. Still, their immuno-stimulatory properties do not always result in the expected potent anti-cancer effect. In order to optimize anti-cancer activity viruses are engineered to express various immuno-stimulatory transgenes, most prominently T cell and DC activating cytokines like interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-15 (IL-15) or GM-CSF

 </sup>. Within the influenza A virus background we were able to establish potent expression of various transgenes from a deleted or truncated NS1 reading frame, including the reporter gene green fluorescing protein (GFP), the cytokine IL-2, or CC-chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20)

 </sup>. Using the viruses’ inherent property of a high mutational frequency we were able to adapt viruses to stably express transgenes up to 441 AA from the NS segment, together with nuclear export protein (NEP) and NS1 truncated to 116 AA
