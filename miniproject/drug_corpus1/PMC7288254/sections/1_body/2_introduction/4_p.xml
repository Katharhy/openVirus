<p id="Par14">Utilizing an influenza A virus as an oncolytic agent has several advantages. The influenza virus is a small virus of the

The extensive knowledge and infrastructure that has previously been established for the production of seasonal influenza vaccinations reduces the amount of novel biotechnological engineering and regulatory issues, which are necessary for clinical development of the virus in the field of oncology
