<p id="Par11">The observation of viral infections leading to the reduction of cancerous tumors was reported throughout the 20th century

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
 </sup>. The first report of a complete tumor remission in the context of an influenza A infection dates back to 1904
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup>. Preclinical models solidified the assertion of oncolytic effects of influenza A viruses
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup>. However, the lack of understanding of virus biology made a safe and effective development of oncolytic A viruses impossible at that time. In the last decades advancements in molecular virology and viral engineering led to the clinical development of a variety of oncolytic viruses, including herpes simplex virus (HSV)
 <sup>

 </sup>, reovirus
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
 </sup>, vaccinia virus (VV)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
 </sup>, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup>, adenovirus
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
 </sup>, newcastle disease virus (NDV)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>, measles virus (MeV)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup> and picornaviridae
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>. This renewed interest in oncolytic viruses resulted in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval of the first oncolytic virus, Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC), in 2015
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup>. T-VEC is an HSV, which is modified to grow selectively in tumor cells and express the immuno-stimulatory transgene granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The development of oncolytic viruses was based on conditional replication of prototype viruses in malignant tissue, while being attenuated in normal tissue
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>. The lytic effect of the virus was initially thought to be the main principle of their anti-cancer activity. Later it turned out that the therapeutic effect was mainly promoted by a pro-inflammatory stimulation of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) counteracting tumor-associated immunosuppression. Thus, the concept of virotherapy largely overlapped with the rational principles of immune checkpoint inhibiting antibodies
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>
 </sup>. Importantly, the combination of oncolytic viruses with checkpoint inhibitors appears to be highly beneficial in a number of preclinical models
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>. In this line, a seminal paper by Zamarin et al. indicated, that an oncolytic NDV sensitized an immunologically “cold” murine tumor to systemic checkpoint inhibitors, which increased the rate of tumor remission
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>
 </sup>. Similarly, combining T-VEC with immune checkpoint inhibitors was associated with complete remission in 22% of stage IIIB/IV melanoma patients in a small phase I study strongly supporting this concept
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>. Those observations prompted a high level of interest in the field of virotherapy.
