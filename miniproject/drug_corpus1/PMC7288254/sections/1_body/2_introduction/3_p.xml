<p id="Par13">There are several hallmarks viral candidates should possess in order to be considered for development into oncolytic agents: their genetics and biology should be well known and targeting to cancerous tissue needs to be feasible. They should be highly immunogenic and exert lytic activity leading to an immunogenic cell death (ICD) of malignant cells, while sparing normal tissue

 </sup>. They should not lead to a chronic disease or retain capability of integrating into the human genome. Moreover, the use of the viruses as an oncolytic agent must be safe, in terms of excluding the possibility of the induction a pathogenic virus, which causes a disease the human population. It should also be feasible to genetically modify the virus and arm it with recombinant transgenes to enhance its immunogenicity or stimulate targeted anti-cancer mechanisms.
