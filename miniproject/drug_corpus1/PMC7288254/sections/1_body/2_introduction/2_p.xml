<p id="Par12">With respect to oncolytic influenza A viruses, only preclinical studies have been accomplished yet, in spite of the fact, that this virus family is well studied and known to be highly immunogenic. In this review we summarize major milestones in the development of oncolytic influenza A viruses. We delineate in which manner targeted replication in cancer cells was achieved. Furthermore, we discuss strategies to arm influenza A viruses with immuno-stimulatory transgenes. Finally, we discuss which types of cell death influenza A virus-infected cancer cells succumb to and their implications for future design of oncolytic A viruses.</p>
