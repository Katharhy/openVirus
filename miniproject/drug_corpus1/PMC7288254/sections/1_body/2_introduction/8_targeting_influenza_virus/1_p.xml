<p id="Par29">Influenza A virus entry depends on a protease to cleave the hemagglutinin (HA), a protein mediating viral entry. Thus, the presence of trypsin or equivalent proteases in the tissue is substantial for host restriction. It restricts the influenza A virus infection to the lung, the enteric system and for some viral isolates to the brain. We discovered that various colon cancer cell lines express trypsin and allow oncolytic influenza A virus growth in the absence of exogenous protease

 </sup>. To further target the influenza A virus to tumor tissue we generated a virus in which the conformational change of HA, which enables viral entry, relies on the protease elastase

 </sup>. Elastase has been shown to be present in tumor tissue due to expression by neutrophils. Elastase is also strongly expressed by malignant cells of pancreatic origin. Replacing the trypsin cleavage site with an elastase cleavage site has been shown to attenuate influenza A virus replication in swine and mice

 </sup>. We therefore exchanged the trypsin cleavage site within the partially NS1 deleted (116AA) PR8 influenza virus to elastase. Elastase-dependent viruses yielded a potent therapeutic efficacy in murine melanoma (B16) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PANC-1) xenograft models

 </sup>. Thus, this attenuation marker present in HA can be used to target virus to tumor tissue and might allow for the use of HA which is currently not present in the human population, including the H7 or H9 subtypes.
