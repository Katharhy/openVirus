  <title>Reassortment of oncolytic influenza A viruses and wild-type influenza A viruses.</title>
  <p>Examples of reassortment of an armed oncolytic influenza virus attenuated by NS1 truncation during co-infection with wild-type influenza virus. 
   <bold>a</bold> represents transgene expression from the NS1 reading frame. All reassortants carrying the transgene are attenuated. 
   <bold>b</bold> represents transgene expression from the M segment. Some reassortants may carry both wild-type elements of the attenuation marker NS1 and a transgene, leading to unpredictable effects of the newly created virus. NS1 nonstructural 1 protein.
