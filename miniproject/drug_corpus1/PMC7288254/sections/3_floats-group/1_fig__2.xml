  <title>A proposed model of how influenza A virus controls apoptosis in 2 phases.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold> In the early phase of an influenza virus infection, the virus benefits from reduced apoptosis, in order to transcribe viral structural proteins and replicate viral RNA. Anti-apoptotic functions are mediated by NS1, interfering with various danger signaling proteins and reducing NF-κB induced TNFα release. 
   <bold>b</bold> In the late phase of influenza virus infection, the pro apoptotic viral protein PB1-F2 and the weakened TNFα release might accumulate, leading to enhanced apoptotic signaling. Apoptosis enhances the release of viral RNA from the nucleus, a prerequisite for virus assembly and release. NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor alpha.
