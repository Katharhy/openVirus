<p>Certainly a huge effort should be done for translation of the research into clinics. Indeed, HNM applications as antivirals are still in the early phase of research. Several challenges still need to be tackled before their safe use. At the current stage, some HNMs have been approved only for surface disinfection. For instance, CuNPs have been used in filters for the preparation of highly efficient broad spectrum antiviral masks.

 </sup> Some HNMs have been already clinically approved. For example, FeNPs were approved for imaging and as a drug to treat iron deficiency anemia in adult patients with chronic kidney disease, while AuNPs are in clinical trials for the treatment of prostate cancer (photothermal therapy).

 </sup> However, at the moment no clinical trials are running for the use of HNMs as antiviral agents. In fact, there are still several concerns on the applications of HNMs in drug formulations. Compared to molecules, where mainly concentration and exposure routes are concerned, solving HNM toxicity issues is much more complicated. Composition, size, shape, and surface functionalization must be considered to respond to the requirement for safety regulations. Additionally, interaction on HNMs with the immune system must be better elucidated. In particular, the activation of the immune system and complement activation-related pseudoallergy must be taken into account.

 </sup> For instance, ferumoxytol (a FeNP-based drug) has been reported to generate severe anaphylactic reactions in humans, 18 of which were fatal.

 </sup> This is due to the possible interaction of HNMs with mast cells, provoking their degranulation/activation and release of histamine even at the first exposure (pseudoallergic-mediated hypersensitivity). Besides, the mechanism of activation of these cells is still unknown, although it was found that it depends on the HNM composition, size, and surface chemistry and on the corona formation.

 </sup> On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that HNMs can travel to the draining lymph nodes, targeting resident dendritic cells and macrophages. Therefore, they are able to interact with antigen presenting cells to stimulate innate and adaptive immune responses.

 </sup> We believe that a joint venture of different chemists, materials scientists, virologists, toxicologists, and medical doctors can push forward the preparation and safe application of HNMs in this field, hoping to prevent and eventually block the rise of new viral pandemics.
