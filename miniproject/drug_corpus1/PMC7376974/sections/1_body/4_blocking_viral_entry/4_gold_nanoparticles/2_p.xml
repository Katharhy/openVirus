<p>Besides the 
 <italic>per se</italic> antiviral activity, AuNP surface modifications have been developed in order to enhance their overall therapeutic benefits. The engineering of tailored AuNPs with selected ligands has allowed the preparation of efficient antiviral nanoagents. The target ligands can be introduced directly during the particle synthesis 
 <italic>via</italic> ligand exchange reactions or ligand modifications. For instance, direct reduction of gold ions in the presence of gallic acid produced homogeneous AuNPs able to sensibly reduce herpes simplex virus infection 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>.

 </sup> Compared to free ligand NPs, functionalized AuNPs benefit from the multivalency effect and higher circulation times, decreasing the needed therapeutic concentrations.

 </sup> Functionalized AuNPs can present organic groups that mimic host cell surfaces or other specific molecular patterns that selectively target the virus. Normally, negative charges are used to mimic cell surfaces and favor the interaction between the particles and the capsid. In particular, sulfonates and organic sulfates have been used for their capacity to attract the virus 
 <italic>via</italic> capsid protein interaction and block the HA activity.

 </sup> AuNPs functionalized with sulfonates showed an increasing inhibition of influenza A compared to the nanoparticles capped with succinic acid.

 </sup> This study also demonstrated that there is not a correlation between the negative charge and the antiviral activity, but instead the inhibition depends mainly on the organic groups used. Thiol-capped AuNPs also displayed powerful inactivation of bovine viral diarrhea virus 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>.

 </sup> Multivalency has been exploited in more complex systems using dendrons as capping agents. This strategy allows to generate higher concentrations of the target ligand in close proximity to the AuNPs and to increase the binding efficiency of the nanoparticles to the capsid. The driving force of the antiviral efficiency relies on the concentration of the targeting agent onto the particles. Sulfonated dendrons were grafted to AuNPs 
 <italic>via</italic> a sulfide bond and tested for HIV inhibition.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>
 </sup> The results showed that the decorated AuNPs exerted a higher affinity to the virus. Additionally, comparing AuNPs functionalized with different generation dendrons, those with a third generation displayed the highest inhibition performance with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> below 0.1 Î¼mol/mL, thus making them attractive for 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> translation. It is worth noting that the inhibition efficiency is strictly dependent on the available sulfonate groups present on the surface of the NPs, making crucial a thorough characterization of the material.
 <sup>

 </sup> The size of the AuNPs clearly plays an important role in the concentration of targeting ligands exposed per particle.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>
 </sup> Indeed, too big NPs have a limited surface area, while too small would not allow an efficient grafting of the dendrons due to steric hindrance. For instance, it has been shown that dendron-functionalized AuNPs showed a size-dependent antiviral activity for influenza virus, where 14 nm particles exhibited a higher efficiency than 2 nm AuNPs. This has been associated with the low functionalization grade of the small nanoparticles and to the inappropriate spatial distribution of the interacting ligand/receptor pairs.
