<p>For this purpose, different glycofullerenes were synthesized by changing the number of mannose units (from 12 to 36) and the spacers between the fullerene moieties and by varying steric hindrance in order to obtain a library of molecules.

 </sup> The synthetic route is composed of three steps based on “click chemistry”: (1) assembly of glycodendrons by Cu(I)-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), (2) synthesis of alkyne-substituted Bingel-Hirsch hexakis-adducts, and (3) the coupling between the last two products again by CuAAC. To increase the number of mannose moieties up to 36, the glycodendron core was changed from malonate to trialkynyl pentaerythritol. In order to compare the different derivatives, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies were performed. Jurkat cells (lymphocyte T CD4 immortalized cells) expressing DC-sign were used to prove the inhibition capacity of the glycofullerenes on viral infection of Ebola (

 </xref>, route A). The study revealed an IC
 <sub>50</sub> in the μM range for the 12 mannose fullerene, a lower efficiency with the 36 mannose fullerene with a short spacer (PEG, with 2 ethylene oxide units), while a nanomolar IC
 <sub>50</sub> was achieved with 36 mannose fullerenes with a longer spacer (PEG, with 3 ethylene oxide units) (
