<p>Following an alternative strategy, a supramolecular assembly of monodisperse glycofullerenes, leading to the formation of micelles, was achieved and tested.

 </sup> These micelles present a uniform and spherical shape (

 </xref>, route C). The aggregation synthetic route is faster compared to a controlled synthesis of giant glycofullerenes, but it might suffer from low reproducibility and batch-to-batch differences between each formulation. This self-assembled C

 <sub>50</sub> of 424 nM for six mannoses and 196 nM for 12 mannoses, respectively,
