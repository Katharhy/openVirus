<p>Functionalized fullerenes have been used for their ability to compete with viral particles through lectin receptors in host cells. There has been a tremendous advancement in the functionalization of fullerenes leading to the preparation of derivatives with a high amount of mannose, capable to enhance the multivalency effect and thus to increase the therapeutic outcome. First, glycofullerenes do not have an intrinsic virucidal activity. They can reduce the infectivity, but they are not able to completely inactivate the virus. Second, the mechanism of action of glycofullerenes relies on their interaction with host cells and not with viral particles. Thus, for a therapeutic application, they should be injected at different time points, ensuring that the local concentration is therapeutically relevant to prevent the virus from invading the host cells. In addition, glycofullerenes can be internalized into host cells losing their viral “shield” activity. On the other hand, the well-developed surface chemistry of glycofullerenes can be used for other key receptors involved in viral entry. For instance, in the case of the current SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, a similar click chemistry strategy can be used to anchor ligands recognized by human lung ACE2 receptors and so inhibiting viral entry.
