 </sup> GO platforms have shown also interesting antimicrobial activity.

 </sup> Regarding viral infection, GO was used to block the virus entrance in host cells. GO and rGO can be considered as two-dimensional materials that contain hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains allowing to adsorb many biological molecules including nucleic acids and proteins. GO showed low interaction with viruses, however its surface functionalization with target molecules can sensibly enhance its affinity for the viral particles. Additionally, GO can be used as photothermal agent (generation of heat by NIR irradiation) or photodynamic therapy (using visible light irradiation) inactivating the capsids by local thermal shock or by radical formation during irradiation, respectively. The use of phototherapies may significantly augment the antiviral properties of the materials. However, we must keep in mind that these therapeutic modalities can be applied only to disinfection, since the radical/heat production may be harmful for the healthy tissues

 </sup> In this study, GO was functionalized with an aptamer recognized by the viral surface. The results showed that this functionalization is able to enhance the binding efficiency of the MS2 capsids onto the GO surface compared to nonfunctionalized GO. Subsequently, irradiation in the visible light was able to disinfect the solution, while nonfunctionalized GO showed much less activity due to the lack of adsorption. Despite these interesting results, this pioneer work remains at an early research stage since the use of high light dose (300 W for 10â€“140 min) and the lack of material recovery and reuse make its application for surface disinfection difficult.
