<p>Alongside fullerenes, other carbon nanomaterials (NMs) have been scrutinized for their ability to block viral entry. CDs and GO are the most known and studied carbon NMs with marked antiviral properties. CDs are zero-dimensional carbon nanoparticles. They are generally produced 
 <italic>via</italic> hydrothermal decomposition of carbon containing “low-cost” precursors. The use of CDs in the biomedical field has been encouraged by their easy preparation, low toxicity, fluorescence properties, and easy surface functionalization. Pristine CDs have shown moderate viral blocking activity for HIV infection 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>.

 </sup> This has been associated with the surface of the material rich in carboxylic and hydroxyl groups prone to form noncovalent interaction with viral membranes. Moreover, due to the complexity of the biological systems these nonspecific interactions could not be so effective 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, likely reducing the antiviral efficacy. Therapeutic targeting molecules can be grafted onto a CD surface to enhance their antiviral activity. In this context, the design of multifunctional CD platforms can be obtained through two different strategies. The first consists in a single-step reaction that foresees the insertion of the therapeutic molecule directly into the step of preparation. Target molecules are decomposed with the other precursors, generating the desired functional CDs. This protocol is fast and efficient, however the drug loading as well as its activity are hard to estimate. Indeed, the hydrothermal treatment can alter the chemical structure of the active molecule, thus vanishing its therapeutic effect. For these reasons, the reaction conditions must be carefully controlled.

 </sup> The second method is a two-step reaction and implies the postfunctionalization 
 <italic>via</italic> amide formation on the surface of the CDs rich in carboxylic groups. This strategy offers a better chemical control, but the yield and the drug loading may not be quantitative and high, respectively. Different functionalized CDs were prepared to hamper host cell viral entry. For instance, benzoxazine (a low water-soluble antiviral agent) was incorporated into the CD structure during their preparation (

 </sup> These positive results were explained by the efficient binding and deactivation induced by the multivalent effect of the CDs to the viral particles
