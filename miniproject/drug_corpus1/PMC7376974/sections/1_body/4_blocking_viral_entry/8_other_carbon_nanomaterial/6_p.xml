 </sup> This strategy promotes the synergy between the electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, showing incredibly high inhibition efficacy. Overall, graphene materials have shown a good capacity to block host cell viral entry. Disinfection with graphene family materials is also promising, offering the possibility to couple high viral binding with phototreatments. Regarding the GO and rGO activity in cellular environments, different parameters must be considered such as protein coronation, blood circulation time, and activity
