<p>Due to their diversity, versatility, and tunable surface chemistry, carbon nanomaterials have been attractive for several types of applications. In particular, the past decade has seen a tremendous raise in the preparation of performant carbon-based nanomaterials in the antiviral field. Fullerene and its derivatives are the most studied carbon nanomaterials for their virucidal activity. Due to the lack of solubility of pristine fullerene, functionalization strategies have been developed to prepare water-soluble drugs. Investigations in the biomedical field evidenced the membranotropic capacity of fullerene derivatives.

 </sup> By modulating shape and functions, fullerene derivatives have been shown to possess antiviral properties through inhibition of viral entry and blockage of viral replication. From these results, the attention has been directed also to other carbon nanomaterials. In particular, functional carbon dots (CDs) and graphene oxide (GO) have been investigated for their ability to block viral entry into host cells.
