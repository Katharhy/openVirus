 </sup> More recently, ZnO nanoparticles (ZnONPs) were developed for the treatment of HSV-2. ZnONPs were prepared with a tetrapod morphology.

 </sup> The results showed that they can mimic cell surface interacting with the HS present on the viral capsid. Additionally, these particles have been used for photocatalysis showing to efficiently destroy the viral proteins upon UV irradiation.
