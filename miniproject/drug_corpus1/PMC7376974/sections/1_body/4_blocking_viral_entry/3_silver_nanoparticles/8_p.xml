 </sup> Curcumin was used as a reducing and capping agent to prepare stable curcumin AgNPs (cAgNPs) under physiological conditions. cAgNPs could reduce cytopathic effects induced by RSV and showed efficient antiviral activity against infection by directly inactivating the virus prior to entry into the host cells. Its antiviral effect was higher than curcumin alone or unmodified AgNPs (
