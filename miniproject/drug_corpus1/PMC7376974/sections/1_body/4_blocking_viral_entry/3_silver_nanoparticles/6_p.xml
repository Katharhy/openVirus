<p>The surface modification can also exert a synergistic antiviral effect. AgNPs decorated with polyphosphonium-oligochitosan (PQPOC) exhibited moderate to excellent antiviral activity against HAV, NoV, and CoxB
 <sub>4</sub>. In addition, AgNPs could interact with the virion glycoproteins and prevent viral attachment and penetration. PQPOC can also serve as an effective virus inhibitor by blocking the interaction of the targeted virus with the host through the electrostatic interaction between the cationic polymers and the negatively charged binding sites of the virus.
