<p>In other studies, it has been demonstrated that silver ions released from nanosilver can directly damage the viruses. Based in this property, an interesting application has been proposed. AgNPs were used as a coating on polyurethane condoms, effectively inhibiting the activity of HIV and herpes simplex virus (HSV). The hypothesized mechanism is that silver ions are transferred directly from oxidized NPs to biological targets, such as viral membrane proteins gp120 and gp41. In addition, a small amount of silver ion is also released from the coated contraceptives to improve the antiviral level.
