<p>Although the potential of AgNPs as antiviral agents has been commonly recognized, unfortunately, their wide biological applications are limited by the risks of self-aggregation and environmental pollution. Silver ions can be released from the surface of AgNPs and potentially pollute the environment, and their agglomeration into bulkier particles or fibers may change their biological characteristics, diminishing the antiviral effect. In several cases, it has been reported that naked AgNPs may affect human health.

 </sup> Therefore, research and development of AgNPs whose surface is modified or stabilized by protecting molecular layers is an urgent need to overcome these problems (

  <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">2</xref>
 </xref>). Poly(
 <italic>N</italic>-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) (PVP) is the most commonly used stabilizer of AgNPs. The PVP-coated AgNPs are able to inhibit the activities of HIV-1, herpes simplex 2 virus (HSV-2), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

 </sup> But compared to foamy carbon, small-sized PVP and BSA-coated AgNPs showed poor antiviral activity to the HIV-1 virus.

 </sup> For RSV, PVP-coated AgNPs have a specific binding capacity to the viral surface, evidencing a regular spatial arrangement and a clear interaction with G-protein.

 </sup> In addition, to improve the stability of AgNPs, their surface modification with antiviral drugs was proved to reduce the drug resistance caused by the drugs administered alone. Tannic acid-modified AgNPs showed good antiviral effects on HSV-2 infection 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. The viral infection was inhibited only when these NPs directly interacted with HSV-2 virions. Indeed, the pretreatment of host cells with such AgNPs did inhibit the entry of HSV-2. Due to the high affinity of tannins to proteins and sugars, tannic acid can bind glycoproteins on the surface of viruses to make them inert, impairing glycoprotein function and preventing viruses from attaching and entering host cells.
