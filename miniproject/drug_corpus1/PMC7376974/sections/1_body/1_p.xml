 </sup> The continuous virology research has more and more increased into viral replication machinery, allowing the preparation and rationalization of more sophisticated vaccine formulations and viral inhibitors. The use of HNMs may be one of the keys to provide more effective biomedical agents with a wide spectrum of activity in viral pandemics.
