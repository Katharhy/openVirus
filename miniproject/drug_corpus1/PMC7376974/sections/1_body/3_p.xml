<p>In this review, we will critically analyze different strategies for the application of HNMs as antiviral agents. The rational and the synthetic strategies will be highlighted and correlated to different relevant examples. Particular attention will be paid on the mechanisms of antiviral action and on HNM applicability and efficacy. For the sake of clarity, this review is divided into three parts, namely: blocking viral entry, antiviral activity in host cells, and stimulation of immune system. We have focused on the different stages of infection. In the section dedicated to blocking viral entry, the application of HNMs for surface disinfection and inactivation of the virus prior to interaction with host cells will be described. Subsequently, the interaction of HNMs after internalization into host cells will be addressed, stressing their antiviral delivery features and their activity in viral replication blockage, leading to host cell survival. Then, activation of immune response induced by HNMs, triggering the innate and the adaptive (

 <italic>e.g.,</italic> chemistry, surface charge) properties. Finally, limits (
 <italic>e.g.,</italic> unknown long-term toxicity), advantages (
 <italic>e.g.,</italic> high and wide spectrum virucidal activity), and perspectives will be discussed with particular attention to the applications in viral pandemics (

 <italic>g</italic>., HIV, SARS, and influenza viruses). This review is addressed to material and biomaterials scientists who are interested in antiviral research. We acknowledge that application of HNMs as antiviral agents is still in the early stages; however, we believe that the research on this topic is going to grow soon. Thus, with this contribution we genuinely hope to inspire researchers in the preparation of smart and efficient HNM antiviral agents.
