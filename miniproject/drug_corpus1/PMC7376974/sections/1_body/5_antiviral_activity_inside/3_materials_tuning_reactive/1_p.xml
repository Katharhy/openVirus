<p>ROS homeostasis in infected cells has been studied for both RNA and DNA viruses. For instance, it was shown that infection of mice with influenza A decreased the concentration of lung glutathione and the antioxidant vitamin C, providing evidence that the viral infection was associated with oxidative stress

 <italic>in vivo</italic>.

 </sup> Similarly, in HIV infection, induced oxidative stress in host T cells and high concentrations of antioxidants are able to slow down the cell-to-cell viral spreading.

 </sup> The increase of ROS concentration is a common process in most of the viral infections. However, the mechanism of radical generation is different from case to case. Several proofs suggest that modulating ROS homeostasis in infected cells can slow down or block the infection.
