<p>HNMs have been shown to be powerful allies against viral infections. In particular, metal or metal oxide NMs, once internalized, can regulate the radical production into infected host cells. In this scenario, the NMs can work following two different mechanisms: (1) enhancing radical activity or (2) quenching ROS inside cell compartments. In the first case, metal oxide NPs are able to convert superoxide ions into more reactive hydroxyl radical species 
 <italic>via</italic> Fenton or Fenton-like reactions. The excess of superoxide ions is able to oxidize the viral proteins and the genetic material and therefore efficiently block the infection. This approach has been reported using ZnO NPs.

 </sup> In these studies, ZnO NPs have been successfully applied for the treatment of H1N1 influenza virus and Herpes simplex virus. The preliminary results showed that PEGylated ZnO particles were able to efficiently reduce the viral infection with IC
 <sub>50</sub> similar to acyclovir. More importantly, toxicity of ZnO was modulated by functionalization with PEG, which allowed a higher colloidal stability and a more controlled release of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> ions to catalyze ROS formation. Indeed, ROS (
 <italic>e</italic>.
 <italic>g</italic>., superoxide and hydroxyl radicals) produced by the NPs should be highly reactive and should not only damage the exogenous biological molecules but also attack different cell compartments. Overproduction of ROS may reduce virus spread but also induce cell death. Interestingly, this approach is applicable only at the early infection stage (after 1 h incubation of the host cells with a virus), but it loses its activity at later time points. These experimental evidences suggest that materials capable of triggering the formation of ROS are essential in the first phase of the viral replication, most probably inducing the arrest of the viral DNA polymerases, which is active in the first 1â€“3 h of viral contamination.

 </sup> This specific mechanism of action restricts ZnO NPs to an application only at the early stage of infections. However, the same approach with other metals able to induce Fenton or Fenton-like reactions (
 <italic>e</italic>.
 <italic>g</italic>., Fe, Cu, and Mn) has not been reported yet. The choice of proper capping agents may allow to control the metal ion release and thus tune the ROS-mediated antiviral activity. We would like to take an advantage here to suggest the growth of the antiviral research in this direction.
