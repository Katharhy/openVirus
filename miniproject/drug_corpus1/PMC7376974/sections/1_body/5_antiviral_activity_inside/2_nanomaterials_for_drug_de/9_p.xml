<p>Overall, carbon NMs proved to be interesting carriers for antiviral drugs. However, several questions need to be answered before their safe application as antiviral materials. Different reports have demonstrated that pristine CNTs display relevant toxicity for healthy cells, but by oxidation of the tubes, the side effects can be sensibly reduced.

 </sup> In addition, more investigations should be performed on CNT toxicity. These nanocarriers indeed are not “innocent delivery agents”, but they play a key role in drug internalization pathway and in host cell machinery that might be averse to the expected therapeutic effects.

 </sup> So far, CNT application in biological systems has been studied for 20 years. However, due to their possible toxicity, their real application in clinics seems to be steeper and difficult to achieve.
