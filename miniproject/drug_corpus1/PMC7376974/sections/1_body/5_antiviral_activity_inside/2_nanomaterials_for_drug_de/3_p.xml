<p>The membranotropic properties of fullerenes were widely exploited. For example, pristine C
 <sub>60</sub>, after accumulation at the cell membrane, can translocate into the cytoplasm by crossing the membrane through multiple energy-dependent pathways despite its hydrophobic character.

 </sup> Fullerenes can be made water dispersible using surfactants, sonication or first dissolving them in appropriate organic solvents (DMSO). The use of fullerenes as inhibitors of viruses started in 1993 with a study focused on HIV infection.

 </sup> This work revealed the interaction between C
 <sub>60</sub> derivatives and HIV protease through molecular modeling and experimental verification. HIV protease (HIV-PR) is involved in the mechanism of replication in the maturation of HIV virion, cleaving newly synthesized proteins. The active site of HIV protease has a cavity of 10 Å closed to the diameter of C
 <sub>60</sub> cage.

 </sup> Molecular docking and experiments on HIV-PR catalytic activity revealed a blockage of the active site of the enzyme by van der Waals interactions leading to an antiviral effect. The following studies were based on a structure–activity relationship between functionalized fullerenes and HIV-PR with the aim to increase the antiviral activity. The introduction of pyrrolidinium salts onto C
 <sub>60</sub> was tested against the activity of HIV-1 strain.

 </sup> In a second study, C
 <sub>60</sub> bearing two ammonium groups was applied against the activity of HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains.

 </sup> The results showed the importance of having two moieties in a precise position on the fullerene cage and the influence of the charge of the different salts sensibly increasing its antiviral activity. Further investigations using different functional groups (

 <italic>g</italic>., amino acid derivatives) were explored. C
 <sub>60</sub> functionalized with aminobutyric acid and aminocaproic acid was able to inhibit HIV viral replication at subnanomolar concentrations.

 </sup> In another work, anionic and cationic pyrrolidinium salts and amino acid functionalized fullerene derivatives were used for the inhibition of HIV reverse transcriptase (HIV-RT). Fullerene compounds were compared to nevirapine, an available drug against HIV-RT, revealing a better inhibition compared to the pure drug.

 </sup> The antiviral property of carboxylated fullerenes was confirmed by another study.

 </sup> Results obtained
