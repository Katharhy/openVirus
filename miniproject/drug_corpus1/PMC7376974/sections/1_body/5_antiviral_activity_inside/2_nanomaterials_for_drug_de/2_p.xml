<p>Although the use of AgNPs has shown good antiviral action to further improve the therapeutic effects and reduce both side effects and drug resistance, the way of binding drugs or genes and other therapeutic agents to AgNPs has received particular attention. It has been observed that AgNPs inhibit the activities of neuraminidase and hemagglutinin, preventing the H1N1 influenza virus from attaching to host cells. At the same time, the potential molecular mechanisms revealed that caspase-3-mediated apoptosis was inhibited by ROS generation. AgNPs modified with polyethylenimine (PEI) can bind siRNA. Ag@PEI@siRNA exhibited superior abilities for enhanced cellular uptake and blocking EV71 virus infection and significantly decreased the apoptotic cell population, which prevented the spread of EV71 virus.

 </sup> In addition to drugs and siRNA, neutralizing antibodies in combination with AgNPs were developed. The results demonstrated that there is an additive effect between the antibody and AgNPs when combined against cell-associated HIV-1 infection
