<p>An increasing number of reports describe how HNMs can be successfully applied to block viral spread. HNMs can be used at different stages of viral infection: blocking viral entry, hampering interaction with infected host cells, and modulating immune responses. Due to their core composition (

 <italic>g</italic>., metal oxides, noble metals), HNMs can have an important antiviral activity inactivating some specific proteins of the capsid or dysregulating radical homeostasis in the virus particles. Additionally, surface functionalization can sensibly increase HNM antiviral activity, enabling the mimicking of host cells or enhancing the targeting efficiency.
