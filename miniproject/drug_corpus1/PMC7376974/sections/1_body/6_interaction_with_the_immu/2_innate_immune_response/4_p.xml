<p>Despite these preliminary results, the actual mechanisms of interaction between HNMs and the immune system are still at early stage of understanding. We must consider that the immune response needs to be proportional to the infection grade. If on one side nanosized immuno-boosters can alert more efficiently the sentinel cells, the use of HNMs that trigger an exaggerated immune response can promote excessive inflammation, damaging healthy cells and promoting uncontrolled side effects. In the particular context of SARS-Cov-2, the use of AgNPs, fullerenes, or other pro-inflammatory HNMs at the middle and late infection stage may cause an aggravation of the symptoms due to already diffused inflammation. In particular, most of the studies showed the ability to reduce infection when HNMs were first incubated with the pathogenic virus, thus limiting their potential use in the early stage infection.
