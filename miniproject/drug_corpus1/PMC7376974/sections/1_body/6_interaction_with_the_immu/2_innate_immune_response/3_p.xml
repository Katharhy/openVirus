 </sup> A study explored the influence of functionalization of C
 <sub>60</sub> with molecules presenting different surface charges like hydroxyl groups and amino acids.

 </sup> The study concluded that negative charges upregulated TNF-α up-secretion in RAW 264.7 macrophages, but highly positively or negatively charged surfaces increased cell toxicity. The upregulation of the cytokine TNF-α is a proof that fullerene can promote cellular immune response.
