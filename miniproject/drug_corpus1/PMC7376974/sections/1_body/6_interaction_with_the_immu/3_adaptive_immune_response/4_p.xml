<p>All these approaches are based on the capacity of the nanoparticles to adsorb the antigens and expose them to the immune system in the appropriate conformation to produce the neutralizing and protective antibodies. However, the adsorption is not an easy process to control. For instance, AuNPs have been ineffective in the immunization against SARS-Cov, when S viral proteins were used as antigens.

 </sup> In particular, the immunization with the protein alone was more efficient than when it was adsorbed onto the AuNP surface. This failure was associated with a conformational change or denaturation of the antigen, which did not lead to the production of the specific antibody.
