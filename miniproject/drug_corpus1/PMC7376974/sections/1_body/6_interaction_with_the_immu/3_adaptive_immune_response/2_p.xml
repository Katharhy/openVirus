<p>HNMs have been also applied to the delivery of antigens, exposing them to the immune system. Fullerenes were found as suitable carriers for the delivery of drugs or nucleic acids.

 </sup> polyhydroxy fullerenes (called fullerenols) display interesting properties for antiviral therapy, based on their capacity to self-assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs) and so to enhance the immunogenicity of the antigens.
 <sup>

 </sup> The great advantage of this strategy relies on the easy encapsulation process during the self-assembly making fullerenols versatile for the formulation of different kinds of vaccines. These VLPs were investigated against HIV-1

 </sup> Compared to conventional protein- or peptide-based vaccines intended to induce antigen-specific adaptive immune responses, DNA vaccines are more stable, cost-effective, easy to manufacture, and safe in handling.

 </sup> However, DNA vaccines have the disadvantage of being poorly immunogenic.

 </sup> Fullerenol VLPs allow to avoid the use of other adjuvants. In the case of a vaccine against HIV-1, fullerenol VLPs penetrated easily into the cells resulting in an enhancement of DNA transfection. This was proved in a study using fullerenol encapsulating DNA encoding the HIV-1 envelope protein gp145 (
