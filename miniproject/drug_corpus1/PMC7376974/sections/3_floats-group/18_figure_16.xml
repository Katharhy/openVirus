  <p>(A) Scanning electron microscopy images of ZnO tetrapod nanoparticles (ZOTEN) synthesized by flame transport synthesis. (B) Mice were challenged intravaginally with HSV-2 333 with or without ZOTEN. (C) To monitor progression of infection, mice were observed daily for the development of lesions around the vaginal opening, and base of the tail. Representative images from three independent experiments are shown. Reproduced with permission from ref (
