  <p>Use of fullerenol as co-adjuvant for vaccination. (a) The structure of fullerenol, red balls represent O and white for H on the fullerene surface, and green balls represent C atoms. (b) The schematic diagram of HIV Env plasmid DNA encapsulated during the self-assembly of fullerenol. (c) TEM image of Env entrapped by fullerenol. (d) Compared to naked Env immunization group, IFN-Î³ production (immunospot) was significantly enhanced when mice were immunized with the formulation
