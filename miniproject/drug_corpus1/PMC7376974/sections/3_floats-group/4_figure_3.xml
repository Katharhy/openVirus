  <p>Schematic representation of the synthesis of cAgNPs (A) and a proposed inhibition mode of cAgNPs against RSV infection (B). The inhibition mode of (B) shows that cAgNPs can reduce the binding ability of virus with the binding centers on the surface of cells (b) as compared to those without cAgNPs (a).
