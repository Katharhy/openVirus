  <p>Several non-specific antiviral drugs are undergoing clinical trials in only a few designated hospitals. While the SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding timeline is not well-known, antiviral drugs would be more beneficial if administered during the onset of the disease. More accurate and faster diagnostic tests are still underway, as a timely diagnosis is key to the management of COVID-19 (

  <p>There are no medications or clear guidelines for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients that test positive (

   <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). These patients must remain isolated at home, which increases the chances of infecting other family members.

  <p>Socio-economic disadvantaged countries with low-quality medical health care systems will be at a disadvantage compared to the U.S. and some European countries that are conducting the latest strategies against COVID-19 (

  <p>Asymptomatic patients may be receiving false-negative PCR test results, which causes underestimation of COVID-19 positive cases. Thus, it complicates efforts to prevent the spread of the virus within the community (

  <p>Current lockdown measures could limit the spread, but may not be sufficient to stop it completely.</p>
