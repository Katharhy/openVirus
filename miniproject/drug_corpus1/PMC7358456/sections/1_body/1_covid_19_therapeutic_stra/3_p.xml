<p>CQ and its structural analog hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), FDA approved drugs used as antimalarial agents with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities, are another investigational antiviral therapy drugs being redirected and evaluated for COVID-19 treatment. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown a significant activity of CQ against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS-CoV (

Interestingly, azithromycin and erythromycin, macrolide antibiotics, have specific antiviral effects that can inhibit viral internalization. Oseltamivir-azithromycin combination therapy has been used in randomized clinical trials for the treatment of influenza (
