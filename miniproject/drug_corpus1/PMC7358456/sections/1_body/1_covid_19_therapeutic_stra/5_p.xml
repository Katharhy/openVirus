<p>Efforts are also underway for the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Major COVID-19 vaccines under evaluation are whole virus vaccines (adenovirus-vectored vaccine using AdVac and PER.C6 technology by Janssen), recombinant protein subunit vaccines (recombinant nanoparticle technology by Novavax), and nucleic acid vaccines (mRNA vaccine by Moderna/NIH/CEPI) (
