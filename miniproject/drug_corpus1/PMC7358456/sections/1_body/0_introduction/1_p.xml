<p>The pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly expanded around the globe. As of June 5, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed 6,515,796 cases and reported 387,298 deaths worldwide due to COVID-19. The currently available treatments aim to control symptoms, guarantee tissue perfusion, and avoid multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. This is accomplished through the use of oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation in respiratory failure cases, and hemodynamic support for managing septic shock (

An increasing concern is the detrimental impact this virus could have in countries with weaker health systems and vulnerable populations. At this time, there is no known U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment that can effectively control SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. This review aims to propose trehalose as a prospective prophylactic treatment for COVID-19 containment.
