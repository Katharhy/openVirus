<p>As SARS-CoV-2 continues to expand globally, it is crucial to gain knowledge and understanding of its impact on disparate communities. The proposed trehalose treatment could potentially protect those unable to seek more costly therapeutics. With COVID-19 studies and trials ongoing indefinitely and economies suffering, more cost-efficient options should be considered for fast containment. The investigation of safer treatments for viral infections should be a continuous priority, as the COVID-19 pandemic will not be the last of its kind. We suggest trehalose for consideration to public health agencies worldwide.</p>
