  <p>Reconstruction of Swedish HIV transmission chain 79 (c79) [
   <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-01018" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] using revised assumptions. (
   <bold>A</bold>) The exposure interval was constrained by the seronegative and seropositive dates for each individual. When the seronegative date was either unknown or was &gt;10 years before the seropositive date, exposure start date was set to 10 years, as in the previous example in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01018-f004">Figure 4</xref>. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Exposure start date was set to actual seronegative dates regardless of how many years prior they occurred to the seropositive date. Exposure end date was set to the most recent seropositive date in the dataset. This interval therefore allowed most individuals to transmit the virus even after testing HIV positive and widened the possible exposure intervals for all individuals.
