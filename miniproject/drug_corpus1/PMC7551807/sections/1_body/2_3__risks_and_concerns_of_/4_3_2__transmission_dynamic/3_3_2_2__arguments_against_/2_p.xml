<p>From a pragmatic perspective, transmission dynamic analysis of HIV genetic sequence data is difficult to implement and requires direct programing of mathematical models and statistical inference methods. There is increasing convergence towards more user friendly and “off the shelf” type uses of transmission dynamic analysis. However, these types of analysis are not trivial to implement and can lead to misleading results if they are not constructed carefully.</p>
