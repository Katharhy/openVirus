<p>A basic weakness of transmission dynamic modeling in general for any data including genetic sequence data is that the model applies globally to the domain of the data. In practice, when we are fitting transmission models to genetic sequence data, we subsample the data for both computational and theoretical reasons such that the data represent a broad swath of the population in both geography and time. Focusing on the broad population dynamics may hide essential heterogeneities by aggregating up to a sufficient level for the transmission model to work. Likewise, dividing the population a priori into transmission groups such as MSM and people who inject drugs (PWID) may prevent understanding how sub-epidemics communicate with one another and whether or not there are possible intervention strategies at the boundaries of a priori population divisions.
