<p>Transmission dynamic analysis focuses on fitting models that describe the broad patterns of virus transmission in a population in terms of mathematical expressions using both genetic sequence and standard epidemiological data such as diagnosis time series. These methods are often referred to as phylodynamic methods [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-01018" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] because they are generally (although not always) based on first inferring a phylogeny from genetic sequence data and then fitting an epidemiological model to that phylogeny [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-01018" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The logic behind this type of analysis is that a mathematical model can potentially tell us quantities that are highly relevant but difficult to determine directly, e.g., incidence stratified by variables such as race and age and how certain risk groups are mixing with one another. There are a wide range of methods for conducting this type of analysis that make different assumptions and are more or less suitable for addressing epidemiological questions [
