<p>Here, we show that there are public health benefits from applying evolutionary theory principles to allocating prevention resources and fighting the HIV epidemic. Because linking transmissions among infected persons is sensitive information, we also discuss possible public health risks associated with such information. Preventing further spread of HIV is in the interest of the society and welfare of the people, yet doing so must not cause excess harm. Disease prevention is a complex and difficult task, with limited resources and many unknown factors. Modern evolutionary theory can be used to better trace and predict HIV epidemics, identify local and changing risk factors, and thereby direct allocation of public health resources to where they are needed most. Inference based on HIV genetic sequences provides useful epidemiological information that is actionable for public health purposes. It is sensitive information about potential transmission linkages between individuals and groups. It is important that such information is securely stored and not misused.</p>
