<p>In turn, molecular surveillance is an active approach that is now a routine component of HIV prevention strategies implemented by several US states and the CDC. Molecular surveillance leverages information from the HIV genetic data collected at the state and county levels. Because HIV evolves continuously within an infected person [

 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-01018" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], individuals harboring closely-related viral sequences are possibly linked by direct or indirect virus transmission [

 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-01018" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Such groups of linked sequences form molecular or genetic clusters, which may indicate recent and ongoing HIV transmissions [

 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-01018" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A molecular cluster does not indicate the source of virus transmission, i.e., who infected whom. It simply includes diagnosed HIV-positive individuals with closely-related viruses. The similarity among virus genetic sequences can result from one or multiple virus transmission scenarios. For example, all members of a cluster may have been infected by a common unidentified source or by multiple undiagnosed donors in the transmission chain. These are only two of many possible transmission scenarios that may be compatible with the epidemiology of such a cluster. A molecular cluster is therefore usually part of a larger transmission network, for which one or several individuals are yet to be identified, diagnosed, and enrolled in care (

These individuals can be identified via on-field investigations similar to traditional surveillance or their existence can be predicted via computational tools (as described below). Thus, the follow-up procedures (i.e., interviewing infected persons and following up on potential partners) in both traditional and molecular surveillance can be quite similar and may lead to identification of additional HIV-positive or at-risk individuals.
