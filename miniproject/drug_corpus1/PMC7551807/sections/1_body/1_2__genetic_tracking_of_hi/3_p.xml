<p>The recent CDC guidelines require that CDC funded jurisdictions run monthly analyses of molecular cluster detection using CDC recommended computational tools [

The automatization of this process can aid in optimizing resource allocation and direct follow-up investigations to localities where they are most needed. Moreover, molecular surveillance is independent of patient recall history and is thus a faster and less expensive way to rapidly, and hopefully in real-time, detect and stop emerging outbreaks.
