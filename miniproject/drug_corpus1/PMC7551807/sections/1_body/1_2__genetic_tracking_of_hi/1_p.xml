<p>Surveillance is key to prevent the future spread of infectious diseases. This is evident in the case of COVID-19 where a three-pronged approach of test, trace, and isolate has proven successful in containing virus spread in some Asian countries. In the case of HIV, surveillance requires a coordinated effort from healthcare professionals, state and local health departments, community members, and scientists. At the very basic level, healthcare providers notify increased patterns of HIV diagnosis in a geographical region, population, or community to the state and local authorities. This is often followed by contact tracing investigations, as permitted by local resources, to trace the epidemiology of the suspected outbreak and to identify additional at-risk and undiagnosed individuals within the contact network of new patients. Similar efforts focused on getting HIV-positive individuals back into care and virally suppressed may also be enacted. Because the median time-gap between HIV contraction and clinical diagnosis is three years [

Moreover, patients cannot always accurately recall the source of HIV transmission, especially if they acquired the virus long ago. Traditional surveillance is therefore passive and can miss several undiagnosed HIV-positive persons involved in the outbreak. According to CDC, these individuals may contribute ~40% of new HIV transmissions [
