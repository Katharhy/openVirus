<p>We have described three different strategies that can use HIV genetic data collected by US states, counties, and other countries, to help contain HIV spread. These options are summarized in 
 <xref rid="viruses-12-01018-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and provide varying levels of actionable information. We believe that the maximum and most actionable information is provided by phylogenetically enhanced HIV surveillance systems that attempt to reconstruct the virus transmission history among clustered individuals as we have illustrated in an example analysis of a small HIV transmission cluster. These kinds of analyses can provide immediate actionable information to contain future virus spread and also enroll undiagnosed individuals into healthcare. However, linking of cases by virus transmission is a sensitive issue, and it is important to communicate the value of these insights to both public health practitioners but also to the communities whose data are being used and preferably include them in the decision process [
