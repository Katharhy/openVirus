 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01018-f004">Figure 4</xref>A represents the best guess of who transmitted to whom when based on the available data including HIV genetic sequences. Infected persons are indicated by a unique color and an anonymous patient ID. Each internal node in the tree represents a transmission event occurring between two people at a certain time. The color at an internal node indicates the most probable infector for the given data and methodological assumptions. Put into words, the transmission history in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01018-f004">Figure 4</xref>A documents how the 8 sampled persons became infected. Under the most likely arrangement given the data, in 1999, an unsampled person infected p1044 who, about 2 years later infected both p458 and p1200. p458 then infects p384 in 2001 who is about 20 at that time. The unsampled case that started this outbreak also infects p1129 around the same time he infected p1044 (2001). P1129 then begins a chain of transmission leading to p1302, then to p466, and finally p694. Interestingly, both p1129 and p458 were the oldest persons in the dataset (data not shown). This tree tells us that not only are these 8 persons “linked” but exactly who and approximately when each one was infected, and, furthermore, that the most probable inference is that at least one person is missing from this cluster.
