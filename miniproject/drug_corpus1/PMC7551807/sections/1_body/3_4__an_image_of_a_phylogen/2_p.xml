<p>We want to make 4 specific points with these illustrations: (1) reconstructed transmission histories provide an image into the otherwise hidden transmission story of a genetic cluster, (2) the reconstructed transmission histories have a substantial-level of uncertainty about exactly who infected whom, (3) reconstructed transmission histories are sensitive to both methodological assumptions and the available data, and (4) reconstructed transmission histories provide actionable information that can be used to both make public health decisions and better understand the local HIV epidemic.</p>
