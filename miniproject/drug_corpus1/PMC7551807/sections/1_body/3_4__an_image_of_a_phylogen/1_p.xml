 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01018-f004">Figure 4</xref> shows output of a transmission history reconstruction of a previously published HIV transmission cluster [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-01018" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The cluster includes 8 MSM in Stockholm (sampled between 2002 and 2010) that were believed to have infected one another based on relatively close genetic distances between their HIV sequences. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01018-f005">Figure 5</xref> shows the reconstructed transmission history under a different set of assumptions and using different levels of data.
