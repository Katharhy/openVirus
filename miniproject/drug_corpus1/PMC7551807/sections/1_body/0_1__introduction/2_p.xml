<p>In this paper, we address the question, what should public health departments do with HIV sequence data? We begin by stating the potential benefits and risks of using HIV genetic data in public health surveillance and then discuss three reasonable options. We are not arguing for a “one-size-fits-all” approach, but rather, our aim is to delineate both the motivation and benefits of different analysis levels that can make use of these rich collections of HIV genetic data. We discuss this sensitive question primarily in the context of the US HIV epidemic, but the issues, benefits, and risks associated with these analyses are broadly applicable to many other countries that also mandate collection of HIV genetic data from laboratories and clinics.</p>
