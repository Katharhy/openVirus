<p>An HIV infected person in care in most developed countries will typically have part of the polymerase gene of their HIV population sequenced at least once, and often multiple times, to help guide clinical/therapeutic decisions. For example, many United States (US) state health departments collect HIV sequence data from healthcare providers and laboratories as a matter of state law and then communicate those sequences to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as part of an integrated HIV prevention and surveillance program [

Together, the state and county-level sequence collections likely match or possibly outnumber the number of entries in the public HIV sequence database (859,952 as of July 2020) that contains most published HIV sequences. Collectively, these databases likely represent the single largest, most well sampled, document on the historical and statistical properties of the HIV epidemic as it plays out in locations ranging from dispersed rural communities to large urban centers in the US and worldwide. Nevertheless, using these databases for public health surveillance is a complicated issue that needs to balance individual and public benefit with the potential harm to individuals and communities from misuse of these resources [
