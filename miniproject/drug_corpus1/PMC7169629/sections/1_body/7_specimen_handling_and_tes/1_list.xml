  <p>- Personnel collecting the specimens should wear appropriate PPE (N95, KF94, or equivalent respirators, protective clothing, disposable gloves, etc.) and handle the specimens in a Class II or higher biosafety cabinet (BSC) at a biosafety level 2 (BL2) laboratory. Aerosol-producing procedures should always be performed within the BSC. If the container has to be opened outside of the BSC, PPE, such as an N95, KF94, or a higher-grade respirator (powered air-purifying respirator recommended), should be worn by the personnel and the bench should be disinfected after the procedure.</p>

  <p>- Specimens that are subjected to nucleic acid extraction or inactivation in the BSC can be handled outside of the BSC in accordance with standard precautions for conventional specimens.</p>

  <p>- The test method should comply with the standard operating procedures used by each laboratory and the manufacturer’s instructions. Currently, clinical laboratories are using various nucleic acid extraction methods and reagents for real-time RT-PCR with EUA for COVID-19 diagnosis, and there are variations in the procedures used for the diagnosis. These guidelines do not present opinions regarding the selection of specific test methods or detailed test items. KSLM provides expert opinions on the detailed test items in the Q&amp;A section of its website (

  <p>- When using commercially available products, the manufacturer’s instructions and all other appropriate measures should be followed and care should be taken to prevent cross-contamination during nucleic acid extraction and addition to reagents. All procedures should comply with laboratory biosafety guidelines. Personnel should wear PPE (N95 or KF94 mask, disposable gloves, gown [covering the entire body, long-sleeves, and back-closure], and eye protection) in an isolated BL2 or higher laboratory. The use of automated equipment for nucleic acid extraction, which enables extraction outside of the BSC, is recommended. If an automated nucleic acid extraction system is not used, the procedure should be performed in a Class II or higher BSC.</p>

  <p>- At the end of the procedure or when the specimen is contaminated, the bench should be disinfected using appropriate disinfectants (70% ethanol, 2% glutaraldehyde, sodium hypochlorite [chlorine concentration 0.05%, 500 ppm], or other common virus disinfectants). Other disinfectants approved by the Korea Ministry of Environment may also be used. The manufacturer’s recommendations for dilutions and contact times should be followed.</p>
