  <p>- When performing routine tests (hematological tests, biochemical tests, serological tests, etc.) on blood, serum, or urine specimens, after performing a risk assessment considering the risk of infectious aerosol, the specimens can be handled in the same way as that used for general clinical specimens in appropriate cases.</p>

  <p>- In general, decapping is considered a low-risk procedure. However, it depends on the design of the lid and container. Whether to proceed with the testing will be determined following a risk assessment, which takes into account the need for centrifugation, mixing, and aliquoting. In addition, the use of a BSC should be considered at any time when there is a high risk.</p>

  <p>- Point-of-care testing, such as blood-gas analysis, should also be performed once safety is confirmed through a risk assessment.</p>
