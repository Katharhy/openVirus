<p>All kits currently available in Korea can detect two or more genes. According to the interpretation criteria of some manufacturers, detection of only one of multiple genes is interpreted as COVID-19 positive. However, based on results from actual clinical specimens, KSLM recommends a determination of a positive result only when all genes are detected. When only one gene is detected, retesting or consulting the reference laboratory is recommended.</p>
