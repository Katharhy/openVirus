  <p>Screening test (+) and confirmatory test (+): positive for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 detected).</p>
  <p>Among the reagents with EUA, some kits with three target genes use one target gene for the screening test and the other two target genes for the confirmatory test. For these kits, the confirmatory test result is deemed positive only if both confirmatory genes are detected. If one gene is not detected, the result cannot be interpreted as positive.</p>

  <p>Screening test (+) and confirmatory test (−): negative for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 not detected).</p>
  <p>For kits using betacoronavirus primers for the screening test, there is a possibility of betacoronavirus rather than SARS-CoV-2.</p>

  <p>Screening test (−) and confirmatory test (−): negative for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 not detected).</p>
  <p>If the internal control is also negative, the result is invalid, and a retest is necessary.</p>
 </list-item>
 <list-item>
  <p>Screening test (−) and confirmatory test (+): retest or refer to a reference laboratory for additional testing.</p>
