<p>As the current knowledge on COVID-19 is limited, it is difficult to rule out infection based on a single negative test result, especially when the test is performed using an upper respiratory tract specimen. Even if the upper respiratory tract specimen tests negative, the collection and testing of lower respiratory tract specimens are strongly recommended, especially in cases of severe or progressive disease.</p>
