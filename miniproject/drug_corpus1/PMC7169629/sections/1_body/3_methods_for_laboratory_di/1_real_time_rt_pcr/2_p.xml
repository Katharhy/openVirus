<p>Of the various protocols, some examine two genes using a two-step interpretation algorithm [

 <xref rid="b8-alm-2020-40-5-351" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b12-alm-2020-40-5-351" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In these protocols, the identification of one gene is used as a screening test, while that of the second gene is used as a confirmatory test. In contrast, the results of other protocols, which examine three or more genes, are considered positive only when all genes are detected. If one of the genes is not detected in these protocols, the results are often interpreted as indeterminate or negative.
