 </sup> In January 2019, China made available the “genome” of this mysterious new virus in hopes of producing the first diagnostic test for the disease, but the United States declined to use the WHO test even temporarily as a bridge until the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; Atlanta, Georgia USA) could produce its test. This action remains a perplexing question and the key to the Trump administration’s failure to provide enough tests to identify the coronavirus infection, needlessly slowing the critical domestic testing process and surveillance.

 </sup> Additionally, President Trump’s reliance on the validity of his “hunches,” claimed WHO’s mortality rate was “false,” irresponsibly valuing his “best guesses over scientific analysis.” This has led to a “false sense of security that endangers public health.”
