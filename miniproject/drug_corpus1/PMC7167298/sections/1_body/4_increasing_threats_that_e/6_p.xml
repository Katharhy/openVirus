<p>Ever since WHO first announced the presence of clusters of unknown pneumonia on December 31, 2019, an alarming concern has surfaced that WHO has become beholden to influential countries for funding support, giving wealthy UN members, especially China, support and influence both before and during the coronavirus outbreak. For example, WHO’s position regarding China has renewed a longstanding debate about whether WHO, founded 72 years ago, is sufficiently independent to allow it to fulfill its purpose.

 </sup> Critics raised questions concerning WHO’s response over how “China’s sway over the WHO is its success in blocking Taiwan’s access to the body, a position that could have very real consequences for the Taiwanese people if the virus takes hold there.” Others cite that WHO “downplayed the harsh control of medical whistleblowers,” and the critical delay in revealing COVID’s presence, and further argue that WHO is “overly bureaucratic, bizarrely structured, too dependent on a handful of major donors, and often hamstrung by political concerns.”
