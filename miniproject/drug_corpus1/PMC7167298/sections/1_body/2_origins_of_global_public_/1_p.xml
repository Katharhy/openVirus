<p>Modern day scholars have taken the “One Medicine” concept and advanced it into the “One Health Initiative,” a movement that seeks to “forge greater collaboration between the health disciplines,” advocating for multidisciplinary efforts to improve global health in general. It became a globally shared concept and world-wide strategy for expanding interdisciplinary collaborations and communications in all aspects of health care for humans, animals, and the environment. The synergism accelerated “biomedical research discoveries, enhancing public health efficacy, expeditiously expanding the scientific knowledge base, and improving medical education and clinical care.”
