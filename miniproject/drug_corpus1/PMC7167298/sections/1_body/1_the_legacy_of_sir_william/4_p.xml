 <italic>Aequanimitus,</italic> Osler emphasized that medicine is the “only world-wide profession following the same methods, actuating the same ambitions, and pursuing the same ends.” He emphasized that this “homogeneity” or “solidarity” which physicians world-wide are witnessing today with the COVID-19 pandemic is a quality “not shared by law” or politics, that “allows physicians to practice the same art amid the same surroundings in every country on earth.”
