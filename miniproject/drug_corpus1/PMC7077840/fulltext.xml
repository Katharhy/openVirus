We demonstrate the value of social media for automated surveillance of infectious diseases such as the West Africa Ebola epidemic. We experiment with two variations of an existing surveillance architecture: the first aggregates tweets related to different symptoms together, while the second considers tweets about each symptom separately and then aggregates the set of alerts generated by the architecture. Using a dataset of tweets posted from the affected region from 2011 to 2014, we obtain alerts in December 2013, <italic>which is</italic> three months prior to the official announcement of the epidemic. Among the two variations, the second, which produces a restricted but useful set of alerts, can potentially be applied to other infectious disease surveillance and alert systems.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Raina was supported by a NHMRC Principal Research Fellowship, grant number 1137582.

These systems have traditionally utilised information sources such as health encounters, medical records, hospital statistics, disease registries, over-the-counter drug sales data, laboratory results and surveys. However, for the purpose of early epidemic detection, traditional surveillance data are less timely and sensitive due to factors such as the long process of data validation, influence of bureaucracy, politics, higher costs and resource requirements[<xref rid="pone.0230322.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230322.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The WHO website states that early indicators for more than 60% of epidemics can be found through informal sources such as social media. Therefore, traditional surveillance can be supplemented through the use of publicly available data from internet-based or electronic platforms such as search engines, social media, blogs or forums[<xref rid="pone.0230322.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230322.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. When combined with signals and information from traditional sources and agencies, social media-based surveillance of infectious diseases can assist early detection of public health emergencies. While all infections or symptoms may not necessarily get reported on social media due to a variety of reasons, we claim that a change in the prevalence of symptom reports on social media can be an indicator of an outbreak, and can supplement traditional infectious disease surveillance.</p><p>In this paper, we investigate if early indicators of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa in 2014 can be obtained from social media posts. This epidemic is regarded as one of the deadliest epidemics in recent times that resulted in a high loss of life and severe stress to medical services in the countries impacted. We evaluate the possibility of surveillance using a dataset of tweets&#x02014;social media posts published on Twitter&#x02014;posted between 2011 and 2014 in key cities of the affected region in West Africa. A typical pipeline for a surveillance system to monitor infectious diseases using social media consists of two steps: (a) collection of social media posts reporting symptoms related to the infectious disease; and, (b) application of a monitoring algorithm to generate alerts for an epidemic[<xref rid="pone.0230322.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For step (a), we employ automatic techniques based on computational linguistics and for step (b), statistical time series monitoring. A lead time of more than two months can be obtained for the Ebola epidemic when these automatic techniques are applied to tweets.</p><p>Most past work in social media-based infectious disease surveillance uses datasets created using a set of symptom words. The goal is to signal a disease outbreak before official health systems detect it. This is not to say that social media-based epidemic intelligence would replace human expertise. However, social media brings value in terms of being real-time and originated by human users. However, past work monitors several symptoms of an illness as a collection, and constructs a stream of tweets that is then monitored. For example, for detection of influenza, tweets containing reports of cough, cold, and fever may be considered. However, different symptoms have different prior probabilities of being reported (for example, a fever may be more common than rash or a fever may be reported with less stigma as compared to rash) and different seasonal appearances (for example, cold may be more common in winters while dehydration may be more common in summers). Therefore, tweets reporting each of these symptoms may have different time series behaviours in terms of magnitudes and trends. In this regard, our paper differs from past work in social media-based infectious disease surveillance. Specifically, we address the question:</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;<italic>Since different symptoms of a disease may have different attributes</italic>, <italic>in what ways can tweets that report each of these symptoms be combined to detect the disease</italic>?&#x0201d;</p></disp-quote><p>An investigation into this question is likely to impact social media-based syndromic surveillance for other epidemics as well. Towards this, we adapt an architecture that we had previously reported for early detection of disease events using social media[<xref rid="pone.0230322.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The architecture takes as input a set of tweets and returns a set of alerts, where an alert indicates the possibility of an unexpected behaviour, thereby indicating an epidemic. The original architecture handles only one symptom at a time. To address the question above, we experiment with two variations of the architecture. The first variation uses a combined stream of tweets reporting different symptoms. The second variation obtains alerts from the architecture for each symptom separately and then combines these alerts. We refer to the prior as &#x02018;Data Aggregation&#x02019; because it provides the data for different symptoms together as an input to the architecture, and to the latter as &#x02018;Alert Aggregation&#x02019; because it collects the alerts generated by the architecture for each symptom. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that examines whether the monitoring algorithm should handle symptoms separately or together, for social media-based infectious disease surveillance. In addition, it is the first automatic monitoring for the Ebola epidemic using symptomatic data.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>The Ebola epidemic of 2014</title><p>The 2014&#x02013;16 epidemic of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in West Africa highlighted the importance of Internet-based surveillance methods.

Hossein et al. [<xref rid="pone.0230322.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] found that searching the keyword &#x02018;Ebola&#x02019; in ProMED reports show awareness of spread of Ebola in early April 2014. Similar keyword searches in Google Trends revealed few initial results in March and April, 2014. Alicino et al. [<xref rid="pone.0230322.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] compared Ebola-related relative search volumes (RSVs) by regions reported by Google Trends. The highest RSVs were from the three main affected countries. Liberia had the highest score, followed by Sierra Leone and Guinea. However, the most searches for the keyword &#x02018;Ebola&#x02019; occurred on October 16, 2014 when President Obama issued a press release calling National Guard reserves to contain Ebola[<xref rid="pone.0230322.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In contrast, the first tweet from affected countries mentioning &#x02018;Ebola&#x02019; came as early as December 26, 2013. However, the content of the tweet&#x02013;&#x0201c;This Ebola of a virus come bad pass HIV &#x02026;May God help us,&#x0201d; appeared ambiguous as the user typically posted about football. The next tweet containing Ebola was on March 25th, 2014 &#x02013;&#x0201c;Guinea has banned the sale and consumption of bats to prevent the spread of the deadly Ebola virus,&#x0201d; showing stronger relevance to the outbreak[<xref rid="pone.0230322.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Different programs or algorithms have been used to extract data from online sources, ranging from text parsing and using the Twitter API to using Google Trends[<xref rid="pone.0230322.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230322.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230322.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

No literature to our knowledge has yet analysed the utility of symptom data from tweets for the detection of EVD[<xref rid="pone.0230322.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Thus, the aim of our study is to evaluate the value of symptomatic tweets for rapid infectious disease surveillance of the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, using automated monitoring.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Architecture</title><p>We adapt an architecture that has been reported for early detection of disease events using tweets[<xref rid="pone.0230322.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This architecture consists of four steps:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p><bold>Initial selection</bold>: Tweets are selected based on location, date range and keywords. The keywords are words indicating a symptom. The location is derived based on either the tweet location, the author profile location or the location mention. The code is attached as a python notebook, Step 1.ipynb. Please note that Twitter authorisation keys to access the API have been removed since they are personal to this author.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Personal health mention classification</bold>: This step is necessary because a tweet containing a symptom word may not be the report of a symptom. The classifier uses tweet vectors as the feature representation for a statistical classification algorithm. A tweet vector is the average of word embeddings of content words in a tweet. The word embeddings used are pre-trained on a large corpus. A word embedding is a distributional representation of a word that is expected to capture the semantics of a word. The classification step uses support vector machines trained on a labelled dataset where each tweet is represented as its tweet vector. The code is attached as a python notebook, Step 2.ipynb.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Duplication removal</bold>: We retain the first tweet per day per user. This prevents multiple reports by the same user from swamping the system. It must be noted that this step follows the second step where a classifier has predicted a tweet as a health report. The code is attached as a python notebook, Step 3.ipynb.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Monitoring algorithm</bold>: In this step, we use a monitoring algorithm based on time-between-events[<xref rid="pone.0230322.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Time-between-events corresponds to the duration between consecutive events in a time series. Of relevance to our algorithm is the event of a tweet being posted. Using in-control data, the algorithm fits a Weibull distribution and estimates its parameters. During test time, the algorithm computes the expected duration between times of posting for consecutive tweets. When the time between consecutive tweets is shorter than an expected value, the tweet is flagged. When p such consecutive tweets are flagged, an alert is generated. The detailed code of the monitoring algorithm has been implemented in R, and is included in the appendix.</p></list-item></list><p>In the paper that reported the above architecture[<xref rid="pone.0230322.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], we experimented with individual symptoms related to asthma. Therefore, the four steps above were applied in sequence separately for each symptom. Alerts for a symptom were used as a proxy for an alert of the disease. In this paper, we adapt the architecture to be able to handle a collection of symptoms pertaining to the disease being monitored. The two variations are called Data Aggregation and Alert Aggregation.</p><sec id="sec004"><title>Data aggregation</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230322.g001">Fig 1</xref> shows the architecture for Data Aggregation. In this case, we use two modules of the initial selection step, one for each symptom. The data is aggregated into a common pool, indicated by the &#x02018;+&#x02019;. In other words, tweets for different symptoms are indistinguishable after this stage. Following this, the three steps, namely personal health mention classification, duplication removal and monitoring algorithm, remain the same as in the original architecture. Therefore, the monitoring algorithm works on tweets related to all symptoms of interest together. Since steps 2, 3 and 4 are the same as the base 4-step architecture, data aggregation closely resembles past architecture.</p><fig id="pone.0230322.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0230322.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Adapted architecture using Data Aggregation.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0230322.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Alert aggregation</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230322.g002">Fig 2</xref> shows the architecture for Alert Aggregation.

This combination can be performed in two ways: (a) union, where an alert for a given day is generated by the overall architecture if it was generated by one of the channels; and, (b) intersection, where an alert for a given day is generated by the overall architecture if an alert was generated by all the channels on that day.

TPSA allows two key advantages over the free API. It provides full access to historical tweets, while the free API restricts the caller to tweets posted within the last 30 days. TPSA also allows composite search queries that combine location, keyword and date range parameters, while the free API allows calls restricted to one of the parameters (for example, either location or keyword). We used TPSA to download tweets using the following parameters:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Date range: December 2011 to December 2014.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Locations: We search for locations in key locations in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. The details are provided in the Appendix. TPSA searches for a location using three arguments: latitude, longitude (indicating the location) and a radius (indicating the distance from the location. This can be up to 40 km). We observed that TPSA returns significantly higher number of tweets from Monrovia, the capital city of Liberia. Therefore, Monrovia is the key location of our dataset. This is expected since, among Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, Liberia had the highest access to the Internet (16.5%, as against 1.6% and 1.7%) during the outbreak[<xref rid="pone.0230322.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>Symptoms: For viral haemorrhagic fevers, systems of high sensitivity are expected.

We observe spikes in the counts around the period of the epidemic. This result encourages us to apply automated techniques for the Ebola epidemic. The counts do not track the epidemic curve because, when the epidemic becomes known, corresponding chatter is also observed on social media. It is not possible to break down over multiple locations because the tweets returned may not have the exact city name as a text in any of the fields but contain latitude/longitude parameters as present in the geolocation that is tagged with the tweet. We reiterate that, in the rest of the paper, we use a combination of computational linguistics and time series monitoring, and do not rely on manual selection or counting of either tweets or outbreak signals.</p><fig id="pone.0230322.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0230322.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Daily counts in the aggregated dataset for both the symptoms.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0230322.g003"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec008" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>In our previous work [<xref rid="pone.0230322.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], we used two false discovery rates in Step 4, namely the monitoring algorithm: 1 in 1000 and 1 in 2000.

Our results lead us to two key conclusions:</p><sec id="sec014"><title>Social media provides an alert for the 2014 Ebola epidemic, three months in advance</title><p>Using social media-based monitoring, we obtain the earliest alert in December 2013, three months before the announcement. This holds true for all versions of our architecture. It must be noted that the countries of interest have lower internet penetration and lower mobile subscriber penetration than the world average. We show that, despite that, social media-based infectious disease surveillance can lead to early alerts.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Data aggregation may result in more frequent alerts as compared to alert aggregation</title><p>Most work in social media-based surveillance downloads tweets containing a set of keywords and then applies monitoring algorithms (which we refer to as Data Aggregation). We compare this with an approach where tweets related to each symptom are separately analysed using the monitoring algorithm (we refer to this as Alert Aggregation). We observe that Alert Aggregation results in less frequent alerts than Data Aggregation. Therefore, depending on the desired frequency of these alerts, one of the two strategies can be chosen for future work in social media-based infectious disease surveillance.</p><p>As future work, our architecture could be adapted for other social media platforms or disease types. Our choice of Twitter as a social media platform is due to the availability of its API for research purposes. The architecture may be applicable to other social media platforms with usage frequency and content similar to Twitter. The architecture may need to be modified for a social media platform that gets used less frequently or has longer posts. Also, we apply the architecture for Ebola in this paper. This could be applied to unexpected diseases such as acute disease events, or common diseases such as influenza.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0230322.s001"><label>S1 Code</label><caption><p>(ZIP)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0230322.s001.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0230322.s002"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0230322.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0230322.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Peterson</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name> and <name><surname>Brossette</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name>, <article-title>Hunting Health Care-Associated Infections from the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory: Passive, Active, and Virtual Surveillance</article-title>. <source>Journal of Clinical Microbiology</source>, <year>2002</year>

Using this social media-based monitoring, an early alert was detected in December 2013, three months before the official announcement.</p><p>The authors took into account the probability and relevance of a symptom, its seasonal appearance and its occurrence over time, which are important in terms of specificity to the disease, when trying to combine symptom reports to detect a disease alert in social media.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>1. The sentence at the end of the abstract &#x0201c;An additional observation of relevance to infectious disease surveillance in general, is regarding the second adaptation which produces a restricted but useful set of alerts&#x0201d; could be edited in order to convey the message more strongly. It could be rephrased as &#x0201c;The second adaptation, which produces a restricted but useful set of alerts, could potentially be applied in other infectious disease surveillance and alert systems&#x0201d;</p><p>2. The authors correctly report that the symptoms they searched for were fever and rash. However, they do not adequately explain why they have not tried to incorporate other (than muscle pain) symptoms of ebola virus disease, like headache, diarrhea, vomiting or bleeding in the architecture.</p><p>3. The authors could discuss in more detail if and how their model is applicable in other social media platforms or other (rare or common) diseases.</p><p>Reviewer #2: In the paper &#x0201c;Automated monitoring of tweets for early detection of the 2014 Ebola epidemic&#x0201d; the authors present two methods for analyzing the language in social media posts (specifically Twitter &#x0201c;tweets&#x0201d;) to give epidemic alerts. These two methods are described as adaptations of an architecture which has just been accepted for publication elsewhere (the authors citation number 8). Using a data set of tweets from between 2011 and 2014 the authors are able to predict the Ebola epidemic in West Africa three months prior to what they call the official announcement of the epidemic. They do this by analyzing the frequency of the use of words relevant to a particular disease. I find the subject matter of the paper interesting and important, however I do not feel like the authors have done a sufficient job explaining why their approach is different or better from other methods being used in the literature. Although I find it likely that the method presented in the paper improves upon their previous architecture, I would have appreciated it if the need for improvement was addressed. The performance between these two architectures was discussed, but a performance comparison with their previous architecture for this particular data set was not mentioned. Unfortunately the data used is not publicly available, since a premium twitter API requires that the user pay a monthly fee, and so I have to recommend rejection, although I do believe that after some editing the paper deserves to be published, just not in a public library of science journal.</p><p>PLOS One has seven criteria for publication which I will address in turn.</p><p>1. &#x0201c;The study presents the results of primary scientific research&#x0201d;. The authors present a comparison of two novel architectures on a data set of tweets, and so is a paper describing a new methodology, and does meet PLOS One&#x02019;s crieteria for &#x0201c;primary scientific research&#x0201d;.</p><p>2. &#x0201c;Results reported have not been published elsewhere&#x0201d;. As far as I can tell this is the case.</p><p>3. &#x0201c;Experiments, statistics, and other analyses are performed to a high technical standard and are described in sufficient detail&#x0201d;. Other papers that aim to use social media posts to predict disease often have more technical statistical methods for analysis, or are implementing more standard methods of data sorting for prediction, such as Decision Trees and Random Decision Forests. The lack of such methodology is not a failing of the paper, I assume that this is one of the merits of the methodology. If it works about as well, or maybe even better, but is simpler to understand and implement, then it qualifies as preferable by those standards. If that is the case I think that it should be highlighted, and other works should be cited for comparison. I think that the four step method deserves a bit more detail. For instance, &#x0201c;The algorithm computes the expected duration between consecutive tweets. When the time between consecutive tweets is shorter than an expected value, the tweet is flagged&#x0201d;. Although I can imagine how this is being done, I do not find it clearly stated how it is done.</p><p>4. &#x0201c;Conclusions are presented in an appropriate fashion and are supported by the data&#x0201d;. The conclusions stated seem to be factual.</p><p>5. &#x0201c;The article is presented in an intelligible fashion and is written in standard English&#x0201d;. There are instances in which the grammar needs to be fixed. As I understand it, there is no copy editor, and so the authors must do this themselves. As an example, &#x0201c;Most past work in social media-based infectious disease surveillance uses datasets created using a set of symptom words. before official health systems detect it.&#x0201d;, which appears in the third paragraph of the introduction. This certainly hurts the readability, and for this sentence in particular, does not qualify as intelligible. Other than the overt mistakes, the paper is intelligible.</p><p>6. &#x0201c;The research meets all applicable standards for the ethics of experimentation and research integrity&#x0201d;. I see no issues.</p><p>7. &#x0201c;The article adheres to appropriate reporting guidelines and community standards for data availability&#x0201d;. It is reported here that &#x0201c;For our experiments, we created a dataset of tweets. We used the Twitter Premium Search API&#x02026;&#x0201d;. Twitter premium search API has a monthly fee associated with it, and so fails to meet the criteria of PLOS journals &#x0201c;PLOS journals require authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction at the time of publication&#x0201d;. Having to pay for the data is a restriction.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.
