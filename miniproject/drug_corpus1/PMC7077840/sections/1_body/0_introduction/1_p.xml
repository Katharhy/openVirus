<p>Infectious disease surveillance systems differ in terms of their objective and scope[
 <xref rid="pone.0230322.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These systems have traditionally utilised information sources such as health encounters, medical records, hospital statistics, disease registries, over-the-counter drug sales data, laboratory results and surveys. However, for the purpose of early epidemic detection, traditional surveillance data are less timely and sensitive due to factors such as the long process of data validation, influence of bureaucracy, politics, higher costs and resource requirements[

 <xref rid="pone.0230322.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The WHO website states that early indicators for more than 60% of epidemics can be found through informal sources such as social media. Therefore, traditional surveillance can be supplemented through the use of publicly available data from internet-based or electronic platforms such as search engines, social media, blogs or forums[

 <xref rid="pone.0230322.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. When combined with signals and information from traditional sources and agencies, social media-based surveillance of infectious diseases can assist early detection of public health emergencies. While all infections or symptoms may not necessarily get reported on social media due to a variety of reasons, we claim that a change in the prevalence of symptom reports on social media can be an indicator of an outbreak, and can supplement traditional infectious disease surveillance.
