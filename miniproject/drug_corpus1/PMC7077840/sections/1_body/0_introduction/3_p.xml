<p>Most past work in social media-based infectious disease surveillance uses datasets created using a set of symptom words. The goal is to signal a disease outbreak before official health systems detect it. This is not to say that social media-based epidemic intelligence would replace human expertise. However, social media brings value in terms of being real-time and originated by human users. However, past work monitors several symptoms of an illness as a collection, and constructs a stream of tweets that is then monitored. For example, for detection of influenza, tweets containing reports of cough, cold, and fever may be considered. However, different symptoms have different prior probabilities of being reported (for example, a fever may be more common than rash or a fever may be reported with less stigma as compared to rash) and different seasonal appearances (for example, cold may be more common in winters while dehydration may be more common in summers). Therefore, tweets reporting each of these symptoms may have different time series behaviours in terms of magnitudes and trends. In this regard, our paper differs from past work in social media-based infectious disease surveillance. Specifically, we address the question:</p>
