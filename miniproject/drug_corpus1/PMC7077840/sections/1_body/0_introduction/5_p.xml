<p>An investigation into this question is likely to impact social media-based syndromic surveillance for other epidemics as well. Towards this, we adapt an architecture that we had previously reported for early detection of disease events using social media[
 <xref rid="pone.0230322.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The architecture takes as input a set of tweets and returns a set of alerts, where an alert indicates the possibility of an unexpected behaviour, thereby indicating an epidemic. The original architecture handles only one symptom at a time. To address the question above, we experiment with two variations of the architecture. The first variation uses a combined stream of tweets reporting different symptoms. The second variation obtains alerts from the architecture for each symptom separately and then combines these alerts. We refer to the prior as ‘Data Aggregation’ because it provides the data for different symptoms together as an input to the architecture, and to the latter as ‘Alert Aggregation’ because it collects the alerts generated by the architecture for each symptom. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that examines whether the monitoring algorithm should handle symptoms separately or together, for social media-based infectious disease surveillance. In addition, it is the first automatic monitoring for the Ebola epidemic using symptomatic data.
