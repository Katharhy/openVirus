<p>In this paper, we investigate if early indicators of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa in 2014 can be obtained from social media posts. This epidemic is regarded as one of the deadliest epidemics in recent times that resulted in a high loss of life and severe stress to medical services in the countries impacted. We evaluate the possibility of surveillance using a dataset of tweets—social media posts published on Twitter—posted between 2011 and 2014 in key cities of the affected region in West Africa. A typical pipeline for a surveillance system to monitor infectious diseases using social media consists of two steps: (a) collection of social media posts reporting symptoms related to the infectious disease; and, (b) application of a monitoring algorithm to generate alerts for an epidemic[

A lead time of more than two months can be obtained for the Ebola epidemic when these automatic techniques are applied to tweets.
