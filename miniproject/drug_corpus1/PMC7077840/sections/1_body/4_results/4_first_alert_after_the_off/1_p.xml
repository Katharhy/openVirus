<p>For Alert Aggregation (union), we observe an alert on 31
 <sup>st</sup> March 2014, soon after the official announcement of the epidemic. However, in the case of Data Aggregation, the first alert after the official announcement is on 24
 <sup>th</sup> April, 2014. Because the data streams are separate in the Alert Aggregation architecture, the alert is sooner than in the case of Data Aggregation.
