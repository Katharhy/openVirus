 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230322.g001">Fig 1</xref> shows the architecture for Data Aggregation. In this case, we use two modules of the initial selection step, one for each symptom. The data is aggregated into a common pool, indicated by the ‘+’. In other words, tweets for different symptoms are indistinguishable after this stage. Following this, the three steps, namely personal health mention classification, duplication removal and monitoring algorithm, remain the same as in the original architecture. Therefore, the monitoring algorithm works on tweets related to all symptoms of interest together. Since steps 2, 3 and 4 are the same as the base 4-step architecture, data aggregation closely resembles past architecture.
