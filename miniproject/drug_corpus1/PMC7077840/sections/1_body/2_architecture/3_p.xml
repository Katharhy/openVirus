<p>In the paper that reported the above architecture[
 <xref rid="pone.0230322.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], we experimented with individual symptoms related to asthma. Therefore, the four steps above were applied in sequence separately for each symptom. Alerts for a symptom were used as a proxy for an alert of the disease. In this paper, we adapt the architecture to be able to handle a collection of symptoms pertaining to the disease being monitored. The two variations are called Data Aggregation and Alert Aggregation.
