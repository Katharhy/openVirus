 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230322.g002">Fig 2</xref> shows the architecture for Alert Aggregation. In this case, we use multiple channels of the four-step architecture, one channel for each symptom. The final step is a combination where alerts from all channels are combined. This is indicated by the ‘+’. This combination can be performed in two ways: (a) union, where an alert for a given day is generated by the overall architecture if it was generated by one of the channels; and, (b) intersection, where an alert for a given day is generated by the overall architecture if an alert was generated by all the channels on that day. We refer to these as Alert Aggregation (union) and Alert Aggregation (intersection), respectively.
