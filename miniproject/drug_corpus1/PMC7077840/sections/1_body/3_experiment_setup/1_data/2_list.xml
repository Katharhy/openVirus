  <p>Locations: We search for locations in key locations in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. The details are provided in the Appendix. TPSA searches for a location using three arguments: latitude, longitude (indicating the location) and a radius (indicating the distance from the location. This can be up to 40 km). We observed that TPSA returns significantly higher number of tweets from Monrovia, the capital city of Liberia. Therefore, Monrovia is the key location of our dataset. This is expected since, among Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, Liberia had the highest access to the Internet (16.5%, as against 1.6% and 1.7%) during the outbreak[

  <p>Symptoms: For viral haemorrhagic fevers, systems of high sensitivity are expected. To achieve high sensitivity, we use one early symptom: fever, and one late symptom of Ebola: rash. (

   <bold>muscle pain</bold> but the corresponding stream of tweets did not fit the distribution as required by the time-between-events algorithm. We experimented with 
   <bold>bleeding</bold> and 
   <bold>red eyes</bold> but the number of tweets obtained were too few. Therefore, as a simplistic setting, we stick to two symptoms: fever and rash. This also makes the union and intersection operations simpler. While the architecture could be applied to more than two symptoms in principle, we restrict to only two symptoms of Ebola.
