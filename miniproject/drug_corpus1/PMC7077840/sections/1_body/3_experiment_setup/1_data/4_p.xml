<p>A common reluctance against using social media for surveillance stems from questions over its popularity in the affected region. The mobile subscriber penetration rate in 2016 was 43% in Sub-Saharan Africa, lower than the global average of 66% [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230322.g003">Fig 3</xref> shows the daily counts in the aggregated dataset over the date range. We observe spikes in the counts around the period of the epidemic. This result encourages us to apply automated techniques for the Ebola epidemic. The counts do not track the epidemic curve because, when the epidemic becomes known, corresponding chatter is also observed on social media. It is not possible to break down over multiple locations because the tweets returned may not have the exact city name as a text in any of the fields but contain latitude/longitude parameters as present in the geolocation that is tagged with the tweet. We reiterate that, in the rest of the paper, we use a combination of computational linguistics and time series monitoring, and do not rely on manual selection or counting of either tweets or outbreak signals.
