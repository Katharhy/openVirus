<p>In our previous work [
 <xref rid="pone.0230322.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], we used two false discovery rates in Step 4, namely the monitoring algorithm: 1 in 1000 and 1 in 2000. The alerts for the false discovery rate of 1 in 2000 were far too few and have not been reported. Similarly, they used two classifiers for the second step, namely the personal health mention classification: SVM and SVM-Perf. We choose support vector machines as the classifier training algorithms because they have shown to perform better than decision trees and random forests for personal health mention classification [
 <xref rid="pone.0230322.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. For alerts obtained using SVM, we point the reader to the Appendix. The results in the Appendix show that the adapted architecture using SVM-Perf obtains more relevant alerts than the one using SVM. Therefore, in the following section, we report results on SVM-Perf as the classification algorithm and a false discovery rate of 1 in 1000.
