<p>As future work, our architecture could be adapted for other social media platforms or disease types. Our choice of Twitter as a social media platform is due to the availability of its API for research purposes. The architecture may be applicable to other social media platforms with usage frequency and content similar to Twitter. The architecture may need to be modified for a social media platform that gets used less frequently or has longer posts. Also, we apply the architecture for Ebola in this paper. This could be applied to unexpected diseases such as acute disease events, or common diseases such as influenza.</p>
