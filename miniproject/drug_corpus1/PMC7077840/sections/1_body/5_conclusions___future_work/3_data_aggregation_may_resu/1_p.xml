<p>Most work in social media-based surveillance downloads tweets containing a set of keywords and then applies monitoring algorithms (which we refer to as Data Aggregation). We compare this with an approach where tweets related to each symptom are separately analysed using the monitoring algorithm (we refer to this as Alert Aggregation). We observe that Alert Aggregation results in less frequent alerts than Data Aggregation. Therefore, depending on the desired frequency of these alerts, one of the two strategies can be chosen for future work in social media-based infectious disease surveillance.</p>
