<p>Reviewer #2: In the paper “Automated monitoring of tweets for early detection of the 2014 Ebola epidemic” the authors present two methods for analyzing the language in social media posts (specifically Twitter “tweets”) to give epidemic alerts. These two methods are described as adaptations of an architecture which has just been accepted for publication elsewhere (the authors citation number 8). Using a data set of tweets from between 2011 and 2014 the authors are able to predict the Ebola epidemic in West Africa three months prior to what they call the official announcement of the epidemic. They do this by analyzing the frequency of the use of words relevant to a particular disease. I find the subject matter of the paper interesting and important, however I do not feel like the authors have done a sufficient job explaining why their approach is different or better from other methods being used in the literature. Although I find it likely that the method presented in the paper improves upon their previous architecture, I would have appreciated it if the need for improvement was addressed. The performance between these two architectures was discussed, but a performance comparison with their previous architecture for this particular data set was not mentioned. Unfortunately the data used is not publicly available, since a premium twitter API requires that the user pay a monthly fee, and so I have to recommend rejection, although I do believe that after some editing the paper deserves to be published, just not in a public library of science journal.</p>
