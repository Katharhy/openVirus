<p>3. “Experiments, statistics, and other analyses are performed to a high technical standard and are described in sufficient detail”. Other papers that aim to use social media posts to predict disease often have more technical statistical methods for analysis, or are implementing more standard methods of data sorting for prediction, such as Decision Trees and Random Decision Forests. The lack of such methodology is not a failing of the paper, I assume that this is one of the merits of the methodology. If it works about as well, or maybe even better, but is simpler to understand and implement, then it qualifies as preferable by those standards. If that is the case I think that it should be highlighted, and other works should be cited for comparison. I think that the four step method deserves a bit more detail. For instance, “The algorithm computes the expected duration between consecutive tweets. When the time between consecutive tweets is shorter than an expected value, the tweet is flagged”. Although I can imagine how this is being done, I do not find it clearly stated how it is done.</p>
