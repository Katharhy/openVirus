<p>Reviewer #1: This is a very interesting article where the investigators used datasets derived from social media (tweets) and applied two adaptations of an existing surveillance architecture with automated monitoring to test for early detection of the 2014 Ebola epidemic. Using this social media-based monitoring, an early alert was detected in December 2013, three months before the official announcement.</p>
