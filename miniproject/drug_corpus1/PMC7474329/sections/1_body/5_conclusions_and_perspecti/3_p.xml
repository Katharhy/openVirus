<p id="Par60">Due to the multifaceted interactions between nanomaterials and biological systems (in vivo), it is very challenging to foresee the behaviour of these materials under physiological conditions. Once within the body, the nanoparticles reach the blood circulation, which is a very complex matrix containing ions, small molecules, proteins, and cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR206">206</xref>]. It is already known that nanoparticles are able to interact with biomolecules, mainly proteins, resulting in the formation of protein corona [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR207">207</xref>]. The composition of protein corona is mainly driven by the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles. In other words, it is unique for each nanoparticulate system and influenced by several factors. Both protein-nanoparticle interaction and proteinâ€“protein interaction regulate the adsorption of protein on the surfaces of nanoparticles [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR207">207</xref>]. The formation of protein corona modifies the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles, consequently giving them a new biological identity, which is more significant in determining the biological response than the original properties of the nanoparticles [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR208">208</xref>]. Therefore, the characterization of protein corona is an essential step to be investigated in the process of nanomedicine development.
