<p id="Par61">In conclusion, as this review shows, nanotechnology has already been shown to enhance diagnostics, protection and therapies in other viral infections; therefore, there is a good chance that, with more R&amp;D, it will revolutionize the fight against COVID-19 (and any other future outbreaks), offering processes, materials and tools to enhance sensitivity, speed and reliability of diagnosis, as well as providing more efficacious options for therapies. However, as researchers working with nanotechnology, we believe that only through effective and close collaboration between the different society stakeholders will we be able to respond quickly to any future global health emergencies. Therefore, it is extremely important that research centres, universities, commercial companies, and the medical community, as well as regulatory agencies and the government, combine efforts to streamline the use of these new tools and technologies for the benefit and protection of society. We also emphasize the need for investment in scientific research, both through public and private funding. This will make it possible to produce and transform knowledge into products, which, in addition to combating the current pandemic, will also provide means for prevention of future outbreaks.</p>
