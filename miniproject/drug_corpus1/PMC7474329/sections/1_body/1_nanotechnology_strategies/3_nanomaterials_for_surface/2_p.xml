 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] developed nano-disinfectants based on engineered water nanostructures (EWNS) generated through an electrospray and aqueous suspension ionization of different active ingredients. The results showed a significant reduction in pathogen concentration (including H1N1 influenza). In addition, the active ingredient (hydrogen peroxide) doses needed for inactivation were significantly lower (nanogram level), indicating the viability of this platform. The Nanotech Surface Company, for example, provides a disinfectant formulation based on titanium dioxide and silver nanoparticles. According to the company, the formulation allows the surfaces to be self-sterilized and was used recently during the COVID-19 pandemic for cleaning buildings in Milan [

Also, the company nanoSeptic developed a self-cleaning system for surfaces based on crystal nanoparticles, with one non-toxic system that did not generate residues. The nanoparticles promote an oxidation reaction process that is potentialized by light and acts against viruses or other microorganisms, keeping surfaces (such as door handles, elevator buttons and cell phones) clean [
