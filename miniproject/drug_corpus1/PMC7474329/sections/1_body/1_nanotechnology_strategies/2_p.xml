<p id="Par11">In a recent paper published by Huang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], authors described the prospects for researchers in the physical sciences and engineering fields to study these challenges and seek new solutions. Among the highlighted areas is the search for more efficient disinfectants and sanitizers. According to the authors, due to the different practical operations carried out, as well as volatilization processes, deparaffination, and degradation, water or alcohol-based disinfectants may not work completely and evenly on entire surfaces. Therefore, it is necessary to develop disinfectants and sanitizers that can last longer on surfaces, being resistant to constant washing and friction, in addition to presenting non-toxic properties.
