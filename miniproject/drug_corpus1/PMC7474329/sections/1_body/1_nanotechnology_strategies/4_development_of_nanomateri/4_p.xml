<p id="Par19">This use of nanomaterial for facemasks has two positive points. First, facemask protection works as a filter plus microbicidal agent, resulting in blocking and inactivating/killing the pathogens. Second, the management of this material after its use becomes safer once the biggest part of pathogens is destroyed in contact with the masks reducing the probability of contamination during the undressing process. The technology patents also leave this technology open for the production of other kinds of PPE, such as visitor aprons, surgical aprons, medical and lab coats, foot protection and bedsheets, that can further help in avoiding the spread of pathogens [
