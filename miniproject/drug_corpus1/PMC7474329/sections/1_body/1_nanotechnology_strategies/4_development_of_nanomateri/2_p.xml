<p id="Par17">Examples of building hydrophobicity into textiles include the use of a billion tiny fibres, which are collectively called nanowhiskers, of hydrocarbons that are 3-fold smaller than a cotton fibre and increase surface tension, preventing absorption of droplets. Other methodologies include nanoscale 3D surfaces, structuring of materials and/or coating with hydrophobic nanoparticles [
