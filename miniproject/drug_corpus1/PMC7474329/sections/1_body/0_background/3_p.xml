<p id="Par4">Although the number of infected patients is continuously increasing, there are no officially approved drugs or vaccination for COVID-19 available yet. The current treatments are mainly based on symptomatic relief and respiratory support in seriously ill patients [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Efforts to develop effective, targeted and safe drugs and vaccines to control this virus are currently underway. Some scientists have been looking into the similarity of transmission between the novel SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV to develop drugs targeted towards highly conserved key proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], such as those involved in viral replication and proliferation. Examples of these proteins are spike, viral, and envelope proteins, as well as RNA proteases, which are specific viral targets. Host receptors and proteases, which are responsible for virus entry and endocytosis, are also potential targets for drug development [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Most of the currently available drugs for the treatment of viral infections fall in one of the followings classes: antiviral therapies, immune therapy, anti-inflammatory therapy, and other treatments that include traditional medicines based on natural products [
