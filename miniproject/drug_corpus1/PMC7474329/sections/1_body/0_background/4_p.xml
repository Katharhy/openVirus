<p id="Par5">The effectiveness of conventional treatments of viral infections progressively fades away because of viral mutations and the resulting emergence of new viral strains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Recently, the development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs has caught the attention of researchers, as these drugs are less predisposed to resistance and could be used against several types of viruses, including new strains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, the development of new drugs is lagging behind the need for them because of the long process necessary to prove their efficacy and safety [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. To overcome the limitations and to improve antiviral treatments, multidisciplinary research efforts are required toward the development of alternative antiviral therapies, targeting different phases in the viral replication cycle [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In this regard, nanotechnology has attracted increasing attention and has already been investigated for potential use in prevention and/or treatment of viral infections [
