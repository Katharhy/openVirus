<p id="Par56">Different from subunit vaccines, RNA-based vaccines work by introducing a mRNA encoding a disease-specific antigen. Once the sequence of interest is inside the cells, it serves as a template to produce the antigen (protein) in situ. After translation, the antigen could be extracellularly transported and recognized by antibodies or could be intracellularly processed and presented to T-cells, resulting in the humoral and cellular immune response, respectively [

On the vaccine front, Moderna, in collaboration with Vaccine Research Center at the U.S. National Institutes of Health, has developed mRNA vaccines (mRNA-1273) encapsulated in lipid-based nanoparticles. The vaccine is currently in a Phase II clinical trial, which has the participation of 600 healthy individuals (NCT04405076).
