<p id="Par50">So far, there are three different generations of vaccine formulations used to elicit immunological responses against infectious diseases, including attenuated or inactivated whole pathogen (first generation), recombinant subunit vaccines (second generation) and RNA or DNA vaccines (third generation) [

However, the genetic reversion of attenuated vaccines or infection of immunocompromised hosts, as well as the likely tumorgenicity of deactivated viruses, are essential safety issues. In addition, all microorganisms cannot be used as live vaccines, since some of them are extremely virulent and others are intrinsically immune evasive [
