<p id="Par51">As alternative to live attenuated or inactivated vaccines, the second generation of vaccines were developed, based on non-pathogenic resources, which could be synthetic peptides, inactivated toxins or recombinant subunit protein vaccines. However, some limitations of these types of vaccines are the poor immunogenicity of the antigens, needing an adjuvant to enhance its immune response. In addition, premature degradation of the antigen in hostile environments hinders the effectiveness of vaccines. Finally, so far, the most modern vaccines are based on DNA or RNA, which also have some disadvantages, such as failing to reach the target sites and the necessity of a prime-boost vaccination scheme with other immunogenic agents, as well as premature degradation of the antigen, which results in weak immune response [
