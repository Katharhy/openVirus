<p id="Par38">Also, curcumin has shown antiviral activity against several viral infections, including hepatitis, influenza, Zika virus, chikungunya virus and other sexually transmitted viruses. Just recently, Loutfy et al. synthesized chitosan nanoparticles loading curcumin against hepatitis C virus genotype 4a. Chitosan nanoparticles were able to inhibit 100% of viral infection and replication in human hepatoblastoma cells (Huh7) [

The antiviral activity of nanoparticles containing curcumin was due to disturbances in the fluidity of the virion membrane, but no changes in virion integrity were observed. Nanoparticles were able to inhibit both virus entry into the hepatoblastoma cell and replication. Curcumin is just one example within the wide range of natural compounds that can potentially be used to control viral infections, including COVID-19.
