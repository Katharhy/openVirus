<p id="Par43">In another strategy, siRNA also appear as a promising tool for the control of SARS-CoV-2. In 2005, Wu et al. evaluated the effectiveness of siRNA targeted to the coding sequences of the S protein of SARS-CoV-1, which is responsible for the pathogenicity of the virus, and the 3â€²-UTR region and obtained inhibitory effects on the replication of the virus in the Vero E6 cell line [
