<p id="Par40">Nanomaterials in the nanometre range (i.e. smaller or close to the size of viruses) may be combined with active antiviral substances to improve the bioavailability and interaction of the latter with the viral particles. The activity of some nanomaterials (e.g. silver and gold nanoparticles) may also contribute towards the overall antiviral action. An appropriately designed nanoparticle-antiviral drug combination can be expected to enhance the effect of the compounds in several ways (e.g. facilitate interaction with the viral particles, interfere with their entry into cells, increase bioavailability and stability of the formulation, and release antiviral agents in a controlled manner) [
