<p id="Par44">They indicate the highly conserved coding sequence for 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (nsp5) and the RNA polymerase-dependent viral RNA as targets for siRNA. However, due to its high molecular weight (~ 13 kDa), negative charge, easy degradation by enzymes and difficulty crossing cell membranes, naked siRNA could not reach the target cell efficiently. To overcome these hurdles, a non-viral gene delivery system has been studied to efficiently deliver them to target cells and/or tissues [
