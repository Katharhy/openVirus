<p id="Par41">Nanomaterials can be designed to have different functional groups on the surface and to bond with specific cell receptors, and these approaches can be used to block the contact of the virus with target cells. Loczechin et al. used carbon quantum dots (CQDs) combined with boric acid to inhibit human coronavirus HCoV-229E (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). In this study, the interaction of the functional groups (boronic acid) of the CQDs with the receptors of the virus and with glycoprotein S was observed, interfering in the binding of the virus with the cell [

In addition, CQDs were able to inhibit the virus in the replication step. In this way, this kind of approach could be useful for the inhibition of an infection with SARS-CoV-2 at different stages of the infection.
