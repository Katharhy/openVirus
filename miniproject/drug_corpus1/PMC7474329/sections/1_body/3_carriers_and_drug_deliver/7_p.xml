<p id="Par39">Therefore, the use of nano-based formulations has indicated a great potential for the control of viral infections, where nanoparticles can both enhance the efficacy of an antiviral drug and also reduce its toxicity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Nanotechnology has also been used to enhance the efficacy of antiviral drugs by overcoming their low bioavailability. The development of nanomaterials, such as nanogels, which can capture the viable virus particles or viral RNA/proteins, are also promising developments that can help in the fight against SARS-CoV-2 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">150</xref>]. The main goal of future research of nano-based antiviral therapies will be the development of nano-based formulations that can successfully target precise sites of viral infection (e.g. the respiratory system in the case of COVID-19), reduce drug toxicity in other tissues, and potentially have some intrinsic antiviral activity of its own.
