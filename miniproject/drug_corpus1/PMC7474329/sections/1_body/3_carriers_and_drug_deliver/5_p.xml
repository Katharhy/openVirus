<p id="Par37">Dormont et al. used squalene, an endogenous lipid for preparing nanoparticles loaded with the anti-inflammatory drugs adenosine and alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E), for targeted action in regions of acute inflammation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">147</xref>]. Mice in an acute hyperinflammatory state and with cytokine storm were treated with squalene nanoparticles, and a reduction in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an increase in the levels of IL-10 were observed, mitigating uncontrolled inflammation. In addition, it was observed that the encapsulation of adenosine increased its half-life and consequently increased its therapeutic effect when compared to non-encapsulated drugs. Due to the targeted delivery of adenosine to the loci of inflammation, combined with the ability of decreased reactive oxygen species at the inflammatory site, this nano-based formulation holds promise as a treatment for uncontrolled inflammation caused by coronavirus.
