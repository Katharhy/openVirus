<p id="Par35">It is already known that nanocarriers are able to change the pharmacokinetic parameters of the encapsulated drug and decrease drug concentration required for biological activity due to sustained and/or controlled release [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. In addition, the application of target ligands on the surface of nanocarriers for recognition of molecular components of the tissue/organ of interest is a very promising approach to boost antiviral effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>]. In summary, the association of the abovementioned FDA approved drugs with nano-based carriers seems to be revenue to create highly effective antiviral formulations and decrease the side effects and toxicity of conventional treatments of viral infections. In addition, it will be possible to decrease the speed of the development of resistance through the encapsulation of these drugs [
