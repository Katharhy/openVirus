<p id="Par33">With the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, it is necessary to search for strategies to contain this new and deadly human infection. Several drugs employed in the treatment of other diseases have been suggested as possible inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2; however, some of them can cause serious side effects or are still in the testing phase [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">129</xref>], and until now, there are none with proven efficacy. The antiviral substances considered to contain SARS-CoV-2 have, as their potential mechanism of action, an aim to change or inactivate viral surface proteins, such as the spike glycoprotein, that is responsible for their binding and entry into cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">130</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">131</xref>] or act in the inhibition of viral replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">132</xref>]. Although investigations regarding the efficacy of these and other drugs are in progress, it is important to consider that many of these substances have specific actions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">130</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">133</xref>], which makes them prone to loss of effectiveness as a result of possible viral mutations and development of resistance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. There is some evidence from analysing patient samples that SARS-CoV-2 is mutating, which may make available drugs ineffective [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>]. In addition, some drugs are only effective in high concentrations, which can cause toxicity to host cells and consequently side effects [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">134</xref>].
