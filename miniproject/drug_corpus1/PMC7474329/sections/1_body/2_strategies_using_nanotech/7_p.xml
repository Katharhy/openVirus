<p id="Par30">Another example is the graphene-based nanobiosensor reported by Seo et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>]. The authors developed the sensor to detect SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The sensor was produced using graphene nanosheets embedded with a specific antibody against the S protein of SARS-Co-V-2. Samples of antigenic protein, cultured virus, and a nasopharyngeal swab from patients with COVID-19 were used for system validation. The device was able to detect the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 in concentrations of 1 fg/mL in buffered saline. In addition, for clinical samples, a detection limit of 2.42 × 10
 <sup>2</sup> copies/mL was reached. According to the authors, the advantage of the methodology is that, in addition to being highly sensitive, it does not require the pre-treatment of samples, since the sensor was able to detect the spike antigen protein of SARS-CoV-2 suspended in universal transport medium.
