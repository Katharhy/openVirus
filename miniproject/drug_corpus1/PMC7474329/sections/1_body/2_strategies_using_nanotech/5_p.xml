<p id="Par28">Transcription of the virus genomic sequence was one of the main steps for the development of sensors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>]. It is known that, among the SARS-related viral genomes, three regions have conserved sequences, which are the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene responsible for the ORF1ab region of the open reading frame, the envelope protein (E) gene and the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) gene. These regions have been the focus of the primer and probe project, aiming at detection with considerable analytical sensitivity [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>]. The extraction of viral RNA is also the focus of the nanotechnology application, associating it with the use of molecular diagnostics already commonly applied. Research has shown that magnetic nanoparticles coated with silica can be used to quickly extract RNA from the virus in patient samples for later detection by RT-PCR [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>]. This cuts the needs for lengthy RNA extraction while also making the method more sensitive [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>]. Another important point to be highlighted is the use of hybrid systems that combine the use of biomolecules derived from viruses with nanostructures, being an approach widely used in the development of sensors [
