<p id="Par31">Amid the pandemic, we have witnessed rapid progress in the development of different diagnostic kits for COVID-19. However, the race continues and nanosensors are an integral part of this process in the search for new solutions and have contributed significantly to the process of translating in vitro systems into in vivo systems [

The effect of the corona protein, which is when the surface of nanoparticles in the medium of biological fluids is quickly covered by a selected group of biomolecules, has been extensively investigated for these nanosensors. When functionalized with the appropriate receptors, nanoparticles can act by specifically recruiting viral proteins during the formation of corona proteins [
