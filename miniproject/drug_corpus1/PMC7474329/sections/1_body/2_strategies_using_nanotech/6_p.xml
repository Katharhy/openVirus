<p id="Par29">In this context of hybrid systems, Moitra and collaborators [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>] reported the development of a selective assay that allows the detection of SARS-CoV-2 with the naked eye. The assay is based on gold nanoparticles coated with thiol-modified antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), specific for the N gene of SARS-CoV-2, capable of diagnosing positive cases in 10 min. According to the study, changes in surface plasmon resonance observed using a UV–vis spectrophotometer indicate the selective agglomeration of coated nanoparticles in the presence of a SARS-CoV-2 target RNA sequence (Fig.
