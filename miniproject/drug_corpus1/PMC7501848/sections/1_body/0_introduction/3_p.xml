<p id="p0015">This unprecedented global crisis has posed a significant challenge for the human and has brought forward our therapeutic limitations to fight against an unpredictable deadly virus. In recent years significant progress has been made in the understanding of viral gene functioning, viral genomics, and target-based drug designing which have stimulated the development of many therapeutic strategies capable of efficiently blocking viral gene expression [
