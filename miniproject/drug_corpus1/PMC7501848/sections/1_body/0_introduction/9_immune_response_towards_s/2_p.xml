 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The immune response towards any disease differs due to genetic variations from individual to individual. The SARS-CoV-2 infection can be classified into two categories: initial (non-severe) and latter (severe) [

SARS-CoV-2 infection in the respiratory system has been reported to activate nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), leading to the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), chemokines and tumor necrosis factors (TNFs) [
