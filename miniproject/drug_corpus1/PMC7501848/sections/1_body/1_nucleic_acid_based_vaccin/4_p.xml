<p id="p0060">Several nucleic acid-based molecules such as aptamers, siRNA, and miRNA have been used for the treatment of severe viral infections including HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus) [
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The infections caused by the H1N1 influenza A virus have been treated via the miRNA-based therapeutic molecules and have proved to be an effective medication [

 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Further, it has been reported that the ribozyme inhibited the infection of influenza virus both

 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In addition it was also found that modified ASOs (antisense oligonucleotides) were effective in suppression of the infection by influenza A/PR8/34 (H1N1) virus [
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. ASOs were also reported to be effective in the inhibition of RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) infection [
