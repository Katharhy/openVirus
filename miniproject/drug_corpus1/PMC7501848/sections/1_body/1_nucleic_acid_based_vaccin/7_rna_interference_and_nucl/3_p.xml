 <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Some of the molecules that have been extensively experimented in the past include antisense oligonucleotides, aptamers, siRNA, miRNA, etc [
 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. These therapeutic molecules have shown some promising effects against the viral infection in the respiratory tract and to several other diseases [
 <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. In a study conducted on the cultured Vero cells (kidney epithelial cells) obtained from African green monkeys, inhibition of replication of virus along with cytopathic attenuation effect was demonstrated upon administration of synthetic siRNAs [
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In particular, a strong inhibition in the replication of the virus was exhibited by the siRNAs, which targeted the

 <italic>S</italic> gene was also proven to be a good target for inhibition of SARS-CoV in the cultured cells via expressed RNAi activators [
 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. RNA interference has also been proven efficient in combating the influenza virus [
 <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] and RSV via targeting their mRNA [
