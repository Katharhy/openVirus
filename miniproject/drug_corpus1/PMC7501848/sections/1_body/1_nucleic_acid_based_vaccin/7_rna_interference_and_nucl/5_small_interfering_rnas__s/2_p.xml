<p id="p0110">Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are 21–23 base pairs long double-stranded molecules, which is used for silencing the target genes in a sequence-specific manner [
 <xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Whereas, micro RNAs (miRNAs) are 18–24 nucleotides long single-stranded endogenous non-encoding RNA molecules that are used as key regulators for various cellular functions [
 <xref rid="bib97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Both siRNAs and miRNAs can interact with the multifunctional protein, Argonaute-2, and associate into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) [
 <xref rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. The site-specific gene silencing effect of siRNAs enables it to be used as an indispensable tool for targeting the expression of the gene of interest. The therapeutic approaches involving siRNAs are more specific than miRNAs- mediated therapeutics as miRNAs have the ability to hybridize with mRNA having partially complementary sequences [
