<p id="p0085">The mRNA based vaccine needs an efficient delivery and expression into the cytoplasm but the plasma membrane hinders the entry of mRNA [
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Further, intramuscular delivery leads to a relatively low cellular and humoral response [

 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Hence, direct injection of naked mRNA can be executed through intranodal and intradermal administration in order to efficiently target the APCs [
