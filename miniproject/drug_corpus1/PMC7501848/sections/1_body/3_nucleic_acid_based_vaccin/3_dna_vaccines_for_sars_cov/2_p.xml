<p id="p0155">Developers like Takis, Karolinska Institute, and Inovio Pharmaceuticals are trying and testing various entry mechanisms for the DNA vaccines, including the needle injection and electroporation. Immunomic therapeutic and Osaka University are trying to develop a needle-free system for the delivery of DNA vaccines [

The Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Actranza™ lab and Pharmajet Tropis will be using a Needle-Free Injector System to deliver the vaccine through the intradermal route. The Immunomic Therapeutics, Inc selected SARS-CoV-2 DNA vaccines on the basis of their speculated ability to induce a potent immune response, and it will be ligated to the gene encoding the lysosomal-associated membrane protein (LAMP) for its successful delivery [
