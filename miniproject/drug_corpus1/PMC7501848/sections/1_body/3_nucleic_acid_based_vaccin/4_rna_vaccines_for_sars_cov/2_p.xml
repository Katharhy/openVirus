<p id="p0160">The mRNA-based vaccine has emerged out to a hopeful choice against SARS-CoV-2 for the development of the vaccine [
 <xref rid="bib138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. The mRNA based vaccines possess a beneficial edge over other biomolecules as it lacks the ability of integration into the genome, has the ability to induce autoantibodies, lack of persistence over time, their high purity and can be produced in large quantity to meet the need of vaccination [
 <xref rid="bib139" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. Moderna Inc. The USA, and Pfizer in collaboration with BioNTECH has selected mRNA based vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2. Arcturus Therapeutics and Imperial College London are utilizing self-replicating or self-amplifying mRNA [
