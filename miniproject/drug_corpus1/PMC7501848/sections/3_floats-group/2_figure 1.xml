  <p>Schematic representation of electroporation mediated gene transfer. The desired gene is introduced into the target cell by applying an electric pulse to it. The electric pulse generates electric pores into the cell membrane through which the desired gene gets into it. As soon as the electric pulse is removed, the gene remains into the cell as the electric pores are closed and the cell membrane is in normal state. A similar method has been adopted for the delivery of INO-4800 into the host.</p>
