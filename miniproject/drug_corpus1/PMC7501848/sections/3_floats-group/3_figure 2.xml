  <p>Schematic representation of lipid nanoparticle-mediated gene delivery. The nucleic acid can be either DNA or mRNA. A) In case of mRNA-1273, mRNA encoding pre-fusion spike protein is encapsulated in lipid nanoparticle. It is administrated intravenously into the patient. The ligand on lipid nanoparticle helps it to bind to the receptor and gets internalized through endocytosis. It is then, released into the cytosol where the gene enclosed in it gets released. mRNA is then translated into protein and the protein is translocated to the cell surface where it activates the immune cells to produce antibodies against it. B) If the nucleic acid is DNA, then it first goes into the nucleus to get transcribed into mRNA. In the cytoplasm, mRNA gets translated into the protein and the protein helps to generate an immune response in a similar way as stated above.</p>
