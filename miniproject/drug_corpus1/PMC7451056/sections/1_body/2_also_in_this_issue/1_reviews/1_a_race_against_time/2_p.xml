<p id="p0085">In the meantime, Shih etÂ al. sum up the recent state of affairs relating to diagnoses and treatment of COVID-19 in the present review [
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. They elaborate on the different levels of diagnosis starting with clinical symptoms and nucleic-acid-based identification methods, which are currently the most common tool for broad mass testing, as well as on the security issues with virus isolation and the challenges of antibody detection. Following this, the authors detail the therapeutic options under current investigation by their viral target site, plus some that could modulate the host immune system. Moreover, the option of SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralising antibodies is briefly discussed, which could be an efficient yet very expensive way to bridge the time until a safe vaccine is found [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Finally, different possible vaccine strategies are described with their respective advantages and risk factors [
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], which should be of major interest given the recent developments.
