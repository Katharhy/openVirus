 <xref rid="fn5" ref-type="fn">5</xref> Here, Dubey etÂ al. show that according to a computational docking model, the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 is bound by narcissoside with greater efficiency than the potent broad-spectrum non-covalent inhibitor X77. This suggests that the molecule could potentially act as a good inhibitor against the virus, and thus should be added on the list of compounds to be tested experimentally [
