<p id="p0050">In order to emphasise the urgent need for drugs and vaccines, the authors lay the foundations of their story by reminding the reader of the long list of emerging and re-emerging viral diseases that caused a worrying number of epidemics and pandemics over the past two decades [
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Subsequently, the design of their pseudovirus system is revealed: the classical VSV lentivirus vector system functions as the packaging vector, and is co-transfected with a RFP reporter plasmid and plasmids encoding either the full-length spike (S) protein sequence from SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, or the haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes from H5N2, H5N6, and H5N8 into 293T cells. The latter allow for the production of pseudotyped lentiviral particles, which are then used for the infection of chosen host cells.
