The scientific community has without doubt already made some extraordinary progress since the first cases of avian influenza, and the immediate sharing of data regarding SARS-CoV-2 – from sequences to numbers – has been exemplary. On the other side of the coin, the crisis has highlighted countless flaws of modern societies: unequal access to health coverage and treatment, public hospitals already on the verge of collapse before the start of the pandemic, the complete unpreparedness of governments for this type of scenario, and the dangers of massive media-fuelled misinformation. We can but hope that the enormous amount of data generated by this period will be carefully analysed and evaluated, and that the right and responsible conclusions will be drawn for the future.</p>
