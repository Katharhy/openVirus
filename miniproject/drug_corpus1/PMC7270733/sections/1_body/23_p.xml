<p id="p0120">As it usually happens, the serious crisis we fell into has to be taken as a real chance for all of us to rethink our own lives, thus turning into moral, social and scientific rebirth for the entire hard-hearted world of today. Specifically, for people living with diabetes, the COVID-19 pandemic is even more complicating life.
