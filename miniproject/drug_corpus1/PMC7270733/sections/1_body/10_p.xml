<p id="p0055">Another issue is the possible role of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4) in coronavirus infection that seems to be a further emerging issue as regards diabetes. In fact, Corona virus could bind to the human DPP-4 receptor. Kulcsar et al. used type 2 diabetic transgenic mouse models expressing DDP-4 receptor on pulmonary alveolar cells to study the effect of DM on MERS-coronavirus infection severity and, besides showing the latter to be longer-lasting and worse, found a significant association of DM with greater weight loss and pulmonary inflammation, with macrophage infiltrates similar to those seen clinically in the disease
