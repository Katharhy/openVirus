<p id="Par33">Of the 15 studies, nine are reported as completed, four were terminated due to the end of the H1N1 pandemic or declining case numbers and the status of two studies is not recorded. The anticipated and actual enrolment of patients into all studies is depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. Some study protocols excluded patients because of young age (25%) and pregnancy (50%). Results are available in the literature for three of the completed studies (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), representing 153 patients, and available on the clinical trials registry for an additional two of the terminated studies. A sub-group analysis of clinical trials that only included hospitalised or severe cases is provided in Additional file
