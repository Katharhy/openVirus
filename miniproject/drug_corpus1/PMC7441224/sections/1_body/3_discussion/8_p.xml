<p id="Par43">We report long delays between clinical data capture and publication in the peer-reviewed literature. This is consistent with analyses for other disease outbreaks, including epidemiology reporting for SARS (where only 7% of articles were published within the timeframe of the epidemic) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and randomised controlled trials of pandemic H1N1 vaccines (where only 29% of clinical trial results were published almost a year following the end of the pandemic) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The present WHO standard for interventional clinical trials is that main findings are to be submitted for publication within 12â€‰months of study completion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and although no such guidelines exist for observational clinical data, there are analogous scientific and ethical imperatives for timely reporting.
