<p id="Par46">This systematic review has several limitations. The scope of our review was narrowed due to the high volume of clinical literature discussing A(H1N1)pdm09. In particular, we focused only on hospitalised patients where most antivirals were used [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. There is likely to be considerable geographic variation in what illness severity necessitates hospitalisation which may have limited the inclusion of studies from countries where care models differ (including LMICs). Furthermore, only English language manuscripts were included which may have led to similar bias in included study geography. We included several publication types, including case series or observational studies to provide an estimate of patients who may have been eligible for inclusion in a clinical trial (noting this estimate does not represent the true number of hospitalised patients who were treated). The precision of any estimate is affected by excluding papers where treatment was not clearly defined and when pandemic strain influenza was not laboratory confirmed. Our estimates of patients enrolled in clinical trials is almost certainly an underestimationâ€”much of the momentum toward compulsory registration of clinical trials [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] occurred subsequent to the pandemic and trials may have been registered elsewhere and so it is likely that other trials were planned, initiated or even completed without public knowledge. We restricted our observational data collection to that captured before the end of the PHEIC, and while we recognise that research continued to occur during the second and third waves of the epidemic, differentiating this work from routine seasonal influenza research became difficult. Finally, there was only one reviewer for pragmatic reasons.
