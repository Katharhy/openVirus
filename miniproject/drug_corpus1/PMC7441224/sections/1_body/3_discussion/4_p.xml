<p id="Par39">Recommendations following the Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in West Africa suggest that clinical research should be initiated, enacted and completed by the time an epidemic peaks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. We found that from the time influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was first detected, it was over 3 months before prospective data collection began and 8 months before the first interventional trial began recruitment. While these delays compare well to recent evaluations of delays for other epidemic observational research [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] or clinical trials [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], it remains too slow.
