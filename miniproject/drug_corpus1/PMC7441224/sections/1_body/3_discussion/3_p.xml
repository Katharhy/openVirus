<p id="Par38">We found that most descriptions of treatment courses were in retrospective observational studies or case series, with few prospective studies launched. There was relative success, however, in enrolling A(H1N1)pdm09 patients in ongoing or seasonal influenza studiesâ€”of the 582 patients enrolled in a trial, 439 were enrolled in this manner. Indeed, conducting trials of therapeutics for similar diseases (such as seasonal influenza) during an inter-epidemic period has been proposed as a solution to improving the outbreak research response [

This occurs not only by allowing the rapid recruitment of individuals in the case of an outbreak (as was observed here) but also by testing trial design and establishing research capacity. Novel trial designs, such as adaptive, platform trials, should also be adopted as a way to expedite outbreak research [

Indeed, two large platform trials for therapeutics in COVID-19 are underway (RECOVERY [ISRCTN50189673] and Solidarity [ISRCTN83971151]) and already generating high-quality evidence [

These pre-prepared and pre-approved protocols can lay dormant, waiting for cases of pandemic respiratory viruses, and allow prior assessment of the logistics and feasibility of the protocol. An example of this type of protocol exists for severe acute respiratory infections (NCT02498587) and has been used to rapidly enrol patients with COVID-19.
