<p id="Par41">To ensure generalisability of findings, research responses to outbreaks should also be representative of geographic diversity and global epidemiology. In the results reported here, China was heavily represented and reported the majority of treatment courses described (14,680; 43.3% of the total). Patient characteristics (including age, gender and other risk factors) and healthcare systems vary substantially by country/region, with likely impacts on the suitability and relative efficacy of interventions in these different settings. A timely research response from one region will not necessarily be of benefit to the majority of the global at-risk population, particularly if low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are poorly represented in the epidemic evidence base. Indeed, the importance of strengthening the research capacity and infrastructure of LMICs to enable effective outbreak responses was highlighted following the EVD epidemic [
