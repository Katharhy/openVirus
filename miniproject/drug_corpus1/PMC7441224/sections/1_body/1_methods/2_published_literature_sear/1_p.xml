 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: appendix 2. To capture information on how many patients received treatment outside of a trial, we included case studies, case series and observational research in addition to interventional research. The single exception was to limit descriptions of the use of oseltamivir to publications with ten or more patients, because case reports were abundant. We included research that described hospitalised patients and reported acute clinical outcomes (defined as the length of hospitalisation, intensive care admission or length of stay, medical complication, requirement for mechanical ventilation or mortality). We included patients with only laboratory-confirmed disease. While A(H1N1)pdm09 was the prevailing strain during the outbreak, inconsistencies in defining probable cases between papers meant a consistent inclusion method was not possible. We included papers only if enrolment opened between April 1, 2009 (when the virus strain was first identified), and was completed by August 10, 2010 (the declaration of the end of the Public Health Emergency of International Concern [PHEIC]), by the World Health Organization (WHO). This limitation was necessary to differentiate research conducted specifically for the pandemic, compared with routine seasonal influenza reporting once A(H1N1)pdm09 became a seasonal strain. These criteria did not apply for clinical trials (where there could be no confusion with seasonal reporting).
