    <td>The volume of research gives an indication of the scale of the response mounted. Comparisons of different types of research (clinical trial, hypothesis-driven observational study, case series) describe the quality of evidence available</td>

    <td>Document the time taken to initiate and complete this clinical research and compare this to the outbreak epidemiology</td>
    <td>The faster that clinical research is commenced, the greater the pool of potential participants, and the greater the likelihood of enrolling a sufficient sample size and completing within the timeframe of the outbreak</td>

    <td>Document the time taken to submit and publish this research and compare this to the outbreak epidemiology</td>
    <td>Research can only influence patient treatment in the current outbreak by providing enhanced evidence if it is available to clinicians treating patients within the time-frame of the outbreak</td>

   <tr>
    <td>Describe the extent to which manuscripts report key clinical parameters, including those needed for stratification of treatment effect (the age of patients, the pregnancy status of patients) or indicate the quality of reporting of treatment effect (adverse events due to treatment)</td>
    <td>We have selected key parameters for assessment that would be necessary to know in order to evaluate a treatment effect.</td>
