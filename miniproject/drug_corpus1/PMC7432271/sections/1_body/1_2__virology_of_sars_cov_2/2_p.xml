<p>Several phylogenetic analyses of the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 suggests bats are the most likely animal reservoir. Full-genome evolutionary analysis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 with 96.3% sequence similarity [

Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from bats to humans is likely to have involved an intermediate host, as seen for SARS-CoV (palm civets) and MERS-CoV (dromedary camels). Metagenomic sequencing suggests that Pangolins could be the intermediate hosts due to the genome similarity of Pangolin-associated coronavirus to SARS-CoV-2 (approximately 85.5â€“92.4%) [

 <sup>3</sup> SARS-CoV-2 genomes by Tang et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] indicated that this virus has evolved into two main types, L and S types. The L type (~70%) is more prevalent than the S type (~30%), due to its higher transmission and/or replication rates, although the S type is older in evolutionary terms [
