<p>All subtypes of B lymphocytes are involved in the humoral immune response against coronavirus infections [
 <xref rid="B59-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Several antibodies which have been isolated and designated from MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infected patients are MERS-GD27, CDC-A2, CDC-C2, MCA1, CSC-C5, CDC-A10, and MERS-GD33. We could expect that structurally similar antibodies would be isolated from SARS-CoV-2 patients [
 <xref rid="B60-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein has been identified as an immunodominant and highly specific target for antibodies in affected patients [
 <xref rid="B61-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Since the RBD of the S protein is poorly conserved among SARS-CoVs and other coronaviruses it is a promising antigen for detecting coronavirus specific antibodies, as demonstrated by Premkumar et al. using a large panel of human sera [

 <xref rid="B63-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Zost et al. demonstrated that several human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the S glycoprotein, including COV-2196 and COV-2130, showed potential neutralizing activity and fully blocked the RBD from interacting with ACE2 [
 <xref rid="B64-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Similarly, epitope mapping by Liu et al. identified a short list of 19 antibodies, equally divided between those targeting the RBD or N-terminal domains, confirming that both are immunogenic [
