<p>Binding of SARS-CoV-2 to alveolar epithelial cells activates the immune system, leading to secretion of a large number of cytokines, including IL-6 [

 <xref rid="B75-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. IL-6 binds to soluble forms of IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and forms a complex with gp130 dimers on the cell surface, activating the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK-STAT3) signaling and inducing CRS [
 <xref rid="B74-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Subsequently, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), MCP-1, IL-8, and more IL-6 are secreted, while E-cadherin is downregulated on endothelial cells [
 <xref rid="B76-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. The reduction of E-cadherin and VEGF overexpression give rise to increased vascular permeability [
 <xref rid="B77-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. IL-6 activates B cells, enhances the expansion and proliferation of T cells, regulates CTL activity, promotes Th17 cell differentiation and inhibits the activation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) [
