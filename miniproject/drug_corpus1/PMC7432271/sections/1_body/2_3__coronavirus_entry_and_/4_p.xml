<p>The spike protein of coronaviruses forms a trimer that generates a crown-like structure on the envelope, giving this virus family its name (corona = crown) [
 <xref rid="B14-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This large glycoprotein is divided functionally into the S1 and S2 domains. The S1 domain (amino acids 15–680 in SARS-CoV) is responsible for virus binding to its receptor on the target cell and comprises two sub-domains: the N-terminal and the C-terminal of RBD which consists of 193 amino acids (318–510 in SARS-CoV). The S2 domain of the spike protein (amino acids 681–1255 in SARS-CoV) participates in cell membrane fusion [

 <xref rid="B21-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Cellular proteases including human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT), transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and cathepsin trigger cleavage of the S protein trimer in SARS-CoV, while furin makes the MERS-CoV S protein competent for fusion. TMPRSS2 is a serine protease localized to the plasma membrane that is responsible for proteolysis of the S protein after receptor-binding [
