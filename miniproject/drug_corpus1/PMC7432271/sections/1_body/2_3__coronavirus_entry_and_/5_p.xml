<p>The initial step during SARS-CoV-2 infection is the binding of S to its host receptors, inducing uptake of virus particles by endocytosis and fusion between host and viral membranes [
 <xref rid="B18-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Following membrane fusion and viral entrance, viral genomic RNA is released into the cytoplasm of infected cells. This uncoated RNA acts as a template for translation of the two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. The nsp3 and nsp5 encodes two protease enzymes named papain-like proteases (PLpro) and chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) which cleavage between pp1a and pp1ab to form nsps1–11 and 1–16, respectively [

The accessory and structural proteins are generated by translation of a nested set of subgenomic RNAs synthesized by the RTC. Moreover, a negative strand RNA template is transcribed and forms a complex with intermediate products for transcription of positive-sense mRNAs including the progeny genome and subgenomic RNA, mainly mediated by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) [

In the infected cell, newly synthesized viral genomic RNA, the structural nucleocapsid and envelope glycoproteins are assembled into viral particles in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. In the final step, budding of the viral particles occur through fusion of the plasma membrane and virion-containing vesicles, leading to release of newly formed virions [
