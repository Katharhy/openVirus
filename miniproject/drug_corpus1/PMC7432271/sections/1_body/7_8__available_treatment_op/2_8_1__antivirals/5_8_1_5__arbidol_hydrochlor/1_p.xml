<p>Arbidol (ARB; ethyl-6-bromo-4-[(dimethylamino) methyl]-5-hydroxy-1-methyl-2-[(phenylthio)methyl]-indole-3-carboxylate hydrochloride monohydrate), an indole derivative, is a broad-spectrum antiviral against various enveloped and non-enveloped viruses and is widely used in Russia and China [
 <xref rid="B133-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. Arbidol displays antiviral activity in vitro and/or in vivo against influenza viruses A, B and C, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-CoV, parainfluenza type 5, poliovirus, rhinovirus 14, coxsackievirus B5, hantavirus, Chikungunya virus, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) [
 <xref rid="B134-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. The anti-viral mechanism of arbidol is thought to relate to inhibition of viral fusion with target cell membranes and with the membranes of endosomes and consequently blockage of virus entry [
 <xref rid="B133-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. For influenza A and B viruses it targets hemagglutinin (HA), the major glycoprotein on the surface of the virion, thereby preventing infection [
 <xref rid="B135-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. For SARS-CoV, studies have shown direct antiviral effects of arbidol and arbidol mesylate in vitro, with arbidol mesylate reducing the reproduction of SARS-CoV five times more effectively than arbidol [
 <xref rid="B136-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. In China, limited clinical experience with arbidol for COVID-19 treatment has been described. In one study from Wuhan in 67 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 36 (53.7%) received arbidol treatment for a median duration of 9 days and demonstrated lower mortality rates (0% (0/36) vs. 16% (5/31)) and higher discharge rates (33% (12/36) vs. 19% (6/31)) compared with patients who did not receive this drug [

In a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label multicenter trial investigating the efficacy of favipiravir compared with arbidol in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, the clinical recovery rate at day 7 did not differ between the favipiravir and arbidol groups [

Currently, multiple clinical trials are investigating the efficacy of arbidol on COVID-19 patients in China and USA (NCT04260594, NCT04255017). Four clinical trials are comparing arbidol with oseltamivir, LPV/r and carrimycin for COVID-19 [
