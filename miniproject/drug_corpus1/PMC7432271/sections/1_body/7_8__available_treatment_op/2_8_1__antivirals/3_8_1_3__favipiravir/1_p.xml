<p>Favipiravir (FPV) is a guanine nucleic acid analogue approved for the treatment of resistant strains of influenza [
 <xref rid="B118-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. Intracellular phosphoribosylation of favipiravir generates the active form favipiravir-RTP (favipiravir ribofuranosyl-5B-triphosphate) which is a substrate for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of RNA viruses and inhibits polymerase activity [
 <xref rid="B118-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. Favipiravir suppresses the replication of flavi-, alpha-, filo-, bunya-, arena-, noro-, and of other RNA viruses [
 <xref rid="B119-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. Therefore, favipiravir may also have activity against SARS-CoV-2. The use of favipiravir for COVID-19 has been reported from limited clinical experiences. An open-label study in China compared the effects of favipiravir plus interferon-α with LPV/r plus interferon-α for the treatment of COVID-19. Favipiravir was associated with more rapid viral clearance, better improvement in chest imaging results and less adverse effects [
 <xref rid="B120-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Based on these results favipiravir was approved as the first anti-COVID-19 drug in China [
 <xref rid="B121-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. Another randomized clinical trial compared the effect of favipiravir and arbidolol in COVID-19 patients but demonstrated no difference in clinical recovery rate at day 7. However, favipiravir significantly shortened the latency to relief from pyrexia and cough [
 <xref rid="B122-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. An ongoing clinical trial (NCT04303299) is investigating the efficacy, performance and safety of favipiravir in combination with oseltamivir and chloroquine among 80 participants with COVID-19 in Rajavithi Hospital in Thailand; results will be released in November 2020 [
 <xref rid="B123-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. There is less preclinical support for favipiravir to treat COVID-19 compared with remdesivir, due to its higher EC50 (61.88 μM) compared to remdesevir (0.77 μM) [
 <xref rid="B101-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>,
 <xref rid="B124-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. Favipiravir is well tolerated in healthy volunteers, however caution is required as it is teratogenic [
