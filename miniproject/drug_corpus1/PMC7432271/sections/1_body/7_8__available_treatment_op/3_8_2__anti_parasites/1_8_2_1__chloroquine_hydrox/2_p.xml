<p>Chloroquine possesses different mechanisms of action depending on the pathogen studied. In vitro studies on SARS-CoV showed that chloroquine can interfere with glycosylation of ACE2, in Vero cells [

Since SARS-CoV-2 uses a similar receptor, it is expected that chloroquine may prevent SARS-CoV-2 attachment to target cells by the same mechanism. Moreover, chloroquine can induce autophagosome formation resulting in spike protein degradation by changing the pH of lysosomes and inhibition of cathepsins. Furthermore, chloroquine interferes with viral assembly, budding and proteolytic processing of the M protein through inhibition of Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) [
