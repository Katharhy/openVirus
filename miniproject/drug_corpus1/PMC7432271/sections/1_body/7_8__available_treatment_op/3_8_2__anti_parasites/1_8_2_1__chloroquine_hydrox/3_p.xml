<p>Previous studies have reported the potential use of chloroquine for treatment of SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B150-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. The potent efficacy of remdesivir and chloroquine were evaluated in Vero E6; chloroquine was effective in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro with an EC50 at 48 h of 1.13 μM [
 <xref rid="B101-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>], comparable with previous in vitro findings against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [

Besides the antiviral activity of chloroquine, it has immune modulatory functions by inhibition of TNF-α and IL-6 production and secretion. Upon oral administration of chloroquine, it is widely distributed systemically in the body, reaching the lung [

 <xref rid="B153-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. Despite the in vitro efficiency of chloroquine, the clinical outcomes are uncertain.
