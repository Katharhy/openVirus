<p>In a non-randomized clinical trial in COVID-19 patients (
 <italic>n</italic> = 36), Gautret et al. reported that azithromycin co-administered with hydroxychloroquine reduced the viral load more efficiently than hydroxychloroquine alone [
 <xref rid="B158-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. Patients were administered hydroxychloroquine (600 mg/day), with or without azithromycin (500 mg day one, followed by 250 mg/day for four days) and SARS-CoV-2 was measured in nasopharyngeal swabs by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). They found that at day 6 all of the patients in the combination group (6/6) were virologically cured (negative swab), compared to hydroxychloroquine alone (57.1%) or untreated controls (12.5%) [

However, this small trial was not randomized, patients were not well matched and adding azithromycin to hydroxychloroquine may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. There are now several larger clinical trials investigating the efficacy of azithromycin in COVID-19 patients (e.g., NCT04332107, NCT04336332, NCT04329832), but until these results are available, Azithromycin cannot be recommended for routine use in COVID-19.
