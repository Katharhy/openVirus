<p>Inflammatory responses of host immune cells and the resulting cytokine storm are two important aspects of the pathogenesis in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection [

 <xref rid="B223-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">223</xref>] and can delay viral clearance in critically ill MERS patients (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.35) [

Another meta-analysis of 15 studies in coronavirus infected patients (including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV) revealed that while corticosteroids are likely to be used in critically ill patients, treatment was associated with increased mortality (Risk Ratio RR = 2.11, 
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.019), increased bacterial infection (RR = 2.08, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and led to longer hospital stays (total number of patients = 5270) [

In an observational study of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients treated with 40 mg methylprednisolone once or twice daily, there was no significant association between corticosteroid treatment and time to viral clearance or length of hospitalization [
 <xref rid="B226-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">226</xref>]. Similarly, Fang et al. reported that low-dose methylprednisolone by injection (median hydrocortisone-equivalent dose, 250 mg/day) or orally (median hydrocortisone-equivalent dose = 237.5 mg/day) had no significant impact on SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance time [

 <xref rid="B228-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">228</xref>]. Indeed, according to the guidelines for COVID-19 patient management released by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), corticosteroid treatment is not recommended in confirmed COVID-19 infections except in cases with exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or septic shock [
