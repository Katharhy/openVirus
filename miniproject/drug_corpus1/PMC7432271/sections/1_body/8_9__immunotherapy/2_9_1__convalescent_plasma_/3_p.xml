<p>In a Hong Kong study, 80 SARS patients who were administrated convalescent plasma before day 14 of disease showed an improved prognosis and a higher discharge rate (58.3% vs. 15.6%), including those who were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive and seronegative for SARS-CoV at the time of therapy [

Similarly, transfusion of 500 mL convalescent plasma from three convalescent SARS patients to three health care workers with SARS infection in Taiwan resulted in survival of all three patients, a decrease in viral loads to 0 or 1 copy/mL one day after transfusion and increasing levels of anti-SARS-CoV IgM and IgG [

Concerning COVID-19, Zhang et al. demonstrated anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of convalescent plasma from six patients in China who had recovered; transfusion of the plasma to a patient with severe COVID-19 resulted in clinical improvement, with no requirement for mechanical ventilation 11 days post-plasma transfusion [
