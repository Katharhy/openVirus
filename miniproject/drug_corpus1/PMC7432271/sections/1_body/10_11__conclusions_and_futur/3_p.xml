<p>The constantly changing recommendations from major international health bodies highlights the challenges of treating a novel deadly pathogen in the midst of a rapidly escalating pandemic. However, it also reinforces the importance of undertaking large, well designed clinical trials to evaluate potential treatments, instead of relying on preliminary unpublished data or the latest rumors on social media. The widespread empiric use of unproven agents such as hydroxychloroquine can lead to supply shortages for people who rely on the drug, potentially life-threatening side effects, and delays in evaluating its true clinical efficacy, along with that of other potential therapies. Many large trials are now underway to assess both novel and repurposed drugs to treat COVID-19, and their outcomes are eagerly awaited. Given the scale of the pandemic even incremental improvements can save thousands of lives, while we await the development of potent antiviral agents, targeted immunotherapies or an effective vaccine.</p>
