<p>The clinical presentations of COVID-19 are heterogeneous, so identifying comorbidities associated with COVID-19 is important for several reasons. First, when treating patients, it allows health care providers to adjust and select the best treatment option for vulnerable patients, reducing the risk of side effects due to polypharmacy or drugâ€“drug interactions. Second, it identifies people at higher risk, assisting governments to stratify public health policies and guidelines to allow easing of social distancing restrictions, while protecting the vulnerables. Finally, determining which comorbidities are most associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes will help researchers to understand the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its interactions with underlying chronic diseases.</p>
