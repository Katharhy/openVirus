<p>Similarly to other viral infections, the expression of type I interferons (TI IFN), such as interferon (IFN)-α and IFN-β, determine the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection [
 <xref rid="B35-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as viral RNA are sensed by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on innate immune cells including antigen presenting cells (APCs), resulting in their activation [
 <xref rid="B36-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Endosomal PRRs including Toll-like receptors (TLR-) 3, 7/8 and 9 are responsible for detection of SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="B24-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These TLRs are mainly expressed in macrophages and dendritic cells, which are involved in innate immunity [
 <xref rid="B37-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Activation of the TLRs leads to nuclear translocation of NFκB and IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) transcription factors resulting in TI IFN overexpression and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and Tumor necrosis factor TNF-α), which have been reported to be overexpressed significantly in SARS-CoV-2 infection in association with “cytokine storm” [

 <xref rid="B38-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. TI IFNs and these other cytokines also amplify their own expression [
 <xref rid="B39-ijms-21-05559" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], priming the adaptive immune response or pathogen clearance. However, the inflammatory status can be excessive and is one of the major determinants of COVID-19 disease [
