<p>Healthcare professionals are recommended to closely monitor patients with COVID-19 receiving chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine and to consider patients with pre-existing heart problems that may make them more susceptible to heart rhythm issues. They should carefully consider the likelihood of cardiac arrhythmia, particularly with higher doses, and exercise extra caution when combining treatment with other medicines like azithromycin, which will cause similar side effects on the heart. African national drug regulatory organizations and other health authorities are advised to instantly notify WHO if falsified and substandard products are discovered in their country.</p>
