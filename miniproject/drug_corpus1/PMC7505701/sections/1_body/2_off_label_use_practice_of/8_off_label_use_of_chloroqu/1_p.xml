<p>South Africa is one of the highly infected African countries by COVID-19 and they join a clinical trial on COVID-19 under WHO supervision. The South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) has warned health professionals to stop prescribing the medication chloroquine to prevent infection or to treat the disease, COVID-19 outside the hospitals. This warning comes after several pharmacies in South African cities have run out of chloroquine. The national health department of the country released a new guideline that allows using chloroquine only in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 and for consented clinical trials. This new guideline also noted that chloroquine should be distributed to all hospitals at affordable prices.
