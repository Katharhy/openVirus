<p>Beyond a public health resolution, the choice of dual therapy represents a logistical challenge in Cameroon. Chloroquine was massively used in the country at one time and stocks were exhausted. Dr. Etoundi, director of the fight against diseases, epidemics, and pandemics of Cameroon’s Ministry of Health, explained that they had to place large orders from abroad and restart the wide national industrial production of chloroquine. Cameroon’s minister of scientific research and innovation, Madeleine Tchuente, said that the government has ordered the production of chloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients and they are started producing 6000 tablets per day. As she said, the President, Paul Biya, has ordered them to produce at least eight million tablets of chloroquine each day as the situation is getting worse. The black market for drugs in normal times in Cameroon is rising with the Covid-19 crisis. Several fake chloroquine products are circulated within the Cameroon health network.
