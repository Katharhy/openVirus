<p>On the contrary to Hala Zayed, the Health Ministry spokesman, Khaled Megahed, told to Egypt Today that the country denies producing chloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients. He denied the news that a pharmaceutical company in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, started producing chloroquine phosphate medication primarily used to treat malaria patients. He said that the World Health Organization has not yet adopted any effective treatment for the novel coronavirus.
