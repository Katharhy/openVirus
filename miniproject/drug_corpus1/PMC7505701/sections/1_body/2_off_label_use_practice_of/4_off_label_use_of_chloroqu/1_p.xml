<p>There are around 3305 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 96 Deaths in Kenya until June 13, 2020. South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) reported that Kenya approved the use of chloroquine to treat critical cases of patients with coronavirus. However, it is given only to critical patients as noted by Patrick Amoth, Kenyan Health Director-General. He, however, said that the sale of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine over the counter at pharmacies is not allowed. The countryâ€™s Pharmacy and Poisons Board has also banned over the counter sale of both hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in pharmacies. On the contrary to this, Kenyan medical experts warn to do not use these drugs since they require further clinical study and might not be the cure of COVID-19.
