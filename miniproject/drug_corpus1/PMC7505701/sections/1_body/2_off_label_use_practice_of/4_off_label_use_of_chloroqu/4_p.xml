<p>Uganda recorded good results by treating COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine. The Uganda Ministry of Health told The Independent that they got good results by using hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in managing COVID-19 patients even though the drugs did not treat the disease. Uganda has used either of the two drugs in combination with azithromycin to manage COVID-19 patients at Entebbe General Hospital. Until June 13, 2020, 53 patients treated by these drugs are fully recovered. In addition to chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, the patients have been given Vitamin C. Dr. Diana Atwine, secretary of the Ministry of Health, said that despite the recent findings, Uganda has scored good results from using these drugs. He also added that these drugs are not new for them and they know well about the side effects.
