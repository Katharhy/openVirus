<p>The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has warned against the widespread use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine to treat COVID-19. The EMA noted that there are no studies with strong evidence about the efficacy of these two medicines in treating COVID-19. The agency stressed that patients and healthcare professionals only use chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for their authorized use or as part of clinical trials or national emergency use programs for the treatment of COVID-19.

It could be highly fatal if the medication is taken at high doses or combined with other drugs, such as the antibiotic azithromycin, that have similar effects on the heart. The drugs have also toxic effects including liver and kidney problems, nerve cell damage that can lead to seizures, and hypoglycemia.
