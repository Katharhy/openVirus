<p>Clinical observations in animals and humans showed that MERS-CoV infections were mediated by both virus replication and host inflammatory responses. Those findings led to explorations of combination therapies that included type I interferon (IFN-I) and IFN-II. Interferon beta (IFN-β) displayed the best efficacy, with EC
 <sub>50</sub>s of 1.37 to 17 IU/ml, for reducing MERS-CoV replication in tissue culture (
