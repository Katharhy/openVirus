<p>Work with influenza virus has shown that monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies can be useful prophylactic and therapeutic tools. Several antibodies have been shown previously to bind influenza virus hemagglutinin and inhibit virus replication (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). For example, human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody (MHAA4549A) binds to a highly conserved epitope on the stalk of influenza A virus hemagglutinin. In a phase 2 human influenza A virus challenge study, MHAA4549A significantly reduced the clinical symptoms and viral burden relative to placebo (

 <italic>trans</italic>-chromosomic cattle, was found to be safe and well tolerated in healthy participants. (

The lack of viral sequence homology among different human coronaviruses suggests that current investigational antibody-based therapeutics will not be effective against novel virus variants. Nevertheless, in considering future treatments for novel coronaviruses, immune-based therapies should be not discarded.
