<p>To predict new zoonotic coronavirus jumps across species and to understand the rate of virus spread among people, it is crucial to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 is mutating to improve its binding to human receptors for infection. As an RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 has intrinsic genetic variability, which results in a high mutation rate. Moreover, coronaviruses have the largest genomes (∼30 kb) among RNA viruses. However, part of their sequence encodes a proofreading 3′ exonuclease that can increase replication fidelity (

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Muller’s ratchet predicts that, when mutation rates are high and a significant proportion of mutations are deleterious, a type of irreversible ratchet mechanism gradually reduces the mean fitness of small populations of asexual organisms. Because genetic bottlenecks for RNA viruses often occur during respiratory droplet transmissions, the SARS-CoV-2 is expected to become less virulent through human-to-human transmissions (
