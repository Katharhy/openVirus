<p>The most promising antiviral for fighting SARS-CoV-2 is remdesivir (GS-5734). Remdesivir is an adenosine nucleotide analogue prodrug with broad-spectrum antiviral activity against filoviruses, paramyxoviruses, pneumoviruses, and pathogenic coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Pharmacokinetic studies have been completed and clinical trials are ongoing for testing remdesivir efficacy in treating Ebola virus (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Previous studies have indicated that nucleotide analogues generally show low efficacy against coronaviruses, due to the presence of the virus exonuclease proofreading enzyme. Nevertheless, remdesivir was found to be effective against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and bat CoV strains (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In tissue cultures, remdesivir displayed half-maximal effective concentrations (EC
 <sub>50</sub>s) of 0.069 μM for SARS-CoV and 0.074 μM for MERS-CoV. Of note, tissue culture studies have shown that remdesivir is also active in the submicromolar EC
 <sub>50</sub> range against a number of highly divergent coronaviruses, including the endemic human CoVs OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and 229E (HCoV-229E). Thus, remdesivir has broad-spectrum anti-CoV activity (

Viral titers were reduced by &gt;2 orders of magnitude on day 4 or 5 postinfection. Remdesivir improved the clinical signs of disease and respiratory function compared to untreated control animals (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Comparable results were obtained with MERS-CoV in prophylactic studies carried out with a MERS-CoV mouse transgenic model. In that model, a humanized MERS-CoV receptor (humanized dipeptidyl peptidase 4 [hDPP4]) was expressed and carboxylesterase 1c (Ces1c) was deleted to improve the pharmacokinetics of nucleotide prodrugs (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Remdesivir specificity for coronavirus was demonstrated by propagating the virus in tissue culture. After 23 passages in the presence of drug, two mutations were identified (F276L and V553L) in the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene. These mutations increased the replication capacity of the virus in the presence of remdesivir (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). However, these amino acid changes decreased the viral fitness and attenuated SARS-CoV pathogenesis in mice (

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). When prophylactic remdesivir treatment was initiated 24 h prior to inoculation, MERS-CoV was prevented from inducing clinical disease and inhibited from replicating in respiratory tissues, which prevented the formation of lung lesions. Similar results were obtained when therapeutic remdesivir treatment was initiated at 12 h after virus inoculation (

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>); thus, human trials can be initiated for testing the efficacy of this compound against novel coronaviruses.
