<p>Ribavirin, a guanosine analogue, is an antiviral compound used to treat several virus infections, including respiratory syncytial virus, hepatitis C virus, and some viral hemorrhagic fevers. In most cases, ribavirin is combined with IFN. Ribavirin was first marketed in 1980 for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus in children. Although promising results were obtained previously with ribavirin and IFN-α 2b in a MERS-CoV rhesus macaque model (
