<p>The prophylactic and therapeutic properties of remdesivir and LPV/RTV–IFN-β were previously compared in a humanized transgenic mouse MERS-CoV infection model (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Remdesivir improved pulmonary function, reduced lung viral loads, and ameliorated severe lung pathology. In contrast, prophylactic LPV/RTV–IFN-β reduced viral loads only slightly and did not impact other disease parameters, and therapeutic LPV/RTV–IFN-β improved pulmonary function but did not reduce virus replication or severe lung pathology (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Overall, these results indicated that remdesivir showed more potential than LPV/RTV–IFN-β for treating MERS-CoV infections.
