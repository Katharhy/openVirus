<p>A key issue is whether the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is similar to other SARS outbreaks or whether it shows different features. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 indicate that this new outbreak is different from the 2003-SARS outbreak. SARS-CoV-2 displays higher transmissibility and lower mortality than 2003-SARS (

The asymptomatic period of SARS-CoV-2 infections oscillates between 2 and 14â€‰days, and some individuals probably transmit the virus without developing any disease symptoms. It remains to be elucidated whether this virus replicates more readily in the upper airway than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and whether it is similar to other human coronaviruses (HCoVs) that cause colds but not pneumonia. It will be necessary to identify molecular determinants that mediate transmission from animal to human and from human to human. Of note, in the novel SARS-CoV-2 strain, the nucleotide sequence of the external ectodomain in the spike protein receptor-binding domain is different from that of the 2003 SARS-CoV. When individual bat coronavirus spike genes were introduced into SARS-CoV infectious clones, the SARS-CoV/bat-CoV spike viruses could bind to the human, bat, or civet angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cellular receptor (

Understanding the interaction between this novel SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the host ACE2 receptor might reveal how this virus overcame the species barrier between animals and humans. As discussed below, this information might promote the design of effective antivirals.
