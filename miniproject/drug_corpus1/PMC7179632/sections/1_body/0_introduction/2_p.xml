<p>Coronaviruses can cause different types of infections in diverse animals. In humans, they mainly produce respiratory tract infections, as observed with SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses have shown that the novel SARS-CoV-2 strain is closely related to a group of human SARS-like coronaviruses and bat SARS-related coronaviruses (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">â€“</xref>
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear; it is unknown how it was first transmitted to humans. The high prevalence of SARS-related coronaviruses in bats has suggested that a bat coronavirus might have jumped into a civet or some other mammal, and from there to humans, which started the former 2003 SARS (2003-SARS) epidemic. Initial confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 were associated with Huanan seafood and live-animal markets. However, no animal source has been identified to date, and spillover events may continue to occur. Although bats might be the source of SARS-CoV-2, it is critical to identify the intermediate species to stop the current spread and to prevent future human SARS-related coronavirus epidemics.
