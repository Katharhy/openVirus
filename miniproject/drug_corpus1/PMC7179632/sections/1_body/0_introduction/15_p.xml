<p>To end this minireview, I discuss an interesting potential antiviral strategy. The spike protein of SARS-CoV mediates viral entry into target cells. Intriguingly, cleavage and activation of the SARS-CoV spike protein by a host cell protease are essential for infectious viral entry (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). This host protease could be a type II transmembrane serine protease, TMPRSS2, which was shown to cleave and activate SARS-CoV spike protein in cell cultures. Therefore, TMPRSS2 is a potential a target for antiviral interventions. For example, the serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate inhibits the enzymatic activity of TMPRSS2 (

 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Moreover, the clinically proven serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate, which is active against TMPRSS2, partially blocked SARS-CoV-2 spike-driven entry into Caco-2 and Vero-TMPRSS2 cells (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Future tissue culture and animal model studies should be conducted to clarify the potential antiviral activity of targeting TMPRSS2.
