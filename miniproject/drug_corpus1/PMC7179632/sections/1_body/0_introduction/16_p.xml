<p>By the end of February 2020, 2 months after the first cases of SARS-CoV-2 were reported in China, several hundreds of new infection cases had been registered, mainly in other Asian regions and Europe. This news has strongly suggested that we are in the thick of a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Social alarm and health authorities have called for the development of therapeutic alternatives for fighting the current and, possibly, new coronavirus epidemics. Animal models and clinical studies are urgently needed for evaluating the effectiveness and safety of promising antiviral compounds that target the virus and/or the immunopathology involved in the host responses. The identification and characterization of novel compounds and therapeutic alternatives will be required to better control this probable pandemic outbreak.</p>
