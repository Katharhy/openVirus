<p>From the public health perspective, we urgently need to develop an effective vaccine and antiviral therapeutics to stop the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Moreover, social and economic issues generated by this epidemic also call for rapid interventions. This review focuses on the potential of repurposing preexisting compounds that might provide new opportunities for treating people infected with SARS-CoV-2. Previous work with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has provided an opportunity to accelerate the identification of meaningful therapies for fighting the novel SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Nevertheless, we must be aware that, currently, no compound that targets SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV has moved beyond phase 1 trials.</p>
