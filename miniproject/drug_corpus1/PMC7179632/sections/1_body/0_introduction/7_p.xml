<p>Therapies that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have been evaluated for antiviral activity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. For example, lopinavir (LPV), a human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitor, was combined with ritonavir (RTV) to increase the LPV half-life. The combination of LPV and RTV (LPV/RTV) was shown to be effective against SARS-CoV in patients and in tissue culture. The estimated EC
 <sub>50</sub> in fetal rhesus kidney-4 cells was 4 μg/ml (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). LPV/RTV also reduced weight loss, clinical scores, viral titers, and disease progression in marmosets infected with MERS-CoV (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Nevertheless, the antiviral activity of LPV against MERS-CoV in tissue culture remains controversial. No optimal EC
 <sub>50</sub> was found in Vero cells (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), but an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 8 μM was reported in Huh7 cells (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).
