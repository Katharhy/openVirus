<p>Another interesting therapeutic alternative that was previously explored with influenza virus was that of targeting cellular components involved in the host inflammatory response to the infection. For example, the activation of the inflammatory response to an infection can induce a cytokine outburst that results in an acute lung injury. An example of a therapy for this type of infection has been targeting of cellular Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) with specific antibodies. TLR4 is a transmembrane protein that belongs to the pattern recognition receptor (PRR) family. The prototype pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) that TLR4 recognizes is that corresponding to the Gram-negative bacterium endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS). TLR4 has been implicated in pathology associated with other infections and with tissue damage caused by noninfectious insults. TLR4 activation leads to activation of the NF-ÎºB intracellular signaling pathway and to inflammatory cytokine production, which in turn activate the innate immune system. Interestingly, TLR4-null mice were highly resistant to infection by the mouse-adapted influenza A virus (
