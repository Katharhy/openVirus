<p>The high mortality rates observed in some emerging respiratory diseases induced by viruses like MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and novel influenza A virus strains (H5N1) have given rise to the hypothesis that the proinflammatory response might be involved in the disease pathogenesis. Consequently, immunosuppressants (e.g., corticosteroids) might be used as an adjunct for treating severe forms of the disease. However, the therapeutic use of immunosuppressants is not free of controversy. To date, no conclusive results have been found for the effects of immunosuppressants in severe influenza virus infections (
