<p>Another potential treatment option could be the use of novel coronavirus sera prepared from the blood of patients in convalescence (convalescent-phase sera). Passive immunization is well established for viral infection prophylaxis. Polyclonal antibody products have been licensed that target cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B virus, and varicella-zoster virus. A meta-analysis of reports on the 1918 influenza A virus (H1N1) epidemic concluded that early administration of convalescent blood products reduced the absolute risk of pneumonia-related death from 37% to 16% (

Nevertheless, the appropriate titer of convalescent-phase sera antibody that is required for therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 remains to be determined. Moreover, additional studies performed with influenza virus have produced controversial results regarding the clinical benefit of administering high titers of anti-influenza immunoglobulins (

Work carried out with MERS-CoV showed that sera from patients recovering from infections did not contain sufficient antibody titers for therapeutic use (
