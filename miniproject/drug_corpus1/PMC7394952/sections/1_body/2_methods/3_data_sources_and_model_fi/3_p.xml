<p>The prevalence measures (in those other than the general population) may not be representative of the general population and thus were used to determine only the HCV Ab-prevalence trend (not prevalence level). Specifically, these measures were converted into a corresponding prevalence trend by multiplying each measure in each specific population category by a factor (labelled as the ‘anchoring factor’). The temporal variation of HCV Ab prevalence in the population was determined by fitting the anchored prevalence datapoints over 1990–2016, thereby determining the anchoring factors, as well as fitting the 2008 and 2015 EDHS data
