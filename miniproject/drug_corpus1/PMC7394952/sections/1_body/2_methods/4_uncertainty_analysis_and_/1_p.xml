<p>A multivariable uncertainty analysis was implemented to derive the uncertainty ranges of the predicted outcomes. A total of 1000 runs of the model were conducted utilizing Latin Hypercube sampling from a multidimensional distribution of the modelâ€™s structural parameters, with 25% uncertainty around each parameter point estimate. The means and associated 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) were reported for the key indicators that characterize the role of PAT exposure in the HCV epidemic. Further details on the uncertainty analysis are shown in Supplementary Section 2, available as
