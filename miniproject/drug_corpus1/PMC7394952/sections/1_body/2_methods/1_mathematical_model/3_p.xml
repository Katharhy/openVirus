<p>To represent the variability in the infection risk of exposure, five risk groups (other than PAT exposure) were modelled in the population. The mixing between the various risk groups and age groups was dictated by mixing matrices. The force of infection was determined by the iatrogenic contact rate, infection-transmission probability per contact, risk-group mixing and age-group mixing. HCV treatment scale-up was not incorporated in the model, as the modelling was focused on the historical evolution of the epidemic before treatment onset. The impact of HCV treatment on the epidemic in Egypt has already been assessed in our previous study.
