<p>The modelled epidemic history highlights several notable findings. Whereas the HCV-incidence rate (i.e. the likelihood of infection for a given person) was highest during the peak of the PAT era in the 1960s (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dyaa052-F2">Figure 2B</xref>)—the decline in the incidence rate following the PAT era was more than compensated for by the rapid population growth from the 1970s to the 1990s. Since 1993, both the incidence rate and the incidence have been declining very rapidly (
