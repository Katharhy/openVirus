<p>Demography is perhaps the most underappreciated factor in understanding the epidemic. Egypt has been witnessing a rapid growth in population size over the decades, with the population increasing 3-fold since 1965,

 </xref> Accordingly, most of those who acquired HCV through PAT exposure are no longer alive today (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dyaa052-F2">Figure 2A</xref>), it remained considerable at a time when the population was increasing rapidly (along with its life expectancy), leading to a large number of incident infections and subsequently prevalent infections (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dyaa052-F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Most infected individuals alive today acquired their infection after the PAT campaigns were phased out in the early 1980s. This further demonstrates that PAT exposure is just one driver of incidence, but most incident infections appear to be related to broader healthcare practices.
