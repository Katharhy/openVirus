 </xref> Using an analytical approach anchored on extensive quality data for HCV and PAT exposure, we aimed to characterize the historical evolution of this epidemic and to delineate the role of PAT campaigns. We found that PAT exposure played an important role in transmission at the time of the campaigns, between the 1950s and early 1980s. However, cumulatively up to the present, PAT exposure has explained only 5.9% of the cumulative number of 16.4 million infections that have occurred in Egypt since 1950 (
 <xref rid="dyaa052-T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Notably, among those who are HCV Ab-positive today, only 5.5% were infected through PAT exposure, the majority of whom are already &gt;60 years of age. These findings demonstrate that, despite the role of PAT, the vast majority of infections have been acquired through other modes of transmission, explaining the observed weak spatial association between HCV prevalence and PAT exposure seen in the spatial scan statistical analyses.
