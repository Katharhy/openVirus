<p>Strikingly, even during the peak of the PAT campaigns, &lt;25% of the incidence could be explained by PAT exposure (

Even for those exposed to PAT in earlier times but alive after the year 2000, most infections were acquired through other modes of transmission, sometimes during the several decades of their lifetime. These findings, following multiple studies implicating healthcare exposures (other than PAT) in HCV acquisition,

The reuse of syringes and lax sterilization practices may have been common well beyond PAT campaigns and up to recent times.
