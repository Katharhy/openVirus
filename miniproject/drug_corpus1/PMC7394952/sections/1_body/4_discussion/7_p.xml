 </xref> Whereas these surveys are of high quality and are nationally representative, PAT exposure was measured through self-reporting and thus could be prone to reporting or recall bias. Nevertheless, the conducted sensitivity analysis affirmed our findings even in the presence of a large reporting bias in the PAT-exposure data (
