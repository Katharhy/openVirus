<p>To sum up, even though PAT campaigns played an important role in HCV transmission in Egypt, they explain only 6% of the infections that occurred since 1950. Most infections have been acquired through other modes of transmission, sometime over the past few decades. PAT campaigns were not the main cause of the epidemicâ€”the ultimate driver of the epidemic is presumably the mass expansion of healthcare services and infrastructure that accelerated during the PAT campaigns and subsequent decades, but whose implementation did not adequately adhere to the best practices of infection control. Whereas broad healthcare practices may have driven the epidemic, demographic trends amplified it, leading to an immense expansion and a high-incidence-cohort effect for those who acquired the infection between the 1970s and the 1990s. Despite this historical adversity, the epidemic has been rapidly diminishing since the mid-1990s, with curtailed incidence at present.</p>
