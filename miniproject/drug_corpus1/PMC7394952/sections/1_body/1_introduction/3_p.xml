<p>Against this background, we aimed to provide a detailed quantitative assessment of the historical role of PAT exposure in HCV transmission in Egypt. In addition to estimating the proportion of incident and prevalent infections strictly attributed to PAT exposure, we estimated the past levels and trends of HCV Ab prevalence, incidence rate, annual number of new infections, PAT exposure and HCV Ab prevalence among those who were exposed to PAT. Accordingly, we provided a comprehensive characterization of the worldâ€™s most distinguished HCV epidemic and delineated the role of PAT campaigns in this epidemic.</p>
