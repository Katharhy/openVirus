     <p>Egypt is the nation most affected by hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Key drivers of this epidemic, particularly the historical role of parenteral antischistosomal therapy (PAT) campaigns, remain poorly understood.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
     <p>Using an analytical mathematical modelling approach, we provided a systematic characterization of the level and trend of the epidemicâ€™s historical evolution and a detailed quantitative assessment of the historical role of PAT exposure in HCV transmission.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
     <p>The results affirm that Egypt has endured an HCV epidemic of historic proportions, although PAT campaigns explain only 6% of the cumulative number of infections that have occurred in Egypt from 1950 until the present.</p>

     <p>These findings have implications towards understanding the determinants of generalized HCV epidemics, several of which are observed globally, but which remain poorly understood and are subject to much research interest.</p>
