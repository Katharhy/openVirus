<p>The HCV-incidence rate in the total population and the annual number of new HCV infections (HCV incidence) can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dyaa052-F2">Figure 2A and B</xref>, respectively. The incidence rate peaked in 1966 at 15.7 infections per 1000 person-years and rapidly declined thereafter, starting in mid-1990. The incidence was estimated at 8.0 per 1000 person-years in 2000, but at only 0.7 per 1000 person-years in 2018. Meanwhile, with the rapid demographic growth in Egypt (

The cumulative number of individuals who have ever been infected by HCV since 1950 was 16.4 million by 2018, but the number of these individuals alive in 1980 was 4.7 million, 8.6 million in 2000 and 7.1 million in 2018 (
