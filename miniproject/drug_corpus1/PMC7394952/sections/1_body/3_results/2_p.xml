 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dyaa052-F1">Figure 1</xref> reports model predictions for the trend in HCV Ab prevalence 
 <italic>in the total population</italic> of Egypt including all age groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dyaa052-F1">Figure 1A</xref>) and trends in prevalence in children (0–14 years), adults (15–59 years) and older adults (&gt;60 years) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dyaa052-F1">Figure 1B</xref>). HCV prevalence was rising for several decades and reached its peak in 1979, but was projected to decline slowly thereafter. HCV prevalence by age group was similar to that in the total population, but the peak shifted to later years for the older age groups. The earliest peak was in 1970 for children and the latest in 1991 for older adults.
