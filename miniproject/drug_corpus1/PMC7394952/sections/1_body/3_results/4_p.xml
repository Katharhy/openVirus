 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dyaa052-F3">Figure 3A</xref>). It reached a peak of 18.8% in 1974 and declined thereafter to 8.5% by 2000 and 3.8% by 2018 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dyaa052-F3">Figure 3A</xref>). The cumulative number of individuals who have ever been exposed to PAT was 8.3 million by 2018, but the number of them who were alive was 7.3 million in 1980, 5.6 million in 2000 and only 3.5 million in 2018 (
