We found that PAT exposure played an important role in transmission at the time of the campaigns, between the 1950s and early 1980s. However, cumulatively up to the present, PAT exposure has explained only 5.9% of the cumulative number of 16.4 million infections that have occurred in Egypt since 1950 (<xref rid="dyaa052-T2" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>). Notably, among those who are HCV Ab-positive today, only 5.5% were infected through PAT exposure, the majority of whom are already &#x0003e;60&#x02009;years of age. These findings demonstrate that, despite the role of PAT, the vast majority of infections have been acquired through other modes of transmission, explaining the observed weak spatial association between HCV prevalence and PAT exposure seen in the spatial scan statistical analyses.<xref rid="dyaa052-B7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref></p><p>Strikingly, even during the peak of the PAT campaigns, &#x0003c;25% of the incidence could be explained by PAT exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dyaa052-F4">Figure&#x000a0;4B</xref>). Even for those exposed to PAT in earlier times but alive after the year 2000, most infections were acquired through other modes of transmission, sometimes during the several decades of their lifetime. These findings, following multiple studies implicating healthcare exposures (other than PAT) in HCV acquisition,<xref rid="dyaa052-B6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyaa052-B8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> demonstrate that PAT campaigns were not strictly the cause of the epidemic, as much as a &#x02018;symptom&#x02019; of the less-than-optimal quality of healthcare and limited awareness of blood-borne infection control, at the time of the campaigns and in subsequent decades. The reuse of syringes and lax sterilization practices may have been common well beyond PAT campaigns and up to recent times.<xref rid="dyaa052-B6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyaa052-B8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyaa052-B44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref></p><p>With all the evidence on HCV epidemiology<xref rid="dyaa052-B6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6&#x02013;8</sup></xref> and infection control<xref rid="dyaa052-B44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> being Egyptian in context, it seems most consistent and logical to hypothesize that the cause of the epidemic is the mass expansion of healthcare services and infrastructure in Egypt, which accelerated during the PAT campaigns and subsequent decades, but whose implementation did not adequately adhere to the best practices of infection control. Much of the transmission may have occurred through formal and informal healthcare procedures,<xref rid="dyaa052-B6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyaa052-B8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> resulting in a series of clustered micro-epidemics. These micro-epidemics represent large and small outbreaks of different intensities, as opposed to one large epidemic.<xref rid="dyaa052-B7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref></p><p>Demography is perhaps the most underappreciated factor in understanding the epidemic. Egypt has been witnessing a rapid growth in population size over the decades, with the population increasing 3-fold since 1965,<xref rid="dyaa052-B40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> coinciding with the height of the PAT campaigns and associated HCV incidence. The mortality rate was also high at this time, but has declined steadily in recent decades, leading to major increases in life expectancy.<xref rid="dyaa052-B40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> Accordingly, most of those who acquired HCV through PAT exposure are no longer alive today (<xref rid="dyaa052-T2" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>). Even though the HCV-incidence rate declined substantially after the peak of the PAT era (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dyaa052-F2">Figure&#x000a0;2A</xref>), it remained considerable at a time when the population was increasing rapidly (along with its life expectancy), leading to a large number of incident infections and subsequently prevalent infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dyaa052-F2">Figure&#x000a0;2B</xref>). Most infected individuals alive today acquired their infection after the PAT campaigns were phased out in the early 1980s. This further demonstrates that PAT exposure is just one driver of incidence, but most incident infections appear to be related to broader healthcare practices.</p><p>The modelled epidemic history highlights several notable findings. Whereas the HCV-incidence rate (i.e. the likelihood of infection for a given person) was highest during the peak of the PAT era in the 1960s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dyaa052-F2">Figure&#x000a0;2A</xref>), the incidence (annual number of new infections) was the highest more than two decades later in around 1990 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dyaa052-F2">Figure&#x000a0;2B</xref>)&#x02014;the decline in the incidence rate following the PAT era was more than compensated for by the rapid population growth from the 1970s to the 1990s. Since 1993, both the incidence rate and the incidence have been declining very rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dyaa052-F2">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>), likely due to blood screening, improved injection safety and infection control following the identification of the virus in 1989<xref rid="dyaa052-B45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyaa052-B46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref> and discovery of the epidemic in Egypt in the early 1990s.<xref rid="dyaa052-B47" ref-type="bibr"><sup>47</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyaa052-B48" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48</sup></xref></p><p>Another notable finding is that there are two &#x02018;cohort effects&#x02019; in the Egypt epidemic, best seen in the two incidence peaks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dyaa052-F2">Figure&#x000a0;2B</xref>.

This latter cohort, labelled here as the &#x02018;high-incidence cohort&#x02019;, constitutes the most infected people alive today in Egypt.</p><p>There are limitations in this study. A sophisticated dynamical modelling approach was used to capture transmission dynamics that was refined and perfected over a series of applications,<xref rid="dyaa052-B9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyaa052-B38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyaa052-B49" ref-type="bibr"><sup>49</sup></xref> although model projections are contingent on the quality and representativeness of the input data. PAT-exposure data were extracted from the EDHS databases.<xref rid="dyaa052-B10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyaa052-B34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> Whereas these surveys are of high quality and are nationally representative, PAT exposure was measured through self-reporting and thus could be prone to reporting or recall bias. Nevertheless, the conducted sensitivity analysis affirmed our findings even in the presence of a large reporting bias in the PAT-exposure data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>, available as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary data</xref> at <italic>IJE</italic> online).</p><p>Whereas a large database of systematically extracted HCV Ab-prevalence data was used to fit the model (practically every available measure in the literature<xref rid="dyaa052-B6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref>), fitting the model to the era before the discovery of the epidemic hinged on the availability of age-specific prevalence data to capture historical exposure over time. Therefore, the uncertainty in the estimates increases as the projections go further back in time, with less age-cohort data becoming available. Despite this wide uncertainty in the earlier years, the uncertainty analysis supported our predictions that PAT exposure contributed to only a minority of infections (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>, available as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary data</xref> at <italic>IJE</italic> online).</p><p>Disease-related mortality was not incorporated in the model, but the relative risk of mortality with infection is relatively too small to appreciably affect the projections.<xref rid="dyaa052-B9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyaa052-B43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyaa052-B50" ref-type="bibr"><sup>50</sup></xref> Even if it did, it would have further lowered the estimates for the role of PAT exposure in the epidemic. Indeed, this was the case, as demonstrated by the conducted sensitivity analysis incorporating HCV-disease-related mortality (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>, available as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary data</xref> at <italic>IJE</italic> online).</p><p>Despite these limitations, a major strength of this study is that it provided a comprehensive characterization of the epidemic&#x02019;s historical evolution that is anchored on an extensive and quality foundation of epidemiologic evidence and incorporated the intricate demography of the Egyptian population. Even by factoring in the uncertainty in the modelled projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dyaa052-F4">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>), the conclusions on the role of PAT exposure were invariable.</p><p>To sum up, even though PAT campaigns played an important role in HCV transmission in Egypt, they explain only 6% of the infections that occurred since 1950. Most infections have been acquired through other modes of transmission, sometime over the past few decades. PAT campaigns were not the main cause of the epidemic&#x02014;the ultimate driver of the epidemic is presumably the mass expansion of healthcare services and infrastructure that accelerated during the PAT campaigns and subsequent decades, but whose implementation did not adequately adhere to the best practices of infection control. Whereas broad healthcare practices may have driven the epidemic, demographic trends amplified it, leading to an immense expansion and a high-incidence-cohort effect for those who acquired the infection between the 1970s and the 1990s. Despite this historical adversity, the epidemic has been rapidly diminishing since the mid-1990s, with curtailed incidence at present.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Data</title><p>
