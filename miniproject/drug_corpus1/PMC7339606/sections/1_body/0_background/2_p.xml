<p id="Par21">The novel coronavirus is the most relevant virus of the family Coronaviridae in terms of research currently, as there remains no approved antiviral drug or vaccine against it [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Recently, on the basis of genomic resemblance with previously reported SARS-CoV, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) coronavirus study group named this virus “SARS-CoV-2” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It has been confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 can spread with human-to-human transmission via respiratory droplets (e.g. through coughing or sneezing) or even by contact with contaminated surfaces [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A coronavirus epidemic was previously predicted by the WHO soon after the Ebola virus outbreak in 2016 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]; and this prediction came to fruition in the Wuhan city seafood market with the coronavirus epidemic of 2019–2020 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Therefore, scientists are attempting to use preexisting antiviral drugs to control the virus upsurge, however, these drugs have thus far had inappreciable effects on SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Efficacy of such antiviral drugs may be compromised due to changes induced by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), thereby resulting in amino acid shifts which ultimately modify functional viral protein(s). This could be the case for SARS-CoV-2, in that viral proteins are actively acquiring mutations due to SNPs and thus escape from being targeted by antiviral drugs [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].
