<p id="Par22">Genome organization of all coronaviruses are similar and contain 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTR’s) for characteristic genes coding for ORF1ab, spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. ORF1ab is of particular importance, as it occupies two-thirds of the CoV genome and encodes a replicase polyprotein from ORF1a and ORF1b. In addition, a slippery sequence (UUUAAAC) is present at the junction between ORF1a and ORF1b in all coronaviruses, with translation commencing at the end of slippery sequence via a − 1 RNA-mediated ribosome frame shift [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Papain-like protease (PLpro) and 3C-like protease (3CLpro) are proteins encoded by ORF1ab and cleave the replicase polyprotein into 15–16 non-structural proteins (nsps) at consensus cleavage sites. Some of these nsps encode proteins with essential functions, such as PLpro (nsp3), 3CLpro (nsp5) and RdRP (nsp12) which plays an important role in viral replication, whereas helicase (nsp13) has been recognized to unwind duplex oligonucleotides in an NTP-dependent manner [
