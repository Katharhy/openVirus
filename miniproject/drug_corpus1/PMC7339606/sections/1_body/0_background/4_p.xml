<p id="Par23">Most RNA viruses—except for retroviruses—require an RdRp for replication and transcription of the viral genome, making it essential for their survival [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The RdRp protein ranges from 240 to 450 kD and consists of a catalytic core with a clear resemblance to the human right hand with differentiated palm, fingers and thumb domains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. RdRp is considered to be a conserved protein within RNA viruses, and thus could be used as an attractive candidate for understanding their biology in terms of nucleic acid synthesis and development of antiviral drugs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. RdRp plays a crucial role in the viral life cycle, and as the active site of the RdRp is the most conserved and accessible region, targeting this region for inhibition of viral replication may be an effective therapeutic approach. Scientists worldwide have proposed the use of preexisting drugs against the novel coronavirus; however, the efficacy of these drugs is somewhat limited. Others reported repurposing the use of existing antiviral agents in order to reduce time and cost compared to de novo drug discovery [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Ribavirin, lopinavir–ritonavir, corticosteroids, and interferon are just a few of the antiviral drugs that have been tested for use against SARS-CoV-2 [
