<p id="Par36">Docking simulations demonstrated that the ligand Galidesivir strongly binds within active sites containing the following residues: ASP760, ASP761, GLY616, TRP617, ASP618, TYR619, PRO620, LYS621, CYS622, LEU758, SER759, ALA762, ALA797, LYS798, CYS799, TRP800, HIS810, GLU811, PHE812, CYS813, SER814, and GLN815. Of these, the sites ASP761, ALA762, LYS798, and SER814 strongly bind Galidesivir, while the other AA found in close vicinity were involved in making the interface of ligand and receptor complex (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). CID123624208 and CID11687749 interactions with RdRP are presented in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>. We suggest two non-toxic drug-like compounds predicted to bind ASP761, ASP760, SER814 and LYS798 sites (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) through stout hydrogen bonding. ADMET profiling for drug-like compounds demonstrated positive results for blood–brain barrier (BBB), human intestinal absorption (HIA), renal organic cation transporter (ROCT) for CID11687749 and CID123624208 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), whereas CaCO
 <sub>2</sub> permeability results were found to be negative for both the compounds. Ames toxicity testing results revealed that the compounds were non-toxic and non-carcinogenic (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). CID123624208 and CID11687749 were the best suggested drug-like compounds analyzed through in silico analysis and may act as strong inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2. We suggest that these novel compounds could be used for preclinical trials as antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2.
