<p id="Par38">Physicochemical properties of the RdRp protein used in our study revealed satisfactory results in terms of molecular weight, GRAVY score, and instability index capable of making strong hydrogen bonds, and are similar to previous data reported by Dwivedi et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Homology modeling results within the current study are consistent with those reported by Xu et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and Sarwar et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. However, the latter group only predicted 10 models, instead of the ~ 100 structures here. In addition, of these possible structures we selected the most suitable among them to predict the 3D structure of the RdRp protein of SARS-CoV. Moreover, in our study, the RdRp protein sequence was searched for similarity with other viral RdRps. Our results demonstrated that all the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp proteins relatively clustered together, which included isolates from Hong Kong, USA and Wuhan (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). It is suggested that the close association between all these RdRps is due to the similarity in their genome organization. Therefore, more research is needed to explore the differentiation between these viral RdRps.
