<p id="Par37">Sequencing of novel viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 helps to identify target regions for intervention. Scientists took less than 60 days to trace the origin of SARS-CoV-2, however, this virus may show similarity to other viruses based on nucleotide sequences, such as MERS, which could help to find attractive therapeutic options [

In our study, 94 validated sequences were used for construction of a phylogenetic tree to trace out similarity between all the sequences from alpha-, beta-, and gamma coronaviruses. Most of the viral species examined showed resemblance to each other and clustered together. SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequences reported from Hong Kong and USA (MN975262.1, MN997409.1, MN994467.1, MN988713.1) revealed close relation with each other as they originated from same clade and are considered as sister species (Fig.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], who demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 and bat-origin SARS-CoV clustered together, revealing similarity in their genomes (Fig.
