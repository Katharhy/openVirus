<p id="Par41">Use of FDA approved anti-polymerase drugs has been theÂ objective of virologists in treating the patients of new viral infection caused by SARS-CoV-2. The choice of FDA approved drugs was a wise decision in this current emergency arises due to COVID-19 pandemic; since they were previously tested before approval by the FDA. The present study is aimed at finding the best alternative drugs to inhibit the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2. Galidesivir and its suggested compounds pose no toxicity and are safe to consume proved in our in silico analysis. The only limitation of the study is to confirm the results of this study using in vivo and in vitro analysis. In the future, further research is direly needed to validate the results of this in silico evaluation for preclinical trials of these potent drug-like compounds CID123624208 and CID11687749.</p>
