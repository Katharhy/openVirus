<p id="Par39">Docking simulations of results of our study are in line with Xu et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] regarding their strong interaction with the following active sites: ASP760, ASP761, GLY616, TRP617, ASP618, TYR619, PRO620, LYS621, CYS622, LEU758, SER759, ALA762, ALA797, LYS798, CYS799, TRP800, HIS810, GLU811, PHE812, CYS813, SER814, GLN815 (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). This group also reported that ASP760 and ASP761 are responsible for composing the RdRp catalytic domain, while SER814 is involved in positioning of the priming nucleotide, and our results are consistent with the previous studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Similarly, the LYS798 residue was found to be involved in stabilizing the core structure of the RdRp domain, the finding is in line with other studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. In a recent study, Gao et al. reported that nucleoside analogs such as Remdesivir and Sofosbuvir strongly binds with ASP760, ASP761 and ASP618 residues to inhibit RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Our study is similar to Gao et al. reporting nucleoside analogs can form hydrogen bonds with active site of RdRp.
