<p id="Par42">The rapidly growing coronavirus cases urge the development of new therapeutics and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. In the previous studies so far, RdRp-CoV (nsp12) is the most frequently used and suggested potential target to inhibit viral replication. In this study, we tested some important anti polymerase drugs, whether they are currently in clinical trials or in the market to stop viral infection on an emergency basis. However, Galidesivir and its drug-like compounds CID123624208 and CID11687749 have shown an effective attachment to the priming site of viral RdRp, which could lead to replication failure. Moreover, for further safety, health concerns and vaccine development, the suggested compounds of our in silico assessment need further in vitro analysis for future confirmation which will lead towards preclinical trials.</p>
