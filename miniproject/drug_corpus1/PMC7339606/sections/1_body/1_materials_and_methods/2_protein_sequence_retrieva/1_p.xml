<p id="Par26">Sequence of RdRp protein for SARS-CoV-2 (YP_009725307.1) was retrieved from the NCBI protein database and contains 932 amino acids (AA). In addition, physicochemical properties—such as molecular weight, amino acid composition, atomic composition, extinction coefficient, estimated half-life, instability index, aliphatic index and grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY)—were analyzed through ProtParam tool of ExPASy for evaluation of the primary structure of RdRp protein.</p>
