<p id="Par27">RdRp protein AA from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were aligned with the help of Clustal X 2.1 software using default parameters, and the sequences were further refined by GeneDoc to find the similarity between them. This similarity helps to select a template for modeling and further analysis. RdRp proteins of SARS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and novel SARS-CoV-2 were compared for their amino acid residues. Based on similarity in amino acid residues of both RdRps, a reference template of SARS-CoV RdRp (PDB ID: 6NUR; kindly provided by the Ward lab) was used for further analysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Homology modeling was performed with the MODELLER v9.1 program using 6NUR as reference and ~ 100 structures were predicted [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The best possible structure was selected based on highest discrete optimized protein energy (DOPE) score. In addition, this best suited structure was placed in a Ramachandran plot for evaluation of chemical properties, bonds, and angles of RdRp. Moreover, the RdRp protein sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was subjected to pBLAST to infer its similarity with other RdRp protein sequences; 94 total sequences were selected that exhibited &gt; 90% similarity with our input RdRp sequence. Likewise, these 94 validated sequences were uploaded in MEGA v7 and further aligned through the CLUSTALW alignment tool. Aligned sequences were used to construct a MLE tree for understanding the phylogenies of all the validated protein sequences along with SARS-CoV-2 RdRp.
