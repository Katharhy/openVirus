<p id="Par29">All the retrieved compounds were docked using selected catalytic site of the three-dimensional structure of RdRp protein. Removal of water, 3D protonation and energy minimization were carried out with the MOE software using the following parameters: force field, MMFF94X, gradient 0.05, and current geometry [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The binding pocket of the RdRp—GLY616, TRP617, ASP618, TYR619, LEU758, SER759, ASP760, ASP761, ALA762, LYS798, TYS799, TRP800, GLU811, PHE812, CIS813, and/or SER814—was found using the MOE SiteFinder algorithm, and most optimal docked compounds were selected based on higher S-score and lower RMSD with a reference inhibitor (PubChem CID: 10445549). Docking simulations were performed for Galidesivir, a potential non-covalent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, which binds strongly to the active site of RdRp. It also targets the ASP761, ALA762, LYS798, and SER814 residues with stout hydrogen bonding and a maximum docking score. For the discovery of novel drug-like compounds, we screened compounds structurally similar to Galidesivir that may target SARS-CoV-2 RdRp as an antiviral agent. The best hits—CID123624208 and CID11687749—were selected from the docking analysis.
