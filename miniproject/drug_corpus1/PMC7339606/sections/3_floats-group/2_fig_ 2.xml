  <p>RdRp Sequence alignment of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. RdRp sequences of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were aligned for analysis of divergence, the dark region represents the conserved regions and lighter regions highlight changes in amino acids in specific sites. Only 2.46% divergence was observed between the two RdRp protein sequences</p>
