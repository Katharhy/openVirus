<p id="p0070">A prominent feature of severe SARS-CoV-2 infections is the cytokine release syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 infection of respiratory epithelial cells activates monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, resulting in secretion of a range of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6). IL-6 release instigates an amplification cascade that directly results in T helper 17 (Th17) differentiation, among other lymphocytic changes. Circulating IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor complexes indirectly activate many cell types, including endothelial cells, resulting in a flood of systemic cytokine production that contributes to hypotension and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The key role of IL-6 in this cascade has prompted evaluation of IL-6 antagonists such as tocilizumab, sarilumab, and siltuximab for treatment of severe COVID-19 disease (
