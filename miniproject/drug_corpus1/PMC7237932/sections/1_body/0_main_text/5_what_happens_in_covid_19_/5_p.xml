<p id="p0075">In addition to increased vascular permeability, the cytokine “storm” also leads to high levels of fibrinogen and activation of the coagulation cascade on endothelial surfaces of small blood vessels, signaled by very high levels of a fibrin breakdown product called D-dimer. Dysregulation of the RAAS because of competitive binding of ACE2 by the virus may also induce constriction of blood vessels. A puzzling phenomenon has been seen in COVID-19 pneumonia: some patients have extremely low blood oxygen levels, but they do not complain of breathlessness. It has been suggested that oxygen uptake in COVID-19 pneumonia is impeded because of clogged and constricted blood vessels in the lungs rather than because of congestion from accumulation of edema fluid in the alveoli, as seen in other viral pneumonias. The benefit of anticoagulants in the treatment of severe COVID-19 disease is therefore of great interest. It is becoming clear that the pathogenetic cascade triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection damages many organs in the body, from the kidneys to the brain. Such pathophysiological changes are rarely seen with other respiratory virus infections.</p>
