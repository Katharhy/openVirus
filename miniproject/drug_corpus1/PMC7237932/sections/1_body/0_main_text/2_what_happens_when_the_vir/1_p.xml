<p id="p0015">The respiratory epithelium is composed of a variety of cells that include ciliated and non-ciliated epithelial cells; goblet cells, which produce mucus that forms the first barrier for an incoming virus; and club cells, which produce proteases. Different respiratory viruses preferentially bind and infect ciliated or non-ciliated epithelial cells of the airways: pneumocytes lining the alveoli in the lungs and alveolar macrophages (

For example, avian influenza A viruses infect ciliated epithelial cells, whereas human influenza viruses infect non-ciliated epithelial cells. The presence of specific host cell molecules that are receptors for viral attachment and entry are the main determinants of which cells become infected. Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (

The receptor for the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus is human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), and human coronavirus 229E uses aminopeptidase N as its receptor. All influenza viruses use sialic acid as their receptor, but there is added subtlety; human influenza viruses bind sialic acids with α2,6-linked oligosaccharides, whereas avian influenza viruses bind sialic acids with α2,3-linked oligosaccharides (reviewed in

The presence of cells in the respiratory tract expressing the relevant viral receptor is critical for initiation of viral infection, and the clinical presentation depends on where these cells are situated in the respiratory tract. For example, if cells bearing the viral receptor are only present in the upper respiratory tract, then infection is likely to be limited to rhinitis (characterized by a runny nose and stuffiness) or pharyngitis (sore throat) (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> ). In contrast, if the viral receptor is present on cells in the lower respiratory tract (e.g., epithelial cells expressing α2,3-linked sialic acids beyond the respiratory bronchioles in the lungs), then the infecting virus (e.g., avian influenza A(H5N1) virus) causes lower respiratory tract infection.
