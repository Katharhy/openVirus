In RCTs, participants are allocated by chance alone (randomly) to receive an intervention or drug or one among two or more drugs or interventions; randomization minimizes bias in measuring the effectiveness of a new intervention or treatment. Some of the drugs that were evaluated are the HIV protease inhibitor combination of lopinavir-ritonavir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and remdesivir. Lopinavir-ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine have not shown clear clinical benefits to date, although some RCTs are still ongoing. Clinical improvement regarding need for oxygen support and mechanical ventilation have been reported with use of remdesivir in a compassionate use study, where the drug was used in patients with severe disease outside of a clinical trial when no other treatments were available. A placebo-controlled RCT of remdesivir in China failed to demonstrate a statistically significant clinical benefit in treated patients (

A preliminary report of the data is now available, and the drug has been approved for treatment of COVID-19 in the US (
