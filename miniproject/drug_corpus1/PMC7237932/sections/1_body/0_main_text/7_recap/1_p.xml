<p id="p0100">A diverse group of viruses, including coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, RSV, parainfluenza, and influenza viruses, target the respiratory tract, cause a range of infections from rhinitis to pneumonia, and represent a large global burden of disease. The viruses infect epithelial cells of the respiratory tract after binding distinct cell surface receptors, and infection rapidly triggers innate immune responses. However, viruses employ several strategies to inhibit antiviral immunity in the host. TÂ cell responses are critical for viral clearance, and antibody responses directed against respiratory viruses can protect against re-infection, although reinfection occurs over the course of a lifetime with many respiratory viruses. COVID-19 refers to the respiratory illness caused by SARS-CoV-2, a zoonotic coronavirus that emerged in China in 2019 and has rapidly spread around the world in a pandemic. COVID-19 pneumonia differs from that caused by other respiratory viruses in the severity and duration of inflammation, which appears to be driven by an exuberant innate immune response, a flood of proinflammatory cytokines, and multiorgan dysfunction, driven by derangements in pulmonary and clotting physiology. As the pandemic evolves, we are gaining a better understanding of the complex pathophysiology underlying COVID-19 disease. Treatment strategies currently under study include antiviral agents, immunomodulators, antibodies, and adjunctive therapies.</p>
