<p id="p0040">Innate responses are activated when macrophages encounter damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as intracellular contents released from dying cells or proteins released by tissue injury, or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as viral RNA or oxidized phospholipids from invading pathogens. DAMPs and PAMPs released during initial infection and lysis of pneumocytes (surface epithelial cells of the alveoli) activate multiple innate immune pathways through Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NLRP3 and/or inflammasome activation, or triggering of cytoplasmic DNA sensors such as RIG-I-MAVS and cGAS-STING (reviewed in

The signal transduction that follows drives production of cytokines that activate antiviral gene expression programs in neighboring cells. They also recruit additional innate and adaptive immune cells with diverse roles in antiviral immunity, tissue repair, and homeostasis. Dysregulation of the innate immune response contributes to the cytokine storm seen in severe influenza A/H5N1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection.
