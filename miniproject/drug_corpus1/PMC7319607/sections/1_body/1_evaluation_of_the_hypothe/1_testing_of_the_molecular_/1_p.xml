<p id="p0070">The NCBI pBlast tool was used to test the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 contains a calcium-dependent fusion domain(s) similar to those that were recently discovered in both Rubella and SARS-CoV-1. An amino acid comparison of the two relevant amino acid regions in S protein of SARS-CoV-1 representing fusion loop 1 (FL1 = Amino Acids 798–819) and fusion loop 2 (FL2 = Amino Acids 835–855) was conducted using the Protein Blast program from the National Center for Biotechnology Information

 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> exhibit the data from the Protein Blast Alignment Tool data from the calcium binding fusion domains, labeled FL1 and FL2 respectively, that compare the spike proteins of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) with SARS-COV and Rubella utilizing cited reference data; GenBank: QHD43416.1 (CoV-2), NCBI Reference Sequence: NP_828851.1(CoV-1), GenBank: ACN50046.1. (Rubella), GenBank: CAA71056.1 (Human coronavirus229E) and GenBank: AD177360.1 (hemagglutinin [Influenza A virus (A/Boston/136/2009(H1N1))]).
