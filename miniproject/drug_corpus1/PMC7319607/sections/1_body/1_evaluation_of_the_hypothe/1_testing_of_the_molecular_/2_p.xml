<p id="p0075">The results demonstrated a 100% and a 95% correspondence respectively between the postulated FL1 and FL2 domains in SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) compared to the known FL regions for SARS-CoV-1 described in 2017. Additionally, the less pathogenic Alpha coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) has a solitary FL2 domain and a reduced homology length compared to the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) FL2. Similarly, amino acids 49 to 55 of the Rubella Virus membrane glycoprotein E2 virus also have a smaller, but significant homology with the FL2 domain. In contrast, the Influenza H1N1 hemagglutinin (HA) protein has no significant similarity to any of the CoV FL domains. The reduced homology of HCoV-229Eâ€™s single calcium-binding domain to SARS-CoV-2 suggests attenuation of HCoV-229E, which is consistent with HC0V-229E having crossed species barriers to infect humans decades or centuries ago
