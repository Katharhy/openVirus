<p id="p0035">In one study, volunteer subjects received an inhalation challenge with increasing concentrations of EDTA (0.25 to 10.0 mg/mL) in a double-blind fashion 
 <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Here, EDTA produced a concentration-dependent bronchoconstriction that did not resolve spontaneously within 1 hour. Mean EDTA PC
 <sub>20</sub>  FEV
 <sub>1</sub>  was 2.4 mg/mL (range 1.2 to 12.8 mg/mL). This study concluded that there was no significant difference in airway response to EDTA among volunteers receiving Beta2-agonist treatments 
 <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. To study off-target bronchoconstriction by EDTA, it was found that Albuterol (1 µg/kg IV) significantly attenuated Na2EDTA-induced bronchoconstriction in canines

 <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. There were an estimated 500,000 visits for chelation therapy in the U.S. for 1993 
 <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, and 800,000 in 1997 
 <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. A Canadian survey found that 8% of patients who had undergone cardiac catheterization had used chelation therapy
