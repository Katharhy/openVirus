<p id="p0005">While the Coronavirus family of single-stranded enveloped RNA viruses is divided into four genera: α-CoVs, β-CoVs, γ-CoVs, and δ-CoVs, only alpha and beta can infect mammals 
 <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. After binding to their respective receptors, the Coronavirus viruses enter cells through endocytosis with the viral spike proteins driving the fusion of viral and endosomal membranes to enable insertion of the viral genome into the cytoplasm 
 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The less pathogenic Alphacorona virus 229E (HCoV-229E) was isolated from students suffering from the common cold in 1966 
 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. HCoV-229E is highly prevalent and most people experience acute infection during their childhood 
 <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. One study found 65% of the children between the age of 2.5 and 3.5 years were seropositive for HCoV-229E 
 <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The HCoV-229E virus binds to the aminopeptidase N receptor (CD13) 
 <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and enters the cell after cleavage by TMPRSS2 and fusion 
 <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The more pathogenic SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) viruses belong to the β-genus.
