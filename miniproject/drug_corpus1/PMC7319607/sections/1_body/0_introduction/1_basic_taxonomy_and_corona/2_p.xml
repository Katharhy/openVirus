<p id="p0010">The Betacorona virus SARS-CoV2 is a positive-sense single‐stranded ribonucleic acid (ssRNA) of approximately 29,700 nucleotides in length, of about 80% identical to that of SARS-CoV-1 and approximately 96% identical to the bat coronavirus BatCoV RaTG13 
 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The Spike (S) protein is 1273 amino acid long and S viral envelope protein that has two main subunits (S1 and S2) which protrude outwards with a ‘corona’ like appearance and binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors 
 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The amino-terminal subunit is responsible for receptor binding and is labeled the S1 domain. The C-terminal part, labeled the S2 domain, contains the fusion machinery. More specifically, amino acids 318–510 of the S1 represent the receptor-binding domain (RBD) that binds to ACE2 
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. CoV S proteins have two cleavage sites and protease cleavage is required for S2 fusion to the cell membrane. There is an S1/S2 site composed of the amino acids RSVR that is located at the border between the S1 and S2 subunits and an S2′ site, composed of the amino acids RSAR. In SARS-CoV-2, the S2′ site is located at amino acid 815, just upstream of the putative fusion loop peptides present within the S2 subunit discussed below. In SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 the type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) TMPRSS2 cleaves the S1–S2 subunits 
 <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. It is also noteworthy that TMPRSS2 has two calcium-binding domains; a SRCR (scavenger receptor cysteine-rich) domain (aa 149–242) and a LDLRA (LDL receptor class A) domain (aa 113–148) that forms a binding site for calcium 
 <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The SRCR is a conserved calcium-dependent domain in which binding was disrupted by EDTA 
 <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Together, the LDLRA and SRCR‐like domains that may serve as substrate recognition sites.
