<p id="p0015">Even now, the actual mechanism of virus membrane fusion is not completely understood. In the case of Coronaviruses (CoVs), it is not a simple two-step process of receptor binding (via the S1 domain) and membrane fusion (via the S2 domain containing the fusion peptide). Viral entry into host cells requires that there is a domain of the S protein that interacts with opposing hydrophobic cellular membranes called a fusion peptide or fusion loop. These fusion peptides (fusion loops, FL) are generally external amino acid domains that insert into the host membranes after major conformational changes of the virus S protein following proteolytic cleavage to initiate the process fusion with the host membrane.</p>
