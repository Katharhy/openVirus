<p id="par0050">This study revealed that the EC50 of hydroxychloroquine was lower than that of chloroquine, both in therapeutic and prophylactic use, which translated into greater efficacy of hydroxychloroquine compared to its precursor. Likewise, the efficacy was greater for both drugs at 48 h that at 24 h after administration, which could reflect its ability to accumulate. Given this peculiar kinetics, a computer model calculated that the safest and most effective regimen for patients was an initial induction dose of 400 mg twice a day on day 1, followed by 200 mg twice a day for the next 4 days, managing to keep the calculated concentrations in blood and lungs relatively stable throughout the treatment.</p>
