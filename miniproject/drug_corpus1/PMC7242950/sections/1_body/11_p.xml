<p id="par0060">This study, which has been heavily criticized for not presenting results on mortality or the clinical progression of patients, as well as for an excessive speed in the review, was followed by an observational study which became available on the Internet on 
 <bold>29th March</bold>, carried out by the same group, which analyses the clinical course, contagiousness (PCR &lt; 34 or positive culture), and length of hospital stay in a sample of 80 patients ranging from 20 to 88 years of age (
 <italic>μ</italic>  = 52.5) treated with the previous regimen (92%) or adding a broad-spectrum antibiotic (ceftriaxone). Although the discharge criteria varied during admission due to the increase in care burden, it is striking that 81.3% of patients were discharged on an average of 4.1 days from the start of therapy, and 4.6 days from admission, with a low score on the NEWS scale, which estimates the presence of disease; 16.2% and 1.2% of hospitalized patients remained in the infectious diseases department and ICU, respectively, and only one 86-year-old patient who had been admitted with advanced pneumonia died during the study. Similar to what happened in the preliminary study, contagiousness experienced a rapid and progressive decrease, with negative PCR in 83% of patients on the seventh day, and 93% on the eighth day.
