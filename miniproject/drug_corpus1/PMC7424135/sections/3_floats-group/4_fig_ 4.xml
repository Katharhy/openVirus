  <p>Functional scheme of the renin-angiotensin system. The protease renin converts the precursor angiotensinogen to Angiotensin I (Ang I) and subsequently converted to Ang II by dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Ang II binds to the AT1 receptor (AT1R) to stimulate inflammation, fibrosis, oxidative stress and an increase in blood pressure. Ang II are converted to Ang-(1-7) via endopeptidases (NEP) and the monocarboxypeptidase ACE2, respectively. Ang-(1-7) binds to the Mas-R to exert anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic actions, stimulate the release of nitric oxide and reduce blood pressure. SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 to stimulate internalization of both the virus and peptidase causing deleterious effects. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) regulate the metabolic pathway</p>
