<p id="Par31">A decreased lymphocyte count and an increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) level are the most common laboratory findings [

As the infection advances, white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil count, platelet count, red blood cell distribution width-coefficient of variation (RDW-CV), and RDW-standard deviation (RDW-SD) parameters elevates with severity of the diseases; while, lymphocyte count, eosinophil count, red blood cell count (RBC), hemoglobin, and hematocrit parameters decreases. The combined neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and RDW-SD parameter is the best hematology index [
