<p id="Par21">The S1 domain of the SARS-CoV attaches to its cellular receptor ACE2 on the host cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Binding of the SARS- CoV-2 spike protein to ACE2, followed by a conformational change in the S-glycoprotein permitting proteolysis of ACE2 by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) to generate the S1 and S2 subunits is a critical step for S2-induced membrane fusion and virus internalization by endocytosis in the pulmonary epithelium. The entry of the virus into cells further facilitates virus multiplication and cell- to- cell transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], and is thought to suppress expression of ACE2. This suppression of ACE2 causes decrease in tissue level and reduces Ang-(1–7) formation, and correspondingly increase in Ang II levels. ACE further converts Ang-(1–7) to less biologically active peptides. This process can drive an Ang II–AT1R- mediated inflammatory response in the lungs and prospectively stimulate parenchymal injury [
