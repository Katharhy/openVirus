<p id="Par20">Angiotensin II (Ang II) is the major effector of the RAAS that advances hypertension partly by decreasing baroreceptor sensitivity to maintain heart rate, and increasing vasoconstriction, sodium retention, oxidative stress, inflammation and fibrosis. Evidence from various studies favors a crucial function of ACE2 to efficiently degrade Ang II to Ang-(1-7), which antagonizes the effects of Ang II (Fig.

On the contrary, ACE converts Ang I into Ang II, which acts at the type 1 angiotensin receptor (AT1R) and increase blood pressure by inducing vasoconstriction, increasing kidney reabsorption of sodium and water by the kidney, and generating oxidative stress to promote inflammation and fibrosis (Fig.
