<p id="Par46">The main protease (Mpro) of SARS CoV-2 is an important component of this viral replication. Three polyphenols (epigallocatechin gallate, epicatechingallate and gallocatechin-3-gallate) of green tea [

 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> L. (Zingiberaceae family) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>] interact strongly with one or both catalytic residues (His41 and Cys145) of Mpro, and are considered as potential inhibitors against SARS CoV-2 Mpro. Famotidine, a class A G protein-coupled receptor antagonist used for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux, is reported to interact within the catalytic site of the three proteases associated with SARS-CoV2 replication [
