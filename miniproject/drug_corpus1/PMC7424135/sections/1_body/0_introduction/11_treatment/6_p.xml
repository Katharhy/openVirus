<p id="Par45">E proteins of SARS-CoV2 form ion channels. Result revealed that α-helix and loops present in this protein is associated with the random movement under optimal condition, which successively alter ion channel activity; and thereby developing the disease. Inhibition of those ion channels after binding with three phytochemicals, such as, belachinal, macaflavanone E, and vibsanol B, reduces the random motion of the human “SARS-CoV-2 E” protein, inhibit its function and controlling the disease [
