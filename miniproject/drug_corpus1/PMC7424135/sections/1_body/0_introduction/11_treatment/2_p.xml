Some drugs that are indicated for other afflictions are being tested, although without unambiguous evidence.Â Lipophilic antibiotics tetracyclines (e.g. tetracycline, doxycycline, and minocycline) can chelate zinc (Zn) compounds on matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Coronaviruses are believed to depend on host MMPs for survival, cell infiltration, cell to cell adhesion, and replication; many of those have Zn as a part of their MMP complex. It is possible that the Zn-chelating characteristic of tetracyclines may be responsible to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, and controlling their capacity to multiply within the host [
