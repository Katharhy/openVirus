<p id="Par47">There has been growing interest in the use of anti-malaria and anti-amebiasis drugs chloroquine (CQ, N4-(7-Chloro-4-quinolinyl)-N1,N1-diethyl-1,4-pentanediamine) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), as potential treatments for COVID-19. Chloroquine inhibits quinone reductase 2, which is involved in the biosynthesis of sialic acids [
