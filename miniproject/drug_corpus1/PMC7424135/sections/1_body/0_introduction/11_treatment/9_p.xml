<p id="Par48">A few broad-spectrum antiviral drugs were tested against COVID-19 in clinical trials. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is an essential protease that mediates the replication of RNA from RNA template for coronaviruses and is an important therapeutic target. Some clinical assessments against viral RdRp inhibitors had been conducted. Favipiravir, a purine nucleic acid analogue and effective RdRp inhibitor, which is endorsed against influenza, is additionally being considered in different clinical trials [

Remdesivir, an analogue of adenosine with broad-spectrum antiviral agent has shown a high capacity to block infection and viral replication in vitro and in animals with attainable concentrations in human plasma against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It seems that remdesivir may be one amongst the few antiviral drugs with proven efficacy against SARS-CoV2 [
