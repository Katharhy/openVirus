<p id="Par7">Using all accessible genomic information, the phylogenetic tree investigation has ascertained the high sequence similarity (&gt; 99%) between all the existing sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes, with the closest as Bat coronavirus (BCoV) sequence resembling 96.2% sequence identity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], while pangolin-CoV shares 85.98% identity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], authenticating the conception of a zoonotic origin of 2019-nCoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Other studies including full genome sequencing of strains from China, Japan, USA, Finland and Korea showed more than 99.9% sequence homology [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Sequence homology of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV was accounted 77.5% and 50%, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. One study on the sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from India illustrated high (~ 99.98%) identity with Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus (accession number: NC 045512) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].
