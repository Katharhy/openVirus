<p id="Par10">Phylogenetic and alignment study of 591 novel coronaviruses of different clades from Group I to Group V identified several mutations and related amino acid changes. Detailed analysis on nucleotide substitution revealed 43 synonymous and 57 non-synonymous type substitutions in the coding region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The nonsynonymous substitutions resulting into 57 amino acid changes were reported to be distributed over different human CoV proteins with maximum on spike protein [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].
