<p id="Par8">Analysing the 15 obtainable whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2, 12 whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and 12 extremely related whole genome sequences available in gene bank (five from the SARS-CoV, two from MERS-CoV, and five from bat SARS-like CoV) explained the mutation in spike glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It has been suggested that C-to-U conversion mediated by C deamination played a significant role in the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These outcomes implied that SARS-CoV-2 could have been evolving for a relatively long period in humans following the transfer from animals before spreading worldwide.
