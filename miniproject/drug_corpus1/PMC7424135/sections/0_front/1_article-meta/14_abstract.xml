 <p id="Par1">Since the beginning of this century, beta coronaviruses (CoV) have caused three zoonotic outbreaks. However, little is currently known about the biology of the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019. There is a spectrum of clinical features from mild to severe life threatening disease with major complications like severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute cardiac injury and septic shock. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes polyproteins, four structural proteins and six accessory proteins. SARS-CoV-2 tends to utilize Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of various mammals. The imbalance between ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway and ACE2/Ang(1â€“7)/Mas receptor pathway in the renin-angiotensin system leads to multi-system inflammation. The early symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia are low to midgrade fever, dry cough and fatigue. Vigilant screening is important. The diagnosis of COVID-19 should be based on imaging findings along with epidemiological history and nucleic acid detection. Isolation and quarantine of suspected cases is recommended. Management is primarily supportive, with newer antiviral drugs/vaccines under investigation.</p>
