 </xref> has directed a new strategy to strengthen vector monitoring and control worldwide, stating that through increased capacity, improved surveillance and response in coordinating and integrating actions, disease can be prevented/managed. In 2017, the World Health Assembly adopted a resolution (WHA 70.16: An integrated approach for the control of vector-borne diseases

 </xref>) asking Member States for strategies to implement vector control. 2020 goals include Reduction in: (i) mortality due to vector-borne diseases globally relative to 2016 (by 30%), (ii) case incidence due to vector-borne diseases globally relative to 2016 (by 25%), and to ask of all countries to contain spread of disease to prevent epidemics of vector-borne diseases. This issue includes articles highlighting host immune responses and development of biomarkers that may assist in disease management. Wang et al., shows that host antibodies to the Plasmodium TatD-like DNase protected mouse models from infection (
