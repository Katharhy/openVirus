<p>Types of disease models require specific study and attention for worldwide reduction. Viral diseases continue to be a major threat to health and safety in the twenty-first century for both human and wild or domestic animal species. A more comprehensive One Health framework, using environmental data such as land, water, anthropogenic data (population growth, spatial connectivity) and vector and host distribution is required. This is underscored by the recent emergence and re-emergence of Ebola virus, avian influenza H5N1 &amp; H7N9, Nipah and Hendra viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoV, Zika, the current coronavirus outbreak, and the continuous increased controllable viral outbreaks due to lack of immunization (e.g., measles). Locality mapping of Zika virus (ZIKV) shows the migration of the virus from Africa to Asia and further suggests changes that occurred in different lineages result in vastly different disease outcomes: one associated with microcephaly and one that is not (

This study exemplifies how little is known about interactions of viruses with hosts. In addition, changes in the virus-host ecology that results in cross-species contact and transmission will require much time and financial investment for adequate study in the field, the lab, and in populations.
