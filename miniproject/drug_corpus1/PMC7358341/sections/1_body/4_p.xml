<p>Topics touch upon other vastly different problems facing public health such as disease dissemination, treatment, emergence, and re-emergence of diseases, historical surveys to understand disease migration, etc. as it pertains to globalization and climate change. Malaria Vector

Genetics has proven to be a powerful tool for understanding spread, etiology of disease, and search for better treatments and diagnostics.
