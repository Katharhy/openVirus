Urbanization and deforestation resulting in loss of habitat for existing plants and animals have placed humans and animals in closer contact under unnatural circumstances increasing the human-animal interface. Changing patterns of land use and the increase in international travel, trade, and shipping bring human populations into increased contact with various vectors that travel with humans and transported goods, including completely different biomes, from tropical to temperate. Global and local climatic alterations and other environmental changes have only intensified this matter, with the potential for worldwide spread of certain vector species. The collective geographic ranges of all known host species further complicates the issues of disease, as the range of many vectors is now greatly expanded due to changes in climate and increase of transport connectivity, allowing invasive species to cross borders more readily. In this issue,

This is only one example of the many contributing factors to the spread of infectious diseases. The development of predictive models for future zoonotic/vector-borne disease incidence by using established cross-disciplinary tools integrating both classic and novel tools (e.g., epidemiology and machine learning) should be at the forefront of research.
