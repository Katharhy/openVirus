<p>This Research Topic Emerging Infectious and Vector-Borne Diseases: A Global Challenge calls for more pre-emptive approaches to mitigating infectious diseases as climate change (deforestation/invasive plants, urbanization and globalization) blurs boarders for disease causing agents (e.g., viral spread through increased modes of human transportations or climate changes that allow for vectors including plant hosts to migrate to new regions). Future risk requires baseline data worldwide. Information should be collected routinely regarding geographic, taxonomic (with respect to animal reservoirs) occurrence of vectors, and for human populations to assess disease risks and spread. Lastly, the environment itself requires study in order to assess best practices to prevent “edge effect,” the transfer of viruses, bacteria, fungi, and other parasites. We hope that this issue raises thought provoking ideas and science moving forward.</p>
