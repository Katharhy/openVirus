  <p>The effect on the increasing rate of cases with strict travel restrictions. Red arrow indicates the date after which Wuhan was under strict travel restriction. It was the first time in human history that the gates of a city with a population of about 9 million were almost totally closed by a virus. The data on day 19 were unavailable. The number of cases in Hubei increased much faster than in other provinces after the travel restrictions were imposed.</p>
