<p id="p0040">As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A, the challenges brought to us by the two epidemics are quite different. By January 30, 2020, the cumulative number of 2019-nCoV cases in China had exceeded the total number of previous SARS cases worldwide [
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and many new cases appeared in only one month. Currently, there are still more than 3000 new confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection daily. As of the date of this publication, the total number of confirmed domestic cases has risen to 78064 [
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. During this period, the diagnosis, isolation, admission and treatment of patients have become the biggest challenges that China and the international community need to face. It is reassuring that the vast majority of cases of 2019-nCOV are still concentrated in China, and the number of transmitting countries and regions is currently 28 (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B), slightly lower than the number of countries that reported SARS cases [
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition, no deaths have been reported in any country outside of China, except for the death of a pneumonia patient in the Philippines [
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] (as of February 9, 2020). Since 2019-nCOV has an incubation period of 5.3–19 days (average of 5.2 days) [
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], the effects of international traffic control measures in 2020 need to be further observed.
