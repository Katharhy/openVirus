<p id="p0050">The government’s rapid response to the epidemic has benefited in part from the substantial improvement of the national scientific research ability and research equipment, as well as the efficient communication of research results. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>D, the disease caused by 2019-nCOV was diagnosed 8 days after the first cases appeared [
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], the entire virus gene sequence was obtained on the 11th day, the virus nucleic acid diagnostic technology was established on the 14th day [
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>], the live virus was isolated on the 25th day [
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and the study on the intermediate host was reported on the 39th day 
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. In contrast, the SARS virus was isolated in 125 days [
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], the disease was formally diagnosed in 146 days [
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], a virus nucleic acid diagnostic method was established in 151 days [
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and the full gene sequence of the virus was obtained in 160 days [
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. As noted in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C, during the 2019-nCoV epidemic, most of the government’s major epidemic prevention measures were also implemented quickly after the disease was diagnosed.
