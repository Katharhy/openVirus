  <p>COVID-19 diagnostic test by RT-PCR. First, cotton swab is deployed to collect the secretion sample from the patient â€™s nose or throat. The virus particles in the sample are then deactivated along with the separation of RNA strands. Then, the purified RNA strands are copied by utilizing reverse transcription and amplified by RT-PCR to detect the presence of virus-specific gene sequences. Created with BioRender.com.</p>
