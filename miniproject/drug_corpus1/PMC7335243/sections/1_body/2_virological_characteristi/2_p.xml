<p id="para0006">As previously mentioned, SARS-CoV-2, belonging to the coronaviridae family, is the causative pathogen of COVID-19. Closely resembled other β-CoVs, the SARS-CoV-2 virion with a genome size of ∼3 kb has a nucleocapsid consisted of genomic RNA and phosphorylated nucleocapsid (N) protein 
 <xref rid="bib0027" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Of note, the nucleocapsid is embedded in a phospholipid bilayer and is encased by two disparate types of spike proteins: spike glycoprotein trimmer present in all CoVs and the hemagglutinin-esterase shared merely in some CoVs. The spike (S) protein plays a pivotal role in binding to receptors and is the key to determine host tropism and transmission capacity (

 <xref rid="bib0028" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Genome analysis showed that the SARS-CoV-2 possesses 5′ and 3′ terminal sequences, with a gene order 5′ -replicase open reading frame (ORF) 1ab-S-envelope(E)-membrane(M)-N-3′ 
 <xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The virus particles are 60–100 nm in diameter, and are round or oval 
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. It can be inactivated by ultraviolet light or heated at 56 °C for 30 min and is sensitive to most disinfectants (
