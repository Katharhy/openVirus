<p id="para0054">Rapid genome-wide association of SARS-CoV-2, along with international sharing of information, enabled us to generate rapider and more proper diagnostic tools. As set forth, the major fashioned diagnostic tools are qRT-PCR-based approaches, requiring a long time for specimen preparation and analysis, thus putting off the imperative actions for COVID-19 infections. Of note, in acute respiratory infections, RT-PCR is commonly utilized for detecting pathogenic viruses in respiratory secretions. The positive rate of PCR from oropharyngeal swabs is not very high, implicating the requirement of more swab testing are need to confirm the diagnosis. With the continuous spread of SARS-CoV-2, there is a desperate demand to develop rapid diagnostic methods that can be tested more efficiently.</p>
