<p id="para0034">Hydroxychloroquine is an analog of chloroquine, and there are few studies on its interaction 
 <xref rid="bib0103" ref-type="bibr">[103]</xref>. In previous SARS outbreaks, hydroxychloroquine was found to possess anti-SARS-CoV capacity

 <xref rid="bib0104" ref-type="bibr">[104]</xref>. In line with the research of Yao et al. by applying a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model, they found that hydroxychloroquine is more effective than chloroquine in Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">[105]</xref>. Of note, it has been revealed that cytokines IL-6 and IL-10 are elevated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may induce the cytokine storm (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), which in turn cause multiple organ failure and death 
 <xref rid="bib0049" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine possess immunomodulatory effects and can inhibit such immune responses 
 <xref rid="bib0106" ref-type="bibr">[106]</xref>. Hence, Chinese hospitals and Oxford University had initiated 21 clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy of these drugs in COVID-19 infection. The further crucial study may relate with the determination of whether the benefit of chloroquine treatment is hinged on the age of the patients as well as the clinical manifestations 
 <xref rid="bib0107" ref-type="bibr">[107]</xref>. Recently, a multinational registry analysis of the application of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine unraveled that there might be an increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmias during the treatment of COVID-19 diseases 
 <xref rid="bib0108" ref-type="bibr">[108]</xref>. The WHO has also suspended hydroxychloroquine treatment in COVID-19 solidarity trial in terms of the outcomes of in-hospital mortality and de-novo ventricular arrhythmias
