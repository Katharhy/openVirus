<p id="para0039">Based on data mining, the Traditional Chinese Medicine was also regarded as an alternative method for the treatment of COVID-19 disease in high-risk populations. During the COVID-19 outbreak in China, Chinese herbal drugs such as 
 <italic>Astragali Radix, Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma, Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma, Saposhnikoviae Radix, Lonicerae Japonicae Flos</italic> and 
 <italic>Fructus forsythia</italic> were commonly harnessed for improving the treatment effect of COVID-19 infections. Herbal medications can offer a more effective and personalized treatment by adjusting the specific medicine for each patient based on the disparate syndromes
