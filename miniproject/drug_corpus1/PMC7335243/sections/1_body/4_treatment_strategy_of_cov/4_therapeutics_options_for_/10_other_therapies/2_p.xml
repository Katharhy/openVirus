<p id="para0041">Hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) appears to be another potential therapeutic option for COVID-19. Of note, health experts have said that this compound could help prevent the virus from spreading across the body and from causing damage 
 <xref rid="bib0128" ref-type="bibr">[128]</xref>. A recent study illustrated that even just 0.5% of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> could kill human CoVs, such as those that caused SARS and MERS

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> to fight viral infections. The microscopic mist can easily penetrate the nostrils, sinuses and lungs, which are commonly affected by respiratory diseases like COVID-19. Besides, molecular hydrogen has been verified to favorably modulate the generation of both O
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>âˆ’</sup> and NO through influencing NADPH oxidase, and the NOS enzymes

 <sub>2</sub>/O
 <sub>2</sub>: 66.6%/33.3%) treatment may improve the symptoms
