<p id="para0025">Nucleoside analogs can interfere with cellular nucleotide synthesis pathways and terminate viral genome replication through accumulating mutations and cutting off the entry of natural nucleotides 
 <xref rid="bib0083" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref>. Since nucleosides and nucleotides are the basic components of viral nucleic acids, nucleoside analogs serve as viral RNA synthesis inhibitors in a wide spectrum of RNA viruses. With the view of the targeting ability toward RdRp, nucleoside analogs are responsible for viral RNA replication
