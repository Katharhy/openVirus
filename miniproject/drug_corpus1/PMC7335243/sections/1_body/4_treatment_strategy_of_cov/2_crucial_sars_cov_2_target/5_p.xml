<p id="para0018">In addition, Bojkova et al. recently identified the host cell pathways modulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection and revealed that suppression of these pathways may prevent viral replication in human cells 
 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. Of note, SARS-CoV-2 infection profile was determined by translatome3 and proteome proteomics at different times after infection, suggesting that this virus could reshape central cellular pathways (
