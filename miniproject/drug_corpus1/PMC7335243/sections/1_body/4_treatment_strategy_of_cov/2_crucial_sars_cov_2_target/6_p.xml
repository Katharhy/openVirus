<p id="para0019">The last point of view is the application of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). SARS-CoV-2 can disintegrate in host cells, releasing the nucleocapsid and viral RNA into the cytoplasm, and then translate ORF1a/b into pp1a and pp1ab for genomic RNA replication 
 <xref rid="bib0066" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. Hence, siRNAs targeting structural genes may play a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infections, and further optimizing the delivery of siRNAs
