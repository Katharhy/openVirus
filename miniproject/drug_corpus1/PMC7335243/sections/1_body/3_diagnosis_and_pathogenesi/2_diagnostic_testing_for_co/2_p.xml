 <xref rid="bib0038" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Technologies such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR), and reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) have been leveraged as ideal diagnostic tests for CoVs

As the gold standard for diagnosing the source of infection, PCR holds the preponderance that the primers required for such assays can be generated relatively quickly once the viral sequence is identified (

 <xref rid="bib0041" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Soon after the virus was identified, the first quantitative RT-PCR assays to detect SARS-CoV-2 were inaugurated and distributed in January 2020 by WHO. Nevertheless, this test protocol was complicated and high-priced, and is primarily applicable for large centralized diagnostic laboratories. As for the diagnostic criteria currently formulated by the China National Health Commission, nasopharyngeal cancer and oropharyngeal swab tests have ripened into the standard evaluation for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. So far, three new RT-PCR tests targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)/helicase (Hel), nucleocapsid, and spike genes of SARS-CoV-2 had been inaugurated, with extremely lower detection limit

 <xref rid="bib0042" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. The SARS-CoV E gene detection was superior to the RdRp gene test combined with the one-step RT-PCR system. The E gene PCR was adequate for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the RdRp protocol was endorsed to verify positive results 
 <xref rid="bib0043" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Remarkably, a new FDA-authorized COVID-19 test using the Abbott ID NOW diagnostics platform has been developed, which can produce results in just 5Â minutes cutting down on wait times both in terms of getting tested and receiving a diagnosis. As gene detection of SARS-CoV-2 might provide false negative results, it can be complemented by antibody detection, especially to better screen asymptomatic patients.
