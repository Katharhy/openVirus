<p id="para0044">As for the vaccine development of SARS-CoV-2, the pivotal and tangible avenues can be divided into four aspects: (1) Selection of antigen epitope; (2) Overcoming the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) issue; (3) Weighing humoral immunity and cellular immunity; (4) Selection of technical route befittingly. Up till now, structural epitope mapping by homology modeling has uncovered the immunoreactive antigen epitopes of SARS-CoV-2
