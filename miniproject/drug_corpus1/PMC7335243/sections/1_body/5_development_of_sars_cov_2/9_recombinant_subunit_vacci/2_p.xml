<p id="para0050">Subunit vaccines are superior to other types of vaccines since they are highly safe and possess fewer adverse effects via eliciting the immune system without drawing into any infectious viruses 
 <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. It has also been reported that the enhancement of T cell responses and generation of high titer neutralizing Abs were observed 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> during the vaccine development researches 
 <xref rid="bib0157" ref-type="bibr">[157]</xref>. Clover Biopharmaceuticals was pre-clinically testing a recombinant subunit vaccine in the light of the S-Trimer of the SARS-CoV-2 
 <xref rid="bib0158" ref-type="bibr">[158]</xref>. The researchers detected the antigen-specific neutralizing Abs in the sera of fully recovered patients 
 <xref rid="bib0158" ref-type="bibr">[158]</xref>. Besides, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) disclosed a vaccine which can elicit a protective immune response against SARS. The vaccine contains an S protein immunogen, which was combined with the emulsion adjuvant, GSK2, yielding elevated level of anti-SARS-CoV IgG2a/IgG2b Ab responses. Recently, GSK and Clover Biopharmaceuticals announced a partnership to enhance immune response via introducing GSK's adjuvant system to S-Trimer 
 <xref rid="bib0159" ref-type="bibr">[159]</xref>. In addition, the team of the University of Queensland is also designing subunit vaccines via the transformative technology, known as “molecular clamp” 
 <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">[160]</xref>. Molecular clamps are peptides that stabilize surface proteins, improve the recognition of correct antigens, and lead to a more robust immune response. This vaccine platform can be easily applied to a variety of enveloped viruses and rapidly manufacture their products
