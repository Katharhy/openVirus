More recently, sero-surveillance of healthy blood donors conducted in 2019 revealed high rates of unreported ONNV infection in Uganda. Due to similar clinical symptoms with other endemic mosquito-borne pathogens in the region, including chikungunya virus, dengue virus and malaria, ONNV infections are often un- or misdiagnosed. Elucidating the immunopathogenic factors of this re-emerging arbovirus is critical with the expanding geographic distribution of competent vectors. This study reports the establishment of an immune competent C57BL6/J mouse model to mechanistically characterize ONNV infection and assess potential treatment efficacy. This mouse model successfully recapitulated arthralgia and viremia profiles seen in ONNV patients. Furthermore, longitudinal <italic>in-vivo</italic> PET imaging with [<sup>18</sup>F]FB-IL-2 (CD25+CD4+ binding probe) and histopathological assessment in this model demonstrated the pathogenic role of CD4+ T cells in driving joint pathology. Concordantly, <italic>in vivo</italic> CD4+ T cell depletion, or suppression with fingolimod, an FDA-approved immunomodulating drug, abrogated CD4+ T cell-mediated disease. This study demonstrates the importance of this immune competent ONNV model for future studies on factors influencing disease pathogenesis, which could shape the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies for arthritogenic alphaviruses.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>O'nyong-nyong virus</kwd><kwd>alphavirus</kwd><kwd>immunopathogenesis</kwd><kwd>CD4+ T cells</kwd><kwd>drug repositioning</kwd><kwd>PET imaging</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Agency for Science, Technology and Research<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001348</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Biomedical Research Council<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100012415</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn002">IAF311006</award-id><award-id rid="cn002">H16/99/b0/011</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="35"/><page-count count="12"/><word-count count="6941"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>O'nyong-nyong virus (ONNV) is a mosquito-borne arthritogenic alphavirus. ONNV-infected patients display acute clinical symptoms of low-grade fever, self-limiting polyarthralgia, and other disease manifestations like lymphadenopathy, generalized maculopapular skin rash, and rare occurrences of bleeding gums and nosebleeds (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). There are also cases of prolonged joint pain during the convalescence phase, although no further complications are reported (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). ONNV cases are often underestimated and misdiagnosed for other endemic infectious diseases with more pronounced, overlapping symptoms, such as chikungunya virus (CHIKV), dengue virus (DENV) or malaria.</p><p>ONNV has been the cause of few, but major epidemics confined to Africa. It was first discovered in 1959, during a large outbreak in northern Uganda that affected more that 2 million people (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). After a 35-year hiatus, ONNV re-emerged with two outbreaks in 1996 and 2003 in southern-central Uganda and Ivory Coast, respectively, affecting thousands of people (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Antibody-based serological assays highlighted the nearly complete cross-reactivity between CHIKV and ONNV (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), hindering proper detection and diagnosis. Concordantly, recent serological studies revealed high proportions of previously unreported alphavirus-seropositive coastal Kenya and Uganda populations, particularly to ONNV and closely-related CHIKV (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The absence of epidemiological data on transmission levels in Africa and other regions highlight ONNV as an arbovirus with high potential of global spread. Currently, the components of host immunity mediating ONNV disease are poorly understood. Establishing a mouse model which recapitulates ONNV clinical symptoms is thus an essential step for the characterization of ONNV pathogenesis and the development of anti-viral therapeutic strategies.</p><p>This study reports the development of an immune-competent C57BL6/J mouse model, which upon ONNV infection, presents a self-limiting disease with peak viremia at 3 days post-infection (dpi) and peak joint inflammation at 6 dpi. ONNV-induced joint pathology was further evaluated with tracer assay and histopathological analyses. In addition, immunophenotyping and flow cytometry analyses of immune subsets in the infected joints revealed the pathogenic roles of CD4+ T cells in ONNV infection. Subsequently, longitudinal [<sup>18</sup>F]FB-IL2 PET imaging was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of FDA-approved immune-modulatory drug, fingolimod, as a therapeutic strategy to inhibit CD4+ T cell infiltration and abrogate joint swelling. The development of this mouse model will prove essential in future research to characterize the immune-pathogenesis of ONNV and the <italic>in vivo</italic> assessment of potential therapeutics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Virus</title><p>The WT ONNV isolate (IMTSSA/5163) was isolated from a patient in Chad in 2004 (kindly provided by Marc Grandadam from Unit&#x000e9; de Virologie Tropicale, IMTSSA, Marseille, France) (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Virus isolation was attempted by incubation of patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected on day of illness onset with C6/36 (Aedes albopictus) (ATCC CRL-1660) and Vero E6 (ATCC CRL-1586) monolayers. Supernatants were collected 5 days later and passaged once more in fresh cell cultures to produce the virus stock. Virus stock was tested by indirect immunofluorescene assay (IFA) and qualitative reverse transcriptase real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to be negative for other alphaviruses. Virus stock was further propagated in C6/36 cells and purified on a 20% (w/v) sucrose-cushion ultracentrifugation to produce the ONNV infection stock used in mice, as previously described (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Infection stock titers were determined by standard plaque assay using Vero E6 cells, with a viral RNA/PFU ratio of 1440.</p><p>Firefly luciferase (Fluc)-tagged ONNV infectious clone (ONNV-Fluc), with the Fluc gene inserted between the two open reading frames was produced using a similar methodology as previously described (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Expression of Fluc gene is regulated by a second sub-genomic promoter. ONNV-Fluc was propagated in C6/36 and virus titers were determined by standard plaque assay using Vero E6 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Mice</title><p>Three-week-old and 6-week-old gender-matched wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice were bred and kept in specific pathogen-free conditions in the Biological Resource Center (BRC) of Agency for Science, Technology, and Research, Singapore (A<sup>*</sup>STAR). Experimental procedures involving mice were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC #181353) of A<sup>*</sup>STAR, and in compliance to the guidelines of the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) and the National Advisory Committee for Laboratory Animal Research of Singapore (NACLAR).</p></sec><sec><title>Virus Infection and Disease Evaluation</title><p>Mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 10<sup>6</sup> plaque forming units (PFU) of wild-type ONNV in 30 &#x003bc;l of Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) at the ventral side of the right hind footpad. Viremia was monitored daily for 2-weeks. Height (thickness) and breadth measurements were done for the metatarsal region of the ONNV infected joint daily for 2-weeks, and quantified as (Height &#x000d7; breadth). The disease score was then expressed as the relative fold change in foot size compared with the same foot before infection (0 dpi) using the following formula: [(<italic>x</italic> &#x02013;0 dpi)/0 dpi], where <italic>x</italic> is the quantified footpad measurement for each respective day.</p></sec><sec><title>Viral RNA Extraction and Viral Copies Quantification</title><p>Ten microliters of blood were obtained from the tail vein, and re-suspended in 120 &#x003bc;l of PBS supplemented with 10 &#x003bc;l of citrate-phosphate-dextrose solution (Sigma-Aldrich).

Viral load in 1 &#x003bc;l of the elution buffer was subsequently quantified by qRT-PCR using QuantiTect Probe RT PCR kit (Qiagen). For ONNV viral genome quantification, the following primers were designed to amplify negative nsP1 viral RNA: forward primer (AATTACGCGAGAAAACTTGCG), reverse primer (TTTTTCCAGAGATGTTTTTATCTGT) and TaqMan Probe (CCGCTGGAAAGGT), as described previously (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).

A 10 min static PET acquisition was performed 60 min post tracer-injection. CT scans were performed for anatomical co-registration and attenuation correction. During the scanning, animals were monitored for body temperature and respiration rate using a Biovet physiological monitoring system. Post image-analysis of reconstructed calibrated images were performed with FIJI and Amide software (version 10.3 Sourceforge).

To confirm this, flow cytometry phenotyping of the infiltrating cells was performed at 6 dpi on the infected joints and the draining popliteal lymph node (pLN).

A wild-type C57BL/6J model for ONNV (SG650 strain) was previously attempted (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). While the route of ONNV inoculation and the age of the mice were comparable to the 6WO model in this study, the lack of joint swelling and detectable viremia is intriguing. This could be due to the 1000-fold less virus inoculated into the footpad, as the adopted dose (10<sup>3</sup> PFU) mimic virus inoculation load during a typical mosquito bite (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). However, the lack of ONNV-induced pathology limits it as a model for validating prophylactic and therapeutic strategies. Thus, an increase in ONNV dose is necessary to establish an <italic>in vivo</italic> model that can recapitulate virus-induced disease observed in patients. Nevertheless, pathogenicity of IMTSSA/5163 and SG650 strains are likely similar, given their close phylogenetic relationship (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The risk of global transmission, coupled with the lack of immune-competent models to study ONNV infection, highlights the need of a suitable pre-clinical <italic>in vivo</italic> model to explore therapeutic and prophylactic strategies.</p><p>Here, an immune-competent <italic>in vivo</italic> young adult mouse model for ONNV infection is reported. When infected with ONNV, animals recapitulated the self-limiting symptom profiles seen in patients, i.e., the viremia which clears by 8 dpi and arthralgia peaking at 6 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A,B</xref>) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). ONNV joint pathology was characterized by marked muscle degeneration and necrosis, mild synovitis, and tenosynovitis around the tendon capsule of the infected joint. However, joint swelling was not associated with edema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). This mirrors what is observed in virus-infected patients where edema is also not observed (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). This unique observation sets ONNV apart from old-world arthritogenic alphaviruses like CHIKV, Mayaro virus, and Ross River virus, where edema is frequently or occasionally observed (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Therefore, this immune-competent mouse model can be appropriately adopted for understanding ONNV disease pathogenesis and the discovery of therapeutic strategies.</p><p>High-dimensional UMAP and flow cytometry analysis of leukocyte populations highlighted the increase in proportion and quantity of CD4+ T cells in ONNV-infected joints. Depletion of CD4+ T cells drastically reduced joint footpad swelling, immune cell infiltration and muscle degeneration and necrosis at 6 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A,C,D</xref>), with no impact on viremia clearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Similar pathogenic effects of virus-specific CD4+ T cells were previously reported for other alphaviruses, including CHIKV (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), and Sindbis virus (SINV) (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), suggesting that targeting CD4+ T cells is a viable treatment option for patients suffering of ONNV-induced arthralgia. To confirm this possibility, we investigated if FTY720, an FDA-approved T cell infiltration suppressive drug could be used to reduce ONNV induced joint swelling. Administration of FTY720 into ONNV-infected joints reduced the joint swelling during the peak of inflammation at 6 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). We previously showed that FTY720 could effectively reduce CHIKV-induced arthralgia (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), suggesting that this strategy could be applicable to a large spectrum of arthritogenic alphaviruses. Successful treatment of alphavirus disease using CTLA4-Ig, an anti-rheumatic drug has also been reported to suppress CD4+ T cell activation in the CHIKV-infected joint (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) and it would be interesting to assess its potency during ONNV infection. In general, the anti-rheumatic effects of such FDA-approved drugs, together with their wide usage against multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, respectively, highlights the interesting possibility of repositioning immune-modulating drugs targeting the pathogenic CD4+ T cell response for these virus-induced joint and muscular pathologies. However, the use of such drugs is only effective if the CD4+ T cells are upregulated and major contributors in alphavirus-induced disease in patients. Thus, we propose the use of [<sup>18</sup>F]FB-IL-2 PET imaging (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), a non-invasive screening method that can be used to characterize activated CD4+ T cell profile and their pathological role in alphavirus infected patients. This will allow accurate prescription of immune-modulatory drugs against the identified pathogenic mediator. Similar repositioning of drugs that target viral protein synthesis, increase viral genome mutational load or decrease virus infectivity has previously been performed successfully for different viral pathogens, such as dengue virus (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), human immunodeficiency virus (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) and zika virus (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).</p><p>In light of the underestimated ONNV epidemics that is still currently on-going and the increase potential of world-wide outbreaks, this immune-competent mouse model will be an invaluable tool for <italic>in vivo</italic> characterization of the mechanisms between the immune driven pathogenesis as well as assessment of FDA-approved drugs repurposing efficiency.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The datasets generated for this study are available on request to the corresponding author.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The animal study was reviewed and approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC 181353) of A<sup>*</sup>STAR Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) National Advisory Committee for Laboratory Animal Research of Singapore (NACLAR).</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>LN and LR supervised the study.
