<p>This study reports the development of an immune-competent C57BL6/J mouse model, which upon ONNV infection, presents a self-limiting disease with peak viremia at 3 days post-infection (dpi) and peak joint inflammation at 6 dpi. ONNV-induced joint pathology was further evaluated with tracer assay and histopathological analyses. In addition, immunophenotyping and flow cytometry analyses of immune subsets in the infected joints revealed the pathogenic roles of CD4+ T cells in ONNV infection. Subsequently, longitudinal [
 <sup>18</sup>F]FB-IL2 PET imaging was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of FDA-approved immune-modulatory drug, fingolimod, as a therapeutic strategy to inhibit CD4+ T cell infiltration and abrogate joint swelling. The development of this mouse model will prove essential in future research to characterize the immune-pathogenesis of ONNV and the
