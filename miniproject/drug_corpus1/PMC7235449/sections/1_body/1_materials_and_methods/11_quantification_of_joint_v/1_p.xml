<p>Tracer 653 Assay (Molecular Targeting Technologies Inc.) was performed as described (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Briefly, 100 Î¼l of tracer dye was injected intravenously and allowed to circulate passively in each mouse for 1 h. Tracer dye was then quantified with 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging system (IVIS) (PerkinElmer). Vascular leakage in regions of interest were quantified using Living Image 3.0, and average radiance in selected areas [infected joint, Log
 <sub>10</sub>(p/s/cm
 <sup>2</sup>/sr)] were determined.
