<p>The WT ONNV isolate (IMTSSA/5163) was isolated from a patient in Chad in 2004 (kindly provided by Marc Grandadam from Unit√© de Virologie Tropicale, IMTSSA, Marseille, France) (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Virus isolation was attempted by incubation of patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected on day of illness onset with C6/36 (Aedes albopictus) (ATCC CRL-1660) and Vero E6 (ATCC CRL-1586) monolayers. Supernatants were collected 5 days later and passaged once more in fresh cell cultures to produce the virus stock. Virus stock was tested by indirect immunofluorescene assay (IFA) and qualitative reverse transcriptase real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to be negative for other alphaviruses. Virus stock was further propagated in C6/36 cells and purified on a 20% (w/v) sucrose-cushion ultracentrifugation to produce the ONNV infection stock used in mice, as previously described (
