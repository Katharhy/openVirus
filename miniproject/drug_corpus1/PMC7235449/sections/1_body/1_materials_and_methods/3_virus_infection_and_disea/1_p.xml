<p>Mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 10
 <sup>6</sup> plaque forming units (PFU) of wild-type ONNV in 30 μl of Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) at the ventral side of the right hind footpad. Viremia was monitored daily for 2-weeks. Height (thickness) and breadth measurements were done for the metatarsal region of the ONNV infected joint daily for 2-weeks, and quantified as (Height × breadth). The disease score was then expressed as the relative fold change in foot size compared with the same foot before infection (0 dpi) using the following formula: [(
 <italic>x</italic> –0 dpi)/0 dpi], where 
 <italic>x</italic> is the quantified footpad measurement for each respective day.
