<p>Isolated cells were incubated with blocking buffer containing 1% rat and mouse serum prior to staining. Cells were stained with BUV395-conjugated rat IgG
 <sub>2b</sub> anti-mouse CD45 (clone 30-F11; BD Biosciences), Pacific Blue-conjugated rat IgG
 <sub>2a</sub> anti-mouse CD4 (clone RM4-5; BioLegend), PE-CF594-conjugated rat IgG
 <sub>2a</sub> anti-mouse CD8 (clone 53-6.7; BD Biosciences), PE-Cy7-conjugated rat IgG
 <sub>2b</sub> anti-mouse CD3 (clone 17A2; BioLegend), APC-Cy7-conjugated rat IgG
 <sub>2c</sub> anti-mouse Ly6C (clone HK1.4; BioLegend), Alexa Flour 700-conjugated rat IgG
 <sub>2b</sub> anti-mouse MHC-II (clone M5/114.15.2; BioLegend), PerCP-Cy5.5-conjugated rat IgG1 anti-mouse LFA-1(clone H155-78; BioLegend), BV650-conjugated rat IgG
 <sub>2b</sub> anti-mouse CD11b (clone M1/70; BioLegend), BV605-conjugated Armenian hamster IgG anti-mouse CD11c (clone N418; BioLegend), PE-CF594-conjugated rat IgG
 <sub>2a</sub> anti-mouse Ly6G (clone 1A8; BD Biosciences), eFluor450-conjugated rat IgG
 <sub>2a</sub> anti-mouse B220 (clone RA3-6B2; eBio- science), APC-conjugated rat IgG
 <sub>1</sub> anti-mouse CD64 (clone X54-5/7.1; BioLegend), Biotin-conjugated mouse IgG
 <sub>2a</sub> anti-mouse NK1.1 (clone PK136; eBioscience), and BUV737 streptavidin (BD Biosciences) for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed and fixed with 50 Î¼l of intracellular (IC) fixation buffer (eBioscience) for 5 min followed by acquisition with LSR II (5 laser) flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with FACSDiva software and analyzed with FlowJo software (version 10.4.2).
