<p>Mice were euthanized on 6 dpi, and perfused with PBS, followed by 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF). ONNV-infected joints were then harvested at the ankles, and fixed in 10% NBF for 24 h at room temperature. The joints were then decalcified in Osteosoft (Merck, Germany), and trimmed into three portions at 5 mm intervals. Sectioned tissues were then routinely processed, sectioned into 5 μm thickness, and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E). Tissues were then viewed under an Olympus BX53 upright microscope (Olympus Life Science, Japan) and images were captured with an Olympus DP71 digital color camera with Olympus DP controller and DP manager software. Histo-pathological assessments were performed in a blind fashion by histo-pathologist, using a scoring method in each individual animal based on the presence of edema, inflammation, muscle necrosis, tendonitis and synovitis, if any. Severity of the lesions were assigned to the following scale: 0—no finding; 1—minimal; 2—mild; 3—moderate; 4—marked; 5—severe; as previously described (
