<p>Live CD45+ singlets events were pre-gated and then randomly down-sampled to a fixed number (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5,000) for each sample. Logical transformation was performed using autoLgcl of the Bioconductor package cytofkit2. The dimensionality algorithm UMAP was then run using 1,000 max iterations, 30 nearest neighbors and other default parameters (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). For clustering, PhenoGraph (R package Rphenograph v0.99.1) was used with default parameters (
 <italic>k</italic> = 30).
