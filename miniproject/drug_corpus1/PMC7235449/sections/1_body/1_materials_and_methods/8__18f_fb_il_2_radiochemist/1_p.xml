 <italic>N</italic>-(4-[
 <sup>18</sup>F]fluorobenzoyl)-interleukin-2 ([
 <sup>18</sup>F]FB-IL2) was prepared in a two-step reaction using a previously reported method with minor modifications (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). First, 
 <italic>N</italic>-succinimidyl 4-[
 <sup>18</sup>F]fluorobenzoate ([
 <sup>18</sup>F]SFB) synthon was prepared by reacting the 4- (ethoxycarbonyl)- 
 <italic>N,N,N</italic>- trimethylbenzenaminium trifluoromethanesulfonate (precursor for SFB synthesis) with azeotropically dried [
 <sup>18</sup>F]fluoride. The HPLC purified [
 <sup>18</sup>F]SFB was trapped into an Oasis HLB plus light cartridge and eluted with diethyl ether. The solvent was removed under nitrogen flow and [
 <sup>18</sup>F]SFB was reconstituted in 100 μL DMSO. The reconstituted [
 <sup>18</sup>F]SFB was added dropwise into a mixture of 100 μL aqueous IL-2 solution (Proleukin® 2 mg/ml) and 100 μL sodium borate buffer (1 M, pH 8.5) and incubated at 50°C for 10 min. After the reaction, the crude mixture was purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a PD-10 column, which was previously conditioned with 30 mL elution buffer (0.05% SDS in PBS). Pure labeled [
 <sup>18</sup>F]FB-IL-2 protein was eluted in 4–5 fractions of 0.5 mL each and pooled. The radiochemical purity of [
 <sup>18</sup>F]FB-IL-2 was determined using analytical radio-HPLC and the purity was &gt;97% with good specific activity (114 ± 94 Gabs/μmol).
