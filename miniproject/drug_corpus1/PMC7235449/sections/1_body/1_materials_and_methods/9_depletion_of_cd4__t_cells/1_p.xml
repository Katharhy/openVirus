<p>CD4+ T cell depletion was performed as previously described (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Briefly, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 500 μg of CD4-depletion antibody (InVivoPlus rat anti-mouse CD4, Bio X Cell, #BP0003-1) or rat IgG control (Sigma-Aldrich) on −1 and +4 dpi. CD4+ T cell depletion was confirmed by flow cytometry with antibodies that stain for CD4+ T cells [BUV395-conjugated rat IgG
 <sub>2b</sub> anti-mouse CD45 (clone 30-F11; BD Biosciences), Pacific Blue-conjugated rat IgG
 <sub>2a</sub> anti-mouse CD4 (clone RM4-5; BioLegend), PE-Cy7-conjugated rat IgG
 <sub>2b</sub> anti-mouse CD3 (clone 17A2; BioLegend)] before ONNV inoculation (0 dpi). Mice with incomplete depletion of CD4+ T cells were administered with another dose of CD4-depletion antibody on the same day.
