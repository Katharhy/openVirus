<p>The immunomodulatory effects of FTY720 treatment on pathogenic CD4+ T cell infiltration into ONNV-infected joints were further investigated longitudinally with PET-CT imaging (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Video 1</xref>). Notably, the amount of [
 <sup>18</sup>F]FB-IL-2 uptake in the joints of FTY720-treated mice were limited to basal levels (2% ID/g), indicating that treatment inhibited the infiltration of activated CD4+ T cells into the infection site (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). To confirm this, flow cytometry phenotyping of the infiltrating cells was performed at 6 dpi on the infected joints and the draining popliteal lymph node (pLN). FTY720 treatment efficiently suppressed the ingress of CD4+ T cells and activated LFA-1+ CD4+ T cells into the virus-infected joints (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). Interestingly, while levels of activated LFA-1+ CD4+ T cells were similar, there was a slightly lower amount of total CD4+ T cells in the pLN (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>), suggesting that FTY720 could also inhibit CD4+ T cell ingress or proliferation in the pLN.
