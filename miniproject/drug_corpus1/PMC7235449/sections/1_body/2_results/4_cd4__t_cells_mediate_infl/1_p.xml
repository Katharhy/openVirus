<p>Since CD4+ T cells were shown possess pathogenic roles in multiple alphavirus infections (

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), we next decided to elucidate their role during ONNV infection. Mice depleted of CD4+ T cells were infected with ONNV and subsequently monitored for disease pathogenesis. Absence of CD4+ T cells significantly abrogated the severity of peak swelling by ~0.5-fold at 6 dpi (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0043), with no effect on viremia (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A,B</xref>). In addition, histopathological analyses also revealed significantly less inflammation in the muscle and subcutaneous area, and lower levels of muscle necrosis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3C,D</xref>). Concordantly, adoptive transfer of CD4+ T cells re-established joint swelling in ONNV-infected TCR
 <sup>−/−</sup> animals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A–C</xref>). Notably, the introduction of CD4+ T cells had no effect on viremia clearance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Collectively, these observations confirm that CD4+ T cells contribute to ONNV-induced joint pathology.
