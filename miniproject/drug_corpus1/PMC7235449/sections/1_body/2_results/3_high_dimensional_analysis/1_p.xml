<p>The development of joint swelling and pathology during ONNV infection could be driven by the immune-pathogenesis of infiltrating leukocytes into the joints. To characterize the immune-cell profiles at the peak of inflammation, ONNV-infected joints were harvested at 6 dpi, and cells were subsequently isolated and processed for immune-phenotyping via flow cytometry. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection, UMAP (a dimension reduction technique used for data visualization similar to t-SNE) (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and PhenoGraph (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) were performed on this high-dimensional cytometry dataset to obtain 25 clusters of cells with homogenous marker expression profiles (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). These clusters were then identified based on the collective expression levels of lineage markers (

 <italic>n</italic> = 6 per group) and represent the proportion, but not the quantity of cells in the joint. As observed from the biplots, ONNV infection resulted in the activation of macrophages (clusters 14, 15, 22) to CD64+ Ly6C+ MHCII+ inflammatory macrophages (clusters 3, 5, 21, 24) (
