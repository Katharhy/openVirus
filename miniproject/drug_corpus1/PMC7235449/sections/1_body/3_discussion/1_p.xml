<p>The current existing 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> models for the study of ONNV pathogenesis are typically immune-deficient models and may not accurately mirror the host immune response and disease progression observed in ONNV patients (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). A wild-type C57BL/6J model for ONNV (SG650 strain) was previously attempted (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). While the route of ONNV inoculation and the age of the mice were comparable to the 6WO model in this study, the lack of joint swelling and detectable viremia is intriguing. This could be due to the 1000-fold less virus inoculated into the footpad, as the adopted dose (10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU) mimic virus inoculation load during a typical mosquito bite (

 <italic>in vivo</italic> model that can recapitulate virus-induced disease observed in patients. Nevertheless, pathogenicity of IMTSSA/5163 and SG650 strains are likely similar, given their close phylogenetic relationship (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The risk of global transmission, coupled with the lack of immune-competent models to study ONNV infection, highlights the need of a suitable pre-clinical 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> model to explore therapeutic and prophylactic strategies.
