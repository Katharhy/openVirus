<p>Here, an immune-competent 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> young adult mouse model for ONNV infection is reported. When infected with ONNV, animals recapitulated the self-limiting symptom profiles seen in patients, i.e., the viremia which clears by 8 dpi and arthralgia peaking at 6 dpi (

 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). ONNV joint pathology was characterized by marked muscle degeneration and necrosis, mild synovitis, and tenosynovitis around the tendon capsule of the infected joint. However, joint swelling was not associated with edema (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). This mirrors what is observed in virus-infected patients where edema is also not observed (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). This unique observation sets ONNV apart from old-world arthritogenic alphaviruses like CHIKV, Mayaro virus, and Ross River virus, where edema is frequently or occasionally observed (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Therefore, this immune-competent mouse model can be appropriately adopted for understanding ONNV disease pathogenesis and the discovery of therapeutic strategies.
