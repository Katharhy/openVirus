<p>High-dimensional UMAP and flow cytometry analysis of leukocyte populations highlighted the increase in proportion and quantity of CD4+ T cells in ONNV-infected joints. Depletion of CD4+ T cells drastically reduced joint footpad swelling, immune cell infiltration and muscle degeneration and necrosis at 6 dpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A,C,D</xref>), with no impact on viremia clearance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Similar pathogenic effects of virus-specific CD4+ T cells were previously reported for other alphaviruses, including CHIKV (

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), and Sindbis virus (SINV) (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), suggesting that targeting CD4+ T cells is a viable treatment option for patients suffering of ONNV-induced arthralgia. To confirm this possibility, we investigated if FTY720, an FDA-approved T cell infiltration suppressive drug could be used to reduce ONNV induced joint swelling. Administration of FTY720 into ONNV-infected joints reduced the joint swelling during the peak of inflammation at 6 dpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). We previously showed that FTY720 could effectively reduce CHIKV-induced arthralgia (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), suggesting that this strategy could be applicable to a large spectrum of arthritogenic alphaviruses. Successful treatment of alphavirus disease using CTLA4-Ig, an anti-rheumatic drug has also been reported to suppress CD4+ T cell activation in the CHIKV-infected joint (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) and it would be interesting to assess its potency during ONNV infection. In general, the anti-rheumatic effects of such FDA-approved drugs, together with their wide usage against multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, respectively, highlights the interesting possibility of repositioning immune-modulating drugs targeting the pathogenic CD4+ T cell response for these virus-induced joint and muscular pathologies. However, the use of such drugs is only effective if the CD4+ T cells are upregulated and major contributors in alphavirus-induced disease in patients. Thus, we propose the use of [
 <sup>18</sup>F]FB-IL-2 PET imaging (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), a non-invasive screening method that can be used to characterize activated CD4+ T cell profile and their pathological role in alphavirus infected patients. This will allow accurate prescription of immune-modulatory drugs against the identified pathogenic mediator. Similar repositioning of drugs that target viral protein synthesis, increase viral genome mutational load or decrease virus infectivity has previously been performed successfully for different viral pathogens, such as dengue virus (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), human immunodeficiency virus (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) and zika virus (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).
