  <p>Therapeutic fingolimod (FTY720) treatments alleviate ONNV-induced joint pathology by inhibiting CD4+ T cells infiltration. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Joint inflammation and 
   <bold>(B)</bold> viremia of ONNV+FTY720 treated groups and ONNV non-treated controls (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6 per group). Treated mice were intraperitoneally administered with FTY720 (20 μg) daily from 2 to 6 dpi, as denoted by shaded region. Viremia data beyond 5 dpi were below detection limit. Data are expressed as mean ± SD. Statistical analyses were performed using two-tailed Mann Whitney 
   <italic>U</italic>-test (
   <sup>**</sup>
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Representative radiolabeled IL-2 uptake by CD25 of activated T cells in FTY720-treated and mock-treated ONNV infected mice. Red arrows indicated the paws infected with ONNV. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Percentages of injected [
   <sup>18</sup>F]FB-IL-2 dose per gram tissue were quantified in ONNV-infected mice treated with FTY720 or DMSO at 3 hpi, 4 and 6 dpi. Dotted line represents the radiolabeled IL-2 uptake baseline at 3 hpi. Data are expressed as mean ± SD. Statistical analyses were performed using two-tailed Mann-Whitney 
   <italic>U</italic> test (
   <sup>*</sup>
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). 
   <bold>(E)</bold> Activated CD4+ T cells were quantified in the joints and 
   <bold>(F)</bold> popliteal lymph nodes (pLN) of FTY720-treated groups and non-treated controls (
   <italic>n</italic> = 10 per group). Data are expressed as mean ± SD and are representative of two independent experiments. Statistical analyses were performed using two-tailed Mann Whitney 
   <italic>U</italic> test (
   <sup>***</sup>
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001).
