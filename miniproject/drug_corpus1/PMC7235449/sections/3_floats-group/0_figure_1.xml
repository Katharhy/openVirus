  <p>ONNV infection in wild-type C57BL/6 mice resulted in virus replication and joint pathology. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Viremia and 
   <bold>(B)</bold> joint swelling of ONNV-infected mice aged 3-weeks-old (3WO, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 13) and 6WO (
   <italic>n</italic> = 14) were monitored over 2-weeks. Data are representative of 2 independent experiments and presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical analyses were performed using two-tailed Mann Whitney 
   <italic>U</italic> test (
   <sup>*</sup>
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; 
   <sup>***</sup>
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Representative joint images at 6 dpi 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Representative hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) images of inflamed joint footpad on 6 dpi. The muscle area (M) shows presence of muscle degeneration (D) and necrosis (N) upon ONNV infection. Blue arrows indicate infiltration of immune cells upon ONNV infection. Magnified area is indicated by the box. 
   <bold>(E)</bold> Severity scores were assigned for myopathy, including edema and muscle degeneration and necrosis, and inflammation at the muscle, synovial membrane, tendon and subcutaneous region (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6). None of these pathological distortions were observed in non-infected mice. 
   <bold>(F)</bold> Representative fluorescence images of the tracer assay, with inflamed joints indicated by yellow arrows, and quantification of joint vascular leakage into the joints of ONNV-infected and PBS control groups (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5 per group). Data is presented as mean ± SD. No statistical significance was observed between the two groups with two-tailed Mann Whitney 
   <italic>U</italic>-test.
