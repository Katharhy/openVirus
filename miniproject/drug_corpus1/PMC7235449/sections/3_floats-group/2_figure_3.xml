  <p>Arthritogenic CD4+ T cells mediate joint pathology. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Joint swelling and 
   <bold>(B)</bold> viremia of ONNV+CD4 depletion (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6) and ONNV + isotype control (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5) groups were monitored over 2-weeks. Statistical analyses were performed using two-tailed Mann Whitney 
   <italic>U</italic> test (
   <sup>*</sup>
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; 
   <sup>**</sup>
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). Data points of viremia beyond 6 dpi were below detection limit. Data is representative of 2 independent experiments and presented as mean ± SEM. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Representative photo micrographs of inflamed joint footpad at 6 dpi. B, bone; T, tendon; M, skeletal muscle; black arrow, infiltration of inflammatory cells; blue arrow, degeneration of muscle; N, necrosis of muscle. Magnified area is indicated by the box. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Histopathological scoring of edema, inflammation in different regions of the joint footpad and muscle pathology of ONNV-infected mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6) on 6 dpi was done in a blinded fashion. Scoring was done on three sections from each joint footpad, and data are expressed as mean ± SD. Statistical analyses were performed using two-tailed Mann Whitney 
   <italic>U</italic>-test (
   <sup>*</sup>
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; 
   <sup>**</sup>
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01).
