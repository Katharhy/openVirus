  <p>High-dimensional analysis of flow cytometry data reveals differences in joint immune profile upon ONNV infection. Joints from ONNV- and mock-infected 3-week-old WT C57BL/6 mice were harvested at 6 dpi. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Visualization of clusters in UMAP plots for combined data or individual groups (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6 per group). UMAP plots shown consists of 30,000 cells each and are representative of concatenated samples within each group. Clusters are grouped in proximity based on lineage marker similarities and are not representative of conventional cell types. Populations corresponding to NK cells (green), CD11c+NK cells (black), NKT cells (purple), immature T cells (yellow), CD4+ T cells (magenta), CD8+ T cells (light blue), neutrophils (orange), macrophages (blue), inflammatory macrophages (red), B cells (dark blue) and three undermined clusters (gray) are shown. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Cell percentage heatmap of PhenoGraph clusters (1 to 25) across ONNV- and mock-infected individual mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6 per group). Red box indicates the upregulated clusters during 6 dpi. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Leukocyte subsets were identified by antibody staining based on lineage surface marker expression. Leukocyte subsets in ONNV-infected joints at 6 dpi were quantified, including CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, NK cells, neutrophils, monocytes and CD64+ MHC-II+ monocytes. Data is representative of two independent experiments and presented in mean Â± SD. Statistical analyses were performed using two-tailed Mann Whitney 
   <italic>U</italic>-test (
