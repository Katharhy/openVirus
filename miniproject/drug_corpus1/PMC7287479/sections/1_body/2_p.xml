<p id="para0003">Over a quarter of criminal justice involved populations in the US are charged with a drug offense (

 <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">“Behind Bars II: Substance Abuse and America’s Prison Population. New York, NY:,” 2010</xref>). Globally, it is estimated that one in six are serving time for drug possession (
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Burki, 2020</xref>), and between 10 and 60% have a substance use disorder (

Populations most vulnerable to COVID-19 include older adults and persons of any age with serious underlying medical conditions such as lung disease, heart disease, and diabetes. Among people who use drugs, COVID-19 infection may worsen the respiratory impact of opioid use and withdrawal, as opioids act in the brainstem to slow breathing, leading to respiratory depression and potential overdose (

 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Azbel &amp; Altice, 2018</xref>). Similarly, detained populations have higher prevalence of infectious and chronic diseases, and poorer health than the general population, even at younger ages (
 <xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">Centers for Disease Control, 2020</xref>). Many are also immunocompromised, and the prevalence of HIV is nearly five times higher within criminal justice settings, compared to the general community (
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Beckwith, Zaller, Fu, Montague, &amp; Rich, 2011</xref>). These issues are further compounded by poor access to medical care. The Federal ban on Medicaid in correctional facilities has resulted in out of pocket co-payments that are the equivalent of $200–500 for a medical visit, making most medical care cost prohibitive (
