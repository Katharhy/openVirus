<p>Bats host a reservoir of various zoonotic viruses, including coronaviruses. Regulatory studies and phylogenetic analyzes have shown that there is a high genetic diversity among SARS‐like viruses in bats, allowing for the recombination and evolution of new species. It has been shown that the bat virus with 96% nucleotide sequence similarity to human SARS‐CoV can use human ACE2 as a receptor. This represents the same state of entry into the cell as human SARS‐CoV. For example, bat SL‐CoV‐WIV1 can grow on human epithelial cells and Vero E6 cells, which is neutralized by human SARS‐CoV convalescent sera (Ge et al.,

The damage to the lungs, which leads to fluid leaking from small blood vessels in the lungs. The fluid collects in the lungs' air sacs or alveoli. This makes it difficult for the lungs to transfer oxygen from the air to the blood. While there's a shortage of information on the type of damage that occurs in the lungs during 2019‐nCoV (Tian et al.,

So far, there are no specific treatments for patients with coronavirus disease‐19 (COVID‐19), and the treatments available today are based on previous experience with similar viruses such as SARS‐CoV, MERS‐CoV, influenza virus, and other viral infections. In this article, we have tried to study the different treatments performed on patients with COVID‐19 and the advantages and disadvantages of existing drugs and we have tried to reach a therapeutic window of drugs available to patients with COVID‐19. Molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets of drugs that have been used to treat COVID‐19 (Figure
