<p>In late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, several patients were diagnosed with viral pneumonia, now known as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019‐nCoV). Subsequently, a large number of cases of the disease were found to either reside in Wuhan or travel to the city. The researchers were able to obtain the 2019‐nCoV genome sequence by performing bronchoalveolar lavage and culture of patients' lungs and by conducting phylogenetic analyzes of the genome and investigating the evolutionary relationship between 2019‐nCoV and other coronaviruses, they found the origin of 2019‐nCoV and its evolutionary history. The 2019‐nCoV genomic sequence obtained from the patients showed that 98.99% of their gene sequences matched. The genome also has an 88% similarity to the genome of the bat‐SL‐CoVZC45 and bat‐SL‐CoVZXC21 bat coronavirus genomes that appeared in Zhoushan, China, but with the severe acute respiratory syndrome‐related coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV) coronaviruses, 79% and 50% were similar, respectively. Also by homology modeling, a model for the virus receptor was obtained, which, by comparing homology models, concluded that despite differences in some amino acids, the structure of the domains attached to the receptor at 2019‐nCoV and SARS‐CoV was similar. SARS‐CoV spike (S) protein is essential for entry into the host cell. The Spike S1 subunit contains the receptor‐binding domain (RBD). The SARS‐CoV virus uses the angiotensin‐converting‐enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to bind the host cell, that contains a diversity of respiratory epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages, and monocytes. Considering the relatively high identity of the RBD in 2019‐nCoV and SARS‐CoV, it is crucial to evaluate the cross‐reactivity of anti‐SARS‐CoV antibodies with 2019‐nCoV spike protein, which could have significant implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019‐nCoV. These structures displayed that SARS‐CoV RBD contains a core structure and a receptor‐binding motif (RBM), and that the RBM binds to the outer surface of ACE2. The ACE2 is the only known human homolog of the key regulator of blood pressure ACE. SARS‐CoV‐2 RBD showed significantly higher binding affinity to ACE2 receptor than SARS‐CoV RBD and could block the connection and, therefore, binding of SARS‐CoV‐2 and SARS‐CoV RBD to ACE2‐expressing cells, so inhibiting their infection to host cells. Therefore, ACE2 also serves as the cellular entry site for the SARS‐CoV, a main target for pharmacological intervention and improved new monoclonal antibodies that could attach specifically to 2019‐nCoV RBD. SARS‐CoV RBD‐specific antibodies possibly will cross‐react with SARS‐CoV‐2 RBD protein, and SARS‐CoV RBD‐induced antisera could neutralize SARS‐CoV‐2, suggesting the potential to improve SARS‐CoV RBD‐based vaccines for inhibition of SARS‐CoV‐2 and SARS‐CoV infection (Tai et al.,
