<p>2019‐nCoV outbreak from Wuhan, China offered a respiratory viral pandemic that currently there are no effective therapies for this infection. Despite a crucial need to find options to help these patients and prevent potential death. For this reason, vaccine research should be pursued intensely, until the infection can be controlled with a protective vaccine to prevent 2019‐nCoV infection. Despite the different treatments used by different countries to treat COVID‐19, it is clear that the use of these drugs alone will not produce the desired results, and some drugs will cause side effects in certain groups of people. For example, excessive use of chloroquine is toxic and can even be fatal, or the use of favipiravir in pregnant women is not recommended, as it is associated with teratogenicity and embryotoxicity in animals or corticosteroids that are immunosuppressive and are not recommended for mild or early ARDS, because early use of corticosteroids can delay the clearance of the virus and increase the risk of death, long‐term administration of high doses of corticosteroids in the early stages of treatment has negative effects. Generally, corticosteroids should be avoided unless the patient has symptoms such as moderate or severe ARDS, sepsis or septic shock. MPA also has no effective inhibitory effect on SARS‐CoV, so they are not recommended for treatment. Lopinavir is associated with side effects such as digestive adverse effects and hypokalemia that should be considered by physicians. The use of neuraminidase inhibitors is also invalid due to resistance to nCoV‐2019 and is not recommended for the treatment of patients.</p>
