<p>Pharmacological studies have been conducted on remdesivir and clinical trials for the treatment of Ebola virus with remdesivir are ongoing. One study showed that remdesivir and interferon‐beta (IFN‐β) had a better effect on the MERS‐CoV mouse model than lopinavir, ritonavir, and IFN‐β (Mulangu et al.,

Previous studies have shown that nucleotide analogs generally have less effect on coronaviruses, due to the presence of a proofreading exonuclease in the virus. However, remdesivir has a positive effect on SARS‐CoV, MERS‐CoV, and bat‐CoV strains. In tissue cultures, remdesivir is effective in the EC
 <sub>50</sub> range of 0.069 μM for SARS‐CoV and 0.074 μM for MERS‐CoV. It is effective at SARS‐CoV‐2 at 0.77 μM in Vero E6 cells (EC
 <sub>90</sub> was 1.76 µM). It is also active in the submicromolar EC
 <sub>50</sub> against several different coronaviruses, including human endemic coronaviruses OC43 (HCoV‐OC43) and 229E (HCoV‐229), therefore, remdesivir has extensive antiviral activity against coronaviruses (Brown et al.,

In a SARS‐CoV‐infected mouse, remdesivir administration significantly reduced the rate of viral load in the lungs, and the virus titer decreased more than two‐fold on Day 4 or 5 postinfection, indicating that remdesivir improved respiratory symptoms in the laboratory model (T. Sheahan et al.,
