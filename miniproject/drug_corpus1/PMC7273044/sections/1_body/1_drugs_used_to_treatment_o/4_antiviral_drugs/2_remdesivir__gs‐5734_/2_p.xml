<p>An adenosine nucleotide analog introduced by Gilead Sciences in 2017 to treat Ebola virus infection and shown to have antiviral activity against Marburg virus, parainfluenza type 3 virus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, and measles, mumps, and Pneumoviridae (such as a respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]) in vitro. It is a prodrug monophosphoramidate with widespread antiviral activity against coronaviruses, such as SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV, and has promising antiviral activity against SARS‐CoV‐2. Remdesivir is a metabolically active form (GS‐441524) that affects viral RNA polymerase and prevents the spread of the virus and reduces the production of viral RNA. It has a similar structure to tenofovir alafenamide, a nucleotide analog of adenosine 5‐monophosphate with antiviral activity against hepatitis B virus and HIV (Lo et al.,
