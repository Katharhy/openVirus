<p>Of recent concern about the use of oseltamivir was the emergence of resistance in 23% of patients with H1N1, which was associated with high mortality. Recently, the drug baloxavir has been used to treat resistant strains and has been recognized as an effective drug especially for patients admitted to the ICU (Behillil et al.,

Zanamivir solution is also a class of neuraminidase inhibitors that are used for patients who are ventilated and show drug resistance to oseltamivir. Peramivir is also used intravenously as an antiviral drug. It is especially useful for patients who do not respond to oseltamivir or zanamivir. Oseltamivir is a clinical trial for Phase 3 for 2019‐nCoV in the treatment of COVID‐19 patients with an HIV protease inhibitor (ASC09F) as a 3CLpro inhibitor and is in use alone in Phase 4 2019‐nCoV (Li &amp; De Clercq,

Oseltamivir has been used orally for the treatment of 2019‐nCoV and suspected cases in Chinese hospitals, but there is no conclusive evidence that it can be effective in treating COVID‐19 patients. According to the latest research, neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir are invalid for nCoV‐2019 and are not recommended for the treatment of patients (Li &amp; De Clercq,
