Jin Yong Kim suggested that it may be effective to get a better effect of the drug in the early stages of the disease, but more research is needed within a few days of the disease to determine if better results can be obtained (Lim et al.,

A 2020 study showed that 400 mg daily lopinavir with IFN‐α2b atomization inhalation, 5 million U twice daily, as well as the use of lopinavir alone could be useful for patients with COVID‐19 and increased eosinophils have been suggested as an indicator of improvement in patients, But after starting treatment with this drug, complications such as digestive adverse effect and hypokalemia should be considered by physicians (Liu et al.,
