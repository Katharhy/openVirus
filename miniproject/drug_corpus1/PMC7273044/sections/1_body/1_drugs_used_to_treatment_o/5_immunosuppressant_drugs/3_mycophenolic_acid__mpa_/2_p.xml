Mycophenolic acid (MPA) in use with cyclosporine, it is also a potent inhibitor of MERS‐CoV but has a less inhibitory effect on SARS‐CoV. In studies of coronaviruses in the mouse model, it did not affect SARS‐CoV, but at standard concentrations at oral doses, it was able to inhibit MERS‐CoV (Chan et al.,
