<p>Chloroquine has recently been shown to be an inhibitor of SARS‐CoV‐2 in vitro and the hydroxylated form has been suggested as a potential treatment for patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Importantly, the overdose of this drug is toxic and can cause death (Devaux, Rolain, Colson, &amp; Raoult,

Chloroquine inhibits SARS‐CoV entry, which exerts its inhibitory effect by altering glycosylation of the ACE2 receptor and spike protein. In patients with COVID‐19, hydroxychloroquine has been shown to decrease inflammatory responses and decrease cytokine storm in vitro. Chloroquine also interferes with proteolytic processing of M protein and modifies virion assembly and budding. Also, chloroquine indirectly act against COVID‐19 by reducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines and by activating anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 CD8
