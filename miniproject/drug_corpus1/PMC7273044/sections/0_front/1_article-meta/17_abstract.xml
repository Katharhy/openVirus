 <p>In late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, several patients with viral pneumonia were identified as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019‐nCoV). So far, there are no specific treatments for patients with coronavirus disease‐19 (COVID‐19), and the treatments available today are based on previous experience with similar viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome‐related coronavirus (SARS‐CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV), and Influenza virus. In patients with COVID‐19, hydroxychloroquine decreases the inflammatory response and cytokine storm, but overdose causes toxicity and mortality. Neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir are invalid for 2019‐nCoV and are not recommended for treatment but protease inhibitors such as lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) inhibit the progression of MERS‐CoV disease and can be useful for patients of COVID‐19 and, in combination with Arbidol, has a direct antiviral effect on early replication of SARS‐CoV. Favipiravir increases clinical recovery and reduces respiratory problems and has a stronger antiviral effect than LPV/r. Currently, appropriate treatment for patients with COVID‐19 is an angiotensin‐converting‐enzyme 2 inhibitor and a clinical problem reducing agent such as favipiravir in addition to hydroxychloroquine and corticosteroids.
