<p>Two community level nursing diagnoses were identified as key problems appropriate for a pandemic related to COVID‐19: 
 <italic>Deficient Community Health</italic> (00215) and 
 <italic>Ineffective Community Coping</italic> (00077). These nursing diagnoses are important for any community experiencing a global pandemic and fit well with the model we developed. Only problem‐focused nursing diagnoses or risk nursing diagnoses were considered. Health promotion nursing diagnoses were not included in the linkages for a pandemic because in a crisis nurses focus on the priority problems communities are experiencing. The table constructed for this community level response to COVID‐19 begins with the nursing diagnosis, code, and definition (Table 
 <xref rid="ijnt12291-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

 <italic>Ineffective Community Coping</italic> (00077) is from domain 9, Coping/Stress Tolerance (Herdman &amp; Kamitsuru,
