 <xref rid="ijnt12291-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref> provides a beginning list of proposed nursing diagnoses, outcomes, and interventions for future development. The table identifies 11 nursing diagnoses, 10 nursing outcomes, and 19 nursing interventions for a total of 40 new concepts to support nursing practice during a pandemic. We have provided concept labels to capture the areas we found missing during the linkage process. These are arbitrary concept names that capture the focus on the nursing diagnosis, outcome of intervention and can be refined as the work of developing these concepts is done.
