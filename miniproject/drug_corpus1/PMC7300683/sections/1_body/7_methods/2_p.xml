<p>In the second step, an initial list of outcomes was added to the table and the outcomes were grouped in categories based on components of the identified nursing diagnoses. We included an outcome to measure resolution of each nursing diagnosis selected. The process for this step varies slightly depending on the type of nursing diagnoses selected. Each problem‐focused nursing diagnosis was linked to outcomes that align with measuring the

 <italic>associated conditions</italic>. The second type, risk nursing diagnoses, do not have defining characteristics, so the linkages for these diagnoses focus on 
 <italic>related factors, at‐risk populations</italic>, and 
 <italic>associated conditions</italic>. Once the outcomes were selected and added to the table, the third step focused on creating a list of nursing interventions that targeted the related factors for each nursing diagnosis. The interventions were then added to the linkage table. All interventions and outcomes are listed alphabetically.
