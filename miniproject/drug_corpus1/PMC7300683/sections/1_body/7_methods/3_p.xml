<p>The fourth step focused on additional reviews of the linkages to clarify the alignment of the NNN concepts and whether they are a good fit. For example, for a community nursing diagnosis the outcomes should focus on the community level and the interventions should target a group or community rather than an individual. For this phase of the review, each nurse expert carefully considered the definitions of the nursing diagnosis, outcomes, and interventions selected. In addition, we determined the fit of the NOC indicators to the components of the nursing diagnosis and the appropriateness of the NIC activities for treating each nursing diagnosis. We reviewed the NNN linkages until we reached consensus. As we discussed the NNN linkages, we identified potential new diagnoses, outcomes, and interventions for future development as a final fifth step in the linkage process.</p>
