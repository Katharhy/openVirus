<p>To respond to the current pandemic, we formed a team of seven nurse experts to identify linkages of valid and reliable NANDA‐I nursing diagnoses, NOC outcomes, and NIC interventions focused on COVID‐19 in the spring of 2020. These terminologies are referred to as NNN. They are coded, interoperable, and available for nurses and other care providers to plan care for individuals and families in response to community needs. We used five steps in the linkage process. The first step in developing NNN linkages focused on the identification of relevant nursing diagnoses. A table was created to organize the NNN linkages based on the nursing diagnoses identified. We included the diagnostic code, and the definition for each nursing diagnosis selected.</p>
