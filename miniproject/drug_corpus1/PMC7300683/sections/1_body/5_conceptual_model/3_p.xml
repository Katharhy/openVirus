These actions are called mitigation strategies and should be implemented when there is evidence of community transmission (Center for Disease Control and Prevention,

Individuals are encouraged to not participate in large social or community activities, travel across state lines, or travel to other countries. Transmission of the coronavirus can quickly spread across all circles surrounding the individual depicted in the center of the model. The role of nursing is to care for individuals, families, and communities. This is even more challenging during a pandemic because contact with infected individuals and groups also puts the nurse at‐risk of being infected with the virus and can add to the spread of the disease.
