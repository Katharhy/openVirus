<p>Nursing care needed during the pandemic is multidimensional. Guided by a social ecological framework (Lounsbury &amp; Mitchell, 
 <xref rid="ijnt12291-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>), we propose the 
 <italic>nursing care in response to pandemics model</italic> (Figure 
 <xref rid="ijnt12291-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Although social ecological models are used widely in health education and public health (Baral, Logie, Grosso, Wirtz, &amp; Beyrer, 
 <xref rid="ijnt12291-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Golden &amp; Earp, 
 <xref rid="ijnt12291-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>), we were unable to identify a conceptual model or framework that encompassed nursing care during a worldwide infectious pandemic. In this model, individuals are depicted in the center surrounded by four concentric layers that depict additional recipients of nursing care during pandemics: families, communities, countries, and the global world. Arrowheads cut across each layer of the model, as nurses target problem‐focused and potential (at‐risk) health problems that are both physiologic and psychosocial in nature in response to pandemics.
