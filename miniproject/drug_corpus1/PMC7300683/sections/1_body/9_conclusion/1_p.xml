<p>This paper focuses on a community response to COVID‐19. The manuscript provides a new model, 
 <italic>nursing care in response to pandemics model</italic> to depict the current global pandemic. NANDA‐I nursing diagnoses combined with NOC outcomes and NIC interventions listed in the article support nursing practice by promoting and stimulating the use of three nursing standardized terminologies. Despite the high demands on nurses’ time, the need for valid and reliable documentation of nursing care continues during the crisis. Additional terminology focused on nursing diagnoses, interventions, and outcomes for pandemics needs to be developed.
