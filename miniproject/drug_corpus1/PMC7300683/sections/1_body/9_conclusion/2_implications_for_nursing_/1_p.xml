<p>The COVID‐19 pandemic highlights and reinforces the importance of nursing participating in community efforts to minimize the impact of this virus that currently has no prevention treatment options or vaccine available. In community settings, nurses have a vital role in monitoring, evaluating, and providing information regarding prevention, symptoms, and treatment of physiological and psychosocial response to the infection. The NNN linkages identified in this manuscript serve as important resources for nurses working in community settings by providing models and examples of care plans based on standardized nursing terminologies and supporting nurses at a time when decisions need to be made quickly. In pandemic environments nurses may need cross‐training in areas they do not routinely provide care. Care plans that facilitate this training can improve the nurses’ confidence and ability to provide quality care in difficult situations.</p>
