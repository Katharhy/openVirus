<p>Nurses are educated to implement the nursing process; it is the signature of the profession and the focus of clinical practice. Nursing science seeks knowledge specifically related to the discipline, which can support the day to day practice of nurses. In addition, the nursing process has the capacity to offer support to clinical decision‐making to achieve the quality of nursing care desired for individuals, families, and communities, especially in the throes of this health care crisis. Critical to the nursing process internationally, nurses have been involved in the development of standardized nursing terminologies to enhance the ability of nurses to interact and share data worldwide. It is essential that nurses involved with terminology development identify the gaps in the current classifications to advance the current state of nursing practice related to pandemics. We are at a critical juncture in the health of citizens globally and we need to share resources quickly with nurses and other healthcare providers across the international community. COVID‐19 knows no geographical boundaries.</p>
