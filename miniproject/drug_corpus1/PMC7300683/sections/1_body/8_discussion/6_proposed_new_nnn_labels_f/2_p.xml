<p>Social distancing has become a common strategy for mitigation activities related to COVID‐19. Table 2 suggests the development of a nursing diagnosis called 
 <italic>Compromised Community Social Distancing</italic> (proposed). This problem‐focused diagnosis would focus on the issue of groups of individuals coming together in social situations during a pandemic. We have all heard about individuals continuing to go to the beach during spring break in Florida this year. An outcome named 
 <italic>Community Social Distancing Adherence</italic> (proposed) should be developed to measure how well individuals follow this mandate during a pandemic. In addition, an intervention focused on 
 <italic>Community Social Distancing Support</italic> (proposed) could be useful for nurses working in the community.
