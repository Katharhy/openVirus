<p>We recommend the development of specific nursing diagnoses, outcomes, and interventions to address epidemics and pandemics. We would be the first to admit that this is a preliminary list and others may be needed once the pandemic has run its course. An outcome focused on 
 <italic>Community Coping</italic> (proposed) would have been a good match for the nursing diagnosis 
 <italic>Ineffective Community Coping</italic> (00077). This outcome needs to be developed to capture the challenges of the lifestyle changes placed on community members when there is no available treatment for a new strain of a virus. In addition, an outcome for 
 <italic>Community Social Support</italic> (proposed) is needed. A NIC intervention focused on providing community support such as 
 <italic>Coping Enhancement: Community</italic> (proposed) would also need to be developed to accurately treat this nursing diagnosis. The addition of these suggestions for outcomes and interventions would enhance the linkages to the NANDA‚ÄêI classification for this problem.
