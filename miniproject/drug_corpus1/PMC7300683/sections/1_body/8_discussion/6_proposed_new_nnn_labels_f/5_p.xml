<p>A problem‐focused nursing diagnosis should be added to the NANDA‐I classification focused on 
 <italic>Compromised Community Resilience</italic> (proposed). This concept is important in a pandemic because of the length of time a community needs to restrict large public gatherings and activities and protect individuals from viral exposure. At the same time other essential workers, employed in health care, public services, and in the food chain for example, are continuing to work in the community and interact with the public. These individuals face new challenges and lack of resources to do their work safely in a COVID‐19 environment. The fifth edition of NOC added an outcome, 
 <italic>Community Resiliency</italic> (2704) and the third edition of NIC published an intervention for individuals, families, and communities called 
 <italic>Resiliency Promotion</italic> (8340) although many of the activities are focused on individuals and families rather at the community level. These standardized outcome and interventions would provide key linkages for this proposed community focused nursing diagnosis.
