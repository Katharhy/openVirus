<p>The only risk for diagnosis we recommend for future development is 
 <italic>Risk for Infection: Community</italic> (proposed). The impact of COVID‐19 at the community level will change how individuals participate in social groups in the future. We are only beginning to see changes in our culture that will result from this pandemic. An outcome focused on 
 <italic>Community Infection Control</italic> (proposed) is needed to measure changes that will become part of our “new normal.” In the future, employees coming to work ill or with symptoms of respiratory problems will not be tolerated as workplace policies change in response to this pandemic. Working at home has become much more desirable to both employers and employees as an attempt to “flatten the curve” of this pandemic. A new intervention called 
 <italic>Infection Control: Community</italic> (proposed) is also needed.
