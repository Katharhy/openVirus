<p>Sheltering in place became a common strategy used by governors in many states to reduce exposure to COVID‐19. We recommend the development of a nursing diagnosis called 
 <italic>Compromised Community Sheltering‐in‐Place</italic> (proposed) be developed for future editions of the NANDA‐I classification. The addition of a new NIC intervention, 
 <italic>Community Sheltering‐in‐Place Support</italic> (proposed), could identify strategies to assist community members to comply with this request from city, state, or country officials. A NOC outcome, 
 <italic>Community Sheltering‐in‐Place Adherence</italic> (proposed) should focus on measuring adherence to a government mandate for community members to remain in their homes to reduce or delay the spread of viral pandemic such as COVID‐19.
