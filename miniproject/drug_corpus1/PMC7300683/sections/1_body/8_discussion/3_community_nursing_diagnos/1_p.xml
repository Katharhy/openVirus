<p>Only two problem‐focused nursing diagnoses were selected to structure the linkages of NIC interventions and NOC outcomes at the community level. 
 <italic>Deficient Community Health</italic> (00215) was added to the NANDA‐I taxonomy in 2010 and provides 
 <italic>defining characteristics</italic> and 
 <italic>related factors</italic> for nurses to consider when selecting nursing diagnoses based on their assessment data (Herdman &amp; Kamitsuru, 
 <xref rid="ijnt12291-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>, p. 148). It focuses on an aggregate or group with one or more health problems and fits the concept of a community level nursing diagnosis with an emphasis on programs to meet community needs. 
 <italic>Ineffective community coping</italic> (00077) was added to the NANDA‐I taxonomy in 1994 and was revised in 1998 and again in the latest edition in 2018. It provides 
 <italic>defining characteristics</italic>, 
 <italic>related factors</italic>, and the new category 
 <italic>at‐risk populations</italic> as key components of the nursing diagnosis (Herdman &amp; Kamitsuru, 
 <xref rid="ijnt12291-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>, p. 329). This diagnosis focuses on community activities to adapt and solve problems and considers stress, vulnerability, and powerless as defining characteristics, for example. The related factors focus on community resources. Exposure to pandemics and epidemics could be added to the list of at‐risk populations for this nursing diagnosis to better address outbreaks of infectious diseases such as COVID‐19.
