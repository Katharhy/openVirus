<p>We discovered additional issues with linking NOC outcomes and NIC interventions to the two problem focused nursing diagnoses appropriate for the pandemic. Examples of outcomes we did not include in the linkages were 
 <italic>Community Disaster Readiness</italic> (2804) and 
 <italic>Community Disaster Response</italic> (2806). Although these are community focused outcomes, the definitions focus on “natural or man‐made calamitous events” (Moorhead, Swanson, Johnson, &amp; Maas, 
 <xref rid="ijnt12291-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>, p. 166–167). The indicators focus on activities the communities would evaluate using the adequate to totally adequate measurement scale. Some of the indicators would be useful for evaluating a response to the COVID‐19 pandemic such as “surge capacity of hospital resources” or “mass immunization plan” from the 
 <italic>Community Disaster Readiness</italic> (2804) outcome, while other indicators, such as “notification network to alert response personnel,” better address the readiness of a community to respond to a tornado or hurricane event, for example. This definitional issue is also present in the NIC interventions 
 <italic>Bioterrorism Preparedness</italic> (8810) and 
 <italic>Community Disaster Preparedness</italic> (8840) (Butcher et al., 
 <xref rid="ijnt12291-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>).
