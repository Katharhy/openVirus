<p>We found fundamental differences between how communities respond to a disaster compared to a pandemic. The community response to disasters such as weather‐related tornadoes, hurricanes, and floods draws the responders to a localized area to assist victims of these events. There is a naturally occurring end to the event and resources and emergency responders can be focused on the area of damage when the natural event is concluded. Forecasting of peak exposures and confirmed cases to determine a downward trend in new cases can be severely compromised by the required social distancing and subsequent “flattening of the curve.” This extends the time when responders can begin to focus on the area(s) of damage and return to “normal” activities. It also severely stretches healthcare resources and abilities to adequately continue to respond to the outbreak. The protection of emergency responders differs greatly from the risk of responders to COVID‐19. In the case of a pandemic, community efforts should not draw more people to the affected area and early social distancing is the key strategy to responding to “hot spots” that develop because of the spread of the disease.</p>
