<p>This linkage study identified relevant NNN concepts for planning a response to a pandemic. However, we faced some challenges in identifying useful diagnoses and interventions. The NANDA‐I classification uses axes to define the dimension of the human response that nurses use as part of the diagnostic process. There are seven axes that describe a nursing diagnosis (Herdman &amp; Kamitsuru, 
 <xref rid="ijnt12291-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). For this study, two dimensions are important. Axis 1 describes the focus of the diagnosis and Axis 2 describes the subject of the diagnosis (individual, family, group, caregiver, and community). Unlike NIC and NOC, the NANDA‐I Taxonomy II does not have a domain dedicated to community level nursing diagnoses, making it more difficult to quickly identify community level problems in the taxonomy. The inclusion of a table of community level nursing diagnoses would be helpful in the next edition of the NANDA‐I work.
