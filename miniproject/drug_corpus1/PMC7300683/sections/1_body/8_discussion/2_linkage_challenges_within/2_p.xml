<p>NIC does have a community level domain, but not all interventions for groups are placed in this domain. In several cases, we had to rely on the definition of an intervention to determine if the intervention was developed for groups or communities. This may occur because the actions the nurse chooses to perform for an intervention may be the same for a group or an individual. For example, the intervention, 
 <italic>Resiliency Promotion</italic> (8340), is defined as “assisting individuals, families, and communities in development, use, and strengthening of protective factors to be used in coping with environmental and social stressors” (Butcher, Bulechek, Dochterman, &amp; Wagner, 
 <xref rid="ijnt12291-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>, p. 326). This intervention is in the family domain in NIC. In contrast, all community level outcomes in NOC are found in the community domain and the indicators used for measuring an individual or a community level outcome are not the same.
