<p>We considered using two other community focused nursing diagnoses in the linkages we identified for COVID 19: 
 <italic>Contamination</italic> (00181) and 
 <italic>Risk for Contamination</italic> (00180). The definition of 
 <italic>Contamination</italic> (00181) is “exposure to environmental contamination in doses sufficient to cause adverse health effects” (Herdman &amp; Kamitsuru, 
 <xref rid="ijnt12291-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>, p. 424). The 
 <italic>defining characteristics</italic> are categorized into pesticides, chemicals, biologics, pollution, waste, and radiation. No definitions are provided for these terms and it was difficult to conclude that the biologics category included viral infections. The key word in each of these categories is “exposure.” The 
 <italic>related factors</italic> are focused primarily on external factors such as chemical contaminates in food and water, inadequate protective clothing, and use of noxious materials, for example. The 
 <italic>at‐risk populations</italic> category does not include exposure to viral infections.
