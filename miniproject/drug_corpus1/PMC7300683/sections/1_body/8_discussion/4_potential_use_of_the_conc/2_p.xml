<p>The definition of the nursing diagnosis 
 <italic>Risk for Contamination</italic> (00180) is “susceptible to exposure to environmental contaminates, which may compromise health” (Herdman &amp; Kamitsuru, 
 <xref rid="ijnt12291-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>, p. 426). Since this diagnosis is a “risk for” diagnosis, no defining characteristics are used to describe this potential problem. The related factors are identical to those listed for 
 <italic>Contamination</italic> (00181). Both nursing diagnoses were added to the NANDA‐I taxonomy in 2006 and revised in 2017. We concluded that these nursing diagnoses were not a good match to the COVID‐19 pandemic. They were more clearly aligned with environmental contamination such as bioterrorism, disasters, chemical spills, or radiation.
