<p>The purpose of this project is threefold. In part one of a two‐part article, we present initial guidance for developing nursing care plans for COVID‐19 for nurses practicing in community or public health roles, based on identifying linkages of three standardized nursing terminologies, NANDA international (NANDA‐I) nursing diagnoses, Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC), and Nursing Outcomes Classification (NOC). Community and public health nurses play a critically important role by assessing the needs and resources of the population related to the coronavirus, case tracking, and decreasing the spread of the disease through education at both the individual and community levels. In part two, we present linkages of nursing diagnoses, outcomes, and interventions to support the development of nursing care plans that can be adopted by nurses working with individuals and families in various settings based on a model we developed for this work. These linkages can guide clinical decision‐making and care plan development by nurses at the front line as well as provide needed data to enable researchers to examine the impact of nursing care on both individuals and communities. Our third goal is to identify a list of additional nursing diagnoses, outcomes, and interventions for future development to address pandemic situations.</p>
