<p>Nurses and other frontline health workers need advice on best practices to guide their care decisions during the pandemic. Although the virus itself is novel, many of the nursing diagnoses, interventions, and outcomes associated with the illness are not unique and have been used in previous linkages of nursing diagnoses, outcomes, and interventions to other infections. Valid and reliable documentation of the nursing care provided is needed during the crisis, despite the high demands it imposes on nursesâ€™ time at the bedside. Importantly, documentation should be codified and interoperable to monitor progress, recovery, and potential deterioration of the patient's status, to review prior interventions, and to determine the effectiveness of nursing care retrospectively.</p>
