 <xref rid="ijnt12291-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) adopted a new structure for the linkages based on changes in the format of nursing diagnoses published in the most recent edition of NANDA‐I (Herdman &amp; Kamitsuru, 
 <xref rid="ijnt12291-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). This project focused on using the new diagnosis format adopted by the NANDA‐I.
