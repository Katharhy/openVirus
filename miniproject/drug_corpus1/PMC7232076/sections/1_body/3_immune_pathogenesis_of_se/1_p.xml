<p id="p0020">SARS-CoV-2 has an affinity to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors which are expressed in human respiratory epithelia in the lungs. It spreads through the respiratory tract leading to fever, cough, and subsequently in those susceptible to have serious outcomes, it may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 
 <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The pathogenesis of severe disease is considered to be due to the cytokine storm or a dysregulation of the immune response, in addition to the cytopathic effects of the virus. Both are localized mainly to the lungs due to the presence of high concentrations of virus binding receptors in pneumocytes
