<p id="p0040">DEC is a cheap and safe drug used for decades in the treatment of filariasis. It is known to have anti-inflammatory actions especially in the lungs, immune-modulatory effects and poorly defined anti-viral effects. The following observations and mechanisms are postulated to consider the role of DEC in treatment of COVID-19.

   <p id="p0045">DEC has a wide range of immune-related effects. The main immune modularity mechanism is through its inhibition of lipoxygenase (LOX) and cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes in the metabolism of arachidonic acid to form prostaglandins including PGD2 
    <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Ageing lung is associates with high levels of PGD2, a compound produced from arachidonic acid through the cyclo-oxygenase enzymes. The effects of increased PGD2 include a defect in T-cell function. Since DEC inhibits production of PGD2, it should theoretically enhance T cell responses against respiratory viruses in older humans.

   <p id="p0050">DEC therapy has also been shown to enhance antibody production in mice immunized with tetanus toxoid and the cytokine response in animals immunized with LPS both of which facilitates the immune response against microbes

   <p id="p0055">Action of DEC on lung injury has been studied using models of acute inflammation. Carrageenan induced pleurisy had increased cellularity, mild haemorrhage and congestion, apoptotic cells, inflammatory cells (mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells), pulmonary oedema, emphysema and collagen fibers, all of which are attenuated with DEC pre-treatment 
    <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. This is relevant because carrageenan induced pleural inflammation causes an increase in local IL-1 activity in the pleural exudate 
    <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Its anti-inflammatory effects have been useful in treatment of follicular cystitis of bladder â€“ an inflammatory condition resistant to antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents

   <p id="p0060">In addition, there is some evidence to support the anti-viral activity of DEC against RNA viruses. Mice inoculated with murine leukemic virus, survived significantly longer when they were given DEC
