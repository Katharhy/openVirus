<p id="p0005">SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused a pandemic with approximately 414,179 persons affected in 196 countries and 18,440 deaths within a short period of several weeks 
 <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The virus is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Coronaviridae family, members of which cause mild infections. However, the epidemics caused by Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) resulted in alarming morbidity and mortality. COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 appears to surpass both these in severity. Given the urgency of the outbreak, there is growing interest in repurposing existing agents which have been approved already or to develop novel drugs that can improve the clinical outcome of affected patients.
