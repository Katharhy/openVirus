<p>There is a clear association between the risk scores computed by our framework and the severity of outbreaks as measured by the number of deaths, but there are also outbreaks that fall outside of the risk categories one would wish to see. For example, one of the most severe outbreaks was in the bottom 25% of risk scores, and three of the least severe outbreaks were in the highest 25% of risk scores. Nonetheless, the overall association exists, and in future work, we intend to make the relationship stronger.</p>
