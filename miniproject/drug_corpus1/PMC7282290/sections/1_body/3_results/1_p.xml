 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> presents the sourced parameters for each outbreak corresponding to the nine outbreaks listed in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref> with the corresponding risk score and risk classification. The total risk scores in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref> is the sum of the total country score and total disease score. Australia has the lowest country score, and the overall risk score for Australia is the lowest. Likewise, Japan had a low country score. In contrast, Nigeria had the highest total country score, while Bangladesh also had a high country score; however, diphtheriaâ€™s diseases-related score is the lowest among all diseases tested, so the overall risk score is not high enough to characterise the outbreak as extreme risk but was characterised as high-risk overall.
