<p>For our quantitative evaluation of risk scores computed on an evaluation dataset of 61 outbreaks, we first split the outbreaks into quantiles. Each of the 61 outbreaks was placed in one of four quantiles for the number of deaths associated with the outbreak. An outbreak in Q1 was an outbreak where the number of deaths was in the lowest 25% of the full dataset of 61 outbreaks. An outbreak in Q4 for the number of deaths has a number of deaths associated with it that is within the highest 25% of the full dataset. The same method is used to place the outbreaks into four quantiles of risk scores as computed by our risk framework. 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows the result. What is promising is that of the 16 outbreaks that resulted in the highest number of deaths (Q4), 12 were in the top 2 quantiles in terms of risk score (Q3/Q4). However, the other four were in the lower two quantiles of risk score. Of the 15 outbreaks in our dataset that resulted in the least number of deaths (Q1), 11 were in the bottom two quantiles in terms of risk (Q1/Q2) and four were in the top quantiles of risk (Q3/Q4). An equally promising pattern is shown for outbreaks in Q2 and Q3.
