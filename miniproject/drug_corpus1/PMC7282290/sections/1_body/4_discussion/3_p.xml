<p>The development of a simple risk analysis tool will be useful for global epidemic control. We have demonstrated in principle that EpiRisk can assess the level of epidemic risk for individual epidemics and performed well when tested against an initial set of real-world epidemics. This tool can be used to rapidly predict the risk of outbreaks that is useful when planning and prioritising interventions or for epidemic preparedness. An appropriate and timely intervention can help governments and public health professionals prevent catastrophic outcomes. To improve the relevancy for current or future prediction, the development of a real-time tool that provides the most current data for risk prediction is crucial. The involvement of local government and other health organisation to improve the data is also important. In future work, we will evaluate the generalisability of EpiRisk through the use of a more comprehensive test set of outbreaks.</p>
