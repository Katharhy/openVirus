<p>We found that risk calculations by EpiRisk correlated well with epidemic impact using our test dataset of historical epidemics. Both disease-related parameters and country-related parameters significantly contribute to the overall risk of epidemics. The EpiRisk tool is a simple and rapid risk scoring framework for global infectious disease outbreaks that could be used to prioritise rapid and effective epidemic response.
 <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Lessons from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in early 2003 indicates that the timing of outbreak detection is a key factor in the success of interventions, and delays in outbreak detection can limit the efficacy of such interventions. Delays occurred in the 2013–2016 West African Ebola outbreak resulting in over 28 000 cases and over 11 000 deaths and had a substantial economic cost for the affected countries.
 <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> The use of a risk scoring framework, if used early in the outbreaks, might have predicted the need for a rapid response and prevented a catastrophic outcome.
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> This approach can be used if there are more than one epidemic within a country, particularly if resources are limited. An urgent and aggressive intervention is needed for a higher risk score. It includes aggressive case and contact identification, isolation and management and extreme social distancing nationally. Whereas a less aggressive intervention such as standard precaution and routine surveillance in the local level would be appropriate for a lower risk score. For example, an outbreak of Lassa fever occurring in Nigeria at the same time as other infectious diseases such as polio and cholera could also assist the government in prioritising urgent interventions to Lassa fever because it has higher risk disease and therefore minimise the overall impact. Such a tool may assist with prioritisation and early decision making. It may also help international organisations to prioritise countries in most need of urgent assistance.
