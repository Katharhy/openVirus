<p>A limitation of this study is the dependence on the quality of the data inputs, such as the validity of the data sources, and the use of fixed disease parameters of known pathogens. The data used to calculate the risk scores were collected from various sources and from different points in time, which in some cases are out of date or contain biases. On an evaluation set of 61 outbreaks, our results show that the risk score computed using our framework has a positive association with outbreak severity as measured by number of deaths associated with an outbreak. In future work, we intend to improve the model to make this association stronger. At the moment, our model is a simple linear summation of risk factors. We intend to develop a larger dataset of historical outbreaks, at which point it will become viable to develop individual weights for the factors in the model that we hope will improve the strength of the association between risk score and outbreak severity. It should also be noted that the risk categories (and their cutoffs) do lead to a situation where a unit difference in risk can change the risk category entirely. The framework is also currently limited to known pathogens. This limits the tools application during the early moments of an outbreak where the pathogen maybe unknown and awaiting diagnostic confirmation. This also includes the emergence of novel pathogens, where many disease parameters required for input such as the basic reproductive number (R
 <sub>0</sub>), mode of transmission and case fatality rate are likely to be uncertain. However, in the case of COVID-19 as an example, as the pandemic progressed, these parameters quickly became known. Several of the high-scoring features outlined in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>, such as asymptomatic transmission, respiratory spread, viral infection and high case fatality rate, were present.
 <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44 45</xref> Future iterations of the tool could allow the input of these disease parameters manually, and various potential scenarios could be tested by varying the parameters individually, such are variations of R
 <sub>0</sub> to account for uncertainty early in an epidemic. The framework is meant to be used as a whole, where the user ought to look at the risk score, the disease score, the country score and then the individual risk factor scores for deeper insight. Despite these limitations, EpiRisk provides an individualised approach where specific input data for a country and disease can be used, rather than a standard ‘one size fits all’ approach that would be even less generalisable. We believe this country-level approach is more rigorous and can predict outbreak risk more accurately than relying on disease or country factors in isolation.
