<p>There are limited studies assessing the risk of infectious disease outbreaks based on country features. In 2017, Ajisegiri 
 <italic>et al</italic>
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> used such an approach to predict the risk and outcome of the Ebola epidemic worldwide by considering country-specific parameters based on socioeconomic, health system, cultural and geographical factors. The risk framework by Ajisegiri successfully stratified the risk of Ebola outbreaks by country and predicted a much higher risk in West Africa compared with the USA or UK. Had such a tool been available in March 2014, it may have helped prompt a more rapid response. This study aimed to develop a generalised epidemic risk analysis framework that incorporates both pathogen and country-specific parameters to classify the risk of epidemics and provides an early warning system for the management of global outbreaks.
