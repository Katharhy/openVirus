<p>Lessons learnt from recent serious epidemics show that control measures may not be sufficient or timely enough,
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and even short delays to outbreak response result in preventable morbidity and mortality.
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 14 15</xref> The response to the 2013–2014 West African Ebola outbreak is an example of a delayed intervention. Traditional laboratory and surveillance systems misdiagnosed Ebola victims as Lassa fever and cholera.
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The first confirmed laboratory case detected by scientists in France occurred approximately 2.5 months after illness in the index case, and intervention by WHO was delayed for at least 5 months after that.
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> This failure in the early stages of the outbreak had significant follow-on effects, contributing substantially to an exponential increase in epidemic size to over 28 000 cases and 11 000 deaths.
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In 2015, 21 polio-free countries reported re-emergence of the virus with a total of over 1000 confirmed cases,
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> with a slow response implicated as a factor in the impact of these outbreaks.
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Rapid response time is critical for epidemic-prone diseases, and decision support tools to prompt rapid response may be useful.
