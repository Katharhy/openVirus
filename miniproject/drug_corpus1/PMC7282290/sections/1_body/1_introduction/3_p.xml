<p>When looking at global patterns, there is diversity in the severity and impact of outbreaks,
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> which means in the early stages, tools that can predict risk may help identify those with catastrophic potential. Both pathogen and country parameters have a significant impact on the risk of infectious disease outbreaks in a particular country or region.
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> For example, innate characteristics of the pathogen such as the type of pathogen, transmission mode, basic reproductive number, case fatality rate, as well as the availability of effective therapy and vaccine for that particular disease all have a role in predicting the risk of an epidemic.
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Country factors including the social, economic and cultural characteristics of a country may also contribute to the risk of an outbreak. Risk assessment frameworks exist for polio, measles and dengue, which are used in endemic countries such as the Philippines and Romania.
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21â€“23</xref> The availability, however, of a simple, universal epidemic risk scoring framework is valuable to predict the risk of an infectious disease outbreak and to prioritise response.
