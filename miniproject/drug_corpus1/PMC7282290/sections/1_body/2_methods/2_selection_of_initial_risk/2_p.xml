<p>The infectiousness of pathogens also contribute to the risk level of an outbreak.
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Diseases caused by viral pathogens are likely to transmit more rapidly due to the nature of viral replication and mode of transmission in contrast to many bacteria;
 <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> pathogens such as measles are more infectious partly because they spread by the respiratory route and have a high R0.
 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Cholera, although spread via the faecal–oral route, is not as rapid as airborne transmission; however, it has a high reproductive number.
 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> During the South Sudan epidemic in 2016 cholera spread rapidly, resulting in over 20 000 cases and 436 deaths. Besides infectiousness, the availability of control measures for prevention and treatment also has an impact on the overall risk of an outbreak. These factors make it easier to prevent and control epidemics. Vaccination reduces the risk of infections by reducing the number of susceptible people in the population.
 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Treatment availability affects the risk of disease outbreak by reducing the duration, infectious period and severity of disease.
