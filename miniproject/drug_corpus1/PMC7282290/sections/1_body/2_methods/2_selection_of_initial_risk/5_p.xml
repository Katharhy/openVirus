<p>As part of the collection of pathogen-specific data, we performed a review of three outbreak databases: ProMED-mail,

 <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> and EpiWatch
 <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> to collect a line-list of diseases from recent outbreak events for evaluation of the tool.
