<p>The initial set of 18 parameters were reduced to 14 as a result of qualitative discussions and a correlation and clustering analysis on the country parameters. The country parameter ‘roadways/transport network’ was removed due to conflicting interpretations of risk i.e. (1) it may indicate better access to healthcare services, or (2) increase contact between people and hence risk of infection. The disease-factor ‘Disease identification method’ was removed as it provided little variance with most diseases requiring further investigation for confirmatory diagnosis. The ‘reservoir’ factor was removed as its mapping to risk is not consistent and straightforward.</p>
