<p>In our framework, an outbreak in a given country is given risk scores in each of the seven disease factors and seven country factors. These scores are then summed to produce a disease score and a country score for the outbreak, which are then in turn summed to produce a final risk score. The minimum possible risk score is 14 (all 1s) and the maximum is 42 (all 3s). The total score was classified into four risk categories to rank the priority. The categories are ‘low risk’ for a score less than 21, ‘moderate risk’ for a score between 21 and 29, ‘high risk’ for score 30–37 and ‘Extreme risk’ for total score beyond 37. The cut-offs were determined based on expert knowledge of historical outbreaks.</p>
