<p>After the qualitative determination to remove the three aforementioned factors, leaving 15 factors (eight county, seven disease), we performed a quantitative analysis to compute the correlations between all remaining country parameters for the 198 countries in our dataset. As some of the country factors (see 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>) consist of ordinal level data, we used the Kendall correlation coefficient to compute the correlations. See 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref> for the results between the eight country factors.
