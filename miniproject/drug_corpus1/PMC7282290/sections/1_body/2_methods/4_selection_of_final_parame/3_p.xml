<p>The correlation results demonstrated that income, hospital bed density, physician density, and nurses and midwife density were highly correlated factors. We decided that income and hospital bed density were both useful information to show in the framework, and we include them both, despite the Kendall correlation of 0.53. This will lead to a bias towards this in the model, which we address in our conclusion. Regarding the physician density and nurse/midwife density factors, their correlation is 0.66, and we decided they represent similar information about the healthcare system of a country; we therefore chose to retain physician density as a factor over nurse and midwife density, because of physician diagnostic and therapy skill and due to slightly more limited historical availability of nurse and midwife density data for some countries. The initial 18 parameters were reduced to 14 after the reduction process described above (the remaining factors are bold in
