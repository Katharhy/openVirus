<p>We applied values ranging from one to three for each parameter to indicate the level of risk, where ‘low risk’ was denoted by ‘1’, ‘moderate risk’ was denoted by ‘2’ and ‘high risk’ was denoted by ‘3’. We applied minimum and maximum values, score 1 as ‘yes’ and 3 as ‘no’ for binary parameters that had only two different risk groups, for example, asymptomatic transmission, vaccine availability and drug availability. Criteria for assigning risk scores to selected parameters were used from the relevant studies.

 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>. Where there was no available data for a parameter (N/A=not available), the highest risk score was assigned.
