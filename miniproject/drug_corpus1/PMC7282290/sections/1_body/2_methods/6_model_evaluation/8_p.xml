<p>For our evaluation, we split the outbreak risk scores into four quantiles, and we split the number of deaths into four quantiles. That is, Q1 of risk scores represents the 15 outbreaks in our evaluation set with the lowest risk scores and Q4 represents the 15 outbreaks in our evaluation set with the highest risk scores. Similarly, Q1 of deaths represents the 15 outbreaks that resulted in the lowest number of deaths and Q4 represents the 15 outbreaks that resulted in the highest number of deaths. We then tabulated these two quantile groups against each other to evaluate to what extent outbreaks with the highest number of deaths were also the outbreaks with the highest risk scores in our framework and similarly for the lower quantiles. See 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref> in the results section for the result.
