<p>First, to demonstrate the use of the framework, we selected nine different outbreaks with varied outcomes, from different countries with low, medium and high incomes from the last 5 years (2015â€“2019) in order to to cover a range of disease-related and country-related parameters. 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> presents these outbreaks together with the country and disease risk scores computed using our framework. The outbreaks consist of the following: hepatitis A in Australia (2018), Ebola in the USA (2018), measles in Japan (2018), diphtheria in Bangladesh (2017), Zika in Brazil (2015), hepatitis A in Italy (2013), Ebola in Sierra Leone (2014), cholera in South Sudan (2016) and Lassa fever in Nigeria (2018).
