<p>To demonstrate the extent to which the model risk scores correlate with outbreak severity, we collected data on 61 different (non-endemic) outbreaks between 2002 and 2018 of 18 different pathogens in 43 different countries with a wide range of number of cases (mean 25 691, median 804, first quantile 100, third quantile 2734) and deaths (mean 347, median 14, first quantile 1, third quantile 76) per outbreak. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> shows the distribution of the total risk score computed for the 61 outbreaks in the dataset.
