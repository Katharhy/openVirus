<p>We evaluated our risk framework in two ways. First, to demonstrate the use of the framework, we applied it to a number of past outbreaks and showed that our computed risk scores provided insight into the severity of nine historic outbreaks. Second, we collected data on 61 different outbreaks between 2002 and 2018 and showed to what extent the risk scores computed in our model correlate with the number of cases and deaths in those 61 outbreaks.</p>
