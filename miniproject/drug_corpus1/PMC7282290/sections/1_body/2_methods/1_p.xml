<p>We developed a risk analysis framework to predict the risk of an epidemic of any cause modifying the approach used in the Ebola-specific tool developed by Ajisegiri 
 <italic>et al</italic>. In 2018, Ajisegiri 
 <italic>et al</italic>
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> identified the role of sociodemographic features of the Ebola-affected countries to the magnitude of the outbreak. The authors developed a framework that assigned risk scores (from 1 to 3) to country-specific characteristics such as socioeconomic, health systems and geographical factors, as well as cultural beliefs and traditional practices. These risk scores were then added into a simple summation model to produce a single risk figure for a given country. Our modified approach differs from that by Ajisegiri 
 <italic>et al</italic> in two key ways. First, we expanded the scope of the framework developed by Ajisegiri 
 <italic>et al</italic>
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> to be suitable for almost any outbreak in any country (pending data availability) by including both disease-specific and country-specific parameters. Second, we used a subset of the country parameters used by Ajisegiri 
 <italic>et al</italic>. A key objective of the framework presented in this paper is to allow for a quick and simple evaluation of outbreak severity risk in countries around the world. Some factors used by Ajisegiri 
 <italic>et al</italic> require data that are not easily or quickly available (eg, screening at borders and bush meat consumption), and while those factors were suitable for evaluating a local region such as that in the Ebola outbreak, it does not meet the needs of our global framework. Data were collected on outbreak parameters that fall into two different categories: disease-related parameters and country-related parameters, as outlined in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>.
