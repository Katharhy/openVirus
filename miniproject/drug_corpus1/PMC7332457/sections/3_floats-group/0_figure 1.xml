  <p>The Gut Microbiota’s Hypothetical Role in SARS-CoV-2 Infection</p>
  <p>A healthy gut microbiota boosts the lungs’ antiviral response, including interferon production and the effector function of CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cells (step 1). Soon after infection, SARS-CoV-2 replicates in the intestinal compartment and decreases the expression and activity of ACE2 (step 2). This leads to gut dysbiosis and gastrointestinal symptoms (step 3). Meanwhile, viral infection of the lungs triggers the systemic production of interferons and elicits weight loss, both of which trigger gut dysbiosis (step 3). Changes in the composition and functional activity of the gut microbiota and impairment of the gut’s barrier function contribute to disease outcomes, including ARDS, a systemic cytokine storm, and multiorgan dysfunction (step 4).
