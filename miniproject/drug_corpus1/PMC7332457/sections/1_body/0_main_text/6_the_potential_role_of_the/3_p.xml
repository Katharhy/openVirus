<p id="p0045">Whether gut disorders (including microbiota alterations) influence on outcomes in COVID-19 is still an open question. Evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection alters the gut-blood barrier and thus leads to systemic dissemination of bacteria, endotoxins, and microbial metabolites (

 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Guan et al., 2020</xref>). This might affect the host’s initial response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and might then contribute to multisystem dysfunction, septic shock, and the systemic inflammation storm seen in the second phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which typically result in death (

 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020c</xref>). Clinical studies have demonstrated that the presence of a gastrointestinal disorder in COVID-19 patients is associated with a more aggressive clinical course, including ARDS, liver injury, a higher body temperature, and shock (

 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2020</xref>) are known to be associated with disturbances of the intestinal microbiota and, in particular, low production of SCFAs. This is particularly the case for patients with metabolic syndrome (obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes) who exhibit severity factors for viral infections (including respiratory infections) (

 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Honce and Schultz-Cherry, 2019</xref>). The role of intestinal dysbiosis in this setting needs to be investigated, e.g., by performing fecal transfer experiments in relevant animal models. We speculate that ACE2 disruption, changes in microbial profiles, and intestinal inflammation and leakiness during SARS-CoV infection strongly amplify systemic pathways in comorbid individuals and exacerbate underlying pathologies (e.g., diabetes and hypertension). SARS-CoV-2 infection may also deteriorate the course of human inflammatory bowel diseases (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Effenberger et al., 2020</xref>). The mortality rate associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher in older adults, who also tend to display chronic low-grade inflammation with underlying microbiota alterations and gut leakiness. In the setting of COVID-19, can we exploit the gut microbiota for the patient’s benefit? At present, no direct clinical evidence suggests that modulation of the gut microbiota has therapeutic value in patients with COVID-19. However, it is tempting to speculate that targeting gut microbiota might be a therapeutic option.
