<p id="p0040">Patients with respiratory infections generally have gut-dysfunction-related complications that worsen the clinical course. For example, this type of gut-lung crosstalk has been described during influenza infections in both humans and animal models. Severe influenza A virus infection is associated with intestinal disorders and gut microbiota alterations (

In fecal transfer experiments, we showed that the dysbiotic microbiota remotely compromises the lung’s defenses against pneumococcal infection. In mechanistic terms, a reduction in SCFA production is associated with a decrease in the alveolar macrophages’ bactericidal activity (
