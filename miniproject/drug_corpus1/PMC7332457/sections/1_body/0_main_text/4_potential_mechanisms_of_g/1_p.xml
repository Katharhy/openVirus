<p id="p0025">Gastrointestinal disorders in COVID-19 patients are likely to have several etiological factors. The recruitment of inflammatory cells (i.e., from the bone marrow) and/or the systemic and local production of inflammatory cytokines are likely to have a role. In this setting, local inflammation might weaken the epithelial barrier. Cellular damage induced directly by viral replication and spreading might also actively contribute to injury and inflammation of the gut epithelium. Gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 patients might also result from dysfunction of ACE2. As mentioned earlier, ACE2 is a key regulatory enzyme in the RAAS, and the latter is known to influence immune functions and inflammation (

 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Hashimoto et al., 2012</xref>). The intestinal phenotype is (at least partly) due to ACE2’s non-catalytic function. A lack of ACE2 alters the expression of the neutral amino acid transporter B
 <sup>0</sup>AT1 on intestinal epithelial cells, which lowers the intake of tryptophan and thus reduces the production of nicotinamide and (potentially) other tryptophan-derived metabolites with a critical role in intestinal homeostasis (

 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Agus et al., 2018</xref>). Binding of the viral spike protein to ACE2 leads to reduced expression of the latter but does not change the expression of ACE (
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kuba et al., 2005</xref>). During SARS-CoV infections, the expression of ACE2 is considerably reduced—at least in the lungs (
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kuba et al., 2005</xref>). Given the key role of ACE2 in intestinal homeostasis, reduced expression and impaired function of this protein during a SARS-CoV infection might substantially contribute to local disorders and pathogenesis. It remains to be seen whether drugs able to modulate ACE2 expression, such as ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (used in hypertension and diabetes), can modulate gastrointestinal disorders, including gut dysbiosis, in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Along with inflammation and dysfunction of ACE2, other mechanisms might be implicated in gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Because hypoxia is a major clinical symptom in COVID-19 patients (
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Cavezzi et al., 2020</xref>) and is known to be critical in intestinal homeostasis, including microbiota composition and function (
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Singhal and Shah., 2020</xref>), it is also likely that oxygen deprivation might be important in gastrointestinal disorders and disease severity. Recent evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may affect the central nervous system (
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Paniz-Mondolfi et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Helms et al., 2020</xref>). Regarding the importance of the gut-brain axis, one can speculate that this may play a role in gastrointestinal disorders during SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is possible that the enteric nervous system could be affected by SARS-CoV-2, either by direct viral infection or through the elicited immune response (e.g., inflammatory cytokines), amplifying diarrhea and possibly stimulating the vagus nerve to promote vomiting.
