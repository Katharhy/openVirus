<p>As already mentioned above, aberrant maladaptive innate immune host responses, including “cytokine storm” events, have been associated with severe lung disease and the development of ARDS during SARS and the COVID-19 current episode. Mechanistically, these events usually occur at a late stage of the disease, and several mechanisms have been proposed. In particular, a murine study has shown that a prolonged (albeit delayed, as demonstrated also 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, see above) type I IFN signaling was instrumental in triggering over-exuberant innate inflammatory monocytes–macrophages immune responses and an impaired virus-specific T-cell response (
