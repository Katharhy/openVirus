<p>Furthermore, in an interesting “2-way” system involving differentiated SARS-permissive lung Calu-3 cells and monocyte-derived Macs and DCs, it was shown that mediators produced by Calu-3 cells activate cytokine production by macrophages (IL-1β, G-CSF, MIP-1, and TNF-α) and DCs (IL-12p40, MIP-1, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1) but that some of these Calu-3 derived mediators (in particular IL-6 and IL-8) compromised the ability of DCs and Macs to activate naïve T cells and phagocytosis (
