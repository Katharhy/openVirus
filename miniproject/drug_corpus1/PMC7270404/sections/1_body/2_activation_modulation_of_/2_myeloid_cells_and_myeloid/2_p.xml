<p>However, a few studies have shown that myeloid cells can respond to SARS-Cov infection. Indeed, Dosch et al. showed that the S protein could, through TLR2, trigger NF-κB activation and inflammatory responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) (

Also, in common with epithelial cells, it was shown that PBMCs and DCs infected with SARS-CoV produced cytokines and chemokines such as and C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand (CCL)-2 and/or C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand (CXCL)-10/RANTES/Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)/IL-8/IL-6, but, importantly, not IFN-β (
