<p>In addition, a mouse genetic study revealed that the TLR adaptor protein 
 <italic>Ticam2</italic> was a susceptibility gene to SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>); mice KO for 
 <italic>Ticam2</italic> (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>), but also 
 <italic>MyD88</italic> (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>), another TLR adaptor protein, were highly susceptible to a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV lung infection. Since polymorphisms of TLRs and MyD88 have been associated in humans with heightened sensitivity to a variety of pathogens (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>), these studies, in addition to demonstrating the role of TLR pathways in the SARS-CoV infection, suggested a human genetic predisposition to SARS-CoV, and this could explain the variability of severity in patients with COVID-19 disease. Forthcoming human genetic studies from international collaborative efforts (

 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). Indeed, 
 <italic>ACE2</italic> genetic variants may be associated with a modulated ACE2 protein expression, the SARS-Cov-2 receptor, which may explain in part patients' susceptibility to infection. Genes associated with TLR pathways also represent good candidates, as demonstrated in other respiratory viral infection (e.g., influenza) where 
 <italic>TLR3</italic> variants (
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>) were shown to modulate its virulence.
