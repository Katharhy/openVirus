<p>Demonstrating that SARS-CoV can induce TLR-dependent host responses 
 <italic>in vivo, Tlr4, Tlr3</italic>, and 
 <italic>Tram</italic> KO mice were shown to be more susceptible to mouse-adapted SARS-CoV, albeit without exhibiting extra mortality (

 <italic>Trif</italic> were highly susceptible to CoV infections, exhibited diminished lung function, aberrant inflammatory responses, and importantly, higher mortality (
