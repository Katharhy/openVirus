<p>Unfortunately, coronavirus vaccines in general have attracted less attention compared to the effort dedicated to vaccines against other potential pandemic viruses such as Influenza. For example, from 2012 onwards, few SARS-CoV vaccines reached phase 1 clinical trials for lack of interest from the pharmaceutical industry when it became evident that the virus was not making a “comeback” after its initial appearance. However, although probably too late for affecting the current “first wave” of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, many pharmaceutical companies and research laboratories are now working on a plethora of vaccine formulations [for a review, see (
