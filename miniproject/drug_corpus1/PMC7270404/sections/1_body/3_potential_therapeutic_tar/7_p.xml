<p>Indeed, in pre-clinical studies, the determination of cryo-EM structures of the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer is providing a blueprint for the design of vaccines and inhibitors of viral entry (

In this context, promising results show that murine polyclonal antibodies against S protein of SARS-CoV are able to elicit polyclonal antibody responses, preventing SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells, and thus indicating that cross-neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved S epitopes can be elicited upon vaccination (
