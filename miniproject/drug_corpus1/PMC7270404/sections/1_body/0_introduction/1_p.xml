<p>COVID-19 is a respiratory disease whose aetiologic agent is a novel beta coronavirus (CoV) called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2/2019-nCov. The initial outbreak of the pandemic began in December 2019, and it is currently affecting the health and safety of the global community. Indeed, on May 12, 2020, 4.5 million worldwide cases were confirmed (probably a significant under-estimation given the number of untested asymptomatic subjects), with a death toll exceeding 286,000. Before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, two related highly pathogenic CoVs viruses, Middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV (

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), provoked catastrophic epidemics and pandemics, respectively. Unfortunately, no drugs nor vaccines have currently been approved to prevent or treat these viral episodes. The first anatomical/histological reports from the lungs of severely SARS-CoV-2-affected patients experiencing acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) revealed excessive inflammatory activation and destruction of the bronchial and alveolar epithelium, features already observed during the first SARS pandemics in 2003 (

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Indeed, in the latter pandemic, lung alveolar epithelial cells were identified as the most likely site of virus replication, and it was suggested that alveolar macrophages may be responsible for the dissemination of viruses within the lungs (
