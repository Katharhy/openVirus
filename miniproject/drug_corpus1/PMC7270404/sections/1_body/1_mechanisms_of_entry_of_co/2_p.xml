<p>The entry of CoV viruses into host epithelial cells is mediated by the interaction between the viral envelope S protein homotrimers and the cell surface receptors. Following proteolytic cleavage of the CoV S protein (“priming”), the S1 ecto-domain recognizes a membrane receptor [angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for SARS-Cov and SARS-Cov-2 as well as Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for MERS-Cov], whereas the S2 C-terminal domain is involved in cell fusion and viral entry (

 <italic>Influenza</italic>, MERS, CoV, and Paramyxoviruses such as Hendra and Nipah viruses) use similar host proteolytic enzymes for cleaving their ligands (HA and S), namely, mostly lysosomal (Cathepsins B, L), furin, or trypsin-like proteases (
