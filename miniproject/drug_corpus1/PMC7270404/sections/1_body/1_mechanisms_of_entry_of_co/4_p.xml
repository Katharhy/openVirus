<p>Whether this is strictly dependent on ACE2/protease expression is debatable since ACE2 is present in other tissues in humans [such as the intestine, kidney, and testis (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>)]. Indeed, “seasonal” low pathogenic CoVs (e.g., CoV-229E, CoV-OC43) infect mostly upper airways, whereas pathogenic CoVs (SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 and MERS) have a tropism for the distal lung and can cause severe pneumonia and ARDS (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), as currently demonstrated again in the present pandemic. Indeed, potentially explaining this is the fact that seasonal coronaviruses do not use ACE2 as a receptor. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic>, primary nasal and tracheobronchial epithelial cells as well as the Calu-3 bronchial cell line were shown to express ACE2 (the latter not colocalizing with cilia), and their infection with SARS-CoV was shown to be highly cytotoxic (

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). In the distal lung, as hinted above, primary alveolar type II epithelial (ATII) cells are also permissive to SARS-CoV infection (

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 has also been shown to infect various respiratory epithelial cell lines including A549 (alveolar origin), BEAS2-B (bronchial origin), Calu-3 cells, as well as primary human bronchial epithelial cells (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Besides the lung, ACE2 is also highly expressed in the intestine (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), and gastrointestinal symptoms have been recorded with COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). It was shown that SARS-COV2 is able to infect enterocytes as well as intestinal organoids and induces a viral response characterized by the expression of mediators related to type I and III IFN (
