<p>Given the described importance of host proteases in mediating infectivity of a number of viruses, it is no surprise that, upon virus infection, murine knock-out (KO) for some of these molecules has shown some protection. For example, TMPRSS2-KO mice were protected from pulmonary disease and death following H1N1 and H7N9 
 <italic>Influenza</italic> infection, but not from that of the influenza H3N2 subtype, demonstrating some specificity and showing also that other TTSP proteases [such as DESC1 (TMPRSS11E) and MSPL (TMPRSS13)] or other factors may be important (
