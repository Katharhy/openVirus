<p>Although a variety of these proteases have been studied and shown to be involved to varying degrees in virus activation, including neutrophil elastase (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), proteases of the type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSP) family [HAT, Transmembrane protease, serine (TMPRSS)2, and TMPRSS4] have recently been demonstrated to be particularly important, albeit probably at different stages of the virus cell cycle (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In particular, recent research on SARS-Cov-2 has focused on TMPRSS2 and has shown it to be important (although mostly using cell lines infected with pseudotyped virus particles bearing SARS-Cov-2 S protein) for virus entry (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In that context, it has also been demonstrated that the serine protease inhibitor camostat (see also below section on Therapeutic targets and Conclusion) was protective (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In contrast, DPP4 which is necessary for the entry of MERS-CoV (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) is not involved in SARS-Cov-2 entry (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Unlike other SARS-CoVs, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a furin cleavage site at the boundary between the S1 and S2 subunits, which is processed during biogenesis and which may explain CoV-2 high infectivity (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Although mechanistic studies are obviously still in their infancy, it is very likely that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 target mainly respiratory epithelial cells with similar mechanisms. Indeed, as indicated above, initial work has shown that ACE2 is the S receptor for both SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) and SARS-CoV-2 viruses (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), and structural studies using cryo-electron microscopy suggest a binding of two S protein trimer to an ACE2 dimer (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).
