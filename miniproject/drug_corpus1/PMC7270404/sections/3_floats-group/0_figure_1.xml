  <p>Schematic representation of airway and lung infection by SARS-CoV-2 at early time points 
   <bold>(A)</bold> and during SARS 
   <bold>(B)</bold>. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> The airway epithelium is composed of various cell types including ciliated (C), basal (B), glandular (G), and club cells (CC). It is covered by mucus (M) involved in the mucociliary clearance. Distal to the lung, the alveoli include alveolar type I (ATI) and type II (ATII) cells coated with surfactant (S). The airways are also protected by the resident alveolar macrophages (AM) and dendritic cells (DC). Through the action of host proteases, including the TTSP Transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), and the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with its cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), SARS-CoV-2 can enter and replicate into airway epithelial cells and AM. Also, interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 with the PRRs is instrumental in inducing cytokine, chemokine, and interferon responses for the establishment of innate and adaptive immune responses. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> During SARS, innate immune responses are exacerbated in the alveolar space, with accumulation of activated monocytes (mono), activated macrophages (AM), interstitial macrophages (IM), and neutrophils (neut), leading to dysregulated inflammation, disruption of the alveolar-capillary membrane and tissue damage.
