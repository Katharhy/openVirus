<p id="para0038">Replication fidelity of SARS-coronaviruses is relatively high, because of their RNA proofreading functions through 3’- 5’ exonuclease activities of NSP14 and NSP12, which results in a low rate of new mutations, estimated to be at 2x10

 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. Nevertheless, the rare errors that occur during viral genome replication could results in generation of variants that could affect infectivity of the virus, lead to antigenic drift, and modify the host responses to the viral antigen, and hence, impede generation of an effective vaccine. This antigen drift could pose considerable challenges for developing a vaccine that maintains its effectiveness for a long period. A notable example is a single amino acid substitution, namely p.D614G, located in the S protein, which has become the dominant variant in the current pandemic in the Western world, as opposed to D614 variant during epidemics in Wuhan, China. Experimental and clinical data suggest that the G614 variant increases infectivity and is associated with a higher viral load 
 <xref rid="bib0071" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. Preliminary data suggest that the p.D614G variant does not affect antigenic properties of the S protein and therefore, is unlikely to have an effect on efficacy of the vaccines targeting the S protein
