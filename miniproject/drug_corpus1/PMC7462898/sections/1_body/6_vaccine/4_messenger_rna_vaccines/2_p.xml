<p id="para0039">The rationale is to deliver an mRNA that codes for a viral protein as an antigen presented to the host-immune system in order to elicit an immune response and produce neutralizing antibodies. The mRNA vaccine differs from the conventional vaccine, which typically utilizes an inactivated organism or its protein as an antigen to stimulate the host-immune system. An mRNA, containing an ORF, is first transcribed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> from a DNA template using an RNA polymerase. The ORF codes for the protein of interest that serves as the antigen. The translation is achieved using the host translational machinery. The mRNA-based vaccines have several advantages, including relative safety, reliance on host translational machinery, lack of integration in the genome, and the relative ease and scalable production in the laboratory. However, there are important challenges, such as effective delivery, stability of the mRNA in the host system, fortuitous immune response, and instability upon storage, unless frozen.
