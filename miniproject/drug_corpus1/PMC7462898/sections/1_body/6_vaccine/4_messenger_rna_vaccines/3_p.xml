<p id="para0040">The mRNA vaccine is advocated to be as the most efficient and less time-consuming approach to develop a vaccine against COVID-19. Therefore, the RNA vaccines have emerged as the prime candidates for vaccination against COVID-19. The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the prime target of RNA vaccines as it closely resembles that of SARS-CoV, making it possible to apply the existing knowledge about the S protein to develop an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. In support of the potential utility of the S protein as an antigen, data in a small number of patients with COVID-19 show neutralizing antibodies against the RBD and the N-terminal domain of the S proteins, rendering these domains as attractive targets for vaccine development
