<p id="para0043">Two RNA constructs, one presenting the replicate and the other target antigen, also have been developed, which might offer the advantage of persistent antigen expression upon a single injection 
 <xref rid="bib0076" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. Likewise, dendritic cells transfected with the viral RNA could potently activate antigen-specific T cells and confer robust immunogenicity. Finally, nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccines are highly effective in presenting antigen and eliciting an immune response. In accord with the diversity of approaches and potential efficacy of the mRNA-based vaccines, there are enormous efforts by several academic centers and the industry to develop mRNA-based vaccines, utilizing various renditions of the approach. Several mRNA-base vaccines already have been tested for safety and immunogenicity in provoking neutralizing antibodies (Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies). Enrolment into large-scale phase 3 clinical efficacy clinical trials has already been started.
