<p id="para0046">Full-length or domains of the S, M, and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are the candidate antigens, as they are effective in producing host antibodies, at least in the case of SARS-CoV. To enhance immunogenicity of the viral peptides, often an adjuvant or an epitope that is recognized by the T or B cells are fused with the viral protein. Likewise, multi-epitope peptides might confer a superior immune response. Repeated administration is often required to induce a sufficient humoral and cellular immune response. A recently developed technique is delivery of a fragment of viral S protein through microneedle array, as opposed to conventional subcutaneous injection 
 <xref rid="bib0081" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>. Similarly, fusion proteins, comprised of a fragment of viral S or M protein and an adjuvant, such as aluminum, are being developed and tested to induce vaccination. Over a dozen programs are advancing various peptide-based vaccine platforms from the preclinical studies to early phase 1 and 2 clinical studies in humans.
