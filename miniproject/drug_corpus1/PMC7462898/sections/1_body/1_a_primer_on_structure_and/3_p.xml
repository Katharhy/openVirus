<p id="para0005">The S glycoprotein (~141 kDa and ~1,270 amino acids) forms a homotrimer that protrudes from the cell membrane and gives the virus the appearance of a crown under electron microscopy, and hence the name coronavirus (
 <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig.Â 1</xref> ) 
 <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The S protein is responsible for attachment of the virus to the host cell receptors, namely the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) 
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The M glycoprotein (~25 kDa, ~220 amino acids) is the most abundant structural protein, which through interactions with other structural proteins gives the virus its physical structure. The M protein also interacts with the S protein to retain the virus at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi complex, where the new virions are assembled and subsequently excreted via secretory vesicles. The excess load of the viral proteins during infection with SARS-CoV-2 could overwhelm the ER leading to ER stress and consequent activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). The nucleoprotein or the N protein (~46 kDa, ~420 amino acid) directly interacts with the viral RNA as well as the membrane proteins, such as the M protein, and forms nucleocapsid, which provides stability to the viral genome within the envelope. It also enables viral replication. The E protein (~ 10 kDa, ~75 amino acid) is the smallest of the structural proteins and contributes to viral production and maturation, as its absence significantly reduces viral titers and leads to production of incompetent viral particles 
 <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. These structural proteins not only interact with each other but also with a large number of host proteins, which are collectively responsible for part of the phenotypic effects of infection with SARS-CoV-2.
