<p id="para0004">SARS-CoV-2 is a positive sense, single-stranded RNA virus whose genome is comprised of 29,903 nucleotides (NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_045512) 
 <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The genome codes for the viral proteome, comprised of four major structural surface glycoproteins, namely, spike (S), matrix (M) and envelope (E) and the nucleoprotein (N), as well as 16 nonstructural proteins (NSPs), the latter proteins are generated from cleavage of two large polypeptides 
 <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The viral genome also contains several additional ORFs, which encode the accessory proteins involved in virus-host interactions
