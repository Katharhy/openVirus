<p id="para0006">The viral genome also codes for 16 NSPs, which are involved not only in viral replication but also in suppression of the host defenses by various mechanisms, including degradation of host mRNAs and inactivation of protein translation. These NSPs along with the proteins coded by the ORFs and the structural proteins interact with over 300 human proteins to impact various biological effects 
 <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Through meticulous cooperative interactions, the viral proteins confer the virus the ability to replicate effectively by copying the viral RNA, evading detection by the host-immune system, and destroying the host-defenses (reviewed in 
 <xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>). Several of these NSPs, because of their essential functions in viral survival and infectivity, are subject to specific therapeutic targeting.
