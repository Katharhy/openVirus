<p id="para0003">Since first diagnosed in early December 2019 in the city of Wuhan in China, the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic with a colossal global impact. The disease is caused by a coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
 <xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. COVID-19 along with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are the third epidemic outbreaks caused by coronaviruses in humans. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 has 80% sequence identity to that of SARS-CoV, which caused the first outbreak in humans more than a decade ago, and about 97% sequence identity to a bat coronavirus (CoV RaTG13) genome, the latter indicating its origin from the bat virus 
 <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The genomic similarities have afforded scientists the opportunity to apply the knowledge gained from studying SARS-CoV and bat coronaviruses in deciphering the molecular underpinning of SARS-CoV-2 structure and function and therefore, the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Today, not only the genomic sequence of SARA-CoV-2 is fully known but also various protein constituents of the virus and its modus operandi for replication and infection of the host cells have been reasonably well-characterized. This is not to be interpreted that all is known and nothing is left to discover. To the contrary, there are plenty of unknowns about this virus and about this infection. Nevertheless, the fundamental discoveries about genetics and molecular biology of coronaviruses have paved the way in an unprecedented way for the rapid development of virus-specific therapeutics and vaccines, which are essential for the ultimate elimination of COVID-19.
