<p id="para0031">The approach exploits the rare error of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase during RNA synthesis, resulting in incorporation of modified nucleotides into the viral RNA during synthesis, which leads to premature termination of RNA elongation, effectively abolishing viral replication 
 <xref rid="bib0054" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. A library of nucleoside analogues, which were initially developed and approved for treatment of other viral diseases, such as Ebola virus disease and influenza, are candidates to effectively terminate SARS-CoV-2 replication upon incorporation into its RNA chain during synthesis and terminating its elongation 
 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. The list of potential candidates includes remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin, galidesivir, tenofovir, sofobuvir, and EIDD-2801 among others. Upon phosphorylation to the triphosphate these nucleosides forms convert to active drugs and terminate viral RNA synthesis upon incorporation.
