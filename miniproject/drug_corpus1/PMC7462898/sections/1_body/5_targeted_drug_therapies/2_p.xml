<p id="para0022">The knowledge gained through basic science discoveries about the structure and function of the SARS-CoV-2 has enabled the researchers to test the existing compounds and to perform large-scale screening to identify new compounds that effectively target the specific components of the virus. Likewise, sequencing of the viral genome and identification of its proteome have enabled the investigators to develop vaccines by using the viral RNAs and specific epitopes of the viral proteins as antigens. Over 3,000 clinical trials, including ~ 500, phase 3 clinical trials, have been registered worldwide that are designed to test effectiveness of over four dozen different compounds, ranging from the epigenetic modulator JQ1 to medicinal herbs, in prevention and treatment of COVID-19 (

In the following sections, a selected number of interventions that directly target specific components pertaining to viral entry and replication are discussed along with various approaches to vaccine development.
