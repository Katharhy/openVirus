<p id="para0035">A diverse array of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions is applied to prevent, attenuate, or reverse, in part, the response of the host cells to infection with SARS-CoV-2. A notable phenotypic feature of COVID-19 is the cytokine storm, characterized by marked elevation of proinflammatory and cytotoxic cytokines, such as IL1, IL6, IL10, IFN-g and TNF-a, among others 
 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. Consequently, specific inhibitors of cytokines, such as tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL6, have been used in treatment of patients with COVID-19. Preliminary observational data show that treatment with tocilizumab is associated with improved laboratory and clinical outcomes, including the risk of mechanical ventilation and hospital-related mortality [
