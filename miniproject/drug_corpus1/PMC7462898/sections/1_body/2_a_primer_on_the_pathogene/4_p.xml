<p id="para0009">Given the above mechanism of entry, coexpression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and possibly other host proteases on the same cell type is considered essential for infection with SARS-CoV-2. Data in the Human Protein Atlas (

Single cell RNA-sequencing data sets show predominant expression of ACE2 in nasal mucosa, lungs, and small intestine
