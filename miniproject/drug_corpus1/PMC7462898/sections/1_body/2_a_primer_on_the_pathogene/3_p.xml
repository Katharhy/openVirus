<p id="para0008">In the open state, which is the predominant state of the S protein, the RBD of the S protein binds to the ACE2, initiating the viral entry into the host cell. The successful viral entry after attachment of the RBD of S protein to ACE2, however, requires proteolytic cleavage of the S protein by furin-like, trypsin-like, and cathepsin proteases, and the serine protease TMPRSS2 (

 <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Proteolytic modifications of the S1/ACE2 protein complex are considered a critical stage in viral entry, as inhibition of TMPRSS2 with serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate blocks entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the epithelial cells

 <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Subsequent to the proteolytic cleavage of S1 by TMPRSS2, the S2 domain fuses with the host cell membrane, enables cellular entry of the virus by endocytosis, and subsequent release of the viral RNA into host cell cytoplasm. The canonical endocytic pathway is clathrin-dependent formation of membrane vesicles. However, viruses could enter the cell through noncanonical pathways, such as caveolae and flotillin-dependent endocytosis. The exact mode of endocytosis utilized by SARS-CoV-2 for entry into the host cell is not known and might vary according to the cell type.
