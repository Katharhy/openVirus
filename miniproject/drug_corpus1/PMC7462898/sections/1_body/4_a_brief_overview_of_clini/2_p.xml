<p id="para0013">The virus is transmitted from person to person via airborne respiratory droplets and aerosols. SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious but less lethal than SARS. Every infected person is estimated to transmit the virus to 2.1 individuals. Given the above basic reproductive number, herd immunity is expected to be achieved when about 2/3rd of the population develop immunity 
 <xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. It is estimated that between 10% and 30% of the infected individuals remain asymptomatic, albeit the true number of infected asymptomatic individuals might be even higher. The asymptomatic individuals by shedding the virus might be an important source of spread of the virus in the population. Given the relatively high number of asymptomatic infected individuals, one might posit that that exposure to the virus is inevitable.
