Elderly with diabetes and cardiovascular diseases are particularly susceptible. Several factors are implicated in increased susceptibility of the elderly to COVID-19, in addition to the high prevalence of co-morbid conditions, such as the presence of underlying inflammatory state, referred to as inflammaging, reduced innate, and adaptive immunity, altered airway function, and altered expression of ACE2 and other molecules involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 (reviewed in
