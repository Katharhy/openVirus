 <italic>Cardiovascular involvement in COVID-19</italic>: SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell through the ACE2 receptors, upon modifications with TMPRSS2 and possibly by furin-like and CTSL (cathepsin L) proteases. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 tropism is largely determined by the expression of protein constituents involved in viral entry. Single cell sequencing data show that ACE2 is expressed at high levels in cardiac pericytes but relatively low to moderate levels in other cardiac cell types, including myocytes, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells [

 <xref rid="bib0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In contrast, TMPRSS2 and CTSL are expressed at relatively low levels in the cardiovascular cells [
 <xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Because tropism of the SARS-CoV-2 depends on coexpression of ACE2 and host proteases, viral myocarditis is not a common feature of COVID-19. However, histological and magnetic resonance imaging evidence of myocarditis, such as interstitial fibrosis, inflammatory cellular infiltrates, and necrosis, has been reported in patients with COVID-19. Whether these changes are the direct consequence of viral infection or are secondary to increased levels of cytokines, catecholamines, or hypoxia, and other factors remains uncertain.
