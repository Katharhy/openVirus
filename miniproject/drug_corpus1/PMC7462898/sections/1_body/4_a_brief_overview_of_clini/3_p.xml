<p id="para0014">Several factors have been associated with the clinical presentation of COVID-19, including age, biological sex, pre-existing medical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. Otherwise, the reasons for: inter-individual variability in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, which ranges from an asymptomatic course to that of severe disease requiring intubation, are largely unknown. The variability likely reflects complex stochastic interactions among multiple factors, including possible exposure load, viral shedding, pre-existing neutralizing antibodies that cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 proteins, differences in the host cellular immune responses, composition of the immune cells, including T cells, blood groups, and genetic composition of the individuals [
