<p id="para0012">At the cellular level, the immune response of the host, including expression of cytokines leads to activation and rapid expansion of the cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, which target and kills the host cells infected with the virus. Likewise, the CD4+ T cells are activated, which in turn signal a subset of the antibody producing B cells (plasma cells), prompting generation of antibodies. These antibodies are specific to the viral proteins and are comprised of IgM and IgG. Whereas the former rises within a few days and declines within several weeks, the latter rises within 2-3 weeks but stays much longer. It is the latter antibody along with the memory T cells that confer host immunity to reinfection with SARS-CoV-2.</p>
