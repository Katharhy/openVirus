<p id="p0070">Specificity of the assays for SARS-CoV-2 compared with other respiratory viral pathogens, including the four non-SARS-2 human coronaviruses, was greater than 95%. While the EDI assay had 100% specificity for SARS-CoV-2 in this set of 20 samples, the Euroimmun assay had one false positive for a sample that was positive for multiple viral pathogens (adenovirus, HMPV, and human rhinovirus/enterovirus). Notably, samples from patients who had tested positive for one of the four non-SARS-2 human coronaviruses were negative by both assays (
