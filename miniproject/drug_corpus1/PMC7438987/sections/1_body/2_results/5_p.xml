<p id="p0080">ROC curves were generated for the EDI and Euroimmun assays based on positive (SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive) and negative results (2019 pre-pandemic samples, and viral pathogen panel-positive/ SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative samples) (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> ). With the defined assay cutoffs, sensitivity of the EDI assay was 84.8% and specificity was 99.1% (compared with the manufacturer's claims of 94.8% sensitivity and 99.8% specificity), whereas sensitivity of the Euroimmun assay was 91.8% and specificity was 96.8% (compared with 90% sensitivity and 100% specificity).
