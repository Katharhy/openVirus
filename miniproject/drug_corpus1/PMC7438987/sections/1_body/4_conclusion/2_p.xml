<p id="p0105">Based on our comparison findings, a combination of two or more antigenic targets may be required to achieve greater sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection. In our study, when positive and negative results from both assays were combined, sensitivity for a positive result in SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive samples increased to 93.2%; however, specificity dropped to 96.0%. Therefore, this approach must be balanced with maintaining high specificity, as false-positives may be erroneously interpreted as possible protective immunity, despite lack of evidence that such positive results are protective and may lead to potential neglect of personal safety measures against SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Additionally, a false-positive result could lead to a patient receiving treatment with convalescent plasma that is ineffective. Regardless of adequate analytical performance among assays, the interpretation of serological findings remains a challenge with knowledge in this arena evolving as this pandemic continues. While samples from initial donations were used in this study, many of our CCP donor cohort have donated multiple times. This will allow for future information on duration of antibody presence in this population.</p>
