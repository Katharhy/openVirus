<p id="p0015">SARS-CoV-2 antibody analysis is evolving at a rapid pace with several assays coming to market, some having received CE-mark (European Economic Area) approval, and a few, more recently, having received FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). (

Currently, there are a number of methodologies including ELISA, automated immunoassay, and lateral flow-based point of care devices. These assays generally target one of the virus's four main structural proteins including the spike (S), small envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) glycoproteins. (
 <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Ahmed et al., 2020</xref>) The S protein has additional antigenic targets in the S1 domain and receptor binding domain (RBD). (
