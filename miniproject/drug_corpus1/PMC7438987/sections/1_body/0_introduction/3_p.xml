<p id="p0010">The United States Food and Drug Administration(FDA) authorized CCP for compassionate use on March 27, 2020 and provided guidance for CCP collection. The fundamental eligibility requirement is a confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or serology test, with the most recent guidance mandating at least 14-days of COVID-19 recovery prior to donation. (
 <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2020</xref>) Aside from assisting in eligibility determination, serological testing informs CCP donor management decisions related to continual eligibility as detectable antibody in donors would be of benefit to potential recipients. In addition to the analysis of CCP, SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing provides information related to past exposure that would be useful in epidemiological studies to understand disease seroprevalence as well as confirm vaccine response during clinical trials. In the patient care setting, as with many antibody tests for infectious disease, SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing is not used for primary diagnosis. However, it may serve to support diagnosis in SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative cases if the patients' viral loads are below the limit of detection in PCR testing, but there is a high clinical suspicion for COVID-19.
