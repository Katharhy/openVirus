<p id="p0040">The EDI ELISA utilizes the SARS-CoV-2 recombinant nucleocapsid antigen. Positive and negative assay controls, and samples diluted 1:100 with the kit-specific COVID-19 IgG sample diluent were added to the wells. Following a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the plates were washed 5 times using the kit-specific wash buffer and anti-human IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated detection antibody was added. The plate was incubated for 30 min at room temperature, followed by 5 washes, and addition of the substrate tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). The reaction was stopped with 0.5 M sulfuric acid after 20 min, and the plate was read at 450 nm within 10 min of halting the reaction.</p>
