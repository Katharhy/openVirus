<p id="p0045">The Euroimmun ELISA assay utilizes the S1 domain, including the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. A kit-specific calibrator, positive and negative controls, and samples diluted 1:101 with the kit-specific dilution buffer were added to pre-coated wells. Following a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the plates were washed 3 times with wash buffer. Anti-human IgG-HRP conjugated detection antibody was added and the plates incubated for another 30 min at 37 °C. Plates were then washed 3 times, and substrate TMB was added. Color development was halted after 30 min at room temperature with 0.5 M sulfuric acid, and the plate was read at 450 nm within 10 min of halting the reaction.</p>
