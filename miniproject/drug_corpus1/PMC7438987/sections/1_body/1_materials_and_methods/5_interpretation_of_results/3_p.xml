<p id="p0055">The euroimmun assay was interpreted based on the ratio of the sample OD
 <sub>450</sub> to the calibrator OD
 <sub>450</sub>. Samples with a ratio of less than 0.8 were deemed negative, samples with a ratio of greater than 1.1 were positive, and OD
 <sub>450</sub> values between 0.8 and 1.1 were reported as borderline.
