<p id="p0050">For the EDI assay, positive, negative and borderline results were calculated based on the average optical density (OD
 <sub>450</sub>) value for the negative control assayed in triplicate for the specific assay. The positive and negative cut-off values were calculated using the formula: positive cut-off =1.1 x (xNC + 0.18) and negative cut-off = 0.9 x (xNC + 0.18), where xNC is the average OD
 <sub>450</sub> of triplicate negative control OD values. Samples that had OD
 <sub>450</sub> values that fell between positive and negative cut-off values were reported as borderline.
