<p id="p0095">Our data show that the EDI assay has higher specificity (99%) at the manufacturer defined cutoff compared to the specificity of the Euroimmun assay (96.8%). However, EDI displayed a lower sensitivity, as it missed low-positive or borderline antibody responses that were detected in the Euroimmun assay. These findings suggest that the performance characteristics of a SARS-CoV-2 antibody assay may depend on specific antigen used, and may therefore influence the context in which the assay is used â€“ for example, when used for community surveillance, an assay with lower sensitivity may lead to under-representation of seroconversion rates in population studies.</p>
