 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, both assays performed similarly with SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive samples with over 93% positive result agreement. Interestingly, samples that were discrepant between the two assays tested either borderline- or low-positive in one of the assays and negative in the other. While the majority of moderately to strongly positive samples were positive for both N and S1 antigens, a small subset of samples was positive for either N or for S. These samples tend to be low positive or borderline. Of note, since borderline samples cannot be reliably categorized as positive or negative, we chose to drop borderline results from subsequent calculations for sensitivity and specificity of the assays in this study.
