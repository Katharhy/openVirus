<p id="p0100">This serologic validation was limited by host related variability in antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the timing of specimen collection likely influencing assay performance, and the limited number of non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus PCR positive samples. It is also likely that sensitivity of these assays may be different in a clinical setting with non-recovered patients during the acute phase of infection.</p>
