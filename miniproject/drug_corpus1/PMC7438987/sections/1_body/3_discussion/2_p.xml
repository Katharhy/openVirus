<p id="p0085">Given the diversity among serological methods used in SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing assays, a careful evaluation of these assays prior to implementation is warranted. Being one of the first facilities in the United States to collect CCP enabled us to have a relatively large donor sample set to compare two ELISA-based assays that used different SARS-CoV-2 antigenic targets and had received regulatory approval either by European Union standards or the FDA. Our study design, employing pre-pandemic specimens and SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative samples that were PCR-confirmed for other seasonal coronaviruses (e.g.; NL63, OC43, 229E, and HKU1) provides an ideal assessment of assay specificity and allows for confidence in the lack of significant cross-reactivity observed. Further, using a larger dataset of samples collected from SARS-CoV-2 -PCR-positive individuals and 2019 pre-pandemic serum enabled us to further examine the manufacturers' claims of sensitivity and specificity of these assays for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.</p>
