Eligibility criteria for CCP donors includes documentation of evidence of COVID-19 either by viral RNA detection at the time of illness or positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG after recovery if diagnostic testing for COVID-19 was not performed at the time of illness. In addition to analysis of CCP, analysis of SARS-CoV-2 IgG provides information for possible past exposure and may support diagnosis when SARS-CoV-2 PCR is negative and clinical suspicion for COVID-19 is high. Furthermore, assays with high sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 IgG are critical for understanding community exposure rates to SARS-CoV-2. Currently, there are several assays that test for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using a variety of methods, including point-of-care lateral flow-based devices, high throughput immunoassay analyzers, and manual methods such as ELISA. These assays target a number of SARS-CoV-2 antigens, including the nucleocapsid protein (N), full length spike protein (S), S1 subunit, or receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein. Given the heterogeneity among methods for, and antigenic targets used in SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays, it is necessary for careful evaluation of these assays prior to implementation for clinical use. We compared two assays that had received the CE mark of regulatory approval and that used either the N antigen or S1-RBD antigen as the target for analysis of a large set of CCP samples. Our data indicates that sensitivity and specificity vary between these assays and that more than one antigenic target may be required to improve the sensitivity and specificity of IgG detection to SARS-CoV-2.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>COVID-19, Coronavirus Disease 2019</kwd><kwd>CCP, COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma</kwd><kwd>SARS2-CoV-2, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2</kwd><kwd>FDA, Food and Drug Administration</kwd><kwd>ELISA, Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay</kwd><kwd>TMB, Tetramethyl Benzideine</kwd><kwd>OD, Optical Density</kwd><kwd>ROC, Receiver Operating Characteristic</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0005">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the RNA virus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread worldwide since its discovery in December 2019.

(<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2020</xref>) Early in the pandemic, our facility established a collection program for the experimental COVID-19 intravenous therapy known as COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma (CCP), which is derived from individuals who have recovered from COVID-19. Plasma antibodies from a recovered COVID-19 patient might shorten illness duration, reduce morbidity, and potentially prevent death when administered to a COVID-19 patient with active infection. (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Duan et al., 2020</xref>) In addition, convalescent plasma has been used in previous viral epidemics such as those caused by SARS-CoV-1, Ebola, and Influenza A virus type H1N1.

The fundamental eligibility requirement is a confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or serology test, with the most recent guidance mandating at least 14-days of COVID-19 recovery prior to donation. (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2020</xref>) Aside from assisting in eligibility determination, serological testing informs CCP donor management decisions related to continual eligibility as detectable antibody in donors would be of benefit to potential recipients. In addition to the analysis of CCP, SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing provides information related to past exposure that would be useful in epidemiological studies to understand disease seroprevalence as well as confirm vaccine response during clinical trials. In the patient care setting, as with many antibody tests for infectious disease, SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing is not used for primary diagnosis. However, it may serve to support diagnosis in SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative cases if the patients' viral loads are below the limit of detection in PCR testing, but there is a high clinical suspicion for COVID-19.</p><p id="p0015">SARS-CoV-2 antibody analysis is evolving at a rapid pace with several assays coming to market, some having received CE-mark (European Economic Area) approval, and a few, more recently, having received FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).

Currently, there are a number of methodologies including ELISA, automated immunoassay, and lateral flow-based point of care devices. These assays generally target one of the virus's four main structural proteins including the spike (S), small envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) glycoproteins.

Being one of the first facilities in the United States to collect CCP enabled us to have a relatively large donor sample set to compare two ELISA-based assays that used different SARS-CoV-2 antigenic targets and had received regulatory approval either by European Union standards or the FDA. Our study design, employing pre-pandemic specimens and SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative samples that were PCR-confirmed for other seasonal coronaviruses (e.g.; NL63, OC43, 229E, and HKU1) provides an ideal assessment of assay specificity and allows for confidence in the lack of significant cross-reactivity observed. Further, using a larger dataset of samples collected from SARS-CoV-2 -PCR-positive individuals and 2019 pre-pandemic serum enabled us to further examine the manufacturers' claims of sensitivity and specificity of these assays for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.</p><p id="p0090">As seen in <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, both assays performed similarly with SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive samples with over 93% positive result agreement. Interestingly, samples that were discrepant between the two assays tested either borderline- or low-positive in one of the assays and negative in the other. While the majority of moderately to strongly positive samples were positive for both N and S1 antigens, a small subset of samples was positive for either N or for S. These samples tend to be low positive or borderline. Of note, since borderline samples cannot be reliably categorized as positive or negative, we chose to drop borderline results from subsequent calculations for sensitivity and specificity of the assays in this study.</p><p id="p0095">Our data show that the EDI assay has higher specificity (99%) at the manufacturer defined cutoff compared to the specificity of the Euroimmun assay (96.8%). However, EDI displayed a lower sensitivity, as it missed low-positive or borderline antibody responses that were detected in the Euroimmun assay. These findings suggest that the performance characteristics of a SARS-CoV-2 antibody assay may depend on specific antigen used, and may therefore influence the context in which the assay is used &#x02013; for example, when used for community surveillance, an assay with lower sensitivity may lead to under-representation of seroconversion rates in population studies.</p><p id="p0100">This serologic validation was limited by host related variability in antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the timing of specimen collection likely influencing assay performance, and the limited number of non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus PCR positive samples. It is also likely that sensitivity of these assays may be different in a clinical setting with non-recovered patients during the acute phase of infection.</p></sec><sec id="s0055"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0105">Based on our comparison findings, a combination of two or more antigenic targets may be required to achieve greater sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection. In our study, when positive and negative results from both assays were combined, sensitivity for a positive result in SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive samples increased to 93.2%; however, specificity dropped to 96.0%. Therefore, this approach must be balanced with maintaining high specificity, as false-positives may be erroneously interpreted as possible protective immunity, despite lack of evidence that such positive results are protective and may lead to potential neglect of personal safety measures against SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Additionally, a false-positive result could lead to a patient receiving treatment with convalescent plasma that is ineffective. Regardless of adequate analytical performance among assays, the interpretation of serological findings remains a challenge with knowledge in this arena evolving as this pandemic continues. While samples from initial donations were used in this study, many of our CCP donor cohort have donated multiple times. This will allow for future information on duration of antibody presence in this population.</p></sec><sec id="s0060"><title>Financial support</title><p id="p0110">The Departments of Pediatrics and Pathology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, and Children's Hospital Colorado.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of Competing Interest</title><p id="p0115">All authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bi0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bb0005"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ahmed</surname><given-names>S.F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Quadeer</surname><given-names>A.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Mckay</surname><given-names>M.R.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Preliminary identification of potential vaccine targets for the COVID-19 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) based on SARS-CoV immunological studies</article-title><source>Viruses.</source><year>2020</year><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3390/v12030254</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0010"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0010"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Soo</surname><given-names>Y.O.Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>W.S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>C.K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ng</surname><given-names>M.H.L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Chan</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>K.C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Leung</surname><given-names>C.B.</given-names></name><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Use of convalescent plasma therapy in SARS patients in Hong Kong</article-title><source>Eur.
