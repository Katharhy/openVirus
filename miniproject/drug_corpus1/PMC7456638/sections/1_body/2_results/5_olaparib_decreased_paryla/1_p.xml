<p id="Par22">To explore the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of olaparib against IAV-induced injury to murine lungs, western blot was performed to detect the PARPs, the marker of apoptosis. IAV infection increased the PARylated protein content in lung homogenate samples compared with the control group, while PARP inhibitor olaparib significantly reduced the PARylated protein content in IAV-infected samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a and c</xref>). NF-κB genes are reported to be the targets of olaparib in the context of LPS stimulation to the lungs [

 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b, d, and e</xref>, IAV remarkably elevated the p-p65 and p-IκBα protein expression in lung homogenates compared with those of the control group, while olaparib obviously decreased the abnormal increase of the two proteins, suggesting that olaparib inhibits the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway in the condition of IAV infection. And there were no significant differences of the total expressions of p65 and IkBa among different groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>).
