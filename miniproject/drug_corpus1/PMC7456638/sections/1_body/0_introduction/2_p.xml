<p id="Par3">Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) family is composed of 18 members which are involved in the bioprocesses, including DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, transcription, and so on [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Abnormal expression of PARPs is correlated with necrotic cell death, cancer, and some inflammatory disorders [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. PARP-1 activation has been regarded as one of the critic mechanisms underlying lung inflammation in the context of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and elastase stimulations experimentally [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Evidences indicated the abnormal increased expression of PARP-1 in non-pulmonary cells, alveolar epithelial cells, and lung tissue after IAV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], suggesting its potential as the target for the treatment of IAV infection. One of the PARP inhibitors, olaparib, is reported to ameliorate acute lung injury induced by elastase and LPS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Yet the role of olaparib on IAV-induced lung injury has rarely been reported. This study aimed to explore the effects of PARP inhibition by olaparib on IAV infection.
