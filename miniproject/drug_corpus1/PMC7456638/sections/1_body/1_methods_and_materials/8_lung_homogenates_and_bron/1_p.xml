<p id="Par12">At day 6 post-infection, lung homogenates and BALF were sampled from different groups of mice. For lung homogenates, the lungs were dissected and homogenized in ice-cold RIPA lysis (Sigma) supplemented with protease inhibitor (Sigma) on ice for 2 h. After 4 °C centrifugations at 4000 g for 20 min, supernatants were collected and stored at − 80 °C for further biochemical analysis, including myeloperoxidase (MPO), cytokines, and targeted protein levels. Total protein content of lung homogenates was determined using a BCA assay kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). For BALF sampling, bronchoalveolar lavage was conducted according to previously described by Yashiro M et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Briefly, after anesthesia, the left main bronchus was ligated and the right lung was quickly lavaged twice by 1 ml of cold sterile PBS. Then the collected BALF was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was stored at − 80 °C for measurement of cytokine levels.
