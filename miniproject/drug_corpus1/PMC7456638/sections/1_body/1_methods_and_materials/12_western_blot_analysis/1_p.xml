<p id="Par16">The PARylated protein content in the lung tissues was analyzed by western blot. Briefly, − 80 °C stored lung homogenate samples were thawed on ice. For each sample, 25-μg protein was separated through 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), followed by 1-h block in 5% nonfat milk at room temperature. Then the membranes were incubated at 4 °C overnight with primary antibodies against PAR (1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), phospho-p65 (p-p65, 1:2000, Abcam), p65 (1:2000, Abcam), phospho-IκBα (p-IκBα, 1:1500, Abcam), IκBα (1:1500, Abcam), or β-actin (1:2000, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), respectively. After the 2-h incubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Abcam) at room temperature, the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Millipore) was used to detect the proteins of interest in the UVP BioSpectrum Imaging system (BioSpectrum, CA, USA). β-actin served as the inner control.</p>
