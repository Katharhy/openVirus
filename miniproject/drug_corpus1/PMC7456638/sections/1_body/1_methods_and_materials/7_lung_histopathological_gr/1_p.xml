<p id="Par11">At day 6 post-infection, lungs were dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for further histopathological analysis. Paraffin sections in 5-μm thickness were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and examined using a light microscope. The severity of the lung injury was assessed by scoring the H1N1-induced lung histopathological changes using the scoring system previously described [

The scores of 0 to 4 were defined to represent normal, mild, severe, and very severe lung injury, respectively. In concrete, 0 was valued for normal lung, 1 for lower than 25%, 2 for 25–50%, 3 for 50–75%, and 4 for higher than 75% lung involvement, respectively.
