<p id="Par13">MPO activity was assessed by 3,3′,5,5’-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) method according to previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In brief, equal amount of sample (10 μl) was sequentially mixed with 0.75-mM hydrogen peroxide (80 μl), 2.9-mM TMB dissolved in 14.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (110 μl), and 150-mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.4) in a 96-well plate for 5-min incubation at 37 °C. Then 2-M sulfuric acid (Sigma) was added to stop the reaction and absorbance at 450 nm was measured to evaluate MPO activity in each sample. The MPO levels were expressed as pmol MPO per milligram of lung tissue (pmol/mg protein).
