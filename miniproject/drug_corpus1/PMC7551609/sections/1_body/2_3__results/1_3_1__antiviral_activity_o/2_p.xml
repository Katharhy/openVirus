<p>In the MTT assay, OSU-03012 (CC
 <sub>50</sub>-MTT = 6.39 µM) and Obatoclax (CC
 <sub>50</sub>-MTT = 17.57 µM) had the highest toxicity; Antimycin A (CC
 <sub>50</sub>-MTT = 51.28 µM), Azauridine (CC
 <sub>50</sub>-MTT = 155.80 µM), and Mycophenolate mofetil (CC
 <sub>50</sub>-MTT = 166.30 µM) had moderate toxicity; and Azaribine (CC

 <sub>50</sub>-MTT = 237.70 µM) had the lowest toxicity (

 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-01041" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Due to pigment from compounds OSU-03012 and Obatoclax, higher concentration values were excluded because of the misrepresentation with the Vmax Kinetic Microplate Reader that impacted values based on absorbance. Using an MTT assay, we were able to show Azaribine, Pyrazofurin, Mycophenolic acid, AVN-944, and Brequinar had the least toxicity in Vero cells, and the XTT assay showed no toxic effects in all compounds, except OSU-03012 and Obatoclax. Similar results were observed for MTT and XTT at 72 h (
