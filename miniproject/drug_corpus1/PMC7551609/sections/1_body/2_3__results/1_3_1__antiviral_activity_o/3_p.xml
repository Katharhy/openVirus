<p>We next determined the half maximal effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) in post-treatment conditions (cells were infected for 2 h and then treated with the compounds) to evaluate the compounds potency, maximal effective concentrations were also evaluated (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-01041">Table S1</xref>). Compounds potency to inhibit ZIKV multiplication was determined based on the EC
 <sub>50</sub> and selectivity index (SI = CC
 <sub>50</sub>/EC
 <sub>50</sub>) values. Compounds were then categorized as potent, moderate to weak, and weak based on the SI value determined for each independent treatment condition. Inhibitory activity was observed for all ten compounds tested based on SI-MTT and SI-XTT values (
