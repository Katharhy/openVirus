<p>We next evaluated the effect of the ten compounds on production of infectious viral progeny in a growth kinetics inhibition assay (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01041-f004">Figure 4</xref>). A dose-dependent inhibitory effect was observed for Azauridine, Pyrazofurin, Mycophenolate mofetil, Mycophenolic acid, AVN-944, and Brequinar at all time points (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01041-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Likewise, a dose-dependent effect was observed for Antimycin A at 72 h post-treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01041-f004">Figure 4</xref>). A significant effect was observed for Azaribine at 24 h post-treatment and at 10 EC
 <sub>50</sub> at 48 and 72 h post-treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01041-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Complete inhibition was observed at 1 EC
 <sub>50</sub> for OSU-03012 and Obatoclax at all the analyzed times, which may have been caused by the inhibitory effect of the compound or by the toxicity of the compound, and at 10 EC
 <sub>50</sub> for Brequinar at 24 and 48 h post-treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01041-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Consistent with previous findings, complete inhibition was observed at 10 EC
 <sub>50</sub> for ATA (
