<p>Potent co-treatment inhibitory activity was observed for Obatoclax, Azaribine, and Mycophenolate mofetil based on SI-MTT values, while OSU-03012, Azauridine, Pyrazofurin, and Mycophenolic acid showed weak co-treatment inhibitory activity (

 <xref rid="viruses-12-01041-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In co-treatment conditions, Obatoclax, Azaribine, and Mycophenolate mofetil exhibited potent antiviral activity against ZIKV based on MTT and based on XTT Antimycin A, Azaribine and Mycophenolate mofetil were the most potent among all the tested compounds.
