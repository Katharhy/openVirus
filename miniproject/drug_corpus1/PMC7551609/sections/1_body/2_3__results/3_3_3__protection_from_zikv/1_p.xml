<p>Next, we evaluated the ability of the compounds to prevent ZIKV-induced cell death, tissue culture supernatants and cells were harvested at 24, 48, and 72 h post-treatment to measure the activity of Caspase 3 and 7, key proteins in the apoptotic pathway (

 <sub>50</sub>, except for Obatoclax, Azaribine, Antimycin A, and Pyrazofurin (

 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-01041" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. All compounds apart from Obatoclax, Mycophenolic acid, and Antimycin A were able to prevent ZIKV-induced CPE. Similar results were observed with the Caspase 3/7 assay, where low levels were exhibited by all compounds except for Obatoclax, Azaribine, Antimycin A, and Pyrazofurin.
