<p>To further characterize the anti-ZIKV activity of the ten compounds and its translation into a potential treatment for ZIKV infection in humans, we evaluated their antiviral activity and the effects on cell viability (MTT) and proliferation (XTT) in human alveolar A549 cells. Maximal effective concentrations were also evaluated (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-01041">Table S3</xref>). Results from the MTT and XTT assay showed no toxic effects even at the highest concentration used for the all ten compounds (50.00 ÂµM) (

 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-01041" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Potent antiviral activity was observed for Brequinar and AVN-944, based on the SI-MTT and the SI-XTT values (
