<p>We next determined the ability of the compounds to inhibit representative old World (MR-766) and new World (PRVABC59) ZIKV strains to assess whether their antiviral activities were strain independent. Maximal effective concentrations were also evaluated (

In post-treatment conditions, all ten compounds tested exhibited inhibitory effects with the most potent inhibitors of ZIKV old World (MR-766) being Antimycin A, Brequinar, Mycophenolic acid, Mycophenolate mofetil, and AVN-944, based on both the SI-MTT and the SI-XTT values, whereas all other tested compounds were moderate to weak inhibitors (
