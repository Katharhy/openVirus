<p>We identified the compounds as potent, moderate, or weak inhibitors of ZIKV based on their SI value, both MTT and XTT, calculated for each treatment condition, and grouped them based on their mechanism of action. Group A, consisting of Antimycin A, an inhibitor of mitochondrial electron transport chain (mETC) complex III, leading to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [

 <xref rid="B21-viruses-12-01041" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Results from using various conditions revealed Antimycin A to be a moderate inhibitor when used in pre- and co-treatment and a weak inhibitor when used in post-treatment based on SI-MTT; and a potent inhibitor in post- and co-treatment and a moderate inhibitor in pre-treatment based on SI-XTT. Antimycin A was a potent inhibitor and weak inhibitor of MR-766 and PRVABC59 ZIKV strains, respectively, based on both SI-MTT and SI-XTT (

 <xref rid="viruses-12-01041-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). In A549 cells, Antimycin A was identified as a weak inhibitor based on the SI-MTT and SI-XTT (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-01041-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Despite its weak inhibitory effect in post-treatment assays, Antimycin A might still be of value for treatment of ZIKV infection due to its pre- and co-treatment antiviral activity.
