<p>In summary, our results show that the ten tested compounds are effective prophylactic, co-treatment inhibitors, and therapeutic broad-spectrum antiviral candidates, supporting considering their repurposing for the treatment of ZIKV infections. Due to the various mechanism of action exhibited by these compounds, they can be explored in combination therapy. The findings that the compounds inhibited different ZIKV strains, suggest they may be active against newly emerging strains.</p>
