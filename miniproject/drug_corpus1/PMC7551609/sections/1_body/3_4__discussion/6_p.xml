<p>Group E included Brequinar, a known inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). Brequinar has been described to have broad-spectrum antiviral activity against a large number of viruses (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-01041-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B52-viruses-12-01041" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53-viruses-12-01041" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,

 <xref rid="B57-viruses-12-01041" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Brequinar has also been shown to have anti-ZIKV activity in Vero cells infected with ZIKV MR-766 and PRVABC59 (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.08 and 0.08 µM, respectively), and in Vero cells infected with ZIKV MR-766 in pre-treatment conditions (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.3 µM) [

 <xref rid="B56-viruses-12-01041" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In the present work, we identified Brequinar as a potent post-treatment inhibitor based on SI-MTT and SI-XTT (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-01041-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), a moderate pre-treatment inhibitor based on SI-MTT and a weak inhibitor based on SI-XTT (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-01041-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), and a moderate co-treatment inhibitor based on SI-MTT and SI-XTT (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-01041-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Brequinar was also a potent inhibitor of ZIKV MR-766 and PRVABC59 based on SI-MTT and SI-XTT (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-01041-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="viruses-12-01041-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, respectively). Inhibition of ZIKV MR-766 and PRVABC59 by Brequinar in Vero cells exhibited EC
 <sub>50</sub> values similar to those previously reported (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-01041-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="viruses-12-01041-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, respectively) [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-01041" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In A549 cells, Brequinar was identified as a potent inhibitor based on the SI-MTT and SI-XTT (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-01041-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Altogether, Brequinar was identified as a potent post-treatment inhibitor and a potent inhibitor against MR-766 and PRVABC59 strains making it of value for treatment of ZIKV infections.
