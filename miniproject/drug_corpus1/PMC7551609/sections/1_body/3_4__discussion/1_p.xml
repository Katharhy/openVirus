<p>In this study, we investigated the anti-ZIKV activity of ten compounds from the ReFRAME library (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01041-f001">Figure 1</xref>) that have been previously described as potent inhibitors of LCMV [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-01041" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and influenza virus [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-01041" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. These compounds included Antimycin A, which has been identified as a producer of reactive oxygen species (ROS); Azauridine, Azaribine, Pyrazofurin, Mycophenolate mofetil, Mycophenolic acid, AVN-944, and Brequinar identified to inhibit nucleoside biosynthesis; and Obatoclax and OSU-0312 identified to inhibit endosomal fusion. All compounds, except Obatoclax and Mycophenolic acid, exhibited antiviral activity against ZIKV infection in Vero and A549 cells that was unrelated to compound induced cell toxicity. Results from post-treatment conditions demonstrated values for SI-MTT ranging from 0.76 to 78.16 and SI-XTT ranging from 54.00 to 2142.86; pre-treatment conditions showed values ranging from 0.86 to 136.92 SI-MTT and 4.31 to 1451.61 SI-XTT; co-treatment conditions revealed SI-MTT values ranging from 1.19 to 780.34 and SI-XTT values ranging from 10.36 to 1655.17. We observed similar results when the compounds were tested against old and new World ZIKV strains, as well as in human A549 cells, supporting the repurposing of these compounds as broad-spectrum antivirals.
