<p>Group D included Mycophenolate mofetil, Mycophenolic acid, and AVN-944, known inhibitors of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), a key enzyme in the de novo synthesis of purines. Inhibition of IMPDH can deplete guanine nucleotide pools, followed by a decrease in DNA and RNA synthesis [

It is currently approved for the prevention of acute renal allograft rejection and it has been shown to be effective in the treatment of refractory rejection in renal, heart, and liver transplant recipients, and may have efficacy in the treatment of chronic rejection as well [
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-12-01041" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It has been also shown to have antiviral activity against various viruses (

 <xref rid="viruses-12-01041-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Mycophenolic acid depletes guanosine nucleotides in T and B lymphocytes and inhibits their proliferation, thereby suppressing cell-mediated immune responses and antibody formation. It also inhibits the glycosylation and expression of adhesion molecules, and the recruitment of lymphocytes and monocytes into sites of inflammation [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-01041" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Mycophenolic acid is commonly used for the prevention of rejection in kidney and liver transplantation and has been shown to inhibit flavivirus infection in mammalian cells by preventing the synthesis and accumulation of viral RNA, to suppress DENV2 infection in mosquito midguts and dissemination to salivary glands when administered through a blood or sugar meal, and to inhibit ZIKV infection in both mosquito cells and adults [

Overall, Mycophenolate mofetil was identified as a potent co-treatment inhibitor and against MR-766 and PRVABC59 ZIKV strains making it of value for treatment of ZIKV infections. Although it was not identified as a potent inhibitor in any condition, Mycophenolic acid has the ability to inhibit replication of multiple ZIKV strains. AVN-944 was identified as a potent post- and pre-treatment inhibitor, and a potent inhibitor against MR-766 and PRVABC59 strains making it of value for treatment of ZIKV infections.
