Aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA; Sigma-Aldrich, Catalog No. A1895, St. Louis, MO, USA) was prepared at 100 mM stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and was used as a positive control in these assays [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-01041" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. All compound stocks were kept at −20 °C until experimental use. Each drug was diluted in DMEM media supplemented with 5% FBS and 1% PSG for cell viability assays and in infectious DMEM media supplemented with 2% FBS and 1% PSG for viral inhibition assays, where the maximum DMSO concentration was 0.1%. Media containing 0.1% DMSO was included in each of the experiments as vehicle control.
