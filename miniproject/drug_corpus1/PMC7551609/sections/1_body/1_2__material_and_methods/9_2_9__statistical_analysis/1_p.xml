<p>Data analysis was conducted using Prism software version 8.2.1 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA, Version 8.2.1). The CC
 <sub>50</sub> and EC
 <sub>50</sub> were calculated using sigmoidal dose–response curves (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA, Version 8.2.1), and the selective index (SI) of each compound was evaluated by dividing the CC
 <sub>50</sub> with the EC
 <sub>50</sub>. The unpaired Student’s t-test was used to evaluate significant differences. Data of three independent experiments in triplicates or quadruplicates are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) using Microsoft Excel software. Values were considered statistically significant when *

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, *** 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; or no significance (n.s.).
