<p>Confluent monolayers (24-well plate format, 2.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well, triplicates) of Vero cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 for 2 h at 37 °C with ZIKV Paraiba/2015 diluted in infection media. After viral absorption, cells were incubated with infection media containing the indicated concentrations (0.1, 1, and 10 EC
 <sub>50</sub>) of each compound, or 0.1% DMSO vehicle control (No drug). At 24, 48, and 72 h post-treatment tissue culture supernatants were collected and titrated on Vero cells by immunostaining (PFU/mL) [
