<p>Vero cell viabilities were determined using MTT (CellTiter 96 Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation assay, Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and cell proliferation were determined using XTT (Cell Viability and Proliferation, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) assays, following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, confluent monolayers of Vero cells (96-well plate format, 5.0 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well, quadruplicates) were treated with 100 µL of DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS and 1% PSG containing serially diluted (3-fold dilutions, starting concentration of 1350 µM) compounds or 0.1% DMSO (vehicle control). Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 36 h and treated with either 15 µL of Dye Solution for the MTT assay or 50 µL of XTT labeling reagent for the XTT assay at 37 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere for 4 h. MTT assay plates were then treated with 100 µL of Stop Solution and stored in a dark space overnight. Next, cell absorbance of MTT and XTT assays were measured at 570 nm using a Vmax Kinetic Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Waltham, MA, USA). Viability of compound-treated cells was calculated as a percentage relative to values obtained with DMSO vehicle-treated cells. Non-linear regression curves and the median cytotoxic concentration (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) were calculated using GraphPad Prism software version 8.2.1.
