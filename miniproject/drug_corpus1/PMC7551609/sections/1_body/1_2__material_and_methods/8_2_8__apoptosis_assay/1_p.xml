<p>Apoptosis levels were measured using the Caspase Glo 3/7 assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), following the manufacturers specifications. Briefly, confluent monolayers of Vero cells (24-well plate format, 2.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well, triplicates) were mock-infected or infected (MOI 0.1) with the indicated viruses. After 2 h of virus absorption at 37 °C, the viral inoculum was removed and 500 µL of fresh viral post-infection media containing drugs at the indicated concentrations (0.1, 1, and 10 EC
 <sub>50</sub>) of each compound, or 0.1% DMSO vehicle control (No drug) were added. Post-infection media in the absence of drug was used as internal control in this assay. At 24, 48, and 72 h post-treatment, cells were harvested in the tissue culture supernatants and frozen at −80 °C until analysis. Cells lysates were incubated 1:1 with the Caspase-Glo 3/7 substrate in a 96-well plate in the dark for 1 h at room temperature, and luminescence at 570 nm was measured using a SpectraMax iD5 (Molecular Devices, Waltham, MA, USA) following manufacturer’s instructions.
