<p>Results suggest that repurposing the ten tested compounds and implementing them for the treatment of ZIKV infection would be an efficient approach towards the development of anti-ZIKV treatment options. Future in vivo, pharmacological, and toxicological studies need to be done to demonstrate the feasibility for their use in humans. Host-directed antivirals make drug repurposing and usage feasible as viruses mutate and evolve, contributing to the likelihood of developing resistance against treatments directed against the virus. The results from the ten tested ReFRAME compounds confirm the feasibility of using these broad-spectrum antivirals for treatment of ZIKV infection based on their strain independent capabilities and the results from multiple conditions tested.</p>
