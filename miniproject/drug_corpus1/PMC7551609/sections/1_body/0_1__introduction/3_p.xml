<p>The process of discovery and implementation of antivirals is an extensive and complex process, which requires extensive testing for safety and efficacy. Drug repurposing offers several advantages over developing an entirely new drug for a given indication, as drug repurposing can drastically reduce the timeline and resources required to advance a candidate antiviral into the clinic. The Repurposing, Focused Rescue and Accelerated Medchem (ReFRAME) collection is comprised of about 12,000 compounds [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-01041" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Our screen of the ReFRAME library identified ten compounds with activity against the mammarenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCMV) [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-01041" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The identified compounds included inhibitors of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis (Antimycin A), inhibitors of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) that is a key enzyme of the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway (Brequinar), inhibitors of orotidine monophosphate decarboxylase (OMPD) which catalyzes key steps in pyrimidine synthesis (Azauridine, Azaribine, and Pyrazofurin), inhibitors of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) which inhibit replication of RNA and DNA via GTP reduction (AVN-944, Mycophenolic acid, and Mycophenolate mofetil), and regulators of apoptosis (OSU-03012 and Obatoclax). We have shown that these compounds with antiviral activity against LCMV, also had inhibitory activities against influenza A and B viruses [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-01041" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], identifying these compounds as broad-spectrum antiviral candidates, which led us to examine their ability to inhibit ZIKV infection. The ten tested compounds had effective prophylactic and therapeutic activities against divergent strains of the African and Asian/American ZIKV lineages, further supporting their broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Our results suggest the feasibility of repurposing these compounds for the treatment of ZIKV infection.
