<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne arbovirus transmitted by the mosquito species 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-01041" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. ZIKV is a member of the genus Flavivirus within the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, closely related to Yellow Fever and Dengue viruses (YFV and DENV, respectively), West Nile virus (WNV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-01041" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The ZIKV genome is comprised of a 10.8 kb single-stranded positive-sense RNA molecule that contains a 5′ and 3′ untranslated region (UTR) and a single open reading frame (ORF). The ORF encodes for a large polyprotein that is co- and post-translationally cleaved into three structural (capsid, C; pre-membrane, prM; and envelope, E) and seven nonstructural (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) proteins [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-12-01041" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. ZIKV was first discovered in 1947 in the Zika forest of Uganda during a YFV investigation, and a second virus isolation came from 
 <italic>Aedes africanus</italic> in 1948 [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-12-01041" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. After its discovery, ZIKV infections were only sporadically reported in Asia and Africa until 2007 [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-12-01041" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], when an outbreak of ZIKV occurred on Yap island, in the Federated States of Micronesia, where about 73% of the residents on the island were infected [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-01041" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In 2013, an outbreak of ZIKV occurred in French Polynesia, where 88% of infected patients reported symptomatic infections, including the development of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-01041" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In 2015, local transmission of ZIKV was reported in Latin America and the Caribbean, where ZIKV outbreaks were associated with congenital microcephaly through maternal infection, and a large increase in the number of Guillain-Barré syndrome cases [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-01041" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. By May 2019, ZIKV was spread to over 84 countries and is now a global health problem [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-12-01041" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. There is an urgent medical need for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic intervention strategies to control ZIKV infections due to its potential for re-emergence [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-01041" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, to date, there are currently no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccines (prophylactic) and/or antivirals (therapeutic) for the treatment of ZIKV infection.
