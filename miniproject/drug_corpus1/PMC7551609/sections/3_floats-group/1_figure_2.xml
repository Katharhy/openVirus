  <p>Cytotoxicity of the ten tested compounds: Vero cells (96-well plate format, 5 × 10
   <sup>4</sup> cells/well, quadruplicates) were incubated with DMEM 5% FBS containing the indicated doses of the inhibitors (3-fold serial dilutions, starting concentration of 1350 µM) (
   <bold>A</bold>) Antimycin A, (
   <bold>B</bold>) OSU-03012 and Obatoclax, (
   <bold>C</bold>) Azaribine, Azauridine, and Pyrazofurin, (
   <bold>D</bold>) Mycophenolate mofetil, Mycophenolic acid, and AVN-944, (
   <bold>E</bold>) Brequinar, and (
   <bold>F</bold>) Aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA). Cell viability assays (MTT and XTT) were performed at 36 h post-treatment and the CC
   <sub>50</sub> for each compound was calculated. Dotted line indicates the 50% toxicity of each of the compounds. Data were expressed as mean and SD from three independent experiments conducted in quadruplicates.
