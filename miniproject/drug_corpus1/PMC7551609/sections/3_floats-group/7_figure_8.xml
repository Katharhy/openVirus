  <p>Inhibition of African (MR-766) and Asian/American (PRVABC59) prototype ZIKV strains: Vero cells (96-well plates, 5 × 10
   <sup>4</sup> cells/well, quadruplicates) were infected with 25 PFU of MR-766, and 50 PFU of PRVABC59 ZIKV strains. After 2 h viral absorption, the indicated concentrations of compounds (3-folds dilutions, starting concentration 100 µM) (
   <bold>A</bold>) Antimycin A, (
   <bold>B</bold>) OSU-03012 and Obatoclax, (
   <bold>C</bold>) Azaribine, Azauridine, and Pyrazofurin, (
   <bold>D</bold>) Mycophenolate mofetil, Mycophenolic acid, and AVN-944, (
   <bold>E</bold>) Brequinar, and (
   <bold>F</bold>) Aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) were added to post-infection media. Infected cells were fixed for virus titration by immunostaining assay at 36 h (MR-766) or 48 h (PRVABC59) post-treatment. Dotted line indicates 50% inhibition. Data were expressed as mean and SD from three independent experiments conducted in quadruplicates.
