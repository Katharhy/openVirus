  <p>Inhibition of ZIKV Paraiba/2015 with the compounds (co-treatment): ZIKV Paraiba/2015 (25 PFU/well) were pre-incubated in infection media (DMEM 2% FBS) containing the indicated concentrations of the compounds (3-folds dilutions, starting concentration 100 µM) (
   <bold>A</bold>) Antimycin A, (
   <bold>B</bold>) OSU-03012 and Obatoclax, (
   <bold>C</bold>) Azaribine, Azauridine, and Pyrazofurin, (
   <bold>D</bold>) Mycophenolate mofetil, Mycophenolic acid, and AVN-944, (
   <bold>E</bold>) Brequinar, and (
   <bold>F</bold>) Aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) for 1 h. Vero cells (96-well plates, 5 × 10
   <sup>4</sup> cells/well; quadruplicates) were then infected with the virus-compound mixtures and after 2 h viral absorption, media was replaced by post-infection media. At 36 h post-infection, the cells were fixed and immunoassayed with the anti-E 4G2 mAb. Plaques were counted with an automated ELISPOT reader. Dotted line indicates 50% inhibition. Data were expressed as mean and SD from three independent experiments conducted in quadruplicates.
