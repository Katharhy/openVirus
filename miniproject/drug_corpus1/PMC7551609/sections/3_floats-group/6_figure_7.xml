  <p>Prevention of apoptosis-induced cell death: Vero cells (24-well plate format, 2.5 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> cells/well, triplicates) were infected (MOI 0.1) with Paraiba/2015. After 2 h viral absorption, infected cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of compounds (0, 0.1, 1, and 10 EC
   <sub>50</sub>) (
   <bold>A</bold>) Antimycin A, (
   <bold>B</bold>) OSU-03012 and Obatoclax, (
   <bold>C</bold>) Azaribine, Azauridine, and Pyrazofurin, (
   <bold>D</bold>) Mycophenolate mofetil, Mycophenolic acid, and AVN-944, (
   <bold>E</bold>) Brequinar, and (
   <bold>F</bold>) Aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA); and Caspase 3/7 levels were measured at 24, 48, and 72 h post-treatment. Data of each time point was compared to mock-infected control cells and expressed as mean of relative percentage and SD from three independent experiments conducted in triplicates. Statistical analysis was conducted by an unpaired Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test, * 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, ** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, ***
