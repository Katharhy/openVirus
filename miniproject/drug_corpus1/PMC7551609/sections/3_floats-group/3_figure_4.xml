  <p>Growth kinetics inhibition of ZIKV Paraiba/2015: Vero cells (24-well plate format, 2.5 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> cells/well, triplicates) were infected (MOI 0.1) with Paraiba/2015. After 2 h viral absorption, cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of compounds (0, 0.1, 1, and 10 EC
   <sub>50</sub>) (
   <bold>A</bold>) Antimycin A, (
   <bold>B</bold>) OSU-03012 and Obatoclax, (
   <bold>C</bold>) Azaribine, Azauridine, and Pyrazofurin, (
   <bold>D</bold>) Mycophenolate mofetil, Mycophenolic acid, and AVN-944, (
   <bold>E</bold>) Brequinar, and (
   <bold>F</bold>) Aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA); or 0.1% DMSO vehicle control (No drug) in infection media (DMEM 2% FBS). Tissue culture supernatants were collected at 24, 48, and 72 h post-treatment, and viral titers were calculated by immunostaining using the anti-E 4G2 mAb. Dotted line indicates the limit of detection (10 PFU). Data were expressed as mean and SD from three independent experiments conducted in triplicates. Statistical analysis was conducted by an unpaired Student’s t-test, *
