  <p>Inhibition of ZIKV replication in A549 cells: Human A549 cells in 96-well plate (5 × 10
   <sup>4</sup> cells/well; quadruplicates) were infected (25 PFU/well) with Paraiba/2015. After 2 h viral absorption, post-infection media (DMEM 2% FBS) containing the indicated doses of the compounds (3-folds dilutions, starting concentration 100 µM) (
   <bold>A</bold>) Antimycin A, (
   <bold>B</bold>) OSU-03012 and Obatoclax, (
   <bold>C</bold>) Azaribine, Azauridine, and Pyrazofurin, (
   <bold>D</bold>) Mycophenolate mofetil, Mycophenolic acid, and AVN-944, (
   <bold>E</bold>) Brequinar, and (
   <bold>F</bold>) Aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) were added. At 36 h post-treatment, infected cells were fixed and immunostained with the anti-E 4G2 mAb. Plaques were counted with an automated ELISPOT reader. Dotted line indicates 50% inhibition. Data were expressed as mean and SD from three independent experiments conducted in quadruplicates.
