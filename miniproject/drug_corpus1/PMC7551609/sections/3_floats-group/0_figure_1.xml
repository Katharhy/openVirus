  <p>Chemical structure of the compounds: Groups of compounds include (
   <bold>A</bold>) inhibitors of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis (Antimycin A), (
   <bold>B</bold>) apoptosis inducers (OSU-03012 and Obatoclax), (
   <bold>C</bold>) inhibitors of orotidine monophosphate decarboxylase (OMPD), which catalyzes key steps in pyrimidine synthesis (Azaribine, Azauridine, and Pyrazofurin), (
   <bold>D</bold>) inhibitors of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) that inhibit replication of RNA and DNA via GTP reduction (Mycophenolate mofetil, Mycophenolic acid, and AVN-944), (
   <bold>E</bold>) inhibitors of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) that is a key enzyme of the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway (Brequinar). (
   <bold>F</bold>) The JAK2 and STAT5 activator Aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) was used as a positive control since it has been previously shown to have antiviral activity against ZIKV.
