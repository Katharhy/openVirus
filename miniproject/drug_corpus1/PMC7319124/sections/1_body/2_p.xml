<p>A successful HIV response requires a shift from portraying men as the “problem” to acknowledging that, like women, men are vulnerable to HIV infection due to individual, social and structural drivers. We recently undertook a study in a peri‐urban region of KwaZulu‐Natal province of South Africa, an area where high levels of poverty, unemployment and alcohol consumption co‐exist alongside high HIV prevalence rates. A total of 6993 men participated in male‐focused community‐based HIV and non‐communicable diseases screening from August 2017 to June 2019. In contrast to widely cited generalizations about men’s poorer health‐seeking behaviour, we found that men were concerned about their own and their families’ health.
