 <xref rid="jia225510-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>]. When programmes have included heterosexual men, whether intentional or not, they have frequently been depicted as the 
 <italic>problem</italic> (i.e. transmitting HIV), and the health outcomes of women and children have been prioritized [
 <xref rid="jia225510-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>]. Consequently, the health needs of men in SSA and generally across the world have been largely ignored [

There are two compelling reasons why the health and HIV risks of heterosexual men should be addressed urgently: like women, men have the right to health; and to reach the ambitious UNAIDS targets of 90:90:90, we need a response that is based on public health and gender inclusiveness rather than gender bias. Given men’s higher AIDS‐related morbidity and mortality in the context of a limited focus on men, HIV‐positive men represent a new vulnerable population in the AIDS epidemics of sub‐Saharan Africa [
 <xref rid="jia225510-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>]. The exclusion of heterosexual men from targeted HIV prevention, testing and treatment strategies constrains the ability of HIV‐positive men to manage the risks associated with their health and increases the gender gap in HIV survival [
