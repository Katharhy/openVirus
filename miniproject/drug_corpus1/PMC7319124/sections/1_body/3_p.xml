<p>Our work confirms that men, like women, are not a homogenous group.

Thus, like women, men are vulnerable to HIV infection due to individual, social and structural drivers, which function in tandem with risky sexual behaviours to increase their risk of HIV infection. Despite these challenges, these men belong to families; they are partners and they are fathers. They can survive and thrive when they live in families and communities that are supportive, caring, loving and resilient.
