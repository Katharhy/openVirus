<p>The landmark IAS Forum on Men and HIV prior to the 10th IAS Conference in Mexico represented a turning point in challenging the prevailing discourse on men. Building on the momentum created by the Forum, it is time to reframe the approach to heterosexual men in the HIV epidemic. Men and women should not be seen as competing populations. Like women, men have the right to health, HIV care and treatment, and their poorer access to HIV care cannot be reduced to individual behaviour. HIV interventions for both men and women must be guided by evidence. We need to watch our language: no more “men as a problem” or “men as the vectors”. HIV interventions should improve heterosexual men’s health for their own sake, not only to improve outcomes for women and children. Future HIV/AIDS conferences must include heterosexual men as a vulnerable population. In getting the frame right in the way we view men, we have the chance to address the biggest gap in the response to HIV in SSA.</p>
