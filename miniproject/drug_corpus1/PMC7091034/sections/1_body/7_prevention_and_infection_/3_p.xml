<p id="Par29">Routine chemoprophylaxis to contacts should be avoided, except to control an institutional outbreak, because of concerns of sub therapeutic dosing of the antiviral in case the infection is established. Chemoprophylaxis is best offered to children above 3 mo or adults who have high risk of complications from influenza or in those in whom influenza vaccination is either contraindicated, not available or may not be effective. Post-exposure chemoprophylaxis is not recommended after 48Â h of first exposure to a person with influenza. Either oral Oseltamivir (for above 3 mo of age) or inhaled Zanamivir (for above 7 y of age) is recommended for chemoprophylaxis when indicated. Early initiation of empiric treatment for contacts on development of fever or respiratory symptoms is an alternative to post-exposure chemoprophylaxis [
