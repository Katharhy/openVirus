<p id="Par14">Primary viral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary edema occur due to bronchiolar and alveolar cytopathology and cytokine storm. Secondary bacterial pneumonia post-influenza usually occurs during resolution, however 32% of patients with viral pneumonia can develop a concomitant bacterial pneumonia which is clinically challenging to distinguish [

 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> is the commonest causative organism of secondary bacterial pneumonia in children. The viral-bacterial synergism is not clearly understood but the damaged respiratory epithelial lining with facilitation of access to the receptors, viral suppression of the neutrophil functions and even direct interaction between the virus on the surface of gram positive bacteria like 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> have been proposed as possible mechanisms [
