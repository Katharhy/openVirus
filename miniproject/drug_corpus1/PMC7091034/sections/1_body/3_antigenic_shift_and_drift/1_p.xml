<p id="Par11">The HA glycoprotein is constantly evolving and the minor antigenic changes occur through accumulation of spontaneous point mutations to form antigenically distinguishable strains with very limited cross-sectional genetic diversity. This phenomenon is referred to as antigenic drift and occurs in Influenza A, B and C viruses. When a sudden genetic reassortment takes place with a creation and introduction of a novel HA, NA or both segments from a zoonotoic reservoir into the currently circulating human viruses, it is called as an antigenic shift. This phenomenon occurs only in Influenza A. For 
 <italic>example</italic> antigenic shift took place with swine H1N1 in 1918 then later to H2N2 in 1957 and to H3N2 in 1968 with re-introduction and co-circulation of H1N1 since 1977 [
