<p>Given the significant clinical utility of AZM as an antibiotic, the current rapid spread of antimicrobial resistance is of particular concern. Widespread use of AZM to treat viral infections runs an inevitable risk of increasing the development of drug‐resistant bacteria, and indeed there are good data that increasing rates of macrolide resistance in 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> in the United States correlated closely with global sales of AZM, while in some regions such as China resistance rates approach 90% for 
 <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic> and nearly 100% for 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>.

 </xref> Resistance is a particularly high risk with macrolides due to several features including their long half‐life, the widespread use of the drug, and the high‐level macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin (MLS
 <sub>B</sub>) resistance phenotype attributable to mutations in the 
 <italic>erm</italic> gene and which are frequently associated with resistance to other classes of antibiotics on the same mobile genetic elements.
