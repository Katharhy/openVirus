<p>Beyond its anti‐viral properties, the anti‐inflammatory effects of AZM may be clinically important in treating the cytokine storm which is a prominent feature of influenza A and of COVID‐19. An exuberant production of pro‐inflammatory cytokines including TNF, IL 1β, IL‐6, G‐CSF and IP‐10 are significantly increased in COVID‐19 disease,
