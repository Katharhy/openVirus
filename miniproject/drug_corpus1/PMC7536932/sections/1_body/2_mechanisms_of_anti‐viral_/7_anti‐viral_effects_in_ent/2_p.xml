<p>Enterovirus A71 (EV‐A71) causes hand, foot and mouth disease in young children. AZM and spiramycin (another macrolide) provided significant in vivo protection against EV‐A71 infection in mice.

 </xref> Spiramycin impaired EV‐A71 viral RNA synthesis, and it is likely spiramycin and AZM work through a common mechanism, after viral entry, impairing viral RNA synthesis either directly or indirectly.
