<p>Some murine studies have investigated macrolides in vivo. Erythromycin improved survival during severe H2N2 infection,

Other macrolides leucomycin A3, spiramycin and a non‐antibacterial erythromycin derivative (EM900) each reduced weight loss, improved survival and reduced viral protein expression in H1N1 influenza.

Another study found AZM reduced lung viral titres at day 6 post infection, though the effects were not additive to that achieved with oseltamivir in terms of survival, viral titres or cytokine levels,
