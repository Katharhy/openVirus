 </xref> Likewise clarithromycin reduced viral titres and supernatant cytokines on cultured human tracheal epithelial cells, associated with reduction in surface expression of the influenza A receptor Sα2, 6Gal, inhibition of NFκB and reduced acidification of the endosome required for intracellular release of viral RNA.
