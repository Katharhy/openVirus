<p>Since the outbreak of the current SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic, several drug screens have investigated potential candidate drugs against this virus. A screen of 1520 approved and off‐patent drugs identified 90 drugs which inhibited SARS‐CoV‐2 viral replication at 10 μM.

 </xref> These included ATPase proton pump inhibitors, protease inhibitors, viral protease inhibitors, drugs targeting the angiotensin pathway and AZM. AZM had an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 2.12 μM and EC
 <sub>90</sub> 8.65, and selectivity index &gt;19, which is very comparable to the control compound remdesivir (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.65, EC
 <sub>90</sub> = 2.52), the only anti‐viral with proven clinical efficacy against SARS‐CoV‐2 in clinical trials to date.

 </xref> A focussed study on two candidate molecules, hydroxychloroquine and AZM, suggested a synergistic inhibition of SARS‐CoV‐2 replication in Vero cells at 5 and 10 μM concentrations, respectively.

 </xref> This synergy has been proposed to allow effective use of hydroxychloroquine at less toxic concentrations, and is an approach tried in a small observational study which suggested enhanced virological clearance with hydroxychloroquine, particularly in combination with AZM.

 </xref> However this study was very small, with AZM data from only six patients, and was open‐label and non‐randomised, allowing no useful conclusions to be drawn. Moreover, there are concerns that combination therapy may enhance cardiovascular side effects as both molecules individually can cause prolongation of the QT interval.

 </xref> This combination has been tested in non‐human primates, where a significant anti‐viral effect was not seen in the five macaques which received AZM in addition to hydroxychloroquine.
