<p>Interesting data have recently emerged from a mass eradication programme amongst preschool children in Niger. Children up to age 5 were cluster‐randomised by community to a single oral dose of AZM or placebo every 6 months and nasopharyngeal swabs were taken for viral RNA sequencing. After 24 months, AZM use was associated with an eightfold reduction in viral load of 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic> and a 14‐fold reduction in 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> viral load, though there was no difference in the prevalence of these viruses.
