<p>Comparative analysis of codon 74 among different genetic variants of subtype A showed that the frequency of substitutions was significantly different (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) between the A6 clade and other sub-subtypes A. Sub-subtype A6 and other genetic variants of subtype A included L74L in 3.7% and 86.4% of cases, L74I in 94.9% and 9.6%, L74M in 1.2% and 3%, and L74V in 0.1% and 1%, respectively.
