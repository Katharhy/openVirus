<p>Among the A6 clade (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00838-f001">Figure 1</xref>). A total of 108 mutations were determined in these polymorphic positions. The most polymorphic positions were identified in the N-terminal domain (20/50, 40%), none of which were in the conserved zinc finger motif. In the catalytic core domain, 39 polymorphic positions (39/162, 24.1%) were determined, all of which were out of the DDE catalytic triad. In the C-terminal domain, 16 polymorphic positions were identified (16/76, 21.1%). Additionally, the amino acids in integrase positions that were identified as critical for interaction with the essential HIV integration cofactor LEDGF/p75 linking integrase to chromatin (128, 130, 131, 161, 165, 166, 168, 170, 172, 173, 214, and 216) were determined to be conserved [
