<p>Naturally occurring polymorphisms can affect the genetic barrier to the development of INSTI resistance, defined as the number of transitions or transversions required to overcome drug selection pressure [

 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00838" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, 32 integrase amino acid positions (50, 51, 54, 66, 68, 74, 92, 95, 97, 114, 118, 119, 121, 128, 138, 140, 142, 143, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 151, 153, 155, 157, 163, 193, 230, 232, and 263) related to 58 resistance mutations were analyzed for a genetic barrier (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00838">Table S3</xref>). In these positions, the frequency of occurrence of each codon was calculated. For codons occurring in these subtypes more often than 1%, the number of transversions (tv) and transitions (ts) necessary for a resistance substitution (resistant codon) was calculated.
