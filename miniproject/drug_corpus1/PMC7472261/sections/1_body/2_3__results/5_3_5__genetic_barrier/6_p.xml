<p>Additionally, the sequences of sub-subtype A6 were significantly different from those in A1 and B at position 74. At this position, for the vast majority of sequences of sub-subtype A6, the codon ATA was present, which determined the genetic barrier for L74M (score of 1) and L74I (score of 0). In most sequences of sub-subtype A1 and subtype B, this position was encoded by the CTG, which determined the genetic barrier to 74M and 74I with scores of 2.5 and 2.7, respectively. For position L74F, A6 sequences had a score of 5, while for sequences of A1 and B, the barrier had a score of 3.5.</p>
