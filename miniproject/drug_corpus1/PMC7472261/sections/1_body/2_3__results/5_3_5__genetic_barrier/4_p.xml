<p>Position 140, in most sequences of A1 and A6, is encoded by GGG/GGA, and in subtype B, there is a GGC/GGT codon. These codons determine that, with respect to subtype B, the calculated barrier for the G140C mutation, which is a major mutation and associated with resistance to all INSTIs, was equal to 2.5, and a score of 5 was calculated for subtype A.</p>
