<p>Position 151 in most sequences of subtype B was codon GTA, and codon GTG was present in sequences of subtype A. Therefore, for the V151I mutation, which could play a role in the resistance to INSTIs, for both sub-subtypes A1 and A6, the genetic barrier was also higher than that of subtype B (0.4 versus 0.2, respectively).</p>
