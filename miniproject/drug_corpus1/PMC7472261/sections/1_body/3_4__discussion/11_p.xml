<p>Analysis of genetic barriers among genetic variants A1, A6, and B displayed a similar genetic barrier for almost all positions, which is consistent with published data [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00838" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In a large number of sequences of subtype A, we also showed that subtype B differs from subtype A at positions 140 and 151, and subtype B had a lower genetic barrier to the occurrence of mutations G140C and V151I, which could play a role in INSTI resistance.
