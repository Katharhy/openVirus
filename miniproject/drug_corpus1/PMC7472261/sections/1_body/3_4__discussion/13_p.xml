<p>The L74I mutation appears to be a key characteristic of sub-subtype A6. Therefore, we estimated the temporal origin and phylogenetic characteristics of the sub-subtype A6 viruses with the L74I mutation and showed that viruses with L74I spread as a result of a founder effect among IDUs across FSU countries, validating our initial hypothesis.</p>
