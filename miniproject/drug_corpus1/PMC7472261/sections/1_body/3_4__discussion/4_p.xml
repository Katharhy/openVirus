<p>Because the use of INSTIs was introduced recently in Russia [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00838" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], we found a low level of INSTI DR. Overall, the frequency of at least one INSTI resistance mutation was 1.3% and 2.7% in treatment-na誰ve and INSTI-na誰ve patients, respectively. SDRMs were detected only in 1 INSTI-na誰ve patient. These data suggest that the implementation of INSTI drugs for the treatment of HIV-infected ARV-na誰ve and ARV-experienced patients in Russia will be successful.
