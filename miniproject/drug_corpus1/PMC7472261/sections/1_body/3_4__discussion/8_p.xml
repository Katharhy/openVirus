<p>Remarkably, the prevalence of 12 polymorphic mutations (K14R, R20K, L74I, S119P, T124S, T124A, V126F, G134N, T218I, L234I, S255N, and S283G) was significantly different between sub-subtypes A6 and A1. This characteristic can be used as a marker of the A6 variant, allowing discrimination of this sub-subtype from A1 viruses. Taking into account that the A6 virus dominating Russia may be misclassified as A1, these gene features allow us to clarify the viral sub-subtype in samples and correct the data about the circulation of different A-subtype viruses.</p>
