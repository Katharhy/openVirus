 <xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00838" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Overall, 26.1% of positions in integrase were defined as polymorphic. A total of 108 mutations were detected, including 16 highly polymorphic mutations. Five of them (R20K, I72V, L74I, S119P, and V201I) were described as INSTI resistant [
