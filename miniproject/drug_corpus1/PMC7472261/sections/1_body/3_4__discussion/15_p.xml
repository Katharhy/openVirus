<p>The findings of this article show the important role of features of viral genotypes in drug resistance and also indicate that there is still a need for a better understanding of resistance mechanisms to INSTIs. The potential contribution of naturally occurring polymorphisms, particularly the L74I mutation, in HIV-1 integrase to the evolution of resistance under the selective pressure of INSTIs may have clinical and virological implications. A lower genetic barrier for L74I mutations in sub-subtype A6 can lead to quicker development of drug resistance than subtype B, which is especially important in light of virological failures in patients with the L74I mutation from Russia in the ATLAS and FLAIR studies [
