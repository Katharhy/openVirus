<p>As the name suggests, INSTIs inhibit the second step of viral replication catalyzed by integrase, i.e., strand transfer, through competitive binding to the enzymeâ€™s active site. HIV-1 integrase has three independent domains: The N-terminal domain, the catalytic core domain, and the C-terminal domain. Each region comprises motifs essential for the proper functioning of the enzyme, e.g., the conserved zinc finger motif (H12-H16-C40-C43) in the N-terminal domain, the active site (D64-D116-E153) in the catalytic core domain, and the minimal nonspecific DNA-binding region ranging from I220 to D270 in the C-terminal domain [
