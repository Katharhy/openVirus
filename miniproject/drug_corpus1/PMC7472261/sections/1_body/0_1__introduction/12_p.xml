<p>Recently, several studies of subtype-specific differences in sensitivity and the impact of naturally occurring polymorphisms were presented. Investigated polymorphic substitutions, especially at the active site of integrase, demonstrated that the natural variability of integrase across HIV-1 genetic variants can significantly affect the genetic barrier to drug resistance (DR) by influencing the selection of resistance mutations, native protein activity, structure, and the function of the drug-mediated inhibition of the enzyme, which may have important implications for INSTI therapy [
