<p>Phylogenetic trees were estimated from the underlying nucleotide sequences using the approximate maximum likelihood (ML) method with bootstrap evaluation under the generalized time reversible (GTR) model as a nucleotide substitution model—including a Γ distributed rate of heterogeneity among sites—as implemented in RaxML [

 <xref rid="B47-viruses-12-00838" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] to verify our results. Tree visualization and annotation were performed using FigTree v1.4.2 and iTOL (
