<p>The phylodynamic analysis was conducted using a Bayesian approach as implemented in BEAST v2.2 [
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-12-00838" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. We analyzed sequences found within the Russian samples by using the GTR as the nucleotide substitution model with gamma heterogeneity and an uncorrelated relaxed clock model with lognormal distribution. A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis was run for 25 Ã— 106 generations and sampled every 5000 steps, with the first 10% of samples being discarded as burn-in. The MCMC convergence and effective sample sizes (ESS) were confirmed using Tracer v1.5. A consensus tree was built, and the distribution was assessed from the posterior tree using TreeAnnotator v1.8 23.
