<p>Sepsis and hypercoagulation are constant concerns in respiratory-infection patients, and these problems are particularly relevant in COVID-19. Sepsis was noted in 54/54 (100%) of non-survivors in one cohort, and septic shock in 38/54 (70%) of non-survivors (

 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Indeed, COVID-19 coagulopathy is likely to present with elevated D-dimer and fibrin/fibrinogen products in the setting of normal prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time and platelet counts (Connors and Levy 
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>); these findings may appear in early COVID-19 infection even when there is no clinically identifiable bleeding. Interestingly, the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2-induced coagulopathy may be linked to the receptor of viral adhesion, the ACE2 receptor, which is abundant on vascular endothelial cells – and thus may facilitate endothelial dysfunction and further coagulopathy in COVID-19 infections (Varga 
 <italic>et al</italic>.

 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) further support this mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 related coagulopathy.
