<p>Coronaviruses have long been recognized as causative agents in self-limited upper respiratory tract infections affecting humans (Falsey

 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>), however three strains belonging to the Betacoronavirus (Viruses ICoTo and ICTV 
 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) genus have been shown to cause more complications and worse patient outcomes than other strains overall (World Health Organization 
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). These three viruses are the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome- related virus (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome- related virus (SARS CoV-1) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome- related virus (SARS CoV-2), also known as Coronavirus Disease 2019- related virus (COVID-19 virus). MERS CoV was first identified in Jordan in 2012 (World Health Organization 
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), SARS CoV-1 was first described in Guangdong province, China in 2002, (World Health Organization 
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) and SARS CoV-2 was first detected in Hubei province, China in 2019 (World Health Organization 
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). SARS CoV-2/COVID-19 is an ongoing pandemic which to date has spread to more than 100 countries (World Health Organization 
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). In addition, MERS is still considered to be an on ongoing epidemic but appears to be limited to its area of origin (Al-Tawfiq, Kattan and Memish 
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). On the other hand, according to the National Health Service (NHS) no new cases of SARS CoV-1 infection have been reported in humans since 2004 (National Health Service 
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The estimated case fatality rates (CFR) for MERS and SARS were 20% and 6.4% respectively (Feng 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Mizumoto 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), while the CFR for COVID-19 is estimated to be around 2.3% (Porcheddu 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Nonetheless, despite its lower CFR, COVID-19 has thus far resulted in more deaths than both SARS and MERS combined (Mahase 
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). With regard to transmissibility, SARS CoV-2 has a reproduction number (R0) of 3.28 (Liu 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), whereas the R0 of SARS CoV-1 was approximately three according to estimates by the World Health Organization (WHO) (World Health Organization 
 <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). MERS CoV was found to have an R0 in the range of 2.0–2.8 during its initial outbreak in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, versus an R0 in the range of 3.5–6.7 during a second outbreak occurring 11 days later in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (Majumder 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In addition to exhibiting some similarity in their levels of transmissibility, the diseases caused by these coronaviruses are characterized by similar presentations and complications—with notable variations—affecting different organ systems (Peeri
