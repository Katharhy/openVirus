<p>The model of ARDS in these diseases is supported by radiographic and clinical data. SARS patients who suffer clinical deterioration in the phased manner typical of this disease often show bilateral lung involvement that resembles ARDS on radiologic imaging seen in other diseases (Tse

 <italic>et al</italic>.

 <italic>et al</italic>.

Curiously, all 12 members of a cohort of MERS patients in Saudi Arabia who developed ARDS suffered from comorbidities (asthma, diabetes mellitus, renal failure and others), suggesting that ARDS tends to manifest more often in susceptible patients (Arabi 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
