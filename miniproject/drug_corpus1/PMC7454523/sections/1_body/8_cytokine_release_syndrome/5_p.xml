<p>The altered status of T cells in patients with COVID-19 is also proposed to play a role in the pathophysiology of the disease. Decreased levels of peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cells have been observed, yet the same cells were found to be hyperactivated. The activation of these cells was characterized by a high concentration of CCR6 + Th17 (figure 1), which is associated with a hyperinflammatory response (Wan
