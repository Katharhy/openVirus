<p>MERS patients appear to have some risk of developing neurologic symptoms, although the presentation and pathophysiology seem to differ from those associated with SARS. Seizures were reported in 6/70 patients (8.6%) in a Saudi cohort (Saad 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Another group described three MERS patients with severe neurologic symptoms. These patients presented with altered consciousness, coma, ataxia and focal motor deficits. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), T2-weighted images showed non-enhancing bilateral hyperintense lesions in white matter and in subcortical regions of the frontal, temporal, parietal lobes. Arabi et al did not report virus detection in brain tissue or CSF but noted that the disease process resembled acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, or non-occlusive stroke via MERS vasculopathy (Arabi 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
