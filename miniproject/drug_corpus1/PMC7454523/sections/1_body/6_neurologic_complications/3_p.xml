<p>The possibility of central neurogenic respiratory failure in the setting of coronavirus infection is supported by some evidence from animal models (Li 
 <italic>et al</italic>.

 <italic>Netland et al</italic>. (
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) used transgenic mice with humanized Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors that could efficiently bind SARS-CoV-1 viral particles, to establish that SARS-CoV-1 particles could enter the brain via intranasal inoculation. The infection propagated from the sinuses to the olfactory bulb. Once the infection of the olfactory bulb was established, the infection spread throughout the brain to reach the medullary respiratory center; consequently, these mice died from central respiratory failure. Interestingly, the lungs of the mice showed minimal pathological changes, and the initial concentration of ACE2 receptors in brain tissue was only 1% of their concentration in lung tissue. In this experiment, establishing an infection of the sinuses may have been essential because hematogenous spread to the brain is unlikely (Ding 
 <italic>et al</italic>.

 <italic>et al</italic>. used transgenic mice positive for human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) to show that a similar brain-infection mechanism of SARS-CoV-1 could occur once mice were inoculated with MERS-CoV intranasally; the infection showed a predilection for the thalamus and brainstem (the latter containing the respiratory center; Li 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Until now, there have been no studies demonstrating SARS-CoV-2 involvement in damage to the respiratory centers. However, presentation with such an entity would merit thorough investigation, due to its complex involvement of both the peripheral components and the central neurologic components of the respiratory system.
