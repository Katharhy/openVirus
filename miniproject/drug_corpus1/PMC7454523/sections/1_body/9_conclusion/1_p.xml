<p>MERS, SARS AND COVID-19 are all identified as respiratory viruses. Nevertheless, they exhibit systemic complications and complications specific to other organ systems, especially in the setting of severe disease. Analysis of their common and distinct features is instructive, vital for appropriate patient management, and suggestive of various disease mechanisms that may be targeted through the development of new therapies. The role of hyperactive immune states in severe disease, as supported by mounting evidence, should be urgently addressed in order to reduce morbidity and mortality among individual patients and populations.</p>
