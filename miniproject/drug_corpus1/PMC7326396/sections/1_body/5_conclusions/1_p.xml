<p>COVID-19 is an emerging disease all over the world and spreading at an unpredicted rate, resulting in significant influences on global economies and public health. The present review assessed the risk factors related to the outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections which were included old age, male gender, and obesity, associated co-morbidities in the form of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, cerebrovascular diseases and COPD. Laboratory parameters associated with critical COVID-19 disease were lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, leucocytosis, increased neutrophils, increased C reactive protein and ferritin, increased D dimer, raised ALT and/or AST, decreased albumin, increased cardiac troponin and elevated LDH. Finally, ground-glass opacities when present in the CT chest were considered as the most important imaging indicator for COVID-19 severity.</p>
