<p>Li et al
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> reported the clinical characteristics of 25 cases died with COVID-19. The clinical profile of these patients showed that the most important risk factors for death in these patients represented in, age and underlying diseases. Regarding the underlying diseases associated with death, the most recorded one was chronic hypertension then diabetes mellitus, chronic cardiac diseases, cerebral infarction, kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignant tumors and acute pancreatitis. Li et al
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> demonstrated that respiratory failure was the leading cause of death in all the patients, which confirmed that lungs of the patients are the most important target organ of SARS-CoV-2. Multiple organ failure could be observed in those patients, the heart came after the lung as the most common damaged organ then the kidney and the liver. The results of that study verified that the death of the patients with COVID-19 may be to a large extent related to impaired cardiopulmonary function. All the patients’ albumin levels, 80% and 68% of patients’ RBC and Hb levels were decreased, which indicates that malnutrition is one of the causes of severe COVID-19.
