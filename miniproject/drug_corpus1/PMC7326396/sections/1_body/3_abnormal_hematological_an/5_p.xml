<p>Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a plasma protein that transports lipids during inflammation.
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Li et al
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> showed that the increased levels of SAA and CRP before death in 85% and 100% of patients, suggestive of that there is a serious inflammatory cascade in patients having COVID-19. In intend to monitor biochemical indicators which are important in monitoring the severity of the disease and its progress, Li et al
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> consulted the results of laboratory test for all the dead patients, among which 16patients had repeated measurements. The SAA maintained a high level in all the patients, this result indicated that raised SAA levels are closely related to the poor prognosis of patients. The first test level of neutrophils was (93.8%), CRP (84.6%), PCT (100%), cTnI (88.9%), d-dimer (91.6%) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (100%) were increased than the last test, but the levels of lymphocytes were decreased (87.5%), suggesting that the increasing of neutrophils, CRP, d-dimer, PCT, cTnI, and LDH levels can be used as markers of disease severity and progress, similarly the decline of lymphocytes counts.
