<p>‏Nasiri et al
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> identified common laboratory findings associated with a poor outcome including lymphopenia (50.1%), raised C-Reactive Protein (72%), and increased levels of LDH (41%). Also, thrombocytopenia was found in 11.1% of the cases. The Studies performed by Huang et al,
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and Lippi et al
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> have suggested that thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia in patients with COVID-19 are associated with prolonged hospitalization and worse outcomes. Patients with SARS were indicated to have a higher percentage of lymphopenia (68–90%) and thrombocytopenia (20–45%) than those of COVID-19.
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia have been previously associated with a greater risk of mortality in SARS and influenza.
