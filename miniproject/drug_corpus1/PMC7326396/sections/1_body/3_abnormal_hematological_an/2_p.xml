<p>D-dimers are fragments produced when plasmin cleaves fibrin to break down clots. They are routinely used to exclude the diagnosis of thrombosis. However, plasma d-dimer increases by any pathologic or non-pathologic process that increases fibrin production or breakdown.
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> A study conducted by Zhou et al
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> found d-dimer more than 1 Î¼g/mL is associated with mortality of COVID-19. High levels of d-dimer have been associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis or infection identified in the emergency department.
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Petrilli et al.
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> reported striking findings regarding the predictive value of inflammatory markers to distinguish future critical from non-critical illness. Early elevation in d-dimer level had the strongest association with prolonged hospitalization and the need for mechanical ventilation or death.
