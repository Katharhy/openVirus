<p>The method and level of the virus replication and its duration of life are important factors in evaluating the root of transmission and guiding protocols for patientsâ€™ protection and isolation. As coronavirus RNA detection is more sensitive than the isolation of the virus itself, most studies gave care to use qualitative or quantitative viral RNA tests as a possible marker for infectious coronavirus. About SARS-CoV, the viral RNA was obtained from the respiratory specimens from about third of patients affected by the virus for at least 4 weeks from the onset of the disease.
