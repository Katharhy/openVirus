<p>A study conducted by Zhou et al
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> found that duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in survivors could reach for a median of 20 days even though it could still till death in non-survivors. This result has an important role in the decision of patientâ€™s isolation and guidelines regarding the length of treatment protocols. Usually in serious influenza virus infection, continued viral replication was associated with worse outcome that may be fatal, also the delay in starting with suitable antiviral treatment had an important effect on viral replication and detection.
