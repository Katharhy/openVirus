<p>A study conducted by Zhou et al
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> confirmed that increased age of patients with COVID-19 was associated with death. The decrease in T-cell and B-cell functions depending on age and the additional production of type 2 cytokines, could lead to a lack in control of viral replication and load and more exacerbation in proinflammatory responses that may lead to increase the severity of the disease and poor outcome.
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Petrilli et al
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> described characteristics of 4103 patients in New York City with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 disease, 1999 of them needed hospital admission while 650 of them needed ICU, respiratory support, were discharged to hospital and/or died. They found that older age was one of the most important predictors of hospitalization and a vital predictor of severe outcomes.
