<p>Nasiri et al
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> showed that sex affected the mortality rate, where the mortality of females with COVID-19 was significantly lower than males [Odds Ratio (3.4); 95% CI 1.2–9.1, P value = (0.01)], on the other hand, there was not any significant difference between male and female regarding ICU admissions. Earlier coronavirus epidemics of SARS and MERS resulted in a similar form of higher mortality in males than females. Karlberg et al
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> also showed that the difference in mortality rates according to sex distribution of the affected cases was higher in younger males (0–44 years old) (RR=2), compared to those of age group (45–74years old) (RR-1.45). Also, another study conducted by Alghamdi et al
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> showed that regarding MERS, the number of diseases in males was double that of females (52% vs 23%).
