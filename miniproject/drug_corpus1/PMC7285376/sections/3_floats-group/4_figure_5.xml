  <p>Determination of specificity for wild type (Sh2 = A/Shanghai/2/2013) and mutant H7 HAs on glycan arrays (left) and trachea epithelium (right). Mutations introduced in each glycan array are listed above the plot. Glycans 1 to 10 are non-sialylated controls, while 11 to 79 represent α-2,3 linked sialosides and 80 to 135 represent α-2,6 linked sialosides. The binding profile for triple mutants V186K/G-K193T-G228S is nearly identical to the pandemic control virus Cal/04/09 2009 H1N1. Minimally adapted from the original picture in [
