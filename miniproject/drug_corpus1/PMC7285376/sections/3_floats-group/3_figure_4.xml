  <p>Staining of human trachea cells with G228S hemagglutinin (A/Anhui/1/2013) and a wild type (WT) virus. Tissue sections present recombinant HA stained green, counterstained with propidium iodide in red. The WT virus has not stained cells (top) as intensely as HA-G228S (bottom), demonstrating an increased affinity of the mutated HA for human trachea cells. White arrows indicate specific staining by recombinant HA (in green). Reprinted from [
