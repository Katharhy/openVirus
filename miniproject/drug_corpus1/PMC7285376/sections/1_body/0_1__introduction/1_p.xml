<p>The pandemic potential of the influenza A virus (IAV) is well known, with the most significant impact occurring during the 1918 Spanish Flu, where mortality was estimated between 21.5 million and 100 million [

In the one hundred years since this initial event, evolutionary adaptations in human and animal influenza viruses have resulted in another three IAV pandemic events; the 1957 Asian flu (H2N2), the 1968 Hong Kong flu (H3N2) and the 2009 swine flu (H1N1) [

While pandemic events remain limited in number, recurring seasonal influenza virus epidemics result in approximately three to five million cases of severe illness annually, with between 290,000 and 650,000 deaths linked to virally associated respiratory diseases [
 <xref rid="B3-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The morbidity rate for influenza epidemics underscores the constant molecular changes taking place within the viral genome, which in turn facilitates the evasion of host immunity. In response to selective evolutionary pressures, the IAV is adapting, resulting in viral diversity and the creation of novel genotypes. The emergence of the novel IAV H7N9 in 2013 and the resulting morbidity and mortality signalled an evolutionary adaptation of unknown consequence. The purpose of this review is to document the emergence of the H7N9 virus, how it adapted to human hosts, and also highlight the molecular changes that could bring about a human-to-human pandemic.
