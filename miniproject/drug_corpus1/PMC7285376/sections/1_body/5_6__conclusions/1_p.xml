<p>Evolutionary pressures have driven molecular changes within the viral genome of H7N9, and in the process, established favourable binding to human epithelial cells through increased specificity for α-2,6 linked SA receptors. In an apparent incongruity, the H7N9 virus also retains its specificity for avian cells, which may be an indication of insufficient or ineffective evolutionary pressures. Experimental studies show how a single amino acid substitution enhances binding to human epithelial cells (HA-Q226L), but an equivalent reduction in specificity for avian α-2,3 linked SAs is lacking, and nor is there a particularly strong avidity for α-2,6 linked SAs in the presence of this mutation. The potential impact of single point mutations in hemagglutinin (HA) was recognized when serine was experimentally substituted for glutamine at the HA-228 residue. HA-G228S produced a significant increase in binding affinity within human tracheal cells, signalling the relative simplicity with which antigenic drift could create a highly infectious virus. Introducing multiple mutations into HA residues appears to increase virulence and strengthen binding to human-type cells.</p>
