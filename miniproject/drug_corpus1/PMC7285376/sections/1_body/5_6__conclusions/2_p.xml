<p>Despite the current lack of specificity by H7N9 HA for human cells, there is enough evidence to show increased virulence, and viral replication occurs under certain PB2 amino acid mutations. The substitution of lysine for glutamic acid at Residue 627 (PB2-E627K) occurs across many highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, delivering enhanced replication efficiency and virulence in mammals. Like the introduction of multiple mutations in HA, the introduction of multiple PB2 mutations into the viral genome altered the viral function, creating a shift towards increased polymerase activity and virulence. </p>
