<p>With much of the research focus directed towards HA receptors, little attention has been given to molecular changes in the neuraminidase stalk. Naturally occurring five amino acid deletions in the H7N9 NA stalk are noted to occur in other influenza subtypes, and have been shown to have no significant impact on infectivity, replication or pathogenesis. However, the introduction of extended amino acid sequence deletions in NA stalk length resulted in significant increases in pathogenicity. Nevertheless, it seems that the prospect of such deletions occurring naturally may be limited, if recognition is given to the functional balance that must be maintained between HA and NA activity. </p>
