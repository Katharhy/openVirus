<p>The H7N9 virus continues to evolve through reassortment and amino acid substitutions. While certain mutations have been shown to elicit high pathogenicity, increased virulence and transmission, the prevalence of these mutations appears to be limited at present. Even so, it has been readily demonstrated that a single mutation of one amino acid is all it takes to create a more adaptive H7N9 virus. Under the right conditions, evolutionary pressures could result in a mutation favouring direct human-to-human transmission, at which point H7N9 viruses have the potential to become an unconstrained epidemic, and reach pandemic status within a very short period.</p>
