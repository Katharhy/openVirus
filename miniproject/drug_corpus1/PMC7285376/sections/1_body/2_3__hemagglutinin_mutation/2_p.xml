<p>Following the emergence in 2013 of low pathogenic avian infleunza A(H7N9) viruses, evidence began to mount of a novel IAV originating from an avian reservoir, but without signs of sustained human-to-human transmission. The switching of viral HA specificity from avian α-2,3 SAs to human α-2,6 SA receptors confers an increased binding affinity in the upper respiratory tract of humans [

 <xref rid="B33-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It should be noted that epithelial cells within the nasal mucosa of the upper respiratory tract of humans are dominated by α-2,6 linked SAs, while alveolar epithelial cells in the lower respiratory tract are dominated by α-2,3 linked SAs [

Efficient replication of an avian IAV in the lower respiratory tract is possible where the avian receptor is present, although replication in the upper respiratory tract is required for sustained human-to-human transmission. Although susceptible individuals are at risk from multiple modes of transmission, aerosol transmission is possibly the predominant mode of IAV transmission [

Switching of the viral H7N9 HA specificity to favour human SA receptors is likely to have been facilitated by mutation, and it has been shown that a change in the viral HA molecule is a crucial adaptation in the transmissibility of previous pandemic influenza strains [
 <xref rid="B36-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Importantly, it has been shown that of the five waves of H7N9 viruses, there is no evidence for enhanced or sustained human-to-human transmission [
