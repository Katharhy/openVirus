<p>The viral life cycle is initiated through attachment to a susceptible host. To achieve attachment, a virus must have binding specificity for certain surface molecules on a host cell (a receptor), and without that specificity, transmission of viral particles into the host will not occur. Sialic acid (SA) is a nonspecific term used for nine-carbon acidic amino sugars that act as a cell surface receptor determinant for all influenza A virus (IAV) strains [
 <xref rid="B28-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The attachment of all IAV strains to cells requires SAs with an affinity that are dependent upon the presence of an α-2,3 or α-2,6 linkage between the SA and the sugar galactose. Regarding the α-2,3 linkage, the carbon at Position 2 on the SA hexose is linked via an oxygen atom to the carbon at Position 3 of galactose. This is also the case for α-2,6 except the SA carbon is now linked to Position 6 on the hexose of galactose. On the surface of an IAV, hemagglutinin (HA) glycoproteins are responsible for binding with SAs on the host cell surface, although the specificity of HA towards SA varies between different animal species and contributes to host range restriction. For example, an avian IAV will have an HA-glycan binding specificity that promotes transmission between bird species, but lacks the necessary binding specificity to readily spread to humans, and vice versa [

 <xref rid="B23-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Specifically, it requires an α-2,6 SA residue on the human host [
 <xref rid="B30-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Hence, a human IAV will preferentially bind to an α-2,6 SA residue, while an avian IAV has specificity for an α-2,3 SA residue, thereby limiting the effective transmission of IAVs between birds and humans.
