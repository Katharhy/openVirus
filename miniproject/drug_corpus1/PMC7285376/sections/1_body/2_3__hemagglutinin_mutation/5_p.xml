<p>As previously discussed, mutations in HA-226Q are indicative of the H7N9 mammalian adaptation process, with typical human isolates displaying a characteristic HA-Q226L mutation [
 <xref rid="B31-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. While HA-226L continues to provide evidence of preferential binding to α-2,6 SAs in humans, this substitution does not necessarily impart significant binding avidity [
 <xref rid="B39-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Despite this, experimental results demonstrate that HA-Q226L remains critical for binding to α-2,6 SAs, and enables the transmission of H7N9 viruses in mammalian hosts [
 <xref rid="B38-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Should H7N9 viruses with the HA-226L mutation move into the swine population, this could represent a significant selective advantage, given that swine are recognized as mixing vessels for human, swine and avian influenza viruses [
 <xref rid="B40-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Using a recombinant wild-type virus (rAnhui-WT), Liu et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] demonstrated the effectiveness of direct contact transmission amongst pigs using the recombinant Anhui-HA-Q226L mutation [
 <xref rid="B38-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This study identified that transmission/replication-enhancing mutations were occurring after a single passage in pigs, concluding that the potential for novel reassortments to occur with other IAVs was significant, should H7N9 become enzootic within pigs.
