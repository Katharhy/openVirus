<p>The first step in the viral lifecycle is attachment to a susceptible host epithelial cell, without which infection cannot ensue, and the life cycle terminates. Epithelial cells of the upper respiratory system express abundant α-2,6 SAs at their surface, while alveolar cells in the lower respiratory tract are coated with α-2,3 SAs. The adaptation of H7N9 into the human host from an avian reservoir is realized because HA mutations have switched their binding affinity from α-2,3 SAs in birds to α-2,6 SAs in mammals, and consequently can bind to epithelial cells in the upper respiratory tract. A consistent substitution of leucine at HA-226 occurs in H7N9 viruses, but this mutation does not endow the expected strong binding, potentially contributing to the lack of sustained human-to-human transmission. In contrast to this, a single point mutation at 228 (G228S) produced a significant binding affinity to human cells, and served to highlight the ease with which this virus could mutate into a highly infectious form.</p>
