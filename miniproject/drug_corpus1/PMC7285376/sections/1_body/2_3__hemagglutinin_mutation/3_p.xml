<p>With reference to avain H7N9 viruses, a change in the SA receptor affinity from avian to human has been consistently linked to the substitution of glutamine (Q) with leucine (L) at Position 226 of HA (HA-Q226L) [

 <xref rid="B32-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The presence of a leucine residue in Position 226 of HA was predicted to increase the strength of binding affinity of HA to human α-2,6 linked SA receptors [
 <xref rid="B23-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], yet the H7N9 HA failed to show an increased binding affinity. Instead, the H7N9 HA protein displayed limited binding to α-2,6 linked SA receptors in the upper respiratory tract [
