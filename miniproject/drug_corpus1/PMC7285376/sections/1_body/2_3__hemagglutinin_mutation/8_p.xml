<p>To assess the potential for a fifth wave IAV switch in receptor specificity, triple mutations previously identified by de Vries et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] (V186G/K-K193T-G228S) were introduced in two separate lineages of the H7N9 virus isolated from the 2016 fifth wave (Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta), and investigated to assess changes in human SA receptor specificity [
 <xref rid="B39-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The expression of new variant HAs from the recombinant viruses was analyzed using glycan microarray and bio-layer interferometry to show a significant, but incomplete loss of binding to α-2,3 SA receptors, accompanied by increased binding to α-2,6 SA receptors. The incomplete loss of α-2,3 SA receptor affinity in a fifth wave virus contrasts with the complete loss of receptor affinity for similar mutations in A/Shanghai/2/2013, implying a subtle mutagenic shift in this latest wave [

 <xref rid="B39-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] noted that while HA receptor-binding preference is important, it is not the only consideration for efficient human-to-human transmission [
