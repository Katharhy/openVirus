<p>Following the initial outbreak in 2013, the H7N9 virus has undergone reassortment and mutation, resulting in five epidemic waves of infection, with each wave responding to new evolutionary pressures and adapting in the process [

The first four waves caused by H7N9 strains were classified as low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI), although with the emergence of the fifth wave during late 2016, the LPAI H7N9 virus mutated into a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus [
