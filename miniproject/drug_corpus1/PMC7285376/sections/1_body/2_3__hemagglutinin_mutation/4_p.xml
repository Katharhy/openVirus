<p>An experimental comparison of the glycan receptor binding site for A/Anhui/1/2013 with H3 HA (its phylogenetically closest human-adapted HA) has highlighted the critical importance of S228 in H3 for an amino acid network containing residues S186, T187 and E190 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00778-f004">Figure 4</xref>). This network structurally positions E190 such that it can make critical contact with sialic acids for both avian and human receptors. The H7 HA does not possess this amino acid network, as it has G228, which alters the positioning of the contact residues involving E190, and as a result, binding to human respiratory epithelial cells is diminished. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce the G228S mutation into H7 HA to produce HA-G228S, modifying the structural network and optimally positioning E190 and S228 for binding to both avian and human SA receptors [
