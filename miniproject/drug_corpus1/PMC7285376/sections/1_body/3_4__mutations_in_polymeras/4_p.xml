<p>Xiao et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] demonstrated how PB2-A588V resulted in enhanced polymerase activity, viral replication and virulence for avian-origin H7N9 viruses in mammalian and avian cells. It was noted that the presence of this mutation (PB2-A588V) has increased in human-origin H7N9 viruses, from 0% in 2013 to 24.2% in 2014, with only a minimal presence of this mutation in H7N9 viruses of avian origin (1.9%) [
 <xref rid="B52-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. It was concluded that PB2-588V is essential for mammalian adaptation, and when coupled with PB2-627K, significantly affects the replication and virulence of H7N9.
