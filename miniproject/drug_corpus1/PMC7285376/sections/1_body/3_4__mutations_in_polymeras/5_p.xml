<p>An increase in the replication efficiency of avian influenza viruses in humans is associated with specific mutations in PB2. The similar occurrence of a single amino acid substitution (PB2-E627K) in H7N9 and other highly pathogenic viruses suggests this substitution is instrumental in mammalian adaptation. Other PB2 mutations are known to contribute to replication, enhanced polymerase activity and virulence, and it appears that a virus with multiple PB2 mutations could be appreciably more virulent.</p>
