<p>Avian influenza viruses typically carry glutamic acid (E) at Residue 627 in PB2. Replication efficiency and host specificity are known to be influenced by Residue 627 in PB2. The substitution PB2-E627K has been linked to increased pathogenicity in human isolates of H5N1 and H7N7, both highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses [
