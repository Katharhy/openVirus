<p>Successful binding to the human host is a necessary first step in viral transmission, followed by host cell entry and replication. As a part of the viral replication complex, polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2) plays a crucial role in mammalian adaption, hence an amino acid change or reassortment in PB2 has the potential to allow more efficient viral replication in a new host. Replication efficiency in mammalian cells can be linked to amino acid substitutions in PB2 [

 <xref rid="B46-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], therefore like hemagglutinin (HA) mutations, a change in virulence factors may be related to the accumulation of specific PB2 protein mutations.
