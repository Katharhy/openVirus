<p>Mok et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] identified increased polymerase activity associated with PB2-E627K in human isolates of H7N9, noting that poultry isolates lacked this mutation. The effect of substituting lysine for glutamic acid (PB2-E627K) was experimentally investigated using mice infected with viruses encoding either the PB2-627E or PB2-E627K proteins. Results showed a decrease in disease severity, lower virus replication and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines in mice lungs following viral infection with the influenza A virus (IAV) (PB2-627E), compared to mice infected with IAV (PB2-627K), concluding that these mutations contribute to increased pathogenicity in mice and mammalian adaptation [

 <xref rid="B51-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Similar substitutions in avian H7N9 viruses have not been reported, noting that although these mutations occur rapidly in mammalian isolates of H7N9, they are mammalian-specific, and are likely to have occurred after infection from the avian host [

 <xref rid="B51-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] provided experimental evidence for increased viral polymerase activity associated with mutations PB2-627K and PB2-701N, concluding that these mutations are essential for the mammalian adaptation of H7N9.
