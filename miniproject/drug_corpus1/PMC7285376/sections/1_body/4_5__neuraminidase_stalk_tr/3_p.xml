<p>A subsequent study by Bi et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] investigated the impact NA stalk length variation has within the H7N9 virus, specifically if the deletion of the five amino acid sequence (69–73) impacted virus infectivity or replication. H7N9 strains with NA stalk length variations (deletions or insertions) were administered to mice via intranasal inoculation to demonstrate that the five-amino acid deletion (NA 69–73), commonly present in H7N9, had no significant impact on viral replication, NA activity or pathogenesis [

It was contended that NA stalk length is optimized as an evolutionary strategy to maintain a functional balance of HA-NA interaction, thereby enhancing viral fitness, and that short deletions have no discernible impact on pathogenicity [
