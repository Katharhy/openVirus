<p>Host tropism of the influenza virus is strongly influenced by virus-receptor specificity and avidity for hemagglutinin (HA), preferentially binding to Î±-2,6 SA receptors, resulting in the fusion of the viral envelope with host cells, whilst neuraminidase (NA) acts to cleave sialic acid (SA) from glycans, thereby contributing to the release of viruses from the cell surface [
