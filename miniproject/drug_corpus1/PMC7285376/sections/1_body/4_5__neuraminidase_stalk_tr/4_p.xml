<p>In contrast, certain NA stalk deletions are known to produce virulence enhancements in H5N1 [

 <xref rid="B60-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], and therefore similar amino acid deletions (NA residues 49–68, 54–72 and 54–73) were tested in mice by deleting these sequences in three separate mutations (A/Anhui/1/2013) [
 <xref rid="B57-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Truncated NA stalks resulted in significantly greater pathogenic infections in mice, compared with that of a full-length NA stalk virus, although the naturally occurring 5 amino acid deletion in the NA stalk of H7N9 had no significant impact on NA activity, viral replication or pathogenesis in mice [
 <xref rid="B57-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The increase in pathogenicity was attributed to a disruption in the HA-NA balance and the consequence of a shortened NA stalk length, although the link between reduced NA stalk length and increased virulence requires further investigation.
