<p>When IAV H7N9 emerged in 2013, a notable characteristic of this virus was the deletion of amino acids 69 to 73 in the NA stalk, a feature consistent with other influenza subtypes. Chen et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] postulated that this was a potential mechanism for increasing human tropism and virulence, although this conclusion was reached without experimental evidence, instead noting that a decreased stalk length was statistically significant in other avian influenza subtypes (H5N1, H6N1, H7N1, H7N3 and H9N2), and therefore may have similar significance in H7N9. Although the shortened NA stalk is considered a remnant of molecular evolution, following the early adaption of IAV from wild aquatic birds to terrestrial poultry, it was notable that this was the first time such a deletion had been observed in N9 [
