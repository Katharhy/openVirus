<p>The association between NA stalk length, pathogenicity and virulence in H7N9 has received relatively limited attention within the research literature. Although present in other influenza subtypes, the natural deletion of five amino acid sequences in N9 does not appear to impact viral fitness or pathogenesis. However, expanded sequence deletions of amino acids in NA results in major pathogenic infections, yet the likelihood of this occurring as a natural mutational advantage seems unlikely, since it has been demonstrated that viral fitness is intimately tied to a functional HA-NA balance.</p>
