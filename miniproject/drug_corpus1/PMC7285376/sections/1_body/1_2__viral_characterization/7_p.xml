<p>Early analysis of H7N9 viruses revealed an unusually high internal genetic diversity, noting the unusual characteristic that gene segments encoding the viral HA and NA genes were more conserved than the segments encoding internal genes [
 <xref rid="B24-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The precise origin of H7N9 viruses is unknown, with internal genes potentially derived from avian H9N2 viruses (A/brambling/Beijing/16/2012), while genes encoding the viral HA and NA were obtained from unknown avian H7N?/H?N9 viruses of Eurasian origin [

 <xref rid="B27-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Phylogenetic analysis of multiple H7N9 viruses supports a minimum two-step sequential reassortment for generating avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00778-f003">Figure 3</xref>). This analysis proposed at least two stages of sequential reassortment, incorporating distinct H9N2 viruses at each stage. A lack of data on the first reassortment in wild birds precludes an accurate dating of that event, although the latest reassortment potentially occurred in early 2012 [
