 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00778-f002">Figure 2</xref> outlines the diversity of hosts in which replication and mixing (reassortment) of the IAV RNA genome can occur [
 <xref rid="B13-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Wild aquatic birds remain the principal reservoirs for IAVs and all 16 HA subtypes [

 <xref rid="B22-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], with the reassortment of IAVs potentially occurring in wild aquatic birds, poultry, swine and humans. Importantly, it should be emphasized that while swine are not considered principal reservoirs for IAV, the potential for influenza viruses normally circulating in three distinct species (humans, swine and birds) to meet within pigs indicates they could act as mixing vessels, providing an ideal host for reassortment and cross-species transmission of novel IAVs [
