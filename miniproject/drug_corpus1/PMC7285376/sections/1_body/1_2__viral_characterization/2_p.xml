<p>The segmented nature of the IAV genome enables genetic reassortment, a process by which complete viral segments are exchanged within a cell co-infected with differing influenza viruses. Reassortment of an IAV genome can then generate an antigenic shift, in which the resulting virus may produce novel antigenic proteins for which there is no pre-existing immunity. The mixing of viral genomes also enhances viral diversity, since strains from different animal species may mix freely within a susceptible host. In addition, selective environmental pressures can facilitate rapid viral evolution through processes like adaptation to a new host environment, evasion of the host immune response or acquisition of antiviral drug resistance [
