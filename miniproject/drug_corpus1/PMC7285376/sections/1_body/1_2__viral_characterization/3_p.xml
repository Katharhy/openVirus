<p>The poor proof-reading capacity of the influenza virus RNA polymerase contributes to molecular changes within the viral genome via amino acid substitutions, deletions or insertions [
 <xref rid="B11-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These changes are responsible for generating viral diversity, and are referred to as antigenic drift [
 <xref rid="B12-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Point mutations result in relatively minor changes at antigenic sites on target proteins, although these changes can accumulate over time, and eventually produce a strain that is no longer recognized by host antibodies [
 <xref rid="B7-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. As will be discussed below, antigenic shifts can produce a whole new viral strain, although in the case of the H7N9 virus, antigenic drift can significantly alter the pathogenicity and virulence in humans.
