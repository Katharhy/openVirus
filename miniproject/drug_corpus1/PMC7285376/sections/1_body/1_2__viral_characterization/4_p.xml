<p>Wild aquatic bird species are recognized as a major reservoir for influenza viruses, including IAV, providing viral seeding for domestic birds and mammals [

 <xref rid="B13-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. While IAVs circulate widely in aquatic birds, they also circulate in humans, pigs, horses, domestic birds (including chickens, turkeys, ducks and geese), dogs, marine mammals and wild migratory birds (

 <xref rid="B20-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and although these subtypes are phylogenetically similar to IAV, they cannot reassort with IAV [
 <xref rid="B6-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, a recent study isolated an IAV in Egyptian bats with viral characteristics indicative of an avian host origin. It was experimentally verified that viral replication of this IAV was possible in the lungs of infected mice, thereby demonstrating evidence of a capacity to infect other mammalian species [
 <xref rid="B21-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Although IAVs from bats are not considered potential IAV reservoirs, this recent evidence suggests novel subtype viruses may be emerging from this host.
