<p>Influenza viruses are enveloped negative-sense, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) comprising a segmented genome (

 <xref rid="B4-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The three largest RNA segments (1â€“3) encode the viral polymerases PB1, PB2 and PA, which are necessary for RNA synthesis and replication within an infected cell. Two RNA segments (4 and 6) encode the viral glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), respectively, covering the virion surface at a ratio of approximately 4:1 [
 <xref rid="B7-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The HA protein mediates binding and viral entry via specificity for host cell surface sialic acid (SA) residues, which are common to many animal species and cell types, whilst NA acts to cleave terminal SA residues, facilitating viral release [
 <xref rid="B7-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Nucleoprotein (NP) is encoded on Segment 5, and mainly serves to bind the segmented RNA genome. The viral RNA Segment 7 encodes proteins that enclose the virion to provide a structural scaffold (M1) and a proton ion channel required for viral entry and exit (M2) [

 <xref rid="B7-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and nuclear export protein (NEP) are encoded by RNA Segment 8. NS1 has a major role in restricting the host cell immune response by limiting interferon production, as well as modulating viral RNA replication, viral protein synthesis and host-cell physiology [
 <xref rid="B8-microorganisms-08-00778" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. NEP mediates the export of viral RNA from the nucleus to the cell cytoplasm [
