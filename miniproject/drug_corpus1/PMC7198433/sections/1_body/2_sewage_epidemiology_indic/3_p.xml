<p id="par0055">Other papers published in the literature already reported the presence, and fate of enveloped viruses [
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] or the inactivation of an Enveloped Surrogate Virus in Human Sewage [
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The results of this last paper were performed as a way to model Ebola presence in sewage. The inactivation kinetics of enveloped viruses in sewage used certain bacteriophage, as RNA member of the 
 <italic>Cystoviridae</italic>, as a potential surrogate for enveloped human viruses in sewage. Results reported that it can undergo 6–7 log inactivation in sewage in 3–7 days, depending on temperature.
