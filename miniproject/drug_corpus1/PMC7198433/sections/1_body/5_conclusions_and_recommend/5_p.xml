<p id="par0100">As regards to protective measures for the employees working in wastewater treatment plants most of them are already in place, since wastewaters contain different microorganisms and it is part of their common practice. The list of measures includes: to avoid direct contact with wastewater, to avoid ingesting, swallowing and/or breathing in wastewater spray or mist and to wear personal protective equipment. Protective measures for workers at places at high risk like hospitals and other medical care facilities is certainly more important and need to be in place. In Spain up till now 15 % of the people infected by COVID-19 virus were medical doctors and hospital personnel. Safeguarding supply chain of PPE will sustain vital healthcare provision and will help to reduce mortality. We need to plan strategically to ensure global manufacture, access, protection, and monitoring of supply chains in the face of unescapable shortages, cost increases, and national hoarding. All our fates are bound together, and any helpful products must be recognized as global assets.</p>
