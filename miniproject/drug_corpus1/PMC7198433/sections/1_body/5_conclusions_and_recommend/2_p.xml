<p id="par0085">It is obvious that COVID-19 was not in our radar a couple of months ago, everybody thought this was a Chinese problem but now is already a global threat. To make things easier for everybody the commonly used Environmental Source-Pathway-Receptor' (SPR) concept can be used to explain COVID-19. The source are infected humans and a risk-based approach/measure was applied: isolate the sources and/or cure the sources. The pathway it clear too: Covid-19 spreads 
 <italic>via</italic> aerosols, sneezed our coughed out by infected humans. The virus thus gets direct to the receptor. Or sticks to all kinds of surfaces: plastics, stainless steel, 
 <italic>etc.</italic> But stays only active for few hours-days. Finally the receptors are other humans and the risk-based approach is to isolate the receptors or make them immune by a vaccine, or move receptors away to an area with no source-pathway.
