<p id="par0015">Zhou and Xie [
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] report a comprehensive study on COVID-19 infection in 122 Chinese cities during January-February 2020. The most relevant finding is that there is no evidence supporting that case counts of COVID-19 decline with warmer weather. This is one of the few studies that does not find a decrease on COVID-19 outbreak when ambient temperature increases. Most of all other studies reported indicate just the contrary, warmer temperature should decrease COVID-19 outbreak. One reason could be that this study was performed in winter time, with lower temperatures than spring or summer period. In contrast Luo Bin et al. [

 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In this case the findings indicate that increase of temperature and humidity had a positive effect and the number of COVID-19 deaths which decreased. Same effect was also noticed in Jakarta, Indonesia, from January-March 2020 [
