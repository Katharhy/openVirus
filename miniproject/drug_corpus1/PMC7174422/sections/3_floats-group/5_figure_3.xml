  <p>Population dynamics of the HIV-1 sub-epidemic among injecting drug users in coastal Kenya. A Bayesian Skygrid plot showing population dynamics of the HIV-1 sub-subtype A1 injecting drug usersâ€™ sub-epidemic in coastal Kenya. Since the IDU 
   <italic>pol</italic> sequence alignment did not contain temporal information (all sequences were sampled in 2010), the node height for this cluster was calibrated using information from the tMRCA posterior distribution obtained from dating the origin of subtype A1 Kenyan clusters

   </sup>. Median estimates of the number of injecting drug users contributing to new infections are shown as a continuous black line. The shaded area represents the 95% higher posterior density intervals of the inferred effective population size.
