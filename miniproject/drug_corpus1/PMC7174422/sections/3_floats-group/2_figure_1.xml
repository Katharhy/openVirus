  <p>Clustering patterns of different risk groups in coastal Kenya. Representative clusters selected to highlight typical clustering patterns of the different risk groups. The branches are coloured according to the different risk groups (Bluish- green: MSM; Sky blue: IDU; Vermillion: FSW; Yellow: HET, and Black: reference sequences). As an overview, MSM formed several small clusters ranging in size from two to nine sequences per cluster (
   <bold>A</bold>). Most IDU sequences (N = 41) formed one single large cluster (
   <bold>B</bold>). In contrast, FSW and HET clusters were small (mostly dyads containing two sequences), although most FSW and HET sequences existed as single sequences or clustered with reference sequences (
   <bold>C</bold>). Asterisks have been used to highlight branches leading to significantly supported clusters (aLRT-SH branch support of ≥0.9).
