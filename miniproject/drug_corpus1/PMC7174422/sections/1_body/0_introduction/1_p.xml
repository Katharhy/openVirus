<p id="Par2">Approximately 5.6% in the population in Kenya are infected by HIV-1, with a more than three-fold higher HIV-1 prevalence among so-called high-risk groups – including men who have sex with men (MSM), injecting drug users (IDU) and female sex workers

 </sup>. Modelling data on modes of HIV-1 transmission in Kenya have shown that at least one-third of all new infections occur among high-risk groups
