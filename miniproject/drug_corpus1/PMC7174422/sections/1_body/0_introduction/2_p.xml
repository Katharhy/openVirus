 </sup>. With few exceptions, most phylogenetic studies of the HIV-1 epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa have focused on understanding HIV-1 subtype diversity and prevalence of antiretroviral resistance mutations

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup>. Phylogenetic studies highlighting the dynamics of HIV-1 transmission and contribution of high-risk groups to onward viral transmission are common in North America and Europe, where largescale HIV-1 sequence data are available
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
 </sup>. Due to the limited availability of HIV-1 sequences from sub-Saharan Africa, only a few phylogenetic studies have assessed the dynamics of the HIV-1 epidemic in the region
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>
 </sup>. Transmission networks studies in Kenya have demonstrated clustering of MSM sequences with evidence of transmission between different geographical regions, and limited mixing between MSM and HET

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>. We have also demonstrated extensive clustering of HIV-1 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences from MSM who have sex with only men and MSM who have sex with both men and women in coastal Kenya
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
 </sup>. Given that many MSM on the coast of Kenya have sex with both men and women, there is a possibility of HIV-1 transmission linkages between MSM and the local HET community
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>. The primary objective of the current study was to investigate transmission networks within and between MSM, IDU, FSW, and HET in coastal Kenya using both newly generated and previously published HIV-1 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences. A secondary objective was to determine HIV-1 genetic diversity among different risk groups in coastal Kenya.
