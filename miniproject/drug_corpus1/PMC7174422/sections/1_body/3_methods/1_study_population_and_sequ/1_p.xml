 </sup>. All new sequences were collected from treatment-naïve men and women aged 18 years and over. HIV-1 diagnosis for samples collected before 2016 was done using two rapid antibody tests in parallel (Determine, Abbott Laboratories; Unigold, Trinity Biotech), with conflicting results resolved by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, Genetic System HIV-1/2 plus O EIA; Bio-Rad). HIV-1 diagnosis for samples collected after 2016 was made using the GeneXpert HIV-1 Qual (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
