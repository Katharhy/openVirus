 </sup>. Briefly, 100 µl of blood plasma was efficiently lysed in 1000 µl Qiazol Lysis Reagent (Qiagen). DNA was removed by treating the column with RNase-free DNase 1 (Qiagen) prior to RNA elution in 40 µl nuclease-free water. Reverse transcription and amplification of partial 
 <italic>pol</italic> gene were performed using the One-Step Superscript III RT/Platinum Taq High Fidelity Enzyme Mix (ThermoFisher Scientific
 <sup>TM</sup>) with the 
 <italic>pol</italic>-specific primer pair JA269 and JA272

 </sup>. First-round PCR products were amplified in a nested PCR with DreamTaq Green DNA Polymerase (ThermoFisher Scientific
 <sup>TM</sup>) using 
 <italic>pol-</italic>specific primers JA271 and JA270. PCR products were sequenced in both directions with the nested PCR primers using the BigDye terminator kit v1.1 (Applied Biosystems) and the sequences were determined on an ABI PRISM 3130×1 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).
