<p id="Par28">To estimate the dates of origin (time to most recent common ancestor; tMRCA) of the coastal Kenyan clusters, maximum clade credibility trees were generated using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach as implemented in BEASTv1.8.2

 </sup>. Based on marginal likelihood estimators for model selection and testing in BEAST, the Bayesian Skygrid model with an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock and inferred under the GTR + Γ4 + Ι substitution model was adopted as the best fit model for subsequent inferences. BEAST runs of 100–300 million generations were performed, logging samples after every 10000–30000 steps with the initial 10–30% discarded as burn-in. The convergence of MCMC parameter estimates was accessed based on effective sample size estimates (ESS &gt; 200) using Tracer v1.6

 </sup>. Trees were summarized in Tree-Annotator v1.8.2 (BEAST suite) and maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees were visualized in Figtree. We also aimed to dissect the demographic history of the only large coastal Kenya cluster identified. Since the sequences in this cluster did not contain temporal information (all IDU sequences were sampled in 2010), the node height posterior distribution (tMRCA) for the IDU cluster from the transmission clusters analysis described above was used as a tree-root height calibration prior (fixed the tree root height to 1985), guiding a skygrid analysis to estimate the effective population size (
