<p id="Par27">A previously described ML bootstrap approach was employed to determine the genetic diversity in the identified clusters

 </sup>. Briefly, all sequences in coastal Kenya transmission clusters were used to construct 1000 bootstrap ML phylogenies in Garli 2.0

 </sup>. Diversity estimates were determined in Perl (version 5.30.0) using in-house Perl and Bioperl scripts
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>
 </sup>. The diversity for each pre-defined cluster was estimated by averaging the pairwise tree-distances between the cluster-specific sequences in each bootstrap tree, resulting in 1000 diversity estimates per cluster. Next, the medians of these 1000 diversity estimates were determined for each cluster and then used in the analysis as previously described
