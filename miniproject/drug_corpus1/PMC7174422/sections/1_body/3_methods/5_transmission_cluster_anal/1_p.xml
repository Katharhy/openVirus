<p id="Par26">To detect local transmission clusters, newly generated and published HIV-1 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences were combined into one coastal Kenya sequence dataset. In addition, the ten most similar GenBank reference sequences for each coastal Kenya sequence were obtained through BLAST

 </sup>. The unique coastal Kenya sequences and the reference sequences were aligned and analysed to determine HIV-1 transmission clusters. Subtype-specific maximum-likelihood phylogenies were reconstructed in PhyML. For each subtype, transmission clusters were manually determined by inspecting the ML tree from root to terminal tips to ensure sequences clustered with high branch support. Monophyletic clades with aLRT-SH support ≥0.9 and which were dominated (≥80%) by sequences from coastal Kenya (compared to reference sequences) were defined as coastal Kenya transmission clusters

 </sup>. To determine active transmission clusters, sequences were further explored using a genetic distance threshold (≤1.5%) and aLRT-SH branch support of ≥0.9 in Cluster Picker
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>
 </sup>. Transmission networks were classified based on the number of sequences per cluster into dyads (2 sequences), networks (3–14 sequences) and large clusters (&gt;14 sequences)
