<p id="Par29">Frequencies and percentages were used to describe the distribution of sequences within the study population by risk group, HIV-1 subtype, calendar year of sampling and county of sampling. A logistic regression model was used to assess factors associated with clustering. Variables with P-values &lt;0.1 in the bivariable analysis were included in the multivariable model. A P-value of &lt;0.05 was defined as statistically significant. A Kruskal-Wallis H test and a post hoc Dunnâ€™s test (with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons) were conducted to determine differences in genetic diversity estimates among clusters from multiple risk groups. Statistics were done using Stata version 15 and RStudio (version 1.2.5001), and the packages:
