<p id="Par12">Among the 61 clusters defined by risk group, we identified 34 potentially active clusters as (determined by low genetic distance &lt;1.5%), suggesting ongoing transmission at the time of sample collection. Stratification of the potentially active clusters by risk-group showed: Eight MSM dyads and five MSM networks; four IDU dyads; five FSW dyads; and seven HET dyads and two HET networks. Potentially active clusters with sequences from different risk groups included one FSW/HET network and two MSM/HET networks (Supplementary TableÂ
