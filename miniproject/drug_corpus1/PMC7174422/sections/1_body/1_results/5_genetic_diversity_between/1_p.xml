<p id="Par11">To further dissect differences in clustering patterns between risk groups, we determined the average genetic diversity in the identified clusters. A previously described ML bootstrap approach was employed to determine the genetic diversity (based on 1000 ML bootstrap trees)

 </sup>. The median genetic diversity was 0.009 substitutions/site (s/s, IQR: 0.005–0.017 s/s) for MSM clusters, 0.03 s/s (IQR: 0.02–0.055 s/s) for IDU clusters, 0.008 s/s (IQR: 1×10
 <sup>–8</sup>–0.018 s/s) for FSW clusters, 0.015 s/s (IQR: 0.006–0.023 s/s) for HET clusters, and 0.018 s/s (IQR: 0.013–0.024 s/s) for mixed clusters. A Kruskal-Wallis H test showed that the distribution of genetic diversity differed across the five groups (χ
