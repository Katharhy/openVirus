<p id="Par7">Transmission networks were classified based on the number of sequences per cluster into dyads (2 sequences), networks (3–14 sequences), and large clusters (&gt;14). Of the 658 coastal Kenyan sequences, 206 sequences (31%) formed 61 statistically supported clusters (size range: 2–41 sequences). These included 39 dyads (64% of all clusters), 21 networks (34%), and one large cluster (2%) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). Most of the clusters were found among the subtype A sequences (N = 50, 82%), followed by the subtype D sequences (N = 7, 11%), and the subtype C sequences (N = 4, 7%) (Supplementary Fig.
