<p id="Par8">Stratification by risk group showed two distinct clustering patterns (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The first pattern represented exclusive within-risk group clustering, where sequences in a cluster belonged exclusively to one specific risk group. Compared to HET sequences, MSM and IDU sequences were more likely to cluster (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 25.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 10–63.9, P &lt; 0.001; and aOR 31.5, CI 12.2–81.6, P &lt; 0.001, respectively, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Of the 61 clusters observed, 85% were risk group exclusive clusters. These included 24 MSM clusters (11 dyads and 13 networks), four IDU clusters (three dyads and one large cluster), six FSW clusters (six dyads), and 18 HET clusters (13 dyads and five networks). The majority of the MSM sequences (N = 84, 64%) formed small independent clusters ranging in size from two to nine sequences per cluster. Likewise, the majority of IDU sequences (N = 47, 82%) formed clusters. Interestingly, most of the clustering IDU sequences were of sub-subtype A1 and formed one single large cluster (N = 41, 80%). In contrast, only a small proportion of the FSW (N = 22, 20%) and HET (N = 67, 18%) sequences formed risk group-exclusive clusters.
