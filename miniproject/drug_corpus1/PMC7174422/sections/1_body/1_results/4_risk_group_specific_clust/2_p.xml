<p id="Par9">In addition to risk group-exclusive clustering, 15% of all clusters were mixed between risk-groups (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>): Two (3%) MSM/FSW dyads, four (7%) MSM/HET mixed clusters (two dyads and two networks), and three (5%) FSW/HET clusters (two dyads and one network). Of relevance, both MSM/HET networks (one sub-subtype A1 and one subtype D) had sequences from four MSM and one HET female. Moreover, of the eleven MSM sequences that were found in mixed clusters, eight (73%) reported sex work in the three months preceding sample collection, and 10 (91%) reported bisexual behaviour. The FSW/HET network consisted of two FSW sequences and one HET male sequence.
