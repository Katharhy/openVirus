<p id="Par4">The analysed 658 coastal Kenyan HIV-1 partial 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences included both newly generated (N = 163) and previously published sequences (N = 495). Sequences were collected during 2005–2019 in the Mombasa (N = 210, 32%) and Kilifi (N = 448, 68%) counties in coastal Kenya (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The risk groups included MSM (N = 131, 20%), IDU (N = 58, 9%), FSW (N = 109, 17%), and HET (N = 360, 55%). Based on size estimation of risk groups and the number of infected populations infected with HIV-1 in Mombasa and Kilifi counties
