<p id="Par5">Phylogenetic analysis was used to determine the subtype distribution in the full coastal Kenya sequence dataset (N = 658). In total, 431 subtype A (66%), 46 subtype C (7%), 69 subtype D (10%), 2 subtype G (&gt;1%), and 110 CRF and unique recombinant form (URFs, 17%) sequences were identified (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). In addition, all subtype A sequences belonged to sub-subtype A1. Detailed recombination analyses of newly generated sequences demonstrated extensive recombination between subtypes, sub-subtypes, and recombinant forms (Supplementary Table
