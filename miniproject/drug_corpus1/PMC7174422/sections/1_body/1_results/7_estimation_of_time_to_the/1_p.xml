<p id="Par13">To gain insight into the evolutionary dynamics of the identified transmission clusters, we determined the evolutionary rate and the tMRCA of the clusters by Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. The median tMRCA of the 61 coastal Kenya clusters indicated that HIV-1 has been introduced in coastal Kenya several times over a period of 27 years (1985–2012, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). Only one cluster was large enough to allow for in-depth phylodynamic analysis. This cluster comprised 41 IDU sequences and the tMRCA for this cluster was determined to be 1987 (95% higher posterior density [HPD] interval: 1985–1990) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) with a median evolutionary rate of 6.4 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> substitutions/site/year (HPD interval: 3.9 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> − 1.1 × 10
 <sup>−2</sup>). The Skygrid analysis indicated that the number of IDU contributing to new HIV-1 infections over time increased gradually from 1987 to 2010.
