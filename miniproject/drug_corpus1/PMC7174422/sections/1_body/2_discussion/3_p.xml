<p id="Par16">Although we found several instances of mixed clusters, the majority of the coastal Kenya clusters represented within-risk-group HIV-1 transmission. MSM-exclusive and IDU-exclusive clusters were more common than FSW and HET clusters. High rates of clustering among MSM and IDU have been described before, both in our setting and elsewhere, and have been linked to an elevated risk of infection among MSM and IDU within close networks

 </sup>. Whereas the MSM sequences were found in several smaller clusters, the vast majority of the IDU sequences formed one large cluster. This suggests that the majority of the HIV-1 IDU epidemic in Coastal Kenya was introduced from one single source followed by a long-term gradual spread within the IDU population â€“ a pattern that distinguishes IDU transmission from that of other risk groups in coastal Kenya. In contrast to previous studies where IDU sequences clustered with very low genetic diversity

 </sup>, IDU clusters in our analysis had the highest genetic diversity compared to the other analysed risk groups. This indicates that the elapsed time between HIV-1 infection and sample collection may have been longer among IDUs, and/or that the proportion of collected IDU sequences in relation to the true number of IDUs was lower compared to other risk groups. The underlying reasons for this are unknown and warrant further investigation. However, with or without missing links, such clustering pattern is indicative of long-standing HIV-1 transmission linked with intravenous drug use in coastal Kenya
