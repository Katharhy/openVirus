<p id="Par14">In this study, we found several HIV-1 links between MSM/HET, HET/FSW, and MSM/FSW, indicating mixing between these risk groups in coastal Kenya. Sequences from HET females in clusters dominated by MSM sequences provided evidence for heterosexual linkages in these clusters. The majority of the MSM in mixed clusters also reported having female sexual partners, indicating that this group, in addition to female sex workers, could be an important transmission link to the HET epidemic
