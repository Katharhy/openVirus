<p id="Par19">In conclusion, we demonstrated that there is HIV-1 mixing between high-risk groups and heterosexual populations in coastal Kenya, with frequent within-risk-group transmission. We highlight that high-risk groups could contribute to the epidemic either through seeding and maintaining new infections within their own risk group or through linking infections across different risk groups. It is possible that HIV-1 prevention programmes targeting FSW, MSM and IDU populations could reduce overall HIV-1 transmission in coastal Kenya. As more sequences become available from wider geographic regions, further and larger studies with uniform sampling densities across different risk groups will be necessary to estimate the impact of mixing between risk groups and the general population on HIV-1 spread and to determine the source populations that could most effectively be targeted to mitigate new infections in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
