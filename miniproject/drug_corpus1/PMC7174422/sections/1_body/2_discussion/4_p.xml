<p id="Par17">This is the first study in Africa to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of an HIV-1 sub-epidemic among IDU. The phylodynamic analysis indicated a steady increase in the epidemic among IDU in coastal Kenya from 1987 to 2010, with no evidence of a rapid exponential increase in the number infections that is typical of HIV-1 outbreaks among IDUs

 </sup>. Still, the gradual increase in infections among IDU is compatible with a known period of increased injection of heroin in the region

 </sup>. Interestingly, and given a general absence of epidemiological surveillance data, new infections among IDU did not seem to decrease with the national rollout of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 2004. This could be a consequence of the unfavourable climate of stigma, discrimination and hostile legislation associated with IDU and most-at-risk-populations in Kenya, which impedes these populations from accessing medical services including ART

 </sup>. Opioid substitution therapy for IDU, Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) targeting all high-risk groups, and initiation of ART immediately upon diagnosis have all been introduced and scaled up after 2010, when the IDU samples used for this study were collected
