 </sup>. In the only previous study of phylogenetic HIV-1 transmission linkages between MSM and HET in coastal Kenya, Bezemer and colleagues only found one single transmission pair of an MSM and a known female partner. Hence, extensive mixing between the MSM and HET epidemics was not found in that study

 </sup>. In comparison, our analysis included a higher sampling density and availability of risk-group annotated sequences obtained in more recent years. This likely explains the significantly higher number of mixed clusters between MSM and HET sequences in the current study. In a broader context, our study complements existing research on the role of mixed networks in HIV-1 transmission – both globally and in sub-Saharan Africa
