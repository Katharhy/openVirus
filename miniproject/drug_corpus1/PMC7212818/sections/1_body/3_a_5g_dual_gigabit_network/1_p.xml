<p>On February 24, 2020, radiologists at WCHSU used the 5G Dual Gigabit network to remotely perform computed tomography (CT) on patients with COVID-19 at Ganzi People's Hospital in Ganzi County, Sichuan Province. To our knowledge, this is the first report of remote CT scanning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The experts at WCHSU were able to view the same images and data as the local clinicians at the same time, as well as remotely control the CT equipment at Ganzi Peopleâ€™s Hospital. On March 2, 2020, WCHSU clinicians remotely performed CT scanning of a COVID-19 patient at Huangzhou General Hospital in Huanggang City, Hubei Province. So far, 152 patients at hospitals in the telemedicine network have undergone remote CT scanning under the control and guidance of WCHSU physicians.</p>
