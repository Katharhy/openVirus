<p>Hospitals are a potential source of COVID-19 cross-infection. To reduce accumulation of people in outpatient clinics during the pandemic, WCHSU and other major Chinese hospitals began to offer online consultations and internet-based drug prescription and delivery service for patients with common and chronic diseases since February 1, 2020. The internet-based services are offered through the hospitalsâ€™ websites, WeChat accounts, and widely used apps such as Huayitong. By March 23, 2020, 31,905 patients had received prescriptions or medicines through this service. This telemedicine service reduces the number of patient visits, eases overcrowding in outpatient centers, and allays worry among patients with chronic disease.</p>
