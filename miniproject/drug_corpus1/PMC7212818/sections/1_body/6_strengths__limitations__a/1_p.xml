<p>Pandemics pose unique challenges to health care delivery. As our experiences from Western China illustrate, although telemedicine will not solve all challenges, it can provide rapid access to specialists who are unavailable in person. With the rapid development of the internet and smartphone apps, telemedicine has transitioned to a multimodal paradigm, offering greater possibilities and convenience. The successes of telemedicine in Western China may provide a useful reference for other parts of the world. Prerequisites for success include sufficient financial resources, technological infrastructure, and overall arrangement of policymakers.</p>
