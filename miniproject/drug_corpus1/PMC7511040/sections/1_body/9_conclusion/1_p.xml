<p>The COVID-19 pandemic poses a major impact on health care systems around the globe. Multiple treatment strategies have been published, but results have been variable. Some of the pharmacological agents used in COVID-19 treatment carry arrhythmogenic risks and can cause malignant ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.
