<p>Hydroxychloroquine sulfate, a derivative of chloroquine, is known to be used as an immunomodulating agent for autoimmune diseases with less significant effects on the QT interval compared to chloroquine. It has been used experimentally in the treatment of COVID-19 in combination with azithromycin and antiviral agents.

 </sup> Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are metabolised by CYP3A4, and beside the arrhythmic risks, both have the potential of causing direct myocardial injury. The major arrhythmic risk is attributed to torsade de pointes (TdP), especially in patients at risk of QT prolongation.
