<p>Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (a CYP2D6-inhibiting agent) has been widely used as an anti-malarial drug. It also interferes with virus-receptor binding and shows potential effectiveness as anti-viral therapy. Chloroquine is well known for its modest effect on prolonging the QT interval due to its hERG (coded by the

Chloroquine may also increase the concentration of beta-blockers that are metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP2D6 (such as metoprolol, carvedilol, propranolol, or labetalol), and for this reason, heart rate and blood pressure should be monitored carefully.
