<p>If measures to mitigate QT prolongation are necessary they should not increase the risk of exposure to health-care staff or other patients to SARS-CoV-2.

 </sup> When it is necessary to obtain a 12-lead ECG approach, one ECG machine should be designated for suspected COVID-19 patients and the number of personnel limited to minimize the exposure risk and protective equipment consumption. We encourage the use of real-time QTc monitoring if the telemetry system is equipped with this feature and using lead II for QT measurement.

 </sup> This will not only eliminate exposure risk and protective equipment use, but also allow for more frequent QT assessments (e.g. once per shift) thereby allowing early detection of QT prolongation and earlier implementation of countermeasures.
