<p>On March 11th, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was a global pandemic. No pharmacological agents have yet been proven to be safe and effective for the treatment of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. However, a number of off-label therapeutic regimens have been tried and have shown potential efficacy in treating high-risk patients diagnosed with COVID-19. While no proven effective intervention exists, it is appropriate ethically to offer these experimental interventions to COVID-19 patients after taking into account all legal considerations. As it is not possible to initiate well-controlled clinical studies during an emerging pandemic, the experimental intervention should be documented, and the efficacy and safety should be monitored.
