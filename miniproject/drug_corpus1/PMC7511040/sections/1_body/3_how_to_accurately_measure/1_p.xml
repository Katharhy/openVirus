<p>As the current pandemic continues and these drugs are prescribed “off-label” as treatment or as prophylaxis, correct QTc (heart rate-corrected QT interval) interpretation becomes a fundamental clinical skill for all physicians involved in the care of these patients. The end of the T wave is not always easy to define; therefore measuring the QT interval can be subjective.

 </sup> The method that is being used for baseline QT measurement should be documented and used in all following ECGs to limit subjective variabilities. The QT interval can be measured manually by different methods, such as the tangent (QTTan) and threshold (QTThres) methods.

 </sup> If the T wave is notched, the second component of the T wave (T2) is always included in the QT interval. If, however, the U wave is less than one-half the height of the T wave, it should be ignored. The end of the T wave by the tangent method is defined as the point where the tangent on the steepest point of the terminal limb of the T wave intersects with the isoelectric baseline (

 </sup> The lead with the longest QT interval should be used for QT measurement to avoid underestimation of QT interval. Lead II and V5 in the 12-lead ECG is most commonly used to evaluate the QT accurately when compared to other leads.
