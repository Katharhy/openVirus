<p>The goal of QT surveillance is to identify patients who have abnormal repolarization at baseline or on therapy in whom serial ECGs and QT prolongation countermeasures may be needed. A baseline QT interval measurement via a 12-lead ECG should be obtained before administration of COVID-19 pharmacotherapies, particularly in hospitalized patients. A QT interval above the 99th percentile value for healthy individuals (i.e., 460 milliseconds in pre-pubertal females and males, 470 milliseconds in post-pubertal males, and 480 milliseconds in post-pubertal females) may signal an individual at increased risk for TdP.

 </sup> In patients with a QT interval less than the 99th percentile, the risk of TdP is low and COVID-19 pharmacotherapies may be initiated at once. Patients with QT intervals &gt;500 millisecond (and narrow QRS) are at risk of drug-induced TdP and sudden death, and every effort should be done to mitigate this risk (check and correct any electrolyte derangement and discontinue unnecessary QT prolonging medications).

 </sup> In patients with wide QRS (QRS &gt;120 ms) secondary to bundle branch block or pacing, a QTc of 550 ms is used as a cut-off for normal QTc. The decision to start QT-prolonging COVID-19 pharmacotherapies in these patients lies with the treating clinician. When the benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of arrhythmias, it would be prudent to start with single therapy rather than combination therapy, along with close monitoring (
