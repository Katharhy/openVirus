<p>While there is a real, albeit low risk of drug-induced TdP with the use of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and lopinavir/ritonavir, small uncontrolled trials suggest a reduction in viral load and potential clinical benefit.

 </sup> The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a high demand on healthcare systems and shortage of personal protective equipment and even healthcare providers. If these medications reduce the morbidity and mortality even slightly, this would represent a significant net benefit when compared to the risk of drug-induced life-threatening arrhythmia, especially if measures to mitigate this risk are undertaken. This eventually comes down to identifying high-risk groups and implementing QT surveillance during therapy.
