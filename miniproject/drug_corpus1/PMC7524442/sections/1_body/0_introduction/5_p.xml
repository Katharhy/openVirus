 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], CRS has been described after administration of several antibody-based therapies such as rituximab [

 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], muromomab [

 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], brentuximab [
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Anticancer non-protein-based treatment with oxaliplatin [
 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and IMiDs (lenalidomide) [
 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] can activate cytokine storm as well. Furthermore, CRS was reported in stem cell transplantation and graft-versus-host disease. As mentioned above, cytokine storm is also a proposed pathomechanism of severe viral infections due to massive T cell stimulation. It is supposed to be combined with all influenza epidemics since Spanish flu in 1919 through dengue, Ebola to corona virus infection in 2020 [
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. CRS has been observed also in surgical patients with severe bacterial infections or in patients with inhalation injury [
