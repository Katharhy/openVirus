<p id="par0105">The Janus kinases (JAKs) transduce cytokine-induced signals from specific receptors that bind a broad array of cytokines, including those involved in almost all forms of CRS. Based on their essential roles in transmitting, the JAKs might become a target for pharmacologic manipulation not only in inﬂammatory diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis) and in myeloproliferative disorders (myelofibrosis, polycytaemia vera) but also in the management of cytokine storm. There are several antibody-based TH17 blockades (anti IL-17, anti IL-17R and anti IL-12/23p40) available; however, the antibody-based treatment is expensive and has only a narrow spectrum of effects [
 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Therefore, treatment by JAK inhibitors is tested to restrict the pro-inflammatory function of existing TH17 cells. Treatment with the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib signiﬁcantly reduced the symptoms of disease and prolonged survival time in experimental murine model. Ruxolitinib diminished pro-inflammatory cytokine production, mitigating the cytokine-driven hyperinflammation that occurs in various cytokine release syndromes [

 <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Since April 2020, three new, currently recruiting clinical trials are available on ClinicalTrial.gov (accessed 26 August 2020) focusing on treatment COVID-19 associated cytokine storm with ruxolitinib as monotherapy (NCT04362137, NCT04361903, NCT04334044 - see 
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Except for ruxolitinib, even baricitinib and fedratinib are potent and selective JAK inhibitors approved for indications in rheumatology and hematology. All three are powerful anti-inflammatory drugs that, as JAK–STAT signaling inhibitors, are likely to be effective against the consequences of the elevated levels of cytokines in various forms of CRS, not excluding viral etiology (COVID-19). Although the three candidates have similar JAK inhibitor potencies, Stebbing et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] suggests, due to a high affinity for AAK1, baricitinib as the best of the group, especially given its once-daily oral dosing and acceptable side-effect profile. Two Italian studies (NCT04320277, NCT04358614) are registered for clinical testing of baricitinib and its effect on reduction of cytokine release. The second one is focused on reduction of ICU patient admission with COVID-19 associated moderate pneumonia. The last of three above mentioned JAK2 inhibitors which are used to restrict the pro-inflammatory function of existing TH17 cells is fedratinib. Fedratinib is approved in U.S. for myeloproliferative neoplasms. Wu and Yang [
 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] found that fedratinib treatment decreased in vitro the expression of IL-17 by murine TH17 cells. He supposed fedratinib suppresses TH17 associated cytokine pathways (including the effect of IL-6 on cells) and so could prevent the harmful effect of TH17 associated cytokine storm. A recent study has been published (phase I) for itacitinib, selective JAK-1 inhibitor in GVHD [
 <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. At that stage, no information concerning cytokine release syndrome has been obtained.
