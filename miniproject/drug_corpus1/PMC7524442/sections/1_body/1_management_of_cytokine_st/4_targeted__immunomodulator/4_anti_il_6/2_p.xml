<p id="par0090">Tocilizumab remains the most commonly used therapy for systemic treatment of CRS. Multiple studies conﬁrmed the correlation of peak IL-6 levels with the severity of CRS leading to the approval of tocilizumab for treatment of CRS concurrent with the approval of tisagenlecleucel, CAR T-cell therapy in non-Hodgkin lymphomas (DLBCL) [

Since April 2020, newly opened clinical trial “Efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in the treatment of SARS-Cov-2 related pneumonia (TOSCA)” (NCT04332913) might show a rationale for those patients who develop CRS, blocking the complications caused by high levels of IL-6, and possibly preventing the development of a multi-organ failure. Two other studies recruit patients with the aim to influence CRS in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT) (NCT03533101) and in CAR-T cell therapy pediatric patients with CD19 expressing relapsed and refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (NCT02906371). Other molecule which could manage CRS is siltuximab, a murine chimeric moAb which is an IL-6 antagonist. According to a survey published by special interest group of American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation Pharmacy, siltuximab should be considered for cases of tocilizumab-refractory CRS. The liable favour of siltuximab is its direct binding to IL-6 whereas tocilizumab binds to IL-6R which may result in increased IL-6 levels [
