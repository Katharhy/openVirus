<p id="par0080">Although immunomodulatory therapy is not routinely recommended, majority of clinical trials on CRS are focused on direct influencing highly elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-18, TNF-α, indirectly by modulation of INF-γ production or by interfering NF-κB through JAK inhibitors. If possible, it is critical to intervene prior to the initiation of CRS and severe respiratory distress mainly in patients at high risk of worsening. To increase the chances of survival of such patients, the compassionate use of available drugs is required, based on literature data and current experience of many clinicians. Patients with cytokine release syndrome secondary to viral etiology, show increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines similar to that found in patients who develop CRS secondary to CAR-T cell therapy [
