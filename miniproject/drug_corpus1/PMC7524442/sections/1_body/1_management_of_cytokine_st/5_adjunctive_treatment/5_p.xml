Similar unexplicit results were published by He et al. in metaanalysis upon clinical evidence that even though ulinastatin, a serine protease inhibitor, suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokine elevation and upregulates the release of anti-inflammatory mediators. Because of the poor quality of the evaluated trials and the small cohorts, their findings should be interpreted cautiously [
