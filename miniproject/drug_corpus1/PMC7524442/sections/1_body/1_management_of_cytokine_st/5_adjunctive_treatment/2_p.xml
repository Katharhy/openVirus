<p id="par0110">Solitary trials registered on Clinical trial.gov are focused on adjunctive treatment. One study is being prepared for using immunonutrition (n3- fatty acids and antioxidant vitamins in extraordinary doses) on modulation of cytokine production. Such specific nutrients are capable to modulate the host immune response and ameliorate the cytokine storm (NCT01752348). Two others evaluate the effect of vitamin D on selected cytokines involved in cytokine storm in the Covid-19 (NCT04366908, NCT04476745).</p>
