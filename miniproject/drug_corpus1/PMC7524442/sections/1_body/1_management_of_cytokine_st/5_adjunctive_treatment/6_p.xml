<p id="par0130">Based on promising results in preclinical models by adjunctive immunomodulatory treatment, novel innovative approaches will emerge. Additional research is clearly needed to fully understand the mechanisms of intensive rise of cytokine storm and search for appropriate treatment options. Some preclinical studies are encouraging. Decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1 in cell cultures of human monocytes was observed after incubation with manomycin A, a polyketide antibiotic, with known potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effect [

Indeed, antimicrobials with immunomodulatory effect, such as manumycin A might have potential clinical importance and should be evaluated in further not only experimental studies. Other experimental studies show that PPAR-g agonist (pioglitazone) reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine production and increases the survival of influenza infected mice by 20â€“40% [
