<p id="par0135">Cytokine release syndrome is a sudden onset of almost life-threatening clinical symptomatology which can occur within diverse external or internal conditions. Early identification of rising state and multilevel course of treatment is imperative. Strictly immunologic approach is necessary mainly when considering immunomodulatory treatment. At present, the most widely used molecule for systemic treatment of CRS remains tocilizumab. Its FDA and EMA approval for the treatment of cytokine storm after CAR-T cell therapy gives us a promise for the future. The only exact knowledge about immunologic processes gives us possibilities for combination of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical and adjunctive treatment in successful fight with consequences of CRS. Further work is needed to cut off the signaling pathways that lead to “cytokine storm” and to determine how these effector molecules can be most effectively targeted to help resolve this frequently fatal episode of inﬂammation. It is a huge need for all scientists and clinicians to establish a physiological rational for new therapeutic targets and understanding of exact genetics as well as epigenetic factors that might lead to more personalized medicine approaches.</p>
