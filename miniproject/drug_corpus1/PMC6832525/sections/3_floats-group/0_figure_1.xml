  <p>Phylogenetic relationships within the 
   <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>. The evolutionary tree presented was generated using MEGA7 [
   <xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] from a conserved region of the viral RNA dependant RNA polymerase (RdRp: NS5 or NS5B) and represents 
   <italic>n</italic> = 125 members of the 
   <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>. The in-frame nucleotide alignment was downloaded from 
   <uri xlink:href="https://talk.ictvonline.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://talk.ictvonline.org/</uri>, adjusted manually, and all positions containing gaps or missing data were eliminated prior to analyses (734 sites in the final dataset). The resulting phylogeny was inferred via the Maximum Likelihood Composite method under the GTR+I+Î“ model of nucleotide substitution to account for evolutionary rate differences among sites. The genera 
   <italic>Pegivirus</italic>, 
   <italic>Hepacivirus</italic>, 
   <italic>Pestivirus</italic> and 
   <italic>Flavivirus</italic> are color-coded, in addition to distinct lineages within the genus 
   <italic>Flavivirus</italic>. Statistical robustness of highlighted groupings was determined using the bootstrap approach and values assigned to these branches are percentages derived from 500 replications. Branch lengths are proportional to the scale bar (units: substitutions per site).
