 <caption>
  <p>YFV E protein structures with 17D attenuating mutations and fusion peptide highlighted. (
   <bold>A</bold>) The structure of the YFV-17D E protein pre-fusion monomer is presented with DI, DII and DIII highlighted in different colors. YFV-17D-attenuating mutations are highlighted on the E structure in orange while the fusion peptide is highlighted in pink. Pre-fusion E dimers are presented directly below. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The structure of the YFV-17D E protein post-fusion monomer is presented with DI, DII and DIII, highlighted in different colors. Again, attenuating mutations are highlighted on the structure in orange while the fusion peptide is highlighted in pink. Post-fusion E trimers are positioned directly below with both top (left) and side (right) views presented. The YFV E structures presented were previously described in [
   <xref rid="B54-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] (PDB IDs: 6IW1 and 6IW4) and the presented figures were generated in UCSF Chimera [
   <xref rid="B55-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].
