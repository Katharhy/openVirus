<p>In addition to diagnosis and outbreak surveillance, the application of NGS to longitudinal and cross-sectional monitoring of infected patient cohorts can facilitate advances in our understanding of within-host viral evolution. Despite near-perfect environmental conditions, including the presence of replication-competent 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> vector species, YFV outbreaks in Asia remain conspicuously absent. However, import of YFV from the Angolan outbreak to China was recorded for the first time in 2016 [

 <xref rid="B232-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">232</xref>]. Using Illumina sequencing to follow virus evolution in 12 imported YFV cases revealed the infecting strains were closely related to each other and possessed limited divergence from the Angola 1971 strain (three amino acid substitutions) despite a 45-year period between samplings [

 <xref rid="B233-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">233</xref>]. The action of strong purifying selection was detected throughout viral genomes, with intra-host variation dominated by synonymous substitutions [
 <xref rid="B233-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">233</xref>]. In agreement with these observations, the evolutionary rate of YFV has been shown to be lower than that of DENV [
 <xref rid="B234-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">234</xref>] and the YFV RdRp possesses high fidelity [
 <xref rid="B223-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">223</xref>]. In addition, sequential bottlenecks associated with vector-host switching could potentially select for variants with an enhanced capacity for transmission, reducing variation. Constraints on YFV evolution could also be mediated by the requirement for interactions with host-dependency factors essential for replication and dissemination in both mammals and arthropods, coupled with a limited duration of infection in human hosts.
