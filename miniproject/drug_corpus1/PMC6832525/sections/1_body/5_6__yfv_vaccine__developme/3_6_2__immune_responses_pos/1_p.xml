<p>When humans are vaccinated with YFV-17D, anti-yellow fever serum is detected as early as 2 days post immunization [

 <xref rid="B165-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>]. It induces low-grade viremia in half of the vaccines and elicits protective neutralizing antibody (nabs) levels in 99% patients [
 <xref rid="B166-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>]. Nabs represent the main correlates of protection induced by YFV-17D. These are quantified using plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT) demonstrating robust responses as early as 6 days following vaccination and peaking in titer after 30 days, suggesting a functional memory response [

 <xref rid="B167-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>]. While the humoral arm of vaccine-induced immunity has been studied in detail, a role for T cells is expected in the development of nabs [

The role of other cell types, including NK cells and monocytes, has been inferred in generating protective responses post YFV-17D vaccination. A role for TLRs in NK cell activation was identified in YFV-17D-induced immune responses and may contribute to protective immunological memory [
 <xref rid="B172-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]. Indeed, a systems biology approach indicates a coordinated induction of transcription factors precedes a broad persistent immune response that incorporates all effector cells of the immune system [
