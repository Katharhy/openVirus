Usually, a single dose confers life-long immunity, but a booster is recommended every 10 years for people at risk of exposure or people who were infected with HIV when they received their last dose. Additional doses can also be administered to people who receive hematopoietic stem cell transplants after receiving the vaccine and who are immunocompetent [
