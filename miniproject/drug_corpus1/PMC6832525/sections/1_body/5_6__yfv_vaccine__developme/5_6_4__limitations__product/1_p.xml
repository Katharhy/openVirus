<p>The disease has re-emerged as a public health threat in recent decades, triggered by different factors, such as climate change, increasing population movement and expanding ranges of mosquito vectors. It is estimated that vaccine manufactures can produce a combined 80 million doses per year [
 <xref rid="B160-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>]. However, as YFV-17D-based vaccines are still produced in chicken eggs, this results in issues with supply and demand during outbreaks due to limited production capabilities [
 <xref rid="B187-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>]. Another limiting issue during current production is the stability of live-attenuated vaccines. Antigen instability is an inherent attribute of vaccines, compounded by a requirement for conformationally correct three-dimensional structures that elicit protective host responses to these complex bio-therapeutics. Therefore, more stable vaccines with reduced dependency on the cold chain represent an area for future vaccine development [

Thermal stability is important for the manufacture, distribution and administration of vaccines, especially in tropical developing countries where adverse field conditions exist. Current live-attenuated vaccines exhibit relatively poor liquid stability in clinical settings, and clinicians are instructed to discard the YFV-17D vaccine one hour after reconstitution [
 <xref rid="B189-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>]. This issue can be best addressed by stabilization. Indeed, poliovirus has been experimentally stabilized by the addition of pirodavir and deuterium oxide, with viral RNA and viral capsid resisting a 10-h incubation at 42 Â°C [
