<p>To overcome production limitations and reduce adverse reactions, alternative vaccination approaches should be explored, including vaccinia vector-based systems, DNA vaccines, inactivated 17D vaccines and recombinant subunit vaccines produced in both mammalian cells and plants [

 <xref rid="B208-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">208</xref>]. In line with this, current efforts to develop a new inactivated YF vaccine to reduce serious adverse events have shown good immunogenicity in preclinical and clinical studies [

 <xref rid="B211-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">211</xref>]. In addition, DNA-launched vaccine technology has the advantages of both traditional DNA and live-attenuated vaccines. This platform minimizes the potential for reversions or adverse effects of traditional live-attenuated vaccine, ensures genetic stability, and results in efficient immunization in animal models [

 <xref rid="B214-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">214</xref>]. Therefore, as an alternate to conventional attenuation approaches, codon re-encoding was developed with its basic principal to introduce synonymous mutations into the viral genome [
 <xref rid="B215-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">215</xref>] that would impose the least detrimental effects on viral fitness [
 <xref rid="B216-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">216</xref>]. This approach has been applied to other RNA viruses, including chikungunya (CHIKV) and TBEV [
