<p>In addition to TLRs, the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2, which form part of the RIG-I like receptor (RLR) family, are critical for initiating the IFN response to infection via recognition of intracellular viral RNA [
 <xref rid="B125-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. While RIG-I recognizes dsRNA, which possesses a triphosphate and U or A-rich motifs, MDA5 preferentially recognizes long dsRNAs, [
 <xref rid="B126-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. Both RIG-1 and MDA5 have important roles in restricting flavivirus infections ([
 <xref rid="B127-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>] as reported for DENV [
 <xref rid="B128-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>], WNV [
 <xref rid="B129-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>] and JEV [
 <xref rid="B130-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]), interacting with both MAVS and STING to mediate their antiviral effects [
 <xref rid="B131-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. However, viral genome modifications can prevent RIG-I recognition, with cap1 2′O-methylation of YFV RNA constituting an RIG-I evasion mechanism [
 <xref rid="B132-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. Cyclic GMP-AMP synthetase (cGAS) is a cytoplasmic DNA sensor, synthesizing, 2′3′-cGAMP from ATP and GTP to mediate the activation of STING. After TBK1-mediated phosphorylation of IRF3, nuclear translocation of IRF3 and NF-κB induces type I-IFN and cytokine expression [
 <xref rid="B133-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. In addition to cytoplasmic DNA, cGAS has also been implicated in the recognition of RNA viruses, including flaviviruses: cGAS knockout mice were more susceptible to lethal WNV infection outcomes when compared to wild-type mice [
 <xref rid="B134-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>], and DENV is able to target cGAS for degradation via NS2B, inhibiting IFN production [
 <xref rid="B135-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>,
 <xref rid="B136-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. YFV NS4B exhibits strong homology with the C-terminus of STING and can inhibit its activity [
 <xref rid="B137-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. However, while human STING can be targeted for cleavage by ZIKV, DENV, WNV and JEV proteases, it is not susceptible to cleavage by either YFV-17D or YFV-Asibi proteases [
 <xref rid="B138-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. Finally, nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD) like receptors (NLRs), are cytoplasmic receptors that trigger the engagement of inflammasomes and signalosomes after the detection of viral danger signals. This occurs via activation of caspase-1, which mediates maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1β and IL-18) and secretion of the alarmin HMGB1 [
 <xref rid="B139-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. While inflammasome activation has been reported for WNV and DENV infection [
 <xref rid="B126-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>], the exact danger signals detected and its significance in YFV infection remains unclear. Together these studies implicate RLRs and the cGAS-STING axis as important modulators of YFV infection, although further investigation is required. Additionally, whether inflammasome activation is mediated by YFV replication warrants further study.
