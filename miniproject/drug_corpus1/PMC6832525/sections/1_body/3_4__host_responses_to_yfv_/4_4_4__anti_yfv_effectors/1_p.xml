<p>The mammalian chaperone protein DNAJC14 was demonstrated to confer protection from YFV-mediated cell-death via inhibition of YFV replication and possesses broad activity against diverse 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> members [
 <xref rid="B140-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. This factor is constitutively expressed and not IFN-inducible. The breadth and antiviral potency of over 380 human interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were tested against a panel of important pathogenic viruses, including YFV, using lentiviral overexpression systems in different cellular backgrounds [
 <xref rid="B141-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. This comprehensive study identified antiviral effectors which inhibited YFV replication, including IRF1, TREX1, IFITM3, RTP4, IFI6 and HPSE: in contrast, the IFN regulated genes APOBEC3A, FAM46C, IDO1, LY6E, MCOLN2 and ADAR genes enhanced YFV replication [

 <xref rid="B142-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. IFI6 has broad activity against 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> members but minimal activity against other viruses, interfering with flaviviral proteins when they invaginate ER membranes through interaction with the ER-resident heat shock protein 70 chaperone BiP [
 <xref rid="B142-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. Together, these results point to the complexity of the IFN system: expression of both pro- and anti-YFV effector genes are modulated by the type I IFN response. In addition, some genes have panflaviviral potency, while others are virus specific. The contribution of patient and tissue-specific differences in ISG expression to viral clearance and the correlation between ISG induction and differential disease outcomes is currently unclear.
