<p>Using paraffin-embedded liver tissue from patients who succumbed to fatal YFV disease, it was demonstrated that CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells represent the main infiltrating cell population into liver tissue, with a high proportion of cells expressing TGF-β and, to a lesser extent, TNF-α and IFN-γ [
