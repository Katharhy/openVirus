<p>The replication cycle of YFV is defined by multiple distinct stages, which are shared between divergent members of the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>. These include (a) attachment of the viral particle to target cells, (b) interaction with surface receptors for internalization, (c) fusion of viral and endosomal membranes and release of the nucleocapsid into cytoplasm, (d) disintegration of the nucleocapsid, (e) translation and replication of the viral genome, (f) assembly and maturation of viral particles and (g) release of nascent virions [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Currently, many of these stages are poorly defined for YFV, especially with respect to identification of co-opted host factors, which are essential at every stage of the life cycle. Additionally, how these processes differ between mosquitos and humans requires further investigation.
