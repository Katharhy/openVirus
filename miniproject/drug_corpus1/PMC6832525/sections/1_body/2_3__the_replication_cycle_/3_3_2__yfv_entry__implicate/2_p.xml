<p>Divergent entry mechanisms have been observed for even closely related YFV strains. The parental Asibi strain and the derived YFV-17D vaccine strain both infect permissive cells by a pH-dependent fusion mechanism, although these related viruses enter via distinct routes [
 <xref rid="B78-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Both strains enter in a dynamin-2 dependent fashion and traffic through Rab5- and Rab11-positive early and recycling endosomes. However, the wild-type Asibi strain enters via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, while YFV-17D utilizes a clathrin-independent route. YFV-17D also exhibits enhanced binding and entering capabilities in vitro, and initiates inflated antiviral responses when compared to its wild-type progenitor [
 <xref rid="B78-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. These divergent properties can be pin-pointed to eleven mutations within the E proteinâ€™s primary amino acid sequence (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00960-f002">Figure 2</xref>), which occurred during long-term passaging of the Asibi strain in mouse brains and chicken embryos to generate the attenuated YFV-17D derivate (see

 <xref rid="B78-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. In summary, mechanistic insights into the YFV infection process, in addition to many host factors implicated in YFV entry, have been described. Nevertheless, identification of 
 <italic>bona fide</italic> receptor(s) integral for YFV entry remains outstanding. The entry cascade of YFV is comprised of multiple steps which could be targeted by therapeutic intervention to inhibit further virus spreading within infected patients. For example, targeting the HCV entry factor CLDN1 via a mAb inhibited viral entry and promoted viral clearance in a humanized mouse model [
