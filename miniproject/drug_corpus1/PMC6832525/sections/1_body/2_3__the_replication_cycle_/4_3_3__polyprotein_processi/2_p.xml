<p>Flaviviral replication is coupled with the process of assembly [
 <xref rid="B107-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. Open pores on the lumen of virus-induced ER membrane vesicles allow spatial coordination between the replication and assembly processes [
 <xref rid="B108-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>], facilitating association of newly synthesized viral RNA with structural proteins to produce immature virions during virion assembly [
 <xref rid="B109-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>,
 <xref rid="B110-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. The viral lipid-envelope is acquired from the host cell by budding from the lumen of the ER [
 <xref rid="B111-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>] and virion maturation occurs through trans-Golgi network trafficking to the cellular surface, where furin cleavage of the pr peptide from the M protein produces a rearrangement of the E protein [
 <xref rid="B112-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>], generating infectious virions that are fusogenic under low pH conditions [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Viral replication, assembly, and maturation, as well as host factors essential for viral propagation, are potential targets for the development of anti-YFV drugs. However, a better understanding of determinants of viral replication and the virus-host interactome are required for YFV: many of the critical steps of the flavivirus replication cycle are described for DENV or WNV, but confirmation with YFV is lacking.
