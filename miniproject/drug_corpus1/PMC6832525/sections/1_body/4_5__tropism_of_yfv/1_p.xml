<p>In humans, after transcutaneous inoculation, YFV exhibits broad patterns of tissue tropism and is disseminated systemically via infection of multiple white cell subsets. With respect to organ tropism, the liver is the primary target, although the heart, kidneys, liver, spleen, and less frequently, the brain tissue, can support YFV replication [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The natural host range of YFV includes humans, non-human primates and mosquitos. Additionally, wild animals from the diverse orders Artiodactyla, Carnivora and the superorder Xenarthra have been reported to be serologically positive for anti-YFV antibodies, and the elicitation of antibody responses against YFV indicates a potentially productive infection within these species, indicating that diverse mammalian species could represent YFV potential reservoirs [
