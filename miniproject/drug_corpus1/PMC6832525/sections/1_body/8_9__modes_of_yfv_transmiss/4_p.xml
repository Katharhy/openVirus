<p>Arboviruses often replicate in mosquito mid-gut and targeting this site of viral replication via genetic modification represents another possible strategy for ablating vector-mediated transmission of YFV. Indeed, DENV dissemination and replication were restricted in transgenic 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitos ectopically expressing Loqs2, which interacts with intrinsically expressed Loquacious and r2d2 to restore efficient siRNA suppression of viral replication in the mosquito midgut [
 <xref rid="B247-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">247</xref>]. Furthermore, attenuated YFV-17D is able to replicate in mosquito mid-gut. However, in contrast to wild-type strains, the basal membrane of the midgut blocks YFV-17D dissemination to other tissues [
 <xref rid="B153-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>], indicating a loss of interaction with a co-opted mid-gut host factor during 17D attenuation. In the future, genetic modification of YFV 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> vector species using CRISPR/Cas9 [
 <xref rid="B222-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">222</xref>] could preferentially target co-opted factors in the mosquito midgut or other tissues which are essential YFV propagation and dissemination. The ability of researchers to identify such factors, which are currently unknown, is enhanced by an improved annotated genome for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="B248-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">248</xref>]. Indeed, these data identified gene loci potentially associated with DENV competence and insecticide resistance. In addition, quantification and comparison of gene expression profiles for distinct 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> tissues, from both male and female mosquitos at different stages of the reproductive cycle are described [
 <xref rid="B248-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">248</xref>,
 <xref rid="B249-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">249</xref>]. Together, these data highlight tissue- and sex-specific gene products, which could be further investigated to identify essential YFV replication cofactors in the mosquito mid-gut via iterative screening approaches. Genetically modified mosquitos with CRISPR/Cas9 targeted deletion of such factors could then be generated for replacement studies. In summary, targeting vector species, which have become resistant to traditional insecticides, will be key in reducing future YFV outbreaks. The future of eliminating YFV from endemic regions may involve the suppression or replacement of wild-type mosquitos with modified insects which are not competent for YFV replication. Furthermore, sequencing efforts to expand the number of annotated genomes from jungle-resident mosquito species should commence.
