<p>The 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> is a diverse group of small enveloped viruses representing over 100 species [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Viral genomes from 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> members are non-segmented positive-stranded RNAs ranging from ~9 to ~13 kb in length, and phylogenetic analyses of 125 family members revealed four well-supported genera: 
 <italic>Pestivirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Hepacivirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Pegivirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> (

 <xref rid="B10-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]). Members of the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> which cause a significant disease burden in humans are highlighted on the tree presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00960-f001">Figure 1</xref>. Genome organization and cytoplasmic replication on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes are conserved between divergent 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> members. However, host-range, tissue-tropism, pathogenicity and modes of transmission can differ greatly [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. YFV is a member of the 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus, which is composed of arboviruses exhibiting broad host ranges which can be transmitted to humans from animal reservoirs via insect vectors. This genus contains a number of important human pathogens which can cause acute infections, including dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00960-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Transmission is mediated via mosquito vectors and infection of humans can cause a range of clinical outcomes, ranging from asymptomatic to encephalitis (WNV, JEV and ZIKV) or fatal hemorrhagic fever (YFV and DENV).
