<p>Yellow fever was historically the first described viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) and its causative agent, the yellow fever virus (YFV), is the prototypic member of the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>. Pioneering experimental work in the 19th century identified the 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitos as the vector responsible for transmission to humans, facilitating subsequent eradication from Europe and North America [

 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], with over 900 million people currently living in endemic areas, 500 million of whom reside in Africa [
