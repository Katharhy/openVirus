<p>Infection with YFV has a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from entirely asymptomatic to hemorrhagic fever associated with high mortality rates. Indeed, estimates indicate only one symptomatic case for every 7–12 cases that remain clinically silent [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In the majority of symptomatic cases, YFV infection is a self-limiting disease with abrupt onset of fever and pain (predominantly myalgia, lumbosacral pain and headache with associated conjunctival injection) that occurs after an incubation period of 3–6 days. In this phase, YFV infection is difficult to diagnose, as symptoms are unspecific. The duration of fever is approximately three days, during which the patient is usually viremic [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Laboratory abnormalities during this “period of infection” include elevated liver enzymes, leukopenia and proteinuria. A phase of improvement, lasting up to two days, can be interposed but does not occur in all cases. In around 15% of patients, the disease progresses to a “toxic phase”, which is characterized by the return of fever, nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain and renal insufficiency [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This is characterized by systemic viscerotropic disease and liver injury is a hallmark of this phase [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], leading to jaundice and contributing to bleeding diathesis, which may lead to more severe hemorrhaging. It is not well understood why this phase occurs in some patients although host adaptive immune responses are believed to contribute to the severity [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], in addition to underlying genetic factors which predispose Caucasians to a higher mortality rate [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The case fatality rate of hospitalized patients ranges between 25% and 50% and is correspondingly higher in South America compared to Africa [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Mortality rates may depend on the virulence of the infecting strain, as well as the underlying intrinsic immunity and genetic factors of the exposed population. In addition, cross-immunity to other flaviviruses, such as DENV, is believed to reduce the severity of YFV infections [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Patients who survive the disease may suffer from fatigue and may have elevated liver enzymes for extended periods of time [
