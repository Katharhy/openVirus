<p>To visualize variability across YFV genomes and encoded polyproteins, similarity plots were generated from YFV nucleotide and amino acid alignments. Inspection of genetic and amino acid variability in globally sampled YFV isolates highlights conserved and variable regions in the genome and encoded polyprotein (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00960-f004">Figure 4</xref>b). Of note, YFV nucleotide variability is much greater than amino acid variability, indicating strong purifying selection shapes global patterns of YFV evolution. This is likely a reflection of the selective constraints imposed by the viral transmission cycle: YFV experiences sequential bottlenecks upon continued cycling through an insect vector, coupled with requirements for host factor compatibility in both vertebrates and arthropods. Furthermore, the YFV RdRp has a relatively high fidelity for an RNA virus, with an estimated mutation rate per site of 1.9–2.3 × 10
 <sup>−7</sup> [
 <xref rid="B223-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">223</xref>]. Together, these analyses indicate that both the structural and non-structural proteins of YFV exhibit extensive conserved regions which are therefore viable targets for pharmacological intervention. Consequently, the development or repurposing of direct-acting antiviral compounds targeting YFV proteins should represent an achievable goal. Indeed, it was previously noted that the RNA helicase domain of NS3, integral for RNA duplex unwinding during viral replication, has a conserved function in the

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00960-f004">Figure 4</xref>c, highlighting the conserved regions of this essential virtual protein. Together these analyses, conducted using sequence and structural data available in public databases, can inform rational development of antivirals targeting different components of the YFV virion or replication machinery. Currently, structural data is only available for YFV E, NS3 and NS5 proteins. The elucidation of structural information for the outstanding YFV proteins will expand the number of potential viral targets for future structure-based antiviral drug design studies.
