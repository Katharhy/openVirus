 <italic>n</italic> = 1112 YFV sequences were deposited on the NCBI GenBank sequence database. To assess patterns of globally sampled YFV diversity, we performed phylogenetic analyses of all available YFV full-length ORF sequences (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00960-f004">Figure 4</xref>a). Collapsed clades contain closely related isolates from recent Brazilian and Angolan outbreaks, in addition to 17D vaccine strains. Based on this analysis, global YFV sequences can be divided into six well-supported lineages: West African lineages I and II (WAL I and WAL II), South American lineages I and II (SAL I and SAL II), the East African lineage (EAL) and the Angola lineage (AL). In agreement with a previous phylogenetic analysis of partial [

 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], our expanded analysis illustrates that South American lineages are monophyletic, sharing a common ancestor with the West African lineages, and confirms a deep-divergence between these lineages and the more distantly related East African and Angolan strains, indicating an ancient separation. This observation is consistent with an African origin for YFV, with South American lineages representing historical import of West African YFV strains linked to European colonial expansions and the slave trade [
