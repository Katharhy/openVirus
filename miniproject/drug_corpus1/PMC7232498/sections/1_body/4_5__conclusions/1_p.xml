<p>This study is one of the first to highlight the prevalence and molecular characteristics of influenza B virus strains, especially the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes, which have circulated in Uruguay in recent years. Our findings, like those other studies, confirm the genetic variability of the influenza B viruses and show the importance of systematic epidemiological and molecular surveillance for the effective management of influenza epidemics. Understanding the different evolutionary behavior of the influenza viruses, and how they might interact, is clearly of importance in predicting their future impact on human populations, and may contribute to future vaccine design, and also for better monitoring in surveillance studies.</p>
