<p>Some differences were observed regarding the circulation of both lineages according to age. Although the proportions of cases fewer than 4 years were similar in both lineages (18%, 39/208 B/Victoria, 13% 27/208 B/Yamagata), patients aged between 5â€“14 years were most frequently infected by B/Victoria lineage (22% 46/208 B/Victoria, 11% 23/208 B/Yamagata).
