<p>The mean and median ages for the IBV detected were 22 and eight years, respectively. For ILI patients, the highest rate is in the 5–9 years group (29.5%, 13/44), followed by children &lt;4 years (20.4%, 9/44) and 10–14 years 18.2%, 8/44). We observed that, as the age increased, the circulation of the virus decreased becoming practically null in ages &gt; 39 years. Meanwhile, for SARI patients, we observed two main circulation peaks being the positive rate of influenza B viruses of SARI patients highest in children &lt;4 years (33%, 57/172), followed by &gt;64 years (19%, 33/172). Overall, and even though ILI surveillance was only done during three of the eight years of the study, the proportion of influenza B found was significantly higher than that observed among SARI cases across different groups of age (9.7%, 44/450 ILI and 3.2%, 172/5299 SARI,
