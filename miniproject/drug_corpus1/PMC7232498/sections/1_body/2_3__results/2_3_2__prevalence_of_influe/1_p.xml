<p>In the eight-year period studied, the NIC received a total of 5754 samples from the sentinel surveillance. Of these specimens, 217 (3.8%) were confirmed for influenza B virus by real-time RT-PCR. During the entire study period, Victoria lineage viruses were more represented than those that belonged to the Yamagata lineage, accounting for 51% (110/217) and 45% (98/217) of cases, respectively. The remaining 4 % (9/217) could not be attributed to a specific lineage. The 217 IBV ranged from newborn to 88-year old. Influenza B infection was widely distributed across age-groups, with a clear predominance in children and teenagers with more than 60% of total influenza B infections. Those between 5â€“14 years had the highest detection rates among all age groups for both lineages (
