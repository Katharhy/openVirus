<p>Influenza B lineage mismatch was defined as a season when &gt;60% of circulating B lineage virus was different to the lineage that was included in the trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) for that season. A partial mismatch was defined if both lineages co-circulated at equal or almost equal proportions (40–59%). During 2012–2019, Victoria and Yamagata-lineage co-circulated in Uruguay, most of the years, with alternated predominance. However, only one lineage is contained in the trivalent vaccine recommended by the WHO for each season. We evaluated the extent of lineage-level mismatch between the circulating B viruses and those that were included in vaccine formulation for the Southern Hemisphere. The proportion of circulating IBV mismatched to the vaccine strain was calculated based in the total number of successfully lineage-typed specimens. During 2012–2019, a high degree of B mismatch in the 2012, 2013, and 2015 seasons (70%, 100%, and 92%, respectively) were observed. It is noteworthy that, in 2013, IBV circulation was very low and only B/Victoria strains were detected. On average, 28% of circulating influenza B was mismatched to recommended influenza B vaccine strain during 2012, 2013, and 2015. During 2017, a partial mismatch (Victoria 57%, Yamagata 43%) was observed, being the vaccine strain from the Victoria lineage. Meanwhile, in the 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2019 seasons, the lineage of the dominant sequences matched the lineage of the vaccine strain that was selected in the same season (
