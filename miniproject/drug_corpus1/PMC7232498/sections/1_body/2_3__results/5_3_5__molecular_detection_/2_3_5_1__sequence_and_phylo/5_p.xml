<p>Our 2012–2019 Uruguayan influenza B/Yamagata HA sequences clustered into two distinguishable genetic clades: clade 2 and 3. All B/Yamagata HA sequences detected after 2013 belonged to clade 3, closely related to the vaccine strains B/Wisconsin/01/2010 (in 2013 season) and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (in 2015 and 2018 seasons), whereas only HA sequences from 2012 belonged to clade 2 and were related to vaccine strain B/Massachusetts/02/2012, the vaccine strain recommendation for WHO to be used in 2014 in the Southern Hemisphere. When comparing with the vaccine strain B/Phuket/3073/2013, a series of amino acid changes were observed in the HA1 region. All of the Uruguayan sequences in the 2012 season shared amino acid substitutions at P108A, K116N, R48K, I150S, Y165N, T181A, S202N, D229G, E298K and K312Ewith some having additional substitutions. All of the Uruguayan Yamagata lineage sequences from the 2014–2017 seasons shared amino acids substitutions L172Q and M251V. In 2018, some subclustering of sequences, as defined by specific amino acid substitutions (e.g., D229Nor D232N [introducing a potential N-linked glycosylation site]), can be seen amongst the most recently circulating viruses characterized (
