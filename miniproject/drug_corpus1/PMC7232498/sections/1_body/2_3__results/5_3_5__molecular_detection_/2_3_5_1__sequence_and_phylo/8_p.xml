<p>Previous structural studies of the HA1subunit of HA have identified four major epitopes comprising the 120-loop (position 116–137 of HA1), 150-loop (position 141–150), 160-loop (position 162–167), and 190-helix (position 194–202), which collectively form part of the receptor binding site [

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-microorganisms-08-00591">Tables S2 and S3</xref>. Relative to B/Brisbane/60/2008, there were 13 mutation sites in the HA1 region in our B/Victoria samples. The most represented substitutions were I117V, N129D in the 120-loop, and I146V in the 150-loop. Interestingly, two amino acid substitutions located near antigenic epitopes, V87A and I175V, have been found in 2017 Uruguayan sequences. Unexpectedly, these substitutions have not been found in all other sequences from neighboring countries and included in these studies. We performed the same analysis in the Yamagata lineage. Relative to B/Phuket/3073/2013, there were 15 mutation sites in the HA1 region of our B/Yamagata samples. The most represented substitutions were L172Q, D229N/G, D232N, and M251V, being located near the antigenic epitopes as well as a few mutations in the antigenic epitopes: K116N in the 120-loop area, I150S in the 150-loop area, Y165N in the 160 loop-area, and S202N in the 190-helix area.
