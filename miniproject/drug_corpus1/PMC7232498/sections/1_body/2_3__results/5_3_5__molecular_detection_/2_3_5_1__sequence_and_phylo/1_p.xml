<p>The complete HA1 region of the HA gene were obtained from 39/41 of the selected samples. Additional 24 Uruguayan HA influenza B sequences were obtained from GISAID database. Hence, a total of 63 HA influenza B sequences from 208 positive samples from 2012 to 2019 were included for phylogenetic analysis. Among 63 sequences, 33 belonged to Victoria lineage and 30 belonged to Yamagata lineage. The phylogenetic trees showed different genetic diversities of both lineages based on nucleotide differences in the HA1 region. B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages co-circulated in almost all seasonal epidemics, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00591-f004">Figure 4</xref> and 5. In 2013, only the Victoria lineage was detected whereas in 2018 only Yamagata lineage was detected in Uruguayan samples. Although co-circulation of Victoria and Yamagata lineages was observed, the Victoria lineage clade V1A predominated during 2013, 2015â€“2017, in 2018 there was no Victoria viruses circulating and reappeared in 2019 assubclade V1A.1, while the Yamagata-lineage strains predominated in 2012 as clade 2 and clade 3 in the 2014 and 2018 seasons.
