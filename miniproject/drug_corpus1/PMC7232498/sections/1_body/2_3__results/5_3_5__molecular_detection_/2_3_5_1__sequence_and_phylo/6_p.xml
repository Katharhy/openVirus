<p>Between 2012–2014, we observed a clade shift inside the Yamagata lineage: in 2012, all Uruguayan sequences were clade 2, in 2013 there was no Yamagata viruses circulating in Uruguay, re-appearing in 2014 within clade 3. It was observed in countries of the region, not in Uruguay, that during 2012–2014 there were different clades co-circulating within the same period.</p>
