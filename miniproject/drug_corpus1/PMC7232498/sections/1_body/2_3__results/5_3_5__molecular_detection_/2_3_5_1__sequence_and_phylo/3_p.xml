<p>Our 2012–2017 Uruguayan influenza B/Victoria HA sequences were grouped in clade 1A, together with the vaccine strain B/Brisbane/60/2008, as recommended by the WHO to be used in 2012, 2016, and 2017 seasons. It is noteworthy that, in 2018, there was no detection of B/Victoria lineage strains in Uruguay, unlike what happened in neighboring countries. The HA gene sequences from 2019 Uruguayan circulating viruses were grouped in subclade V1A.1, within clade 1 A along with 2017, 2018, and 2019 HA sequences from neighboring countries. These subclade viruses were closely related to B/Colorado/60/2017, the vaccine strain recommendation by the WHO to be used in 2019 in the Southern Hemisphere. When comparing to vaccine strain B/Brisbane/60/2008, a series of amino acid changes were observed in the HA1 region. All of the Uruguayan sequences in the 2012–2014 seasons shared amino acid substitutions at I146V, whereas the 2015–2017 seasons shared amino acids substitutions at I117V and N129D. Interestingly, nine of 10 Uruguayan 2017 sequences shared additional amino acids substitutions V87A and I175V only found in Uruguayan sequences. Although these sequences do not have other substitutions within this cluster that differentiates one from another, the epidemiological information shows different geographic locations and different sample dates for seven of them. All of the 2019 Uruguayan sequences were characterized by a 2-aa deletion (K162 and N163) in the HA protein. These viruses had additional substitutions of N129G, I180V (
