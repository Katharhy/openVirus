<p>A partial region of the NA gene was obtained from 27/41 of the selected samples. An additional 24 Uruguayan NA influenza B sequences were obtained from GISAID database. Hence, a total of 51 NA influenza B sequences from 208 positive samples from 2012 to 2019 were included for phylogenetic classification. Among the 51 sequences, 25 belonged to Victoria lineage and 26 belonged to Yamagata lineage. All of the Uruguayan NA sequences of Victoria lineage were classified into clade 1 (

Since 2013, S295R, E358K amino acid substitutions were circulating in Uruguayan viruses, then strains of 2016 season and on, showed amino acids substitutions I120V, K220N and D384G. The 2017 Uruguayan NA sequences showed special and unique amino acids substitutions T68A, T106I, and V401I, being the same samples that had unique substitutions V87A and I175V in the HA gene.
