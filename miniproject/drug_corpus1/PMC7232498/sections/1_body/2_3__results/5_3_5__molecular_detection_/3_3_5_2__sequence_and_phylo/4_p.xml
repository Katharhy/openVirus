<p>There are several important conserved residues in the NA active site of influenza B virus [
 <xref rid="B22-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The NA protein of influenza B has eight catalytic residues (R116, D149, R150, R223, E275, R292, R374, and Y409) that interact with sialic acid and 11 framework residues (E117, R154, W177, S178, D197, I221, E226, H273, E276, N293, and E248) that support the enzymatic binding pocket [
 <xref rid="B23-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. None of the 51 NA protein sequences that we analyzed displayed substitutions in the active site and their surrounding residues.
