<p>Influenza NA is a surface glycoprotein that enables the virus to be released from the infected host cells. Using inhibitors to block the cleavage function of influenza NA does not avoid disease, but it treats influenza disease and might shorten the symptoms. We analyzed the NA gene of 51 samples for specific mutations known to confer resistance to NA inhibitors [

 <xref rid="B25-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. None of the Uruguayan NA sequences from original clinical samples had substitutions for influenza B virus resistance to NA inhibitors, which suggested that the antivirals in use might still be suitable as a first-line treatment of influenza B infections in Uruguay.
