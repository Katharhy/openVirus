<p>Our 2012â€“2019 Uruguayan influenza Yamagata-lineage NA sequences clustered into two distinguishable genetic clades: clade 2 and 3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00591-f007">Figure 7</xref>). Almost all of the B sequences detected after 2013 were classified as clade 3 closely related to B/Phuket/3073/2013, whereas only NA sequences from 2012 fell into clade 2 and related to strain B/Massachusetts/02/2012. When comparing to strain B/Phuket/3073/2013, a series of amino acid changes was observed in clade 2 which included B/Florida/4/2006, and was characterized by T106I and S295R substitutions, while clade 3, which included B/Wisconsin/1/2010, was distinguished by K373Q, D342N, and I171M. Interestingly, after 2017, in Uruguay and the region the substitution in position D342N changed to D342K. The 2018 Uruguayan NA sequences showed an amino acid substitution T106I, being the same samples that had unique substitution D229N in the HA gene (
