<p>We checked whether the Uruguayan sequences analyzed for the NA gene were classified in the same lineages according to HA gene due to the possibility that influenza viruses undergo gene reassortment. Although the classification of the two lineages is based on HA sequences, it is clear that most NA sequences are also defined under specific lineage clades with their lineage identified according to the vaccine strains clustered with them. No occurrence of HA and NA reassortment events were observed in the Uruguayan sequences during 2012â€“2019 (
