<p>Fluctuations in the prevalence of influenza A and B were observed during 2012â€“2019. Overall, 14.6% were confirmed influenza cases, of which 36.9% (311/843), 37.4 % (315/843), and 25.7% (217/843) were influenza A/H1N1 pdm09, A/H3N2, and B infections, respectively. Influenza B viruses rarely dominate over influenza A viruses, however in 2012, 2015, and 2017 there was an important circulation of influenza B viruses, reaching 40%, 58% and 47%, respectively, of the circulating influenza virus. The co-circulation of influenza A/H3N2 and B was observed in almost all of the periods studied (2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2018). However, in 2013 and 2016, the lowest incidence of influenza B virus infection was detected (2.8% and 4.5%, respectively), along with the highest incidence of influenza A/H1N1 pdm09 (78% and 95%, respectively) (
