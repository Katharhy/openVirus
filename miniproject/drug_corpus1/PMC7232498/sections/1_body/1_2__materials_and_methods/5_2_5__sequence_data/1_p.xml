<p>In addition to the 39 HA and 27 NA sequences that were obtained in this study, other sequences from Uruguay and the neighboring countries available at the GISAID database from 2012–2019 were downloaded and included in the phylogenetic analysis as well as those vaccine strains for the Southern Hemisphere that were recommended by WHO between 2012–2019 [
 <xref rid="B16-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The output was a dataset containing around a hundred sequences. HA and NA nucleotide sequences of the Uruguayan influenza B viruses generated in this study have been deposited in the GISAID database. For names and accession numbers, see

The sequences were assembled while using Lasergene analysis software, version 10 (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI, USA) and manually edited to produce a final sequence of 1201 nucleotides (nt) for the HA1 region of the HA gene and 1108 nt for the NA gene.
