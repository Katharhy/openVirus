<p>The National Influenza Center (NIC) located in Montevideo, Uruguay, in the Virology Unit of the Department of Public Health Laboratories, Ministry of Health, is the Reference Laboratory for Influenza and other non-Influenza respiratory viruses. Uruguay is a country with a temperate climate, where outbreaks of respiratory viruses usually occur mainly in the autumn-winter period, between April and October. The virological surveillance system is based on the year-round sampling effort and it was carried out in six sentinel centers, including five general hospitals and one childrenÂ´s hospital strategically located in different regions of the country. Nasopharyngeal aspirates or nasal swabs that were obtained from 5299 hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) associated with influenza and 455 outpatients with clinical evidence of influenza-like illness (ILI) were collected between 2012 and 2019. The ILI surveillance was implemented in 2017. All six ILI sentinel centers were the same from the existing SARI surveillance network.</p>
