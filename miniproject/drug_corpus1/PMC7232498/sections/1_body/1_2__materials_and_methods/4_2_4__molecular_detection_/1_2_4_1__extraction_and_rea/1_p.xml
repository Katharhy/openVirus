<p>Ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted from 140 μL of clinical samples that were stored at −80 °C, using QIAamp Viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer´s suggested protocol.The influenza B positive specimens previously typified were distinguished into influenza B Victoria and Yamagata lineages by RT-PCR assay. Real time RT-PCR was performed by using a Invitrogen SuperScript™ III Platinum™ One-Step Quantitative RT-PCR System according to the manufacturer´s instructions, on an Applied Biosystems™Step One Plus (Applied Biosystems, USA) thermocycler. Influenza B lineage-specific sets of primers and probes were provided by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, USA). Testing was done according to the CDC´s instructions, being enclosed with reagents. In brief, the master mix containing appropiate primers and probe was dispensed into reaction tube plate in a volume of 20 μL, and 5 μL of RNA extracts were added to each well. Negative and positive template controls for all of the primer/probe sets were included in each run. The human Rnase P gene primer and probe set served as an internal positive control for human RNA. Thermocycling real time RT-PCR conditions were as follows: reverse transcription for 30 min at 50 °C, Taq polymerase activation for 10 min at 95 °C, and 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, and extension at 55 °C for 30 s. The results were analyzed using Applied Biosystems Step OnePlus Software 2.1 version and the interpretation of the data was done according to the WHO guidelines [
