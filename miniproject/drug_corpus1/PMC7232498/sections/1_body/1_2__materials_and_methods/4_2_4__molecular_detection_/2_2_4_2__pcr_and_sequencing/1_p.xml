<p>For the HA gene, the amplification of a region that contains the HA1-coding region (1340 base pairs) was performed while using the SS III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum™ Taq HiFi Kit and the RT-PCR assays with primer sets that were recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) [
 <xref rid="B15-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Briefly, the 50 μL reaction volume contained 25 μL of 2× PCR buffer, 15.5 μL of RNAse-free H
 <sub>2</sub>O, 1.5 μL of each 10 μM reverse and forward primer, 1 μL enzyme mix (Taq DNA polymerase and reverse transcriptase), 0.5 μL of RNAsin, and 5 μL of viral RNA extract. The RT-PCR reaction was carried out in a Biorad T100 thermocycler with a single reverse transcription step of 42 °C for 30 min, 50 °C 10 min, a pre-denaturation (94 °C) for 2 min, forty cycles (denaturation 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s. of primer annealing al 55 °C, 2 min 30 s of extension al 68 °C), and a final elongation step of 10 min at 68 °C. For the NA gene, a specific primer set was designed for the partial amplification of the NA gene (position 168−1386 bp). Briefly, the 50 μL reaction volume contained 25 μL of 2× PCRbuffer, 17 μL of RNAse-free H2O, 1 μL of each 10uM reverse (5′AACACCTGTGACAGTGTCCC3′) and forward primer (5′CGCATCAAATGTTCAGGCTG3′), 1 μL enzyme mix (Taq DNA polymerase and reverse transcriptase), and 5 μL of viral RNA extract. The RT-PCR reaction was carried out in a Biometra thermocycler with a single reverse transcription step of 50 °C for 30 min, “hot start PCR” (94 °C) for 2 min, thirty five cycles (denaturation 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min of primer annealing at 54 °C, 2 min of extension at 72 °C), and a final elongation step of 10 min at 72°C. RT-PCR products from the HA and NA genes were separated in a 1% agarose gel with GelRed™ (Biotium, Hayward, CA, USA) and then visualized under ultraviolet light. The amplified products were purified with Pure link™ (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s directions, and sequencing was performed at Macrogen, Korea and the Instituto Pasteur in Montevideo, Uruguay.
