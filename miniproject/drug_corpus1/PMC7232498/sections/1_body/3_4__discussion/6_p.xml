<p>In some of the years studied, amino acid substitutions were observed outside the known antigenic regions in the HA gene that have only circulated in Uruguay. Moreover, the same samples have unique substitutions in the NA gene. Recent research has suggested the presence of additional antigenic residues outside the known antigenic regions [

 <xref rid="B54-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. These mutations may have contributed to increasing viral fitness. If they contributed to antigenic evolution, changes in these positions might have caused conformational changes affecting the antigenic sites. Moreover, it is important that the activity of the two main surface glycoproteins (HA and NA) be balanced to efficiently maintain the capacity for infection and the release of viral particles [

 <xref rid="B60-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. It is also imperative that the relative activity of the two proteins is balanced to maintain the ability to infect and release from cells efficiently.
