<p>Although information for other internal gene segments may represent an important limitation of this study, the results presented provide evidence of heterogeneity and genetic information for estimating the variability of circulating influenza B viruses in Uruguay and the neighboring countries. Further antigenic analysis is needed for assessing the characteristics of the vaccine candidates and the circulating strains, especially those that possess changes at antigenic and glycosylation sites of the hemagglutinin. Comparing the antigenic relationship and amino acid substitutions help to define the appropriate vaccine strains. Another limitation is that we only examined NA mutations in previously described antigenic sites. Susceptibility testing of patient isolates and antiviral surveillance studies, as well as the functional characterization of molecular markers of drug resistance, are needed. Despite the limitations, the surveillance system for influenza B viruses has been proven useful to describe the epidemiological and evolutionary behavior of influenza B viruses that have circulated in Uruguay during the last years and the results demonstrate that the virus is changing, in line with other observations that were reported from other countries [
