<p>The Yamagata lineage can be subdivided into clades 2 and 3. In Uruguay, Yamagata clade 3 was detected since 2014 and the sequences were similar to B/Phuket/3073/2013, the vaccine strain recommended by WHO and included in the trivalent vaccine in 2015 and 2018 for the Southern Hemisphere. Yamagata clade 2 was only found in 2012 in Uruguay, confirming recent reports that indicated the incidence of clade 2 viruses decreased substantially [

The co-existence of clade 2 and 3 of Yamagata lineage in a region enables these viruses to evolve in multiple dimensions [
