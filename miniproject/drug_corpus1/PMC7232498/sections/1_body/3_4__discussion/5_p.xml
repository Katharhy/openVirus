<p>The hemagglutinin represents a primary target for host neutralizing antibodies. More specifically, the HA1 region contains the receptor-binding sites and the most part of antigenic sites, including the 120-loop, the 150-loop, the 160-loop, and the 190-helix and their surrounding regions [

In this study, several amino acid substitutions were located in the antigenic epitopes of the Uruguayan viruses sequenced, as compared to their specific lineage vaccine strain. In B/Victoria viruses, mutations were mainly observed in the 120-loop. Mutations in the 150-loop were found until 2015 and no mutations occurred in the 190-helix. Variations in the 160-loop were found since 2019 within all of the Uruguayan HA sequenced. Previous studies show that the 120-loop is one of the sites with greater variability and play a crucial role in stabilizing the HA protein structure [

The large number of amino acids substitutions in 2012 could be due to the fact that the HA sequences of that year were of a different clade from the vaccine strain clade that was used in those years. The non-existence of amino acids substitutions at antigenic sites in years after 2012 would be somehow confirming the slowly evolving influenza B/Yamagata viruses.
