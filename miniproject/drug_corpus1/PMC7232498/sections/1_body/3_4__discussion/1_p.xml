<p>Until the present study, there was little information regarding the epidemiology and genetic characteristics of the circulating influenza B viruses in Uruguay [

 <xref rid="B27-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. On average, influenza B viruses accounted for approximately 26% of influenza positive cases during 2012–2019. These results were similar to other countries that suggest that influenza B virus contribute significantly to influenza disease [

Our findings revealed that types A and B influenza viruses almost always co-circulated throughout 2012–2019 and they confirm the important role of influenza B virus in the spread of infection in the population. In a study by Glezen P and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B4-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], it was suggested that when influenza B activity is intense, it can produce an impact that is similar to that of influenza A. Influenza B viruses rarely dominate in a season, however in 2015, in Uruguay, predominated over influenza A. The increase of influenza B incidence also coincided with a shift in the predominant influenza B lineage (from the Yamagata lineage in 2014 to Victoria lineage in 2015) and clade (from Yamagata clade 2 in 2012 to Yamagata clade 3 in 2014). In 2013 and 2016, the lowest incidence of influenza B virus infection was detected in Uruguay, along with the highest incidence of influenza A/H1N1 pdm09. The absence of influenza B viruses in some season is not unusual, since it is known that the activity of the influenza B virus is highly variable worldwide, without an established pattern that leads to an increase in the size of the susceptible population and that the disappearance of one or both lineages could be related to the genetic variability of the influenza B virus [

 <xref rid="B36-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In some years, influenza B viruses represent strong bottlenecks in the population and they are generally associated with a high prevalence of influenza A virus [

 <xref rid="B38-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Interaction with the influenza A virus might be central in the configuration of the evolutionary dynamics of the influenza B virus and therefore facilitate the change in the dominance or codominance of the lineages between the Victoria and Yamagata lineages [
