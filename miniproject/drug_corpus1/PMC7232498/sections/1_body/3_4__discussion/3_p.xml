<p>Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the HA and NA sequences of influenza B virus could be divided in two distinct lineages: Victoria and Yamagata. The Victoria lineage can be subdivided into V1A and V1B. The V1A clade was the only detected in Uruguay during 2012–2019. The 2012–2017 Uruguayan sequences were genetically related to B/Brisbane/60/2008, the vaccine strain recommended by the WHO to be used in the trivalent vaccine during 2012, 2016, and 2017 for the Southern Hemisphere. In 2019, all of the B/Victoria viruses detected in Uruguay belonged to the V1A clade, encoding a deletion of two amino acids (K162 and N163) in the HA protein.They were grouped within V1A.1 subclade and genetically related to B/Colorado/06/2017, the vaccine strain recommended by the WHO to be used in the trivalent vaccine in 2019 for the Southern Hemisphere. Viruses with the double amino acid deletion in HA were detected in the 2016–2017 Northern Hemisphere season and have continued to circulate since then [
