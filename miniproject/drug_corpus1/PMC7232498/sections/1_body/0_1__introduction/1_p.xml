Although influenza A viruses (IAV) are responsible for pandemics and they have major rates of hospitalization and mortality attribution, influenza B viruses (IBV) cause epidemics worldwide annually, becoming responsible in some years for more than 25% of human seasonal influenza infections, and its prevention represents an important public health priority [
