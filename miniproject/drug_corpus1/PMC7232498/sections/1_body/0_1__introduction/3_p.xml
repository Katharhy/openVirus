<p>The aim of this study was to describe the circulating patterns of IBV strains in Uruguay between 2012â€“2019 as well as determine the age groups that are associated with both influenza B lineages and surveillance type. In addition, we evaluated the concordance between the predominant circulating influenza B lineage and the B lineage included in the vaccine applied in each season. Additionally, we intended to determine the phylogenetic relationships between the circulating strains in Uruguay and neighbouring countries, and the vaccine strains recommended for the Southern Hemisphere. For this purpose, we firstly analyzed the genetic sequences of the HA and NA genes that were obtained in this study and compared with sequences downloaded from the Global Initiative on Sharing all Influenza data (GISAID) database. Further, the co-circulation of IAV and IBV were examined. Finally, we analyzed the NA gene to observe the existence of possible known substitutions that cause reduced susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI).</p>
