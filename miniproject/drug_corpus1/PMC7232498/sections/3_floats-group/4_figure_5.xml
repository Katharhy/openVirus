  <p>Phylogenetic analysis of HA1 nucleotide sequences from influenza B Yamagata-lineage viruses circulating in Uruguay from 2012 to 2019. The phylogeny tree was generated by the neighbour-joining method with1000 bootstrap replicates. Bootstrap values &gt;70 are shown in the nodes. Vaccine strains are shown with a blue triangle. Uruguayan strains are shown in red while representative clade strains are indicated with a black circle as a symbol. The scale bar indicates the substitutions per site. The most relevant amino acid substitutions found are indicated with arrows.</p>
