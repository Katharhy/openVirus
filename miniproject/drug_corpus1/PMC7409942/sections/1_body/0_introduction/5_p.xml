 <xref rid="b49" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. However, the within-host viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection have not been quantitatively investigated. Here we use mathematical models to study the pathogenic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection by examining the interaction between viral replication and the host immune responses. We fit models to available data of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and non-human primates in different countries

 <xref rid="b52" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. We also use model simulations to evaluate some potential therapies against COVID-19. Combination of antiviral drugs and type I interferon (IFN) may control the SARS-CoV-2 replication. This is consistent with the observation that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to IFN
