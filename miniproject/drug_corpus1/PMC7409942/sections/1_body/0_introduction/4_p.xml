<p id="d1e2021">Currently, there are no approved antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Many patients were given symptomatic management such as empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics or anti-influenza therapies 
 <xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Mechanical ventilations were used in patients with respiratory failure. The mortality of COVID-19 patients is primarily caused by severe lung injury induced by hyperactive host inflammation. Corticosteroids were administrated to critically ill patients as immunosuppression agents
