<p id="d1e3418">Within-host dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection have not been quantitatively investigated. We developed mathematical models to study the viral dynamics and compared modeling prediction with the viral load data in COVID-19 patients and non-human primates from different countries. Our study provides explanations to several pathogenic features of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Firstly, SARS-CoV-2â€™s very high transmission capacity is likely to come from a viral plateau phase after the peak, which provides a sustainable source of infectious viruses. The duration of the plateau stage is determined by how fast the seroconversion occurs and how strong the immune responses are on the basis of our data fitting and model simulations. Secondly, the model shows that the current best possible control of SARS-CoV-2 infection might be the adaptive immune response of the infected individual. This supports the legitimacy of current treatment with oxygen, mechanical ventilation, corticosteroids and antibiotics that let severely ill patient sustain the life till the activation of adaptive immunity. Thirdly, we explained the scenario of prolonged viral shedding and viral rebound. They originate from the oscillation caused by interplays between viral replication and the adaptive immune response. If seroconversion emerges late, then prolonged viral persistence is generated. As the adaptive immune response is above a threshold, the virus will be eradicated. These results may improve our understanding of the pathogenic features of SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
