<p id="d1e2231">SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to the diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) 
 <xref rid="b60" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. DAD usually has three phases: exudative phase, proliferative phase and fibrotic phase 
 <xref rid="b61" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. In the exudative phase, immune cells are recruited to the lung, causing accumulated fluid in the airspace. This prevents alveoli from remaining open for gas exchange. The proliferative phase is characterized by regeneration of alveolar type II epithelial cells or pneumocytes  
 <xref rid="b62" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. When replicating, type II epithelial cells transport fluid out of the airspace. SARS-CoV-2 infects pneumocytes and induces hyperactive inflammation that greatly enhances the exudative reaction. Thus, pneumocytes may experience a significant delay in proliferation 
 <xref rid="b63" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. In addition, about 30% of COVID-19 patients are asymptomatic 
 <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b64" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b65" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. They do not develop DAD so the proliferation of pneumocytes could be at a minimum level. Therefore, when studying the viral dynamics during the early stage of infection, we do not include the proliferation and death of pneumocytes. This also keeps the model in the simplest form for data fitting.
