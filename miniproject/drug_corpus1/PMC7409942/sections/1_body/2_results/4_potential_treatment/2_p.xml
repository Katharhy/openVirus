 <xref rid="b86" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>. Lopinavir/ritonavir is a combination of protease inhibitors used to treat HIV-1 infection

 <xref rid="b88" ref-type="bibr">[88]</xref>. We assume that they reduce the production of SARS-CoV-2 by a factor (1-

 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>B) on 10th, 15th and 20th day, respectively. We find that a higher efficacy of antiviral drugs only makes viral load decline slightly faster. However, early treatment can significantly diminish the time to recovery.
