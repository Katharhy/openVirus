<p id="d1e3390">The severe acute respiratory syndrome induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by over-exuberant inflammatory response. Baricitinib, fedratinib and ruxolitinib that are known to inhibit JAK-STAT signaling pathway might reduce the levels of cytokines

Very recently, the National Institute of Health has started a clinical trial to test the combination of remdesivir and baricitinib in COVID-19 patients (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04401579). To describe the relieved inflammatory response that may be induced from the anti-inflammation treatment, we decrease the recruitment rate of lymphocytes (
