<p id="d1e3219">Due to the lack of approved antiviral drugs, many patients with severe symptoms are given oxygen treatment, mechanical ventilation, corticosteroids and antibiotics to maintain the respiratory function and ease the inflammatory response. This provides time for the adaptive immune response to emerge to control the virus

The later the adaptive immune response takes place, the longer the viral load persists. Many senior patients die from COVID-19 because they could not sustain prolonged life support treatment due to multiple significant underlying diseases
