<p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract illness resulting from infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); in recent months, COVID-19 has become a global pandemic, posing a major public health challenge for the health systems of many nations. Simultaneously, numerous rumors, pieces of misinformation, and hoaxes have appeared on several social media platforms regarding the etiology, outcomes, prevention, and cure of the disease [

The pressing issue is that fake news spreads more rapidly on social media than news from reliable sources, damaging the authenticity balance of the news ecosystem. A recent analysis showed that during the 2016 presidential election in the United States, fake and biased news was more outspread than news from 19 authentic sources combined [

This issue is becoming a public health concern as exposure to a high volume of information can lead to media fatigue, causing the discontinuation of healthy behaviors that are essential to protect individuals. Furthermore, misinformation and rumors regarding COVID-19 are hindering the practice of healthy behaviors (such as handwashing and social distancing) and promoting erroneous practices that increase the spread of the virus and ultimately result in poor physical and mental health outcomes. For example, in India, a father of three was reported to commit suicide upon learning that he had been diagnosed with COVID-19 [

Another example of hazards attributable to improper health communication can be drawn from Nigeria, where the health officials found several cases of overdose of chloroquine (a drug used to treat malaria) after news on the purported effectiveness of the drug for treating COVID-19 spread through the news media [

Rumors about a national lockdown in the United States fueled panic buying of groceries and paper products, which disrupted the supply chain and exacerbated demand-supply gaps and food insecurity among individuals with low socioeconomic status and other vulnerable populations [

Similar phenomena have been observed in other economies around the world, which may have prolonged impacts on public health nutrition and psychosocial health among the affected populations. The widespread misinformation related to the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 has confused both the general population and healthcare providers, who are battling a relatively under-researched disease. This phenomenon is also reducing the legitimacy of new scientific discoveries regarding potential cures or vaccine candidates for this disease. These hoaxes and rumors are also creating a social stigma around COVID-19, which has resulted in reduced compliance with home quarantine and social isolation. Several countries have reported incidents where hundreds of individuals were infected by a single person who visited their mosque/church despite their doctorâ€™s advice to remain isolated at home [
