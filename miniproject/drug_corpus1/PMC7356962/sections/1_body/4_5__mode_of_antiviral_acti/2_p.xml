<p>Evidence from the above-mentioned publications and reports and numerous other international investigations reveal that many phytochemical extracts and medicinal plant constituents have displayed antiviral properties against coronaviruses [

 <xref rid="B19-plants-09-00800" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Otherwise, molecules that have an antiviral activity work like a disinfectant or antiseptic and do not necessitate repetition to inactivate a virus [
