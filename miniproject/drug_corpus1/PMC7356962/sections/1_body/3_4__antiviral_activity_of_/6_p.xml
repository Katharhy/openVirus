 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00800-f004">Figure 4</xref>b), was been examined in this research under the same conditions and also revealed antiviral potential against SARS-CoV [

This is because the oral quantity of these molecules in humans may not attain a blood serum dose comparable to that tested in vitro dose.
