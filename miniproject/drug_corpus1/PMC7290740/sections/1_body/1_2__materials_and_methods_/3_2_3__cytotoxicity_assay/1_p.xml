<p>Cells in 96 well cell culture plates were treated with drugs and cultured at 37 °C for 48 h. The cell viabilities were determined using CellTiter-Glo (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The luminescence intensity was determined using a multi-label plate reader (Wallac Envision, PerkinElmer, MA, USA). Three independent experiments were performed in duplicate for the calculation of 50% cell cytotoxic concentration (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) using Prism v.6 software.
