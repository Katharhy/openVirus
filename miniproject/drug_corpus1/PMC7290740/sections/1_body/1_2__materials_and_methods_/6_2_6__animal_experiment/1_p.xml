<p>BALB/c mice aged 6â€“8 weeks were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology and raised in the Animal bio-safety level II (ABSL-2) Laboratory of Wuhan Institute of Virology, CAS. All animal experiments were conducted according to the protocol approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Wuhan Institute of Virology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (WIVA08201601). Mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium and then infected with the influenza virus through the nasal cavity. Infected mice were treated by intragastric managed drug once a day for five consecutive days, starting 3 h after infection. During the experimental period of 18 days, the weight changes and survival rates were recorded. On days 3 and 7 post-infection, the lungs of mice were inflation fixed in 10% formalin and paraffin-embedded and then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E). The lung lavage fluids (BALFs) were collected with precooled 0.1% BSA in PBS and followed by centrifugation at 1500 rpm. The virus titers were measured by the TCID
 <sub>50</sub> method.
