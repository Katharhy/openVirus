<p>In addition to human influenza A viruses H1N1 and H3N2, human influenza B virus strains, the 2009 (H1N1) pandemic strain, oseltamivir-resistant strain H1N1 (H274Y), and a bird flu H7N8 were also tested. We did not measure the infectivity using TCID
 <sub>50</sub> assay. Instead, we tested the NA activity on the supernatants of the cell culture since we found that the TCID
 <sub>50</sub>s are correlated pretty well with the NA activities from the same virus-containing supernatants using a fluorescent substrate (
