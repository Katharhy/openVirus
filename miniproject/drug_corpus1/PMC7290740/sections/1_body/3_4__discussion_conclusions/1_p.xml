<p>Seasonal influenza is an acute respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses that circulate the world [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Influenza A and B viruses cause seasonal epidemics of disease. Currently circulating in humans are subtype A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) influenza viruses [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Influenza viruses circulating in animals, e.g., birds, pose threats to human health in that they can develop the ability to infect humans and cause illness [

In our in vitro study, in addition to the commonly used MDCK cells, we tested the antiviral effect of EEC against a panel of influenza viruses on the epithelial A549 cells and monocytic U937 cells. However, the efficacy of EEC is not as good as oseltamivir (data not shown), but comparable to that of ribavirin (
