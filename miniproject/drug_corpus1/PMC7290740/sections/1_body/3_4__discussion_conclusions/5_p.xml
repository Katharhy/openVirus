<p>EEC, at its current formula, may be not ideal as an anti-influenza drug. However, the plant 
 <italic>C. decapetala</italic> (Roth) Alston can serve as a resource of natural products to be developed as a plant-derived drug against influenza. Further research is in progress to isolate and elucidate the bioactive components or compounds responsible for the antiviral activity of this plant and to determine their mechanisms of action. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the antiviral activity of 
 <italic>C. decapetala</italic> (Roth) Alston. Our findings suggest that the ethnobotanical use of plant drugs may provide benefits in the treatment of influenza, warranting further investigation.
