<p>Human influenza A and B viruses cause annual influenza epidemics, whereas influenza A viruses can also cause sporadic infections or spread worldwide in a pandemic when novel strains emerge in the human population from an animal host [

To test the antiviral spectrum of EEC against different types and subtypes of influenza viruses, we infected A549 cells with 0.25 MOI of influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934, A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H274Y), A/human/Hubei/1/2009 (H1N1), A/human/Hubei/3/2005 (H3N2), A/duck/Hubei/216/1983 (H7N8) and B/human/Hubei/1/2007, respectively. The infected cells by each virus were treated with serially diluted EEC. We found that EEC could inhibit all the influenza viruses, including the oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 (H274Y) virus, on A549 cells at a similar efficiency (

We next checked the antiviral effect of EEC on epithelial MDCK cells and monocytic U937 cells against both influenza virus A and B viruses. Surprisingly, EEC was found to inhibit all the influenza virus strains both in MDCK cells and U937 cells. Comparing with canine MDCK cells, EEC inhibits more efficiently the replication of influenza viruses in human A549 and U937 cells (
