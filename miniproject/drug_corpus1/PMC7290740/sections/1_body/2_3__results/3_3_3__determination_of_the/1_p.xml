<p>To determine the stage of the influenza virus life cycle inhibited by EEC, a time-of-addition assay was conducted. MDCK cells were infected with 0.1 MOI of influenza virus at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by cell culture at 37 °C for 12 h. During the cell culture, three EC
 <sub>50</sub> of ribavirin, oseltamivir, and EEC were added respectively at different time points and maintained for 12 h. The supernatants were collected, and the virus yields were determined by the NA activity assay. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00557-f003">Figure 3</xref>A, similar to oseltamivir, EEC inhibited the virus replication completely when added at all time points until 8 hpi, indicating that EEC may inhibit the very late stage of the influenza virus life cycle, which includes mainly the release of virions that is related to the function of virus neuraminidase. To determine whether EEC inhibits the virus neuraminidase activity, an in vitro neuraminidase inhibition assay was conducted. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00557-f003">Figure 3</xref>B, similar to oseltamivir, EEC inhibited the neuraminidase activity concentration-dependently. Taken together, our results show that EEC inhibits the late stage of the influenza virus life cycle. Since the virus neuraminidase activity is required for the release of virions, we speculate that EEC may inhibit the release of influenza viruses.
