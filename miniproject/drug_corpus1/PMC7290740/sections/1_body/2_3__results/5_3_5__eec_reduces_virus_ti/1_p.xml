<p>Even though the selective indexes of EEC in the inhibitory effects against influenza virus A and B strains in human A549 and U937 cells range from 5 to 52 (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00557-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), EEC does protect mice from lethal influenza virus infection. To confirm whether EEC inhibits virus replication in vivo, we next checked the virus titers in the BALFs of the infected mice treated with EEC. As shown in
