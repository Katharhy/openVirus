<p>In this study, we studied the anti-influenza activity of EEC, both in vitro and in vivo. EEC showed a broad-spectrum inhibitory effect on the replication of all strains of influenza viruses tested on Madinâ€“Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK), A549, and U937 cells. The animal experiments showed that EEC could improve the survival rate of mice infected with lethal influenza virus and decrease the virus titers and pathological damage to the lungs. Our results suggested that EEC has the potential to be a plant-derived drug with further research and development.</p>
