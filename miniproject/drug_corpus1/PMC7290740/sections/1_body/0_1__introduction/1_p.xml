<p>Despite the availability of vaccines and direct-acting antiviral drugs, influenza causes substantial morbidity and mortality every year [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Vaccination is limited to the known epidemic strains and takes a long time for preparation [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. There are many problems with the present anti-influenza drugs [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Amantadine and amantadine, inhibitors of the M2 ion channel, have been used for decades [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. With strong side effects and emergence of widespread drug-resistant strains, they are no longer recommended to treat influenza [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Current therapy for influenza includes virus neuraminidase inhibitors and polymerase inhibitors [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors: oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir, should be administered within 48 h of the onset of symptoms [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For advanced and severely ill patients, there is no significant improvement in clinical effect [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The most recently approved drug baloxavir targets virus polymerase [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, according to the clinical results, compared with treatment in adults, baloxavir showed only a weak therapeutic effect in the susceptible population that includes children, adolescents, and the elderly, which cannot shorten the course of the disease [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Since influenza causes a huge burden on society every year in most countries in the treatment of seasonal and pandemic flu, there is an urgent need to develop new anti-influenza drugs against a broad spectrum of influenza viruses, including the resistant strains [
