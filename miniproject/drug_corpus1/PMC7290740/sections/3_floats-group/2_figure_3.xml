  <p>EEC affects the late stage of the influenza virus life cycle by inhibiting neuraminidase activity. The stages of the influenza virus life cycle affected by EEC were determined by time of addition assay and neuraminidase inhibition assay, respectively. (
   <bold>A</bold>) In the time of addition assay, pre-cooled MDCK cells were infected with PR8 virus at an MOI of 0.1 at 4 °C for 1 h. Three IC
   <sub>50</sub> of ribavirin, oseltamivir, and EEC were added in each group at different time points during virus replication on MDCK cells. The supernatants were collected at 12 hpi, and the viral yield was determined by the NA activity assay. (
   <bold>B</bold>) In the neuraminidase inhibition assay, 95 μL of H1N1 PR8 virus solution of 10
   <sup>5</sup>TCID
   <sub>50</sub>/mL was mixed with 5 μL of serially diluted EEC, ribavirin or oseltamivir, respectively. Each reaction was conducted at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence of 20 μM MUNANA, the fluorescence intensity was determined using the EnSpire multi-label plate reader (PerkinElmer, MA, USA).
