<p>The above studies on the recent applications of NPs in developing sensors based on different analytical techniques for coronaviruses and their related limit of detections are compared in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">TableÂ 3</xref>. As it was discussed above AgNPs, MoS
 <sub>2</sub> nanosheets, QD-MP NPs, Zr NPs and Au NPs had been applied in detection of a range of coronaviruses. Thus, coupling nanomaterials with colorimetric sensing, electrochemiluminescence, immunosensing, photoluminescence and chiroimmunosensing are potential techniques to detect coronaviruses. In addition, electrochemical devices can also be a good options for detection of new kinds coronaviruses in future because of their good ability for coupling with nanomaterials. The advantages of using nanomaterials in this aspect can decrease the analysis time and also increasing the sensitivity, which can open a new door for designing better approaches and higher performance in future.
