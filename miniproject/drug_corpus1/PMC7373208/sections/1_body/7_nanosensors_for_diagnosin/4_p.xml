<p>In another study, Wang 
 <italic>et al.</italic> developed a nano-nest PCR assay based on AuNPs for discrimination of the variant and classical strains of PEDV [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. A total of 78 clinical samples collected from different areas in China were assessed by using both nano-nest and common reverse transcription polymerasechain reaction (RT-PCR). Results indicated that the nano-nest PCR assay was more powerful, with 100-fold sensitivity, than common PCR. In order to determine the specificity of this nano-based assay, five other viruses; classical swine fever virus, porcine rotavirus, pseudorabies virus, TGEV and porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus were also evaluated. Interestingly, it was shown that this assay did not amplify the DNA or cDNA of the other viruses or even of the classical PEDV strain, leading to the fact that the nano-nest PCR assay can be successfully applied for specific detection of variant PEDV [
