<p>A self-assembled nanostructure of chiral gold NPs (CAu NPs) and quantum dots (QDs) was created by Ahmed 
 <italic>et al.</italic> in 2017 and then applied as a chiro-immunosensor for the detection of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in chicken blood samples. The presented biosensor proved to be efficient in selective determination of the target virus with a detection limit of 47.91 EID/50 ml egg infective dose (EID) [

 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. As indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, after preparation of ZrQDs and MP NPs, the IBV antibodies were conjugated with both nanomaterials. At this step, no attraction or conjugation was observed between the utilized nanomaterials (i.e., ZrQDs and MP) and they were apart from each other till the time of adding the target virus. By addition of a virus, a magnetoplasmonic-fluorescent nanohybrid structure was formed and then separated using an external magnet. Eventually, the concentration of the virus was measured through photoluminescence intensity of the nanohybrids with a detection limit of 79.15 EID/50 ml. In a study by Weng and Neethirajan, an immuno biosensor based on antibody-functionalized MoS 2 for rapid detection of IBV with a limit of detection equal to 4.6 × 10
 <sup>2</sup> EID
 <sub>50</sub> per ml was developed [
