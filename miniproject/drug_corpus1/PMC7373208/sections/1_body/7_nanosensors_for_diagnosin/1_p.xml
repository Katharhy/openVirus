<p>Detecting variations in DNA sequences has been found to have a key role in diagnosing and subsequently treating genetic-related conditions at early stages. Among the various types of genetic alteration diseases, sequence-specific mismatch is of significant importance; however, detection of this variation is very difficult and this problem is more serious in case of single-nucleotide polymorphismÂ [
