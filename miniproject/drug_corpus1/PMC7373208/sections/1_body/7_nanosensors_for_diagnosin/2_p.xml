<p>In the year 2017, Teengam 
 <italic>et al</italic>. developed a multiplex colorimetric paper-based analytical device using Ag NPs as a colorimetric reagent for the detection of DNA associated with viral infection such as MERS-CoV. In their study, under an optimum condition, a limit of detection of 1.53 nM was achieved [

Another study, performed by Layqah and Eissa in 2019, described an electrochemical immunosensor utilizing an array of carbon electrodes which were modified with Au NPs which enabled detection of human coronavirus (HCoV) and MERS-CoV proteins in spiked nasal samples [

 <sup>-1</sup> for MERS-CoV and HCoV in 20 min, respectively, and a good linear relationship were observed between the sensor response and virus concentrations. Linear ranges of 0.001–100 ngml
 <sup>-1</sup> and 0.01–10,000 ngml
 <sup>-1</sup> were obtained for MERS-CoV and HCoV, respectively.
