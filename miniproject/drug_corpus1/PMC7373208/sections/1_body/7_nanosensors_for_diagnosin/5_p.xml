<p>In a study by Liu 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, an immunochromatographic strip (ICS) test was developed based on five IBV-specific monoclonal antibodies against the target antigens, spike (S) glycoprotein and nucleocapsid proteins (N), for the detection of IBV in infected chickens. During preparation of the ICS, monoclonal antibodyâ€“colloidal gold conjugate was used as a tracer in conjugation pad of the strip [

 <sup>4.4</sup> EID
 <sub>50</sub> was achieved for IBVs. Moreover, with RT-PCR as a reference, the assembled ICS were identified to be specific to IBV antigens only, compared with other respiratory pathogens including infections laryngotracheitis virus, avian influenza virus and Newcastle disease virus. There was good agreement between the results obtained by the ICS and RT-PCR. Therefore, given the fact that the RT-PCR is an expensive, technically demanding approach, the gold nanoparticles-based ICS technique appeared to have the potential of on-farm rapid detection of various IBV strains in chickens.
