<p>The quest for finding a reliable, safe and effective vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 is still underway. Several candidates have been developed ever since its appearance. But at the time of writing this article, there is still no licensed vaccine that can fight it off. According to the previous data obtained from other types of coronaviruses, nano-based vaccines have proven to evoke a more potent immune response. Therefore, further research is recommended to address the administration of nanoparticles toward the study of SARS-CoV-2 in order to create an experimental nano-based-vaccine in a suitable animal model hopefully to provide long-term immunization. Application of nano assays for detection of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is also a recommended topic for researchers in this area.Â Colorimetric sensing, electrochemiluminescence, immunosensing, photoluminescence and chiroimmunosensing and electrochemical sensors are potential techniques to detect coronaviruses in future with the aid of.</p>
