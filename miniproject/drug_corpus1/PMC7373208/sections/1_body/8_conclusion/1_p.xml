<p>Today, there is increasing concern on how to battle coronaviruses as they have been changing the way we live with novel coronavirus disease being a particularly problematic example. Despite considerable efforts which have been put in to developing an effective therapeutic strategy against different types of coronaviruses, no specific approach has yet been identified. Several studies have been conducted on the application of nanomaterials in the treatment, anti-infection and detection of some types of coronavirus, including those discussed in this report, as well as others [

Thus, an overview of studies regarding the effectiveness of nanoparticles for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes was presented envisioning the possibility of applying nanomaterials in development of a highly effective vaccine against coronaviruses. Up to now, gold, silver, silver sulfide, titanium oxide, zirconium, graphene and some biopolymeric compounds have been the most applicable nanomaterials for this goal. It has been suggested that nanoparticle-based vaccines have a great potential to induce higher protective immunity response in contrast to conventional antigen-based vaccines. Moreover, results have indicated that nano-assays hold promise for providing superior specificity and sensitivity, compared with the current techniques, when applied for rapid detection of viral infection at early stages.
