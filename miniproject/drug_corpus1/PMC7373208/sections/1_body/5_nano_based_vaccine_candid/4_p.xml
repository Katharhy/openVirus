<p>In 2019 Lin 
 <italic>et al.</italic> developed a novel viromimetic nanoparticle-based vaccine coupled with an immunologic stimulator of interferon genes agonist adjuvant against MERS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, a hollow polymeric nanocarriers coated with receptor binding domain (RBD) antigens were prepared followed by loading with cyclic diguanylate monophosphate as an emerging class of stimulator of interferon genes agonist adjuvant. C57BL/6 mice were then immunized with the developed vaccine. Lin 
 <italic>et al</italic>. reported that the virus-like NPs induced durable cellular and humoral immune responses. A strong and constant humoral and CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell response was also detected in the studied mice immunized with the virus-like NP vaccine compared with free RBD antigen admixed with either free cyclic diguanylate monophosphate or MF59 (AddaVax), an adjuvant for influenza vaccines that has been utilized clinically (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B–C). In contrast to MF59, this viromimetic NP vaccine induced higher levels of humoral responses. Furthermore, mice immunized with the proposed NP vaccine produced high levels of RBD-specific IgG2a antibodies without induction of lung eosinophilic immunopathology after the infection (See 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). In a recent study performed by Sekimukai 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, the efficacy of two types of adjuvants (AuNPs and Toll-like receptor agonists) with recombinant S protein were evaluated against SARS‐CoV infection in mice [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Results indicated that vaccination with AuNP‐adjuvanted protein elicited strong IgG response but, in contrast to a Toll-like receptor agonist‐adjuvanted vaccine, did not result in induction of protective antibodies and decreasing eosinophilic infiltration.
