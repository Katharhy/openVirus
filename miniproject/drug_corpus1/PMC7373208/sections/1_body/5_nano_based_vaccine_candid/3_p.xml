<p>Kim 
 <italic>et al.</italic> proposed a ferritin-based NP assembly mediated by RNA as a novel molecular chaperone and demonstrated that using their NP-based vaccine against MERS-CoV can induce CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, which in turn leads to the generation of IFN-γ and TNF-α upon antigen stimulation [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Additionally, Jung 
 <italic>et al.</italic> attempted to develop an immunogenic vaccine against MERS-CoV using a heterologous prime-boost strategy involving a recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 encoding the MERS-CoV spike gene (Ad5/MERS) and spike protein nanoparticles [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Groups of female BALB/c mice were immunized three times with the prime-boost vaccination. It was shown that the homologous spike protein NPs successfully induced higher antibody titers compared with the Ad5/MERS only group. However, a Th1 immune response was not observed to be provided by spike protein NPs themselves and only a Th2 immune response involving induction of neutralizing antibodies was elicited. Therefore, in order to provide much more durable immunogenicity and a suitable balance of Th1/Th2 responses, a heterologous one-stage Ad5/MERS prime and two-stage spike protein NPs boost seemed to be more effective than the homologous prime-boost regimen using either Ad5/MERS or spike protein nanoparticles alone.
