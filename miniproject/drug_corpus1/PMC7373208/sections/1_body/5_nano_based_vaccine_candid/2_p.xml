<p>For example, in 2011, Staroverov 
 <italic>et al.</italic> evaluated the protective immune response stimulated by the administration of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) conjugated with a type of coronavirus known as swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) in immunized mice and rabbits [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. TGEV-conjugated colloidal gold was found to elicit higher concentrations of IFN-Î³ and superior titers of neutralizing antibody in vaccinated animals. Immunization with the antigen-colloidal gold complex increased propagation of T cells tenfold in comparison with the response to free antigen and the authors of the study also reported that administration of the complex resulted in subsequent activation of macrophage respiratory activity and higher protective immunity against TGEV. Thus, AuNPs conjugated to a virus could be considered as a potential antiviral candidate for vaccine application.
