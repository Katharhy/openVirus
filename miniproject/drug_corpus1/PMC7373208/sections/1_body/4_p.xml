<p>Due to high rate of mortality and rapid global transmission of coronaviruses, this article aims to review the use of nano-sized materials for treatment, detection and antiviral activity against previous known coronaviruses. These may present a way to proceed for application of nanotechnology against new coronaviruses. In this special report, different strategies of using nanoparticles in dealing with coronaviruses are discussed in three parts: applications in nano-based vaccines, antiviral activity and development of diagnostic sensors.</p>
