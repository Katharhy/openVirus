<p>In the year 2017, Hu 
 <italic>et al.</italic> developed a promising treatment approach based on the nanoformulation of diphyllin for the treatment of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), which is caused by feline coronavirus [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Diphyllin is a vacuolar ATPase that has been demonstrated to inhibit endosomal acidification in fcwf-4 cells, a necessary process for virus uncoating and cellular entry. It was shown that poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(lactide-coglycolide), which was used as the diphyllin nanocarrier, enhanced the inhibitory activity of diphyllin against FIP and also improved the safety profile. The antiviral activity of diphyllin nanoparticles was also investigated. It should be noted that administration of high doses of the nanoparticles were found to be tolerable in mice. Therefore, diphyllin nanoparticles proved to have prominent antiviral effect against FIP. While not studied as a vaccine candidate, this study still demonstrates that nanoformulations can be effective against coronaviruses and this specific example could be a potential treatment candidate.
