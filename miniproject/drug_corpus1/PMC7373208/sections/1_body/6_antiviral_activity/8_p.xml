<p>Therefore, nanomaterials can have antiviral applications against a range of coronaviruses. However, more focus needs to be placed in investigating antiviral nanomedicines against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. A summary about the applied NPs-based antiviral agents for disinfection of coronaviruses with some details on their function and inhibition efficiency are represented in
