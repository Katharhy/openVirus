<p>A novel therapeutic strategy based on Ag nanomaterials against the alphacoronavirus PEDV was first introduced in 2018 by Du 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. They demonstrated that Ag
 <sub>2</sub>S nanoclusters (NCs) could restrain PEDV proliferation in treated Vero cells. As suggested by authors, this may be attributed to the fact that treatment with Ag
 <sub>2</sub>S NCs inhibited the viral budding and the synthesis of viral negative-strand RNA. Further, the Ag
 <sub>2</sub>S NCs were found to positively regulate the proliferation of IFN-stimulating genes and the expression of pro-inflammation cytokines, leading to protection against PEDV infection, making them a good option to be used in further studies as a treatment tool.
