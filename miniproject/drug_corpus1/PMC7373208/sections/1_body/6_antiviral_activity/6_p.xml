<p>The antiviral activity of graphene oxide–silver (GO–Ag) nanocomposites was reported against non-enveloped and enveloped viruses by Chen 
 <italic>et al.</italic> in 2016 [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. To evaluate the antiviral activity of GO-Ag, GO–Ag solutions with different dilution orders were incubated with serially diluted solution of feline coronavirus. After removing the composite particles, the supernatant was tested using a virus inhibition assay. They demonstrated that 0.1 mg/ml of GO–Ag can inhibits 24.8% of feline coronavirus infection. GO–Ag showed higher efficacy when compared with treatment with GO alone. As illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, during the process of restraining viral infection, GO sheets, which were negatively charged, interact with the positively charged lipid membranes and silver particles bind to the sulfur groups of the viral proteins. As a result, it has been shown that GO could only have an inhibitory effect on enveloped viruses at noncytotoxic concentrations while GO sheets containing AgNPs are capable of impeding the infection caused by both nonenveloped and enveloped viruses.
