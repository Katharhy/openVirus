<p>To tackle human coronavirus NL63, Ciejka 
 <italic>et al.</italic> developed a biopolymeric material to form nano/microspheres (NS/MS) which had good potential for adsorbing coronaviruses [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The investigation demonstrated that after addition of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-3-trimethyl chitosan (H-HTCC)-NS/MS to viral suspensions there was a decrease in the copy number of viral RNA, this showed good correlation with the amount of added H-HTCC-NS/MS. Their study showed that 2.5 mg/500 μl H-HTCC-NS/MS could cause a decrease equal to 99.60%. When 10 mg/500 μl of HHTCC-NS/MS was added, there was a decrease of 99.92%.
