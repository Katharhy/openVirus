<p>In 2014, Lv 
 <italic>et al</italic>. compared the strength of immune responses induced by four different silver nanomaterials, including silver NPs, silver nanowires of 60 and 400 nm and silver colloids, on TGEV in infected swine testicle cells [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. At a concentration of 3.125–12.5 μg/ml, the percentage reduction in virus titer was evaluated in different silver nanomaterials. It was shown that of the different types of silver nanomaterials, only Ag NPs and the two types of Ag nanowires induced protection against TGEV. The silver colloids were not reported to restrain cellular entry of the virus. The Ag NPs and silver nanowires were capable of reducing the number of apoptotic cells elicited by TGEV.
