<p>In a patent invented in 2014 by Cho 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, a mixture comprising silver colloid, titanium dioxide (TiO
 <sub>2</sub>) NPs, a dispersion stabilizer, a binder and water showed its antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities (US 8,673,331 B2) [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Results of antiviral tests showed that at 100-fold dilution of the composition concentration showed an antiviral activity against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and TGEV at a rate of 99.99% or higher. On the other hand, when the composition concentration was 1000-fold diluted, the inhibited growth of the viruses was at a rate of 99.9% for PEDV and 93.0% inhibition for TGEV. The antiviral activity of the nanomaterial proposed Cho 
 <italic>et al.</italic> was therefore dependent on composition concentration meaning dosage should be adjusted to have desired inhibition [
