<p>Viral infections, due to their problematic wide spreading and their ability to evolve by genetic mutation can pose a great threat to human health. In the last few decades, the high number of deaths caused by some viral infections has been also a challenge for healthcare systems [

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The Coronaviridae family, commonly named as coronaviruses (CoVs), is composed of two subfamilies: Coronavirinae and Torovirinae. Infection with a member of the Coronavirinae subfamily can lead to any of reproductive disease, pneumonia, polyserositis, enteritis, hepatitis, encephalomyelitis, nephritis or sialo dacryoadenitis in mammals and birds. Coronavirus and coronavirus-like infections have been reported in various wild and livestock animals such as swine, horses, cattle, cats, dogs, camels, birds and bats [

In humans, coronaviruses include a wide range of viruses contributing to the common cold as well as to more severe respiratory diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and novel coronavirus. Since coronaviruses can be transmitted between animals and people, their effect is known as zoonotic diseases. Previous studies have found that MERS and SARS coronaviruses jumped to humans from dromedary camels and civet cats, respectively, before being transmitted to humans. There are various known coronaviruses which can infect animals that have not been seen in humans yet [
