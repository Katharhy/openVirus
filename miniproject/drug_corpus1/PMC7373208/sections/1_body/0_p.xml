 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2â€“4</xref>] and bio-labeling [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Nowadays, nanotechnology has been used in many different parts of medical science, such as gene delivery [

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], imaging [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], artificial implants [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and sensing platforms for public safety and other biosensors [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Furthermore, it can be exploited for treatment or diagnosis of cancer [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and development of potent agents against viral, bacterial and fungal infections. The rationale of this interest in using nanotechnology in medicine is the nanometer size of the materials, which allows entrance into the cells of living systems and especially into the human body. In addition, nanomaterials can play a protective role, preventing the encapsulated drug or anti-infection agent from degradation because of the shielding properties of these nano-sized materials [
