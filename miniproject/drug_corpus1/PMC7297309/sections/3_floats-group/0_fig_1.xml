  <title>Metapopulation susceptible-infected-recovered model for directly transmitted disease in Yushu City and Nong’an County.</title>
  <p>Panel A shows the location of the Jilin province in northeastern China. Panel B is a blow-up of A showing the locations of our two data sets Yushu City and Nong’an County. Panel C (D) shows the 27 (22) divisions of Yushu City (Nong’an County). These divisions are administrative by construction, but also define the metapopulation we use in our modeling.</p>
