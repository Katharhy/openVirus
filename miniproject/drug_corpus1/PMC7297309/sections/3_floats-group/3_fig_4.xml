  <title>Speed of epidemic introduction and outward transmission correlate and increase with strength.</title>
  <p>For each urban location in one of our two data sets, we estimate the speed of an outward transmission (x-axes) following an introduction into that location until 10% of locations experience outbreaks. We average this value over different runs of the epidemic simulations for each of the 28 different introduction times. The speed of introduction (y-axes) is estimated by the time since the introduction in another location until the focal location receives its first infection, averaged over all introduction location-time combinations. Colors correspond the strength (total mobility flow in and out from a location over seven days). All these simulations assume an initial outbreak of no circadian effect and
