  <title>Epidemic growth depends on circadian rhythms.</title>
  <p>For each city, the time until 10% of locations are infected (Γ
   <sub>10%</sub>), averaged over epidemics for each of the different introduction timings and sites. We compare simulations in settings with the time-dependent transmission rate at three different strengths of the circadian effects (high 
   <italic>C</italic> = 1, medium 
   <italic>C</italic> = 0.5 and no 
   <italic>C</italic> = 0 circadian effect). Epidemic growth varies in different cities and levels of circadian rhythms. Larger Γ
   <sub>10%</sub> is observed with the time dependent transmission rate than without, decreasingly with higher 
   <italic>C</italic>.
