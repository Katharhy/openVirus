  <title>Epidemic growth if advancing or delaying mobility patterns one hour for the Yushu City data.</title>
  <p>Here we study epidemics by shifting mobility with one hour earlier (panels a and b) or later (e and f), in contrast with that without shifting (c and d). For each city, the time until 10% of locations are infected (Γ
   <sub>10%</sub>) is averaged over epidemics for each of the different introduction times and sites. We compare simulations in settings with the time dependent transmission rate characterized by three levels of circadian effects (high 
   <italic>C</italic> = 1, medium 
   <italic>C</italic> = 0.5 and 
   <italic>C</italic> = 0 with no circadian effect). Epidemic growth varies in different levels of circadian rhythms. Larger Γ
   <sub>10%</sub> is observed with two patterns over 
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sub>0</sub>s: First, the time dependent transmission rate than without, increasingly with higher 
   <italic>C</italic>, when mobility is earlier one hour or not. Second, the time dependent transmission rate than without, increasingly with higher 
   <italic>C</italic>, when mobility is delayed one hour. These two patterns can be distinguish by the relative transmission speed (
