<p>Basing disease simulations of large data sets of human mobility is challenging. Even though one has access to the trajectories of individuals, running individual based simulations is difficult [

Instead researchers rather use metapopulation models where the individuals are assumed to be well mixed within a metapopulation [
 <xref rid="pone.0234619.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] at one segment of time. With metapopulation models, one still takes the flow of people and structures in geography and time into account [
 <xref rid="pone.0234619.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Many cases, including ours, one can argue that metapopulation models is modeling at the same level of detail as the original data set, since the sampled trajectories does not cover everyone moving in the area and this incompleteness hard to assess and compensate by adding simulated people.
