<p>Just like individual-based epidemic models, metapopulation models divide the population into classes (compartments) with respect to the disease and models the dynamics of the individuals within these compartments. We base or simulation on the work of Wesolowski 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pone.0234619.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and thus considers four disease compartments: susceptible (individuals don not have, but could get, the disease), exposed (individuals who have got the disease, but cannot yet infect others), infective (individuals who have the disease and can spread it to susceptibles) and recovered (individuals who are immune or deceased and cannot get or spread the disease). For each location 
 <italic>i</italic>, we denote the number of individuals in the three compartments at time 
 <italic>t</italic> by 
 <italic>S</italic>

  <italic>t</italic>,

  <italic>t</italic>,
  <italic>i</italic>

 <italic>R</italic>
