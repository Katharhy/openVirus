<p>How to parameterize the circadian effect on the immune system, is still rather unknown in the medical literature. There are some results about herpes and influenza virus infections, respectively, with respect to viral replication volumes in the 24-hour circadian clock [
 <xref rid="pone.0234619.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] pointing at the range 0.5 &lt; 
 <italic>C</italic> &lt; 1. We use three levels of the strength of the circadian impact on the immune system, spanning the entire range: high 
 <italic>C</italic> = 1, medium 
 <italic>C</italic> = 0.5 and low (or, rather, no) circadian effect 
 <italic>C</italic> = 0.
