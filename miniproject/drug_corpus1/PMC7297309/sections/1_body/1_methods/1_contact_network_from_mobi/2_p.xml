<p>We divide each county into metapopulations (henceforth 
 <italic>locations</italic>) corresponding to administrative divisions within a city as reported in the data (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234619.g001">Fig 1</xref>). In this contact network, an edge denotes the flow of people between two locations and is weighted by the total number of users’ movements in a specific hour of the data. In the raw data, the trips are reported as quadruplets (
 <italic>a</italic>, 
 <italic>i</italic>, 
 <italic>j</italic>, 
 <italic>t</italic>) meaning that individual 
 <italic>a</italic> travelled between locations 
 <italic>i</italic> to 
 <italic>j</italic> and arrived during the 
 <italic>t</italic>’th hour of the data. From this data, we derive a series of 168 hourly mobility matrices 
 <italic>W</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub>, one for each hour 
 <italic>t</italic> of the week. The 
 <italic>ij</italic>-th entry of an hourly mobility matrix at hour 
 <italic>t</italic>, 
 <italic>w</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>ij</italic>,
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub>, denotes the number of users traveling from location 
 <italic>i</italic> to location 
 <italic>j</italic> at time 
 <italic>t</italic> (at an hourly resolution).
