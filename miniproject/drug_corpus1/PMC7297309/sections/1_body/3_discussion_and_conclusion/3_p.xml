<p>We also studied effects of shifting the clock time one hour relative to the sun. These effects could be larger (up to 10%) in the scenarios we simulated. Once again, this is specific to the travel data we studied (two urban regions in northeastern China, in August 2017). Probably, in even larger cities, or cities with yet more pronounced rush hours, these effects could be much larger. By shifting the time zone of a location, one could thus, in theory, slow down the disease propagation considerably, which would give more time for public health authorities to raise awareness of the disease and employ countermeasures. That much said, shifting the times of our daily lives would of course be a political process of great inertia. There is also the caveat that some of our routines are guided by the sun rather than the clock, so shifting the time zone is not the same as shifting the travel patterns. Clearly there is room for more research in the interface of chronobiology, epidemiology and data science (cf. Ref. [
