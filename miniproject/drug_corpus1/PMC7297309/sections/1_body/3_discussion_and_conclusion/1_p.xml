<p>We have investigated the effects of the coupling of the circadian rhythms of the immune systems and the daily travel patterns of city dwellers. In line with recent studies of urban epidemiology [

 <xref rid="pone.0234619.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], we used a metapopulation model based on real survey data that we parameterized to reflect two recent urban disease outbreaks of influenza and varicella [
