<p>This work connects to a larger context of urban planning and social engineering. Earlier studies have found certain locations in cities to be extra important for epidemics [

 <xref rid="pone.0234619.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], but since they per definition have high strength (many people passing through them), they will also be key locations for the transmission of infections. By taking this into account in city planning, public facilities built to lower disease transmission would be efficient and perhaps cost effective [
