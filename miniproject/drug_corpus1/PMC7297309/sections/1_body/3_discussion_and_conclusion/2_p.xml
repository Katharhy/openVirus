<p>With this set-up, we found a small effect (3% difference or less) in including the circadian dependence of the immune systems. On one hand, possibly this effect is smaller than other sources of error, and could thus be neglected. On the other hand, it is possible that for other situations—other diseases, in other populations, at other locations and times of the year—this effect would be larger and less negligible. If possible, we thus recommend modelers to include the effect of the immune system’s circadian dependence.</p>
