<p>If the immune system and the travel patterns were the only phenomena following circadian patterns, then taking their coupling into account would be straightforward. One could simulate the disease propagation at a time resolution of days using standard models, only the parameter values would need to be adjusted. However, this is not the case. Many types of infections have a faster development than could be captured by such a coarse time resolution [
