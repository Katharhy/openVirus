<p>Disease spreading is a phenomenon that is affected by a multitude of factors. Some of these occurs at different time scales—like evolution of pathogens is usually slower than the microscopic pathogenesis in individuals, that typically is slower than the mixing and interaction of people. In such a case, in epidemic modeling, one can separate the timescales and treat the slower changing feature as static. In other cases, the timescales are similar and then one cannot simplify a model like that. The life in cities follow a 24-hour, circadian rhythm. Many people commute at the same times every day [

This means that the synchronization of the travel and the immune systems could affect the predictions of disease models and should ideally not be ignored. Still, to the best of our knowledge, no study takes this coupling into account but assume epidemiological characteristics (i.e., the transmission rate) are static over the course of hours and days [
