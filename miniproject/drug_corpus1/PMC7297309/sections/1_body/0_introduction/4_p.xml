<p>As a basis for our study, we use real data of daily travel patterns as our substrate for interpersonal contacts. The data comes from mobility surveys from two counties (roughly the second level administrative division of China, after provinces)—Yushu City and Nong’an County—in China’s northeastern Jilin province (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234619.g001">Fig 1</xref>). From the data, we can see how many people that travelled between subdivisions of the counties at different times. This type of data lends itself well to a meta population type modeling, where one simulates assumes each location to be well-mixed and use the observed population flow to model the disease spreading between the locations [

To incorporate the circadian patterns of the immune system, we use a sinusodial correction factor to the transmission rate parameters to model the circadian rhythms of the immune system. With this setup we investigate different scenarios like: the effect of including the circadian effects of the immune system (compared to modeling it as constant through the day) and the effect of shifting the mobility patterns relative to the immune system.
