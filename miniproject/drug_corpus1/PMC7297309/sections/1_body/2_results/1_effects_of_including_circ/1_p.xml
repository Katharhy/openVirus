<p>Our first investigation concerns the epidemiological importance of introduction timing with and without explicit modeling of the circadian rhythm of the immune system. We measure the time following an introduction of the disease at a location until 10% of the locations have infected people, i.e. the outward transmission speed Γ
 <sub>10%</sub>. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234619.g003">Fig 3</xref>, the epidemic spreads slowest in simulations without the circadian effects, fastest in the case of highest circadian dependence of the immune system. The effect is significant but rather weak. The observed pattern holds for both high and low 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> but is somewhat more pronounced at low 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>. Furthermore, for each introduction location, we measure the introduction speed 
 <italic>χ</italic>—the number of hours following introduction in another location until the focal location receives its first infection over diverse introduction timings (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234619.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The speed of introduction location to spread pathogens, as captured by Γ
 <sub>10%</sub>, seems to be anti-correlated with the strength of the locations (the total amount of in- and outflow of people), confirming observations in Ref. [
