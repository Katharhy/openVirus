<p>In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234619.g004">Fig 4</xref>, we measure the network structural effect directly. We plot the correlations of three measures: strength (mobility flow into a location), Γ
 <sub>10%</sub>, and 
 <italic>χ</italic>. The three measures are highly correlated with each other. For example of simulations with no circadian effect and 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> = 1.5 in the Yushu City, 
 <italic>χ</italic> and Γ
 <sub>10%</sub> are correlated with a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.83, and the speeds correlate to strength with coefficients of −0.85 and −0.75, respectively (all have 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Although not related to, or much affected by, the circadian effects, the centrality of locations (quantified by strength) is thus an important determinant of their role in the epidemics.
