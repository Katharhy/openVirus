<p>In the previous section, we established that there is a non-negligible effect of the circadian rhythms on the results of epidemic modeling. In this section, we look at the effects of the synchronicity between the immune system and the mobility patterns of people. Phrasing this in terms of parameter values, while in the previous section we were varying 
 <italic>C</italic> and kept Δ
 <italic>t</italic> constant, in this section we vary Δ
 <italic>t</italic> and keep 
 <italic>C</italic> constant. In Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234619.g005">5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234619.g006">6</xref>, we use a box-and-whiskers plots to show the effects of shifting the travel patterns forward or backwards in time. This effect is much bigger than the effect of tuning 
 <italic>C</italic>. In particular, for the case of strong circadian rhythms Γ
 <sub>10%</sub> gets delayed up to 10%, or seven hours, with one-hour delays of the travel rhythm of people Δ
 <italic>t</italic> = 1 hour. (Relative changes are summarized in 
 <xref rid="pone.0234619.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.) There is an asymmetry in this effect in that setting Δ
 <italic>t</italic> = −1 gives the reverse effect, but of a lesser magnitude. This is a manifestation of what we mentioned above—that the effect of the coupling between travel patterns and the circadian rhythms of people is complex and trying to capture it by a general fudge factor might not be enough for an accurate modeling.
