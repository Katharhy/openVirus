  <p>SARS-CoV-2 infection in renal disease and therapeutic targeting of RCC. The top panel shows an overview of the primary signaling targets of viral infection and their association with renal disease. The bottom panel shows a proposed schema of the current therapeutic management (blocking ACE2 receptor pathway and hence viral internalization into host cells) and prevention strategies (controlling inflammation and immunosuppression, and consequently cell response to virulence) for COVID-19 patients with underlying renal disease.</p>
  <p>ACE2 = angiotensin-converting enzyme-2; COVID-19 = coronavirus disease 2019; SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.</p>
