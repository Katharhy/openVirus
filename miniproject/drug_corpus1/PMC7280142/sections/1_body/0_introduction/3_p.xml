<p id="par0010">While investigations are intensified as to the mechanisms of viral infectivity, person-to-person transmission of the virus includes droplet inhalation transmission and contact transmission through oral, nasal, and eye mucous membrane contacts 
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Symptoms of virulence varies depending on the patient but often includes fever and dry cough, while others suffer from fatigue, dyspnea, nasal congestion, nausea, or diarrhea

Owing to the immense burden of the disease on the health, livelihood, and economics of the global population, it is crucial to consider the molecular aspects of the virus, its functional interaction with host cellular signaling, its association with certain comorbidities, and potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment of COVID-19.
