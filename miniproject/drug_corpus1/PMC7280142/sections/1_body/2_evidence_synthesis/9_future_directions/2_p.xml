<p id="par0165">Through repurposing existing drugs such as ACEis and developing new antibodies to combat SARS-CoV-2, future clinical trials in COVID-19 patients battling RCC are a top priority in overcoming the pandemic (
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Mechanistic exploitation of the baseline expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the lung epithelium and kidney tissue of RCC patients will lead to their therapeutic targeting and correlation with the therapeutic response. Whole-blood, whole-urine genomics have yet to be investigated in COVID-19 patients; of immediate clinical significance will be a study of cfDNA, CTCs, exosome-based biomarker’s correlation, and their genomic landscape among RCC and COVID-19–positive patients to enable new insights into the downstream effect of viral damage on renal function. Liquid biopsy could be the most effective tool for early identification, intervention, and improved prognosis among RCC patients harboring SARS-CoV-2 infection. As research efforts escalate globally toward the eradication of COVID-19 in cancer patients, our team joins the battle, driven by science-based evidence to develop action guidelines and therapeutic strategies in the management of RCC patients diagnosed with COVID-19.
