A low pH and pH-dependent endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsins also facilitate the entry of the virus 
 <xref rid="bib0395" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>. Thus, lysosomotropic agents, such as the antimalaria drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, can accumulate intracellularly and neutralize the endosome-lysosomal acidic pH, blocking protease activity and inhibiting viral entry into the cell (
