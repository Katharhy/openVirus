<p id="par0155">A potential new strategy for drug development involves blocking the ACE2 receptor to inhibit the binding and subsequent entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells. An antibody binding to the ACE2 protein blocks the entry of SARS effectively. Additionally, a small receptor-binding domain from the SARS S protein, which binds to the ACE2 receptor, has been shown to be effective in blocking the entry of SARS in cell culture
