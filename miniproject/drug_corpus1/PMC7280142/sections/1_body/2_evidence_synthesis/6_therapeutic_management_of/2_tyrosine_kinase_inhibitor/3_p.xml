<p id="par0105">The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has become increasingly popular in the treatment of RCC. ICIs work to prevent the downregulation of cellular immune responses within tumors by targeting the interaction of programmed cell death protein (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) and CTLA-4 and its ligand B7-CTLA-4 
 <xref rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. The standard of care of mRCC following the approval of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency is the combination of a TKI and an ICI, such as nivolumab plus ipilimumab, which provides the best response rate and survival

 <xref rid="bib0255" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. There have also been proposals for other combinations, such as pembrolizumab plus axitinib and avelumab plus axitinib 
 <xref rid="bib0265" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. The efficacy of ICIs in conjugation with COVID-19 infection is under intense investigation. Recent evidence suggests that restoration of immunocompetence with ICIs impacts the development of cytokine release syndrome and contributes to the severity of COVID-19 and ARDS 
 <xref rid="bib0270" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Additionally, CoV-related interstitial pneumonia could be worsened by potential pneumological toxicity from anit-PD-1/PD-L1 ICI agents. However, discontinuation of ICIs in patients with COVID-19 infections is not recommended due relatively better outcomes than in those patients who are immunosuppressed from chemotherapy

 <xref rid="bib0270" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. In one case study, tocilizumab was used successfully to treat immune-related adverse events (irAEs), namely arthritis, in patients receiving ICI therapy. Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against the interleukin (IL)-6 receptor, serves as a potential neutralizing antibody in treating COVID-19 
 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. This is of particular significance in the treatment of RCC patients with COVID-19 infection, as the treatment of ICIs and tocilizumab may overcome irAE side effects.
