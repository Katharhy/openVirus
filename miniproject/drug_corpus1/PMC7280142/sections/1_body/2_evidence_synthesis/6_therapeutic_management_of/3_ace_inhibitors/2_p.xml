 <xref rid="bib0280" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Lower expression of Ang II receptors yielded better survival in patients with clear cell RCC, and increased ACE activity has been associated with higher tumor grades

 <xref rid="bib0290" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. While the decrease in degradation of bradykinin by ACEis may stimulate growth, survival, and migration of cancer cells, these effects must ultimately be offset by the decrease in angiogenic effects through the decreased VEGF expression due to decreased Ang II

 <xref rid="bib0280" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. There is also the potential for Ang 1–7, increased with the use of ACEis, to have antitumor effects by decreasing cell migration and invasion of cancer cells and reducing tumor growth by decreasing VEGF

 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). There is the potential to increase an RCC patient’s susceptibility to a more severe form of the disease due to increased ACE2 to which the virus can bind with the administration of ACEis.
