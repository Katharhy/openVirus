 <xref rid="bib0330" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. Exosomes, cell-free (cf) DNA/RNA, and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are currently at the forefront of liquid biopsy research, while cf proteins and lipids are also gaining momentum, and various biosensing assays are being developed for their analyses

 <xref rid="bib0340" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. Recent studies in RCC patients have utilized blood-based assays in combination with microRNA and/or protein biomarkers to provide tumor monitoring at high sensitivity and specificity 
 <xref rid="bib0345" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. Hence, RCC-associated biomarkers, which are found in circulating bodily fluids, are strong indicators of an unequivocal future of 
 <italic>NextGen-liquid biopsy</italic> as novel tools for disease monitoring, biomarker discovery, and precision medicine. Recently, RCC-based liquid biopsy was validated and approved by the US FDA for the prognosis and diagnosis of the disease 
 <xref rid="bib0350" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. RCC-associated tumor-based CTCs and cfDNA are studied for their genomic and epigenomic landscape, providing vital information about tumor heterogeneity and tissue lineage 
 <xref rid="bib0350" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. Furthermore, two recent studies of several urinary- and serum-associated protein and RNA biomarkers in RCC, carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) and ceruloplasmin (CP), were found to be significantly increased in RCC patient’s urinary exosomes while they remain the same in the control cohort 
 <xref rid="bib0355" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. Podocalyxin-like protein 1 (PODXL; expressed in podocytes) and aquaporin 1 (AQP1, a water channel) are proteins expressed by kidney and not significantly increased in RCC 
 <xref rid="bib0355" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. More recent evidence identified serum miR-378 and miR-451 as RCC biomarkers
