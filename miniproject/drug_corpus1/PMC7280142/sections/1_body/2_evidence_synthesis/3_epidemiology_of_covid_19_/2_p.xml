<p id="par0045">The COVID-19 pandemic created unique circumstances and challenges for cancer patients, including patients with renal cancer and their clinical providers across the clinical care continuum and management trajectory (ie, cancer diagnosis, treatment, follow-up care, end of life). Epidemiological evidence so far indicates that cancer patients have a higher risk of contracting COVID-19, developing complications, and deteriorating more rapidly 
 <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Specifically, the mortality rate is significantly higher among SARS-CoV-2â€“infected patients with active cancer (28.6%) than in patients with other comorbidities. Older cancer survivors are more vulnerable to COVID-19 because of existing chronic, comorbid health conditions (diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory diseases) 
 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Cancer patients presenting at clinics and hospitals for cancer care might have increased exposure to other infected patients and clinical care personnel, leading to increased risk of COVID-19, morbidity, and mortality.
