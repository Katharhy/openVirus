<p id="par0095">In addition to chronic and acute renal injury, renal cancer must also be assessed when evaluating the risk factors of developing severe COVID-19 infections. In the USA, nearly 60 000 individuals had RCC in 2018, although few studies have evaluated the incidence of renal cancer in COVID-19 cases

Lung cancer was the most frequent type of cancer in the study population (28%), but one case had a history of RCC. Additionally, patients with cancer had a higher risk of severe complications than patients without cancer; cancer patients treated with chemotherapy or surgery had a higher risk of severe events than those not receiving treatment. These are important considerations in decision making regarding the clinical care of a cancer patient infected with the virus (
