The same study also reported that on admission, 43.9% of patients had proteinuria, 26.7% had hematuria, and 13â€“14% had elevated serum creatinine, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and estimated glomerular filtration rate under 60 ml/min. The study confirmed that elevated baseline serum creatinine, elevated baseline BUN, AKI stage, proteinuria, and hematuria were independent risk factors for in-hospital death. The incidence of AKI was significantly higher in patients with elevated baseline serum creatinine; 33.7% of these patients died in hospital, a significantly higher percentage than that of patients with normal creatinine levels. Computed tomography scans of kidneys also showed reduced density, suggestive of inflammation and edema
