<p id="p0015">Fortunately, the relatively new field of sewage epidemiology (also called wastewater-based epidemiology: WBE) has been advancing steadily over the last 15Â years (for example, see 
 <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Choi et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Daughton, 2018</xref>), with research efforts largely concentrated in Europe. Originally geared toward determining the population-wide use of illicit drugs, this monitoring concept has since evolved to include a broad array of other types of substances in wastewater, including virus particles. So the time required for developing and implementing a wastewater monitoring approach specifically designed for SARS-CoV-2 (and therefore Covid-19) might be greatly reduced.
