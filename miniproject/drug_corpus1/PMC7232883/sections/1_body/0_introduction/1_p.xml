<p>Since December 2019, a outbreak of COVID-19 with massive global impact has started in Hubei and Wuhan city in China caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (Bhoopathi et al.,

 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). On January 2020, World health organization emergency committee declared a global health emergency based on the high rate of spreading of the infection with high fatality rate (Chhikara et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Kumar &amp; Rathi, 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). As of now on 4th April 2020, Europe and USA are new epicentres of COVID-19 Pandemic. Even in the past, different coronaviruses have caused multiple human diseases that resulted in global epidemics such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While the coronaviruses have a significant impact on human health, the general public has an inferior awareness of coronavirus pathogenesis and infection. COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March 2020 as the worldwide human population is facing high risk from contracting the nCoV infection. Many countries, including India, has announced lockdown in the country and to maintain social distancing to avoid further spread as no drug or vaccine is available against SARS-CoV-2. Coronavirus has been classified into four subfamilies based on their shape and host. These subfamilies are alpha-coronavirus, beta-coronavirus, gamma-coronavirus and delta coronavirus (Paules et al.,

Coronaviruses contain a positive sense, single-strand RNA genome coding for viral polymerase, RNA synthesis materials, and large non-structural polypeptide. Coronavirus genome contains transcriptional modification, including 5’methylated cap and a 3’polyadenylated tail. Coronaviruses have very high rates of error in RNA replication due to constant errors by RNA dependent RNA polymerase (Banerjee et al.,
