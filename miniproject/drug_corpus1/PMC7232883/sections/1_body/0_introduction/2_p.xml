<p>Only a few protein crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 are available on protein databank. SARS-CoV-2 main protease, a potential drug target, crystal structure (PDB-ID: 6Y84) was available and used for docking simulation and identification of potential drug molecule form Indian spices. SARS-CoV-2 main protease has a vital role in the processing of polyprotein that is translated from viral RNA, and the protease is considered as key for viral survival and growth (Prajapat etÂ al.,
