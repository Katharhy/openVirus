<p>SARS-CoV-2 Mpro Protein (PDBID- 6Y84) active site defined but unliganded (Owen et al., 2019) was used and the molecules where docked in the region where α–ketoamide was bound to protein (PDBID- 6Y2F) (SARS- CoV-2) main protease with bound with α–ketoamide (Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) involving His41,164 and Cys145 in the active site. α–ketoamide was hence used as a positive control for this study and resulting interactions were analytically compared with the other Indian spices. α–ketoamide showed interactions with Cys145 via hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions His41. It was also seen to form hydrogen bonds with Thr26. Upon further analysis of the docking results, it was seen that our molecules had comparable binding energy as to α–ketoamide suggesting that these ingredients could indeed interact with same site (amino acids) as α–ketoamide. Carnasol (-8.2 Kcal/mol) was seen to form hydrogen bonds with Leu141, Ser144 and Cys145. Hydrophobic interactions for Carnasol include His41, Thr25, Asn142, Phe140, Glu166, Met165 (

 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic>), has been previously reported to have antioxidant activity, shows binding energy of -7.99 Kcal/mol and forms hydrogen bonds with Leu141, Gly 143, Ser144 and Cys145. Further hydrophobic interactions are shown with Thr25, 26, His41, Phe140, His163, and Leu27 (
