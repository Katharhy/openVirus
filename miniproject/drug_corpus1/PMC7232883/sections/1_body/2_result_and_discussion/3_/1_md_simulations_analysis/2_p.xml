<p>We have also analysed the molecules we report here for violation of Lipinski’s rule (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Rosmanol, Carnosol fits perfectly as within the defined parameters for non-violation of Lipinski’s rule. The molecules have Log P values ranging from 1.15 to 3.27 which imply that these can effectively have suitable cell membrane permeability.
