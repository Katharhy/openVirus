<p>Their number of hydrogen bond donors as well acceptors are well within range for Carnosol and Rosmanol but Arjunglucoside-I show high number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. Arjunglucoside is a large molecule having high molecular weight and total polar solvent area. Despite these factors it might prove to be essential in terms of potential drug once preceded with advanced studies.</p>
