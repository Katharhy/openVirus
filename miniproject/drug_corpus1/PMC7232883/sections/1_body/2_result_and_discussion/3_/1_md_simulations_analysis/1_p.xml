<p>The results of MD simulation for both apo and ligand complex is analyzed for the 50
 <bold> </bold>ns of time scale to understand the dynamic behavior and stability. MD simulation is performed for the total of 50
 <bold> </bold>ns and the trajectories are for RMSD plot as shown in the 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>. The figure represents the colors with (a) Apo protein, complexed with (b) Alpha ketoamide, (c) Arjun glycoside, (d) Carnosol, and (e) Rosmanol for the 50
 <bold> </bold>ns of time scale. For the apo protein, observed the initial 45
 <bold> </bold>ns of MD simulation as stable, but after the 45
 <sup>th</sup> ns there is a sudden drift and that may occur due to the higher occupancy of flexible loops in the C-terminal region (182-304 residues). Even though the apo protein shows the value of ∼2.0
 <bold> </bold>Å till 47
 <sup>th</sup> ns and remaining 3
 <bold> </bold>ns ends with ∼3.4
 <bold> </bold>Å. For understanding the residue wise fluctuation between the apo and ligand complex, the RMSF values are plotted. The RMSD deviation for the apo and complex proteins clearly shows the dynamic movement that occurs in the loop regions. For understanding the residues participated in the causative for fluctuations, the RMSF plot is provided in the 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>. Here, the amino acid in each position is calculated for its deviation value with the calculated timescale of 50
 <bold> </bold>ns. For apo protein, the amino acid from 70-75
 <sup>th</sup>, 160-175
 <sup>th</sup> position shows the deviation up to ∼4Å, apart from these regions other amino acids are deviating from ∼1-3Å. The deviation that occurs in the 70-75
 <sup>th</sup>, 160-175
 <sup>th</sup> position may be functionally reason for the drift in apo protein RMSD at 45
 <sup>th</sup> ns. While comparing the apo RMSF values with the complex protein RMSF, notably Carnosol is showing high deviations than the other ligand complexes. The amino acid positions from 40-60
 <sup>th</sup>, 150-155
 <sup>th</sup>, 178-200
 <sup>th</sup> position is showing higher deviations, that ranges from ∼4-6Å deviations. Due to these positional amino acid fluctuations, the RMSD of Carnosol deviates approximately 4
 <bold> </bold>Å after the 26
 <sup>th</sup> ns. Similarly, another compound Rosmanol also showing the fluctuations in C-terminal regions, that results in the ∼3-3.5
 <bold> </bold>Å deviations in the RMSD values. The protein secondary structure is framed as 3 sheets, 7 beta hairpins, 9 beta bulges, 13 strands, 32 beta turns, 3 gamma turns from this 182-304 residues are occupied dominantly by loop regions. These 122 residues in the C-terminal functionally act in the MD simulation, and thus the sudden drift happens in the 45
 <sup>th</sup> ns. This values of RMSD for the apo protein, is compared with ligand molecules in the 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>, and for understanding the deviations, the 25
 <sup>th</sup> to 50
 <sup>th</sup> ns is focused. The results of ligand complex for the MD simulation of 50
 <bold> </bold>ns of timescale shows that the ligand complex Alpha ketoamide (Red color) and Arjun glycoside (Blue color) shows stable throughout the simulation. While comparing these two Alpha ketoamide and Arjun glycoside ligand complex with apo protein, the ligand complex is matched with apo protein for the timescale of 45
 <sup>th</sup> ns. After the 45
 <sup>th</sup> ns the apo protein is drifted upwards, but the Alpha ketoamide and Arjun glycoside ligand complex remains stable. This may be due to the strong interaction pattern seen in Alpha ketoamide and Arjun glycoside interactions with the protein. Both the Alpha ketoamide and Arjun glycoside ligand bound complex are stable and positioned in the range of ∼2Å, which is close to the apo protein till 47
 <sup>th</sup> ns. The 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figures 5a and 5b</xref> shows the hydrogen bond interactions for the Alpha ketoamide and Arjun glycoside, which clearly shows the minimum participation of 2-3 hydrogen bonds seen in between the Alpha ketoamide and protein, and minimum participation of 4-6 hydrogen bonds between the Arjun glycoside and protein. This active participation of hydrogen bonds between the Alpha ketoamide and Arjun glycoside with protein makes the ligand complex stable for 50
 <bold> </bold>ns of MD simulations. The ligand Carnosol shows stable movement in terms of RMSD values by showing a narrow graph, but while comparing with apo protein, the Carnosol ligand complex is deviated from the 14
 <sup>th</sup> ns and stays in the range bound of ∼3.4
 <bold> </bold>Å till the end of the simulations. For attaining the stable MD simulation for the Carnosol ligand bound complex, 2-3 hydrogen bonds are actively contributed and makes the complex stable in the dynamic state. The ligand Rosmanol bound complex shows stability till the 26
 <sup>th</sup> ns with the range of ∼2.5
 <bold> </bold>Å, but after that, the drift happens to make the RMSD value deviated in upward direction and fix the positional RMSD with the range of ∼4
 <bold> </bold>Å. This may be due to the loss of hydrogen bonding interactions after the 27
 <sup>th</sup> ns seen in the 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5d</xref>. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5d</xref> says that the initial 27
 <bold> </bold>ns shows the hydrogen bond interactions in the range of 2-3 between the protein and ligand, but after 27
 <sup>th</sup> ns the ligand losses the hydrogen bonding ability and shows the hydrogen bond interactions in the range of 1-2 between the protein and ligand. Overall, the apo protein shows a narrow range of stability and notable fluctuations are also shown, that indicates the participation of loop structures. Those fluctuations are arrested through the active interactions of ligand molecules that shows strong binding between the protein and ligand.
