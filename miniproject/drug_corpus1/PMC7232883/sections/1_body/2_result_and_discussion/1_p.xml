<p>We have created a database of 45 Indian spices compounds and their structures downloaded from PubChem and Zinc databases. Four small molecules were selected based on their binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro as shown in the 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The list of remaining compounds used of moleculer docking is submitted as 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1080/07391102.2020.1763202" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">supplementary material</ext-link> (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1S</xref>). The top three compounds include Carnosol, Rosmanol, and Arjunglucoside-I. The further insights into binding interactions of these compounds with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro were analysed using ligplot as shown in
