<p>Amidst the unforeseeable outbreak of CoVID-19 there has been a sudden rise in demand of drug development, vaccines and identification of potential bioactive molecules which could prove to be useful fulfilling the purpose of broadening treatment options. In the quest for finding novel treatment regimen for these kinds of viral outbreaks, screening of already known molecules could also prove to be vital. In this context, we report here some active pharmaceutical ingredients which are present in the commonly used spices in India could prove to be useful. Preliminary 
 <italic>in silico</italic> investigations show that indeed some molecules like Carnosol and Rosmanol have the properties which can further exploited and investigated for drug candidate against SARS-CoV-2. Although it is imperative to understand that development of rigid and highly specific treatment options will require further expeimental studies.
