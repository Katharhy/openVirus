<p>Molecular screening of the all chemical compound libraries was performed by using Raccoon and MGLTools-1.5.6 software by Autodock as the engine for docking (Morris et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). During the molecular docking period, the ligands were considered as a flexible molecule and the protein was considered as a rigid structure molecule. The configuration file for the grid parameters file and docking parameters file was generated by using Autodock. Autodock and Autogrid tools integrated with the Autodock4 were used to generate grid maps for each atom of the ligand. The grid boxes were made, such as to include one site at a time and perform docking. Grid X, Y and Z coordinates were 9.204, −4.557, and 19.602. We analyzed each ligand by setting default docking parameters except in the number of runs: We ran the LGA for 100 runs with each ligand with an initial population size of 150 random starting positions and conformation, 2.5 million number of energy evaluations.
