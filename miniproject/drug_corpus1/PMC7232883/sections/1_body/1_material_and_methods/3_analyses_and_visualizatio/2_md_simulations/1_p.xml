<p>The classical molecular dynamics simulation is carried out for the prepared co-crystal structure and selected ligand-binding complex poses through Desmond Molecular dynamics package incorporated in Schrodinger suite (Chow et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Both the apo and ligand complex is solvated in the TIP3P model (specifies a three-site rigid water molecule with charges), using the volume occupancy in an orthorhombic box with periodic boundary conditions. For neutralizing the system, the overall charge of apo and ligand complex is solvated with appropriate cation (Na+) or anion (Cl-) along with a salt concentration of 0.15
 <bold> </bold>mol/L. The prepared system is energy minimized for a convergence threshold of 1.0
 <bold> </bold>kcal/mol/Å by using the steepest descent method, and for minimization and relaxation of the system, the NPT ensemble is applied (Selvaraj et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The standard temperature is kept constant at 300
 <bold> </bold>K and pressure at the level of 1.013
 <bold> </bold>bar for the total simulation, and each simulation is started for the total time scale of 50
 <bold> </bold>ns. For the analysis of MD trajectories, the RMSD, RMSF and Hydrogen bond interactions are analyzed using the trajectory analysis incorporated in the Desmond (Selvaraj &amp; Singh, 2014).
