<p>The structure data files of the all chemical compounds were downloaded from PubChem database and converted into mol2 structures by using Open Babel. In order to further simplify the analyses, ligands were fist optimized and converted mol2 to PDBQT format by using the graphical user interface version of Raccoon. MGLTools-1.5.6, Raccoon is preparing AutoDock virtual screening tool-python (Forli, Scripps Research Institute).</p>
