<p>The atomic coordinates of active site were defined using report available in the literature and identification of catalytic His41, His164 and Cys145 (Khaerunnisa etÂ al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Energy minimization of the protein molecule was done by Swiss PDB Viewer (Guex &amp; Peitsch, 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). Before docking, the assignment of charge, solvation parameters and fragmental volumes to the protein was done using the Autodock Tool 4 (ADT). The protein 6Y84 PDB molecule was further optimized by using ADT for the molecular docking using established procedure.
