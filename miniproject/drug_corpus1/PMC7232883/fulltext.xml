coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic in the human population. The unavailability of
specific vaccines and anti-viral drug for nCoV, science demands sincere efforts in the
field of drug design and discovery for COVID-19. The novel coronavirus main protease
(SARS-CoV-2 Mpro) play a crucial role during the disease propagation, and hence SARS-CoV-2
Mpro represents as a drug target for the drug discovery. Herein, we have applied
bioinformatics approach for screening of chemical compounds from Indian spices as potent
inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDBID: 6Y84). The structure files of Indian spices
chemical compounds were taken from PubChem database or Zinc database and screened by
molecular docking, by using AutoDock-4.2, MGLTools-1.5.6, Raccoon virtual screening tools.
Top 04 hits based on their highest binding affinity were analyzed. Carnosol exhibited
highest binding affinity -8.2&#x02009;Kcal/mol and strong and stable interactions with the amino
acid residues present on the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Arjunglucoside-I
(-7.88&#x02009;Kcal/mol) and Rosmanol (-7.99&#x02009;Kcal/mol) also showed a strong and stable binding
affinity with favourable ADME properties. These compounds on MD simulations for
50<bold>&#x02009;</bold>ns shows strong hydrogen-bonding interactions with the protein active
site and remains stable inside the active site. Our virtual screening results suggest that
these small chemical molecules can be used as potential inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro
and may have an anti-viral effect on nCoV. However, further validation and investigation
of these inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 main protease are needed to claim their candidacy
for clinical trials.</p><p>Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

and Wuhan city in China caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (Bhoopathi et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Kumar &#x00026; Rathi, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Wang et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).
On January 2020, World health organization emergency committee declared a global health
emergency based on the high rate of spreading of the infection with high fatality rate
(Chhikara et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Kumar &#x00026; Rathi, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). As of now on 4th April 2020, Europe and USA
are new epicentres of COVID-19 Pandemic. Even in the past, different coronaviruses have
caused multiple human diseases that resulted in global epidemics such as the Middle East
respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19). While the coronaviruses have a significant impact on human health,
the general public has an inferior awareness of coronavirus pathogenesis and infection.
COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March 2020 as the worldwide human population is facing
high risk from contracting the nCoV infection. Many countries, including India, has
announced lockdown in the country and to maintain social distancing to avoid further spread
as no drug or vaccine is available against SARS-CoV-2. Coronavirus has been classified into
four subfamilies based on their shape and host. These subfamilies are alpha-coronavirus,
beta-coronavirus, gamma-coronavirus and delta coronavirus (Paules et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Alpha- coronavirus and beta-coronavirus are
considered to have been originated from bats, while the gamma and delta coronaviruses are
considered to be derived from birds and pigs (Banerjee et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Coronaviruses contain a positive sense, single-strand RNA
genome coding for viral polymerase, RNA synthesis materials, and large non-structural
polypeptide. Coronavirus genome contains transcriptional modification, including
5&#x02019;methylated cap and a 3&#x02019;polyadenylated tail. Coronaviruses have very high rates of error in
RNA replication due to constant errors by RNA dependent RNA polymerase (Banerjee et&#x000a0;al.,
<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Lau et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).</p><p>Only a few protein crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 are available on protein databank.
SARS-CoV-2 main protease, a potential drug target, crystal structure (PDB-ID: 6Y84) was
available and used for docking simulation and identification of potential drug molecule form
Indian spices. SARS-CoV-2 main protease has a vital role in the processing of polyprotein
that is translated from viral RNA, and the protease is considered as key for viral survival
and growth (Prajapat et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).</p><p>Medicinal plants yielding biologically active compounds have always been of great interest
to scientists as they play an essential role in preventing human diseases. In the entire
world, India is recognized where spices have been traditionally used as a source of
medicine. Many active pharmaceutical gradients have been identified and extracted having a
wide range of physiological and pharmacological properties (Sachan et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Apart from the regular uses of spices in
culinary activities, they are widely used as indigenous medicines, nutraceuticals, in
aromatherapy, as natural colouring agents, perfumes, cosmetics etc. In recent years there
has been experimental evidence on physiological benefits that could be drawn in the context
of various diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular issues and inflammatory disorders like
arthritis and cancer. They have also been identified as preventive agents in certain
conditions. Spices like red pepper, garlic, and fenugreek have been reported to have
hypercholesterolemic activity, whereas fenugreek and garlic are also known to reduce and
control blood sugar levels (Bhagya &#x00026; Raveendra, <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The main active ingredient of turmeric, Curcumin has been widely studied to
have a broad spectrum of medicinal value ranging from anti-cancerous, anti-inflammatory and
an anti-amyloidogenic activity (Bhagya &#x00026; Raveendra, <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Several computational studies related to drug or vaccine development
against SARS-CoV-2 is recently published (Aanouz et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Gupta et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Joshi et&#x000a0;al.,

potential applications of Indian spices, we have tried to explore if they can be used as
novel agents for controlling SARS-CoV-2. The data generated using computational approaches
give very encouraging results.</p></sec><sec id="s0002"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s0003"><title>Data sources and preparation target protein</title><p>In this study, prepared list of 45 chemical compounds from Indian spices and compound

SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was downloaded from RCSB protein database. (PDB ID: 6Y84).</p><p>The atomic coordinates of active site were defined using report available in the
literature and identification of catalytic His41, His164 and Cys145 (Khaerunnisa et&#x000a0;al.,
<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Energy minimization of the protein

parameters and fragmental volumes to the protein was done using the Autodock Tool 4 (ADT).
The protein 6Y84 PDB molecule was further optimized by using ADT for the molecular docking
using established procedure.</p><p>The structure data files of the all chemical compounds were downloaded from PubChem
database and converted into mol2 structures by using Open Babel. In order to further
simplify the analyses, ligands were fist optimized and converted mol2 to PDBQT format by
using the graphical user interface version of Raccoon. MGLTools-1.5.6, Raccoon is

ligands were considered as a flexible molecule and the protein was considered as a rigid
structure molecule. The configuration file for the grid parameters file and docking
parameters file was generated by using Autodock. Autodock and Autogrid tools integrated
with the Autodock4 were used to generate grid maps for each atom of the ligand. The grid
boxes were made, such as to include one site at a time and perform docking. Grid X, Y and
Z coordinates were 9.204, &#x02212;4.557, and 19.602. We analyzed each ligand by setting default
docking parameters except in the number of runs: We ran the LGA for 100 runs with each
ligand with an initial population size of 150 random starting positions and conformation,
2.5 million number of energy evaluations.</p><p>The application of grid parameters file was also used to predict the amino acid residue
in the active site of the protein that interacts with the ligands. Positional
root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values were less than 1.0<bold>&#x02009;</bold>&#x000c5; considered
ideal and clustered together for finding the favourable binding. The highest negative
binding energy was considered as the ligand molecule with maximum binding affinity.</p></sec><sec id="s0005"><title>Analyses and visualization</title><p>Visual analysis of the docking site was performed using Pymol-2.3.3 and the results were
validated by using AutoDock Tools-1.5.6 (Morris et&#x000a0;al., 1998). Binding interaction
analyses of identifying inhibitor and the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (PDB ID: 6Y84) was done using an

package incorporated in Schrodinger suite (Chow et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Both the apo and ligand complex is solvated in the TIP3P
model (specifies a three-site rigid water molecule with charges), using the volume
occupancy in an orthorhombic box with periodic boundary conditions. For neutralizing the
system, the overall charge of apo and ligand complex is solvated with appropriate cation
(Na+) or anion (Cl-) along with a salt concentration of 0.15<bold>&#x02009;</bold>mol/L. The
prepared system is energy minimized for a convergence threshold of
1.0<bold>&#x02009;</bold>kcal/mol/&#x000c5; by using the steepest descent method, and for minimization
and relaxation of the system, the NPT ensemble is applied (Selvaraj et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The standard temperature is kept constant
at 300<bold>&#x02009;</bold>K and pressure at the level of 1.013<bold>&#x02009;</bold>bar for the total
simulation, and each simulation is started for the total time scale of
50<bold>&#x02009;</bold>ns. For the analysis of MD trajectories, the RMSD, RMSF and Hydrogen

protein, the amino acid from 70-75<sup>th</sup>, 160-175<sup>th</sup> position shows the
deviation up to &#x0223c;4&#x000c5;, apart from these regions other amino acids are deviating from
&#x0223c;1-3&#x000c5;. The deviation that occurs in the 70-75<sup>th</sup>, 160-175<sup>th</sup>
position may be functionally reason for the drift in apo protein RMSD at 45<sup>th</sup>
ns. While comparing the apo RMSF values with the complex protein RMSF, notably Carnosol
is showing high deviations than the other ligand complexes. The amino acid positions
from 40-60<sup>th</sup>, 150-155<sup>th</sup>, 178-200<sup>th</sup> position is showing
higher deviations, that ranges from &#x0223c;4-6&#x000c5; deviations. Due to these positional amino acid
fluctuations, the RMSD of Carnosol deviates approximately 4<bold>&#x02009;</bold>&#x000c5; after the
26<sup>th</sup> ns. Similarly, another compound Rosmanol also showing the fluctuations
in C-terminal regions, that results in the &#x0223c;3-3.5<bold>&#x02009;</bold>&#x000c5; deviations in the RMSD
values. The protein secondary structure is framed as 3 sheets, 7 beta hairpins, 9 beta
bulges, 13 strands, 32 beta turns, 3 gamma turns from this 182-304 residues are occupied
dominantly by loop regions. These 122 residues in the C-terminal functionally act in the
MD simulation, and thus the sudden drift happens in the 45<sup>th</sup> ns. This values
of RMSD for the apo protein, is compared with ligand molecules in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>, and for understanding the deviations, the
25<sup>th</sup> to 50<sup>th</sup> ns is focused. The results of ligand complex for
the MD simulation of 50<bold>&#x02009;</bold>ns of timescale shows that the ligand complex Alpha
ketoamide (Red color) and Arjun glycoside (Blue color) shows stable throughout the
simulation. While comparing these two Alpha ketoamide and Arjun glycoside ligand complex
with apo protein, the ligand complex is matched with apo protein for the timescale of
45<sup>th</sup> ns. After the 45<sup>th</sup> ns the apo protein is drifted upwards,
but the Alpha ketoamide and Arjun glycoside ligand complex remains stable. This may be
due to the strong interaction pattern seen in Alpha ketoamide and Arjun glycoside
interactions with the protein. Both the Alpha ketoamide and Arjun glycoside ligand bound
complex are stable and positioned in the range of &#x0223c;2&#x000c5;, which is close to the apo protein
till 47<sup>th</sup> ns. The <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figures 5a and 5b</xref>
shows the hydrogen bond interactions for the Alpha ketoamide and Arjun glycoside, which
clearly shows the minimum participation of 2-3 hydrogen bonds seen in between the Alpha
ketoamide and protein, and minimum participation of 4-6 hydrogen bonds between the Arjun
glycoside and protein. This active participation of hydrogen bonds between the Alpha
ketoamide and Arjun glycoside with protein makes the ligand complex stable for
50<bold>&#x02009;</bold>ns of MD simulations. The ligand Carnosol shows stable movement in
terms of RMSD values by showing a narrow graph, but while comparing with apo protein,
the Carnosol ligand complex is deviated from the 14<sup>th</sup> ns and stays in the
range bound of &#x0223c;3.4<bold>&#x02009;</bold>&#x000c5; till the end of the simulations. For attaining the
stable MD simulation for the Carnosol ligand bound complex, 2-3 hydrogen bonds are
actively contributed and makes the complex stable in the dynamic state. The ligand
Rosmanol bound complex shows stability till the 26<sup>th</sup> ns with the range of
&#x0223c;2.5<bold>&#x02009;</bold>&#x000c5;, but after that, the drift happens to make the RMSD value deviated
in upward direction and fix the positional RMSD with the range of &#x0223c;4<bold>&#x02009;</bold>&#x000c5;.
This may be due to the loss of hydrogen bonding interactions after the 27<sup>th</sup>
ns seen in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5d</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5d</xref> says that the initial 27<bold>&#x02009;</bold>ns shows the
hydrogen bond interactions in the range of 2-3 between the protein and ligand, but after
27<sup>th</sup> ns the ligand losses the hydrogen bonding ability and shows the
hydrogen bond interactions in the range of 1-2 between the protein and ligand. Overall,
the apo protein shows a narrow range of stability and notable fluctuations are also
shown, that indicates the participation of loop structures. Those fluctuations are
arrested through the active interactions of ligand molecules that shows strong binding
between the protein and ligand.</p><fig id="F0003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>RMSD analysis of Apo and ligand complex (C-Alpha) in molecular dynamics simulations
