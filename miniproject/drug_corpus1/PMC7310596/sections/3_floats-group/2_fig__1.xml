  <p>Schematic representation of the COVID-19 structure and route of infection. This figure describes the structure of the SARS-CoV-2. In the respiratory system, the virus spike protein binds with the ACE2 receptor in respiratory epithelial cells and internalizes and forms a membrane fusion complex, which causes the release of the viral RNA into the host cell and results in respiratory infection. Through different pathways, the virus induces the proinflammatory response by induction of T- and B-cells and synthesis of type I IFNs, which limit the spread of the virus and cause a cytokine storm, while induction of the macrophage causes ingestion of the viral antigen [this image is generated with the help of Biorender].
