<p id="Par30">A host of therapeutic agents have been employed to treat patients with COVID-19, however a detailed review of these is beyond the scope of this review. We focus on the most promising drugs that have been repurposed and used to treat this disease, emphasizing the CV adverse effects of these therapies and the known strategies to counter them. Among the treatments employed, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, antiretrovirals (lopinavir and ritonavir), ribavarin, remdesivir, corticosteroids, anticytokine agents (IL-6 inhibitors), and immunoglobulin therapy (convalescent plasma) have been prominent [

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been used to treat patients with COVID-19 in small randomized clinical trials and are postulated to work by blocking viral entry into cells through endosomal trafficking and by exerting an immunomodulatory effect through cytokine attenuation. Both agents can cause QTc prolongation, as previously discussed, which can be aggravated by concomitant use of azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, and other fluoroquinolones. Baseline electrocardiography is recommended in patients to evaluate for prolonged QTc in specific high-risk populations, as previously discussed. Serial electrocardiography in critically ill patients following the initiation of these medications is useful to monitor [
