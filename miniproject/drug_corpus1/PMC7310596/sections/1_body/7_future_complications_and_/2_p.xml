<p id="Par32">The outbreak of the pandemic has led to the preservation of medical resources, in terms of hospital beds, medical personnel, and PPE, that have prioritized the care of COVID-19 patients. This has led to stratification and deferral of elective procedures, including structural and electrophysiology procedures [

As a result, there has been an unanticipated increase in urgent cases that occur while patients wait for their procedures. In addition, due to a fear of going to the hospital and contracting COVID, it appears many patients may have ignored important symptoms while at home, resulting in a large number of deaths indirectly related to the pandemic. This is particularly true for the incidence of STEMI, which showed a sharp decline during the pandemic, paralleling a similar sharp rise in patient deaths at home [
