<p id="Par7">The exact pathogenesis of cardiac involvement is not entirely clear. Increased cardiac biomarkers, including troponin T, have been shown to be linearly correlated with inflammatory markers, indicating that myocardial injury is likely related to underlying inflammation [

Several mechanisms of cardiac damage are likely at play, including direct myocardial damage by the virus itself, hypoxic injury mediated by respiratory failure, indirect injury mediated by cytokines secondary to systemic inflammatory response, myocardial infarction (MI) due to plaque rupture secondary to systemic inflammation, the prothrombotic state produced by severe systemic inflammation, and ischemia from myocardial supply–demand mismatch (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). ACE2 receptor-mediated direct cardiac injury also remains a possibility. ACE2 receptors are expressed in cardiac pericytes and endothelial cells, and animal data suggest that their direct dysfunction secondary to viral infection or secondary inflammation may precipitate MI [
