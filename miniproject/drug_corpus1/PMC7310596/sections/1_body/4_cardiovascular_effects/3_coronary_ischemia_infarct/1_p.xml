<p id="Par17">Coronary involvement and ischemia have been seen, including ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), with several mechanisms explaining coronary artery involvement. As ACE2 is expressed in vascular endothelial cells, direct viral infection can lead to plaque instability and type 1 MI. Plaque instability and rupture may also result from the severe systemic inflammatory response in the third phase of the disease. COVID-19 can additionally precipitate type II MI by demand ischemia as patients get sicker. Hypoxia secondary to lung involvement, and fever and tachycardia secondary to sepsis, further worsen the cardiac function. Coronary artery involvement can further be produced by a microangiopathy that has also been described. Such small vessel involvement can be due to systemic vasculitis or to microembolization from ACS or disseminated hypercoagulability impairing blood flow [
