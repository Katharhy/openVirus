<p id="Par20">According to recent statements by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) Interventional Council and Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Intervention (SCAI) regarding the management of STEMI during the COVID-19 pandemic, primary PCI should remain the standard in these patients, with fibrinolytic therapy reserved for patients with relative contraindications or those with severe bilateral COVID pneumonia (PNR) or ARDS, given the poor overall prognosis (Fig.

NSTEMI patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be managed by aggressive medical management until the test comes back, and then risk stratification. High-risk patients or hemodynamically unstable patients should be managed by early invasive strategy (&lt; 24 h), as in all patients with NSTEMI. A non-invasive or medical approach would be best for low-risk patients.
