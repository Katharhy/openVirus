<p id="Par23">Specific mention should be made regarding drugs to treat COVID-19 and the potential for pro-arrhythmia. Although data on outcomes with hydroxychloroquine are not available, it is widely used in hospitals for critical patients. The drug is a known inhibitor of the potassium channel Kv11.1 present in the heart, potentially increasing the QTc interval and predisposing the patient to fatal ventricular tachyarrhythmias (torsades de point). In the setting of a very long half-life of 40Â days, this adverse effect is rarely seen in clinical practice in patients routinely treated for malaria and rheumatological conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus [

According to the recommendations from the Heart Rhythm Society released recently in collaboration with the ACC and AHA, hydroxychloroquine use must be closely monitored in certain patient groups. These include individuals with a known history of long QT syndrome, those with deranged renal function, those with electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, and those prescribed other QTc-prolonging drugs [
