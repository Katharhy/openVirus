<p id="Par12">Cardiotropic viruses directly attack cardiac cells at the initial phase, followed by a secondary inflammatory response that can lead to further cardiac damage. It is likely that coronavirus is following a similar pathway. Indeed, the ACE2 receptor plays a role in the direct cardiac damage, as well as vascular involvement in COVID-19 infection. In autopsies from the SARS outbreak in 2002, 35% of heart samples revealed the presence of viral RNA in the myocardium, and it was associated with reduced ACE2 expression. It is believed SARS-CoV-2 may share the same mechanism, with direct cardiac muscle damage playing a role in both the myocarditis and HF in COVID-19-infected individuals. Cardiac muscle involvement has been evident by increased cardiac biomarkers in a sizable portion of patients [
