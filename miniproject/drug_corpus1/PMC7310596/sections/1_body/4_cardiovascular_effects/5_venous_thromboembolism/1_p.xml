<p id="Par25">An increased risk of blood clot formation resulting from hypercoagulability has been previously noted with SARS and MERS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Similarly, COVID-19 has been associated with a hypercoagulable state. Dysfunction of endothelial cells induced by infection results in excess thrombin generation and fibrinolysis shutdown. The hypoxia found in severe COVID-19 can also stimulate thrombosis through increasing blood viscosity. A hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-dependent signaling pathway also plays a role in increasing the coagulability of the blood [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. A study by Panigada et al. showed an increased risk of venous thrombosis in COVID-19-affected individuals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. One study involving 184 patients showed CT angiography and/or ultrasonography confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE) in 27% of patients and arterial thrombotic events in 3.7% of patients. PE was the most frequent thrombotic complication and may be massive with significant RV failure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. The diagnosis of VTE and PE in COVID patients is challenging. The International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) advocates the use of laboratory tests, including 
 <sc>d</sc>-dimers, prothrombin time, and platelet count, to stratify patients at risk of increased blood clot formation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]; however, elevated 
 <sc>d</sc>-dimer levels are not specific to the diagnosis of VTE. If only a high 
 <sc>d</sc>-dimer level is relied on for diagnosis, it will unnecessarily increase the utilization of CT angiography for infected patients, without much benefit. In addition, it may worsen kidney function due to contrast use in the setting of poor cardiac output and hypoxia from COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Maintaining isolation while doing the tests is also another hurdle for hospitals. Echocardiogram may aid in the diagnosis of large PE by finding isolated RV dilation or failure, or a saddle PE, although it may be difficult to visualize [
