<p id="par0110">Lysosomotropic compounds or cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs) belong to various pharmacological classes but share the same physicochemical properties that enable them to accumulate in acidic compartments of cells (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> ). Such compounds can pass the membrane in neutral form but as they come to a more acidic environment, they become protonated and as such cannot diffuse back through the membrane. Consequently, as the drug moves into more acidic compartment, the equilibrium between protonated and neutral forms is shifted towards the protonated form and a higher fraction of drug molecules become trapped inside the cell [

 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For strong lysosomotropic drugs it was estimated that 50–70 % of intracellularly accumulated compound is stored in lysosomes and endosomes [
 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], leading to extreme concentrations in these compartments. While accumulating, such drugs are heavily loading in lysosomal and other biological membranes inside the cell due to their amphiphilic nature [
 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], meaning that the overall molecule is relatively lipophilic (often with logP ranging from 3 to 5) but also bears positive charge, which enables the molecule to bind close to the surface of the phospholipid bilayer [
