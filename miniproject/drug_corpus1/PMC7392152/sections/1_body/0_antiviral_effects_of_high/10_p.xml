<p id="par0135">It is noteworthy that there are more than 150 marketed and investigational drugs known to induce phospholipidosis [
 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and a majority, but not all of them classify as lysosomotropic cationic amphiphilic drugs. Phospholipidosis is also the most common side effect of lysosomotropic compounds and a direct consequence of their binding to membranes [
 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and reduction of vesicle trafficking in the cell [
 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Therefore, we anticipate that, among phospholipidosis inducers there are many registered drugs that may have intrinsic antiviral activity 
 <italic>via</italic> the same mechanism as described for a handful of lysosomotropic compounds so far; by inhibiting endocytosis, increasing endosomal pH, and slowing down total intracellular membrane trafficking [
 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Their potency may be moderate but in combination with other treatments they can likely show synergistic effects. These drugs thus represent a pool of potential existing modest antiviral drugs that may prove useful as the first line of defence in current and possible new viral epidemic outbreaks.
