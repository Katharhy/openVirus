<p id="par0100">Certain marketed drugs seem to exhibit modest antiviral activity 
 <italic>via</italic> the mechanism that is not specific for a single protein, but rather for a general mechanism of viral infection. For instance, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been reported to affect endosomes, the critical point of viral entry into the cell, resulting in antiviral effect [

Various steps in the viral infection have been examined to understand the mechanism of (hydroxy)chloroquine’s activity, but it has remained not entirely clear. It has been reported that the drug’s effect of increasing the endosomal pH results in reduced capacity of the virus to infect the cell [
