<p id="par0200">It is important to consider that 15 out of 26 identified drugs were found either to induce QT prolongation/arrhythmia or interact with hERG channel 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, or both. This indicates that, even if proven effective against the virus, these drugs will likely need to be avoided in patients with heart conditions. Cautious approach is needed for six drugs that were found negative on QT prolongation and arrhythmia, as the lack of effect may still be linked to applied doses for their primary indication. In addition, higher likelihood of liver toxicity was found in six out of 26 drugs. Care should also be taken with identified antihistaminics in the group, as they share structural features with some lysosomotropic antidepressants, and some still have a mild sedative effect.
