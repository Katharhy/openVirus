<p id="par0210">Compounds listed in 
 <xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> are less likely to show antiviral effects caused by lysosmotropic behaviour (compared to those in 
 <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) as they failed in one of the primary inclusion criteria. Three of them target respiratory system (bromhexine, ambroxol and formoterol), but should be cautiously assessed at which stages of the disease they may be most effective. Interestingly, in this group of compounds, we have also identified imatinib, which was proven effective against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses by inhibiting viral fusion and entry into the cells [
 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and is currently being tested in a clinical trial on COVID-19 patients [
 <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Its efficacy is speculated to be linked to its primary target Abl2 kinase, but it is conceivable that the observed effects are the consequence of its already proven lysosomotropic behaviour [
