<p id="par0155">From the compounds with experimental or clinical proofs of induction of phospholipidosis, we have selected those that according to our 
 <italic>in silico</italic> prediction model for cellular accumulation are predicted to accumulate moderately to extremely high (accumulation (ACC) levels 2–5) for compounds within and at the borderline of the applicability domain for the model; and high to extremely high (ACC levels 3−5) for compounds outside the domain 
 <italic>i.e.</italic> with less reliable prediction of accumulation intensity [

 <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> the data on experimentally determined cellular accumulation is also provided (measured ACC) [
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Third inclusion criterion was the strongest basic dissociation constant, pKa, higher than 7.5 which is an indication that the molecule can become protonated, and thus trapped, inside the acidic compartment in addition to eventually increasing lysosomal/endosomal pH [
