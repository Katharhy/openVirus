<p id="par0150">We have now applied our 
 <italic>in silico</italic> model for the prediction of lysosomotropic accumulation [
 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] on all marketed and investigational drugs that are known inducers of phospholipidosis [
 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and that according to their physicochemical properties have the ability to get trapped by protonation in lysosomes (the strongest basic ionisation constant, pKa&gt;7.5) [
 <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The aim of this analysis was to find other strong lysosomotropic CADs which have a high likelihood of interacting with cell compartments and processes critical for viral infection cycle, such as endosomes, lysosomes and membranes in general. As additional proofs of their lysosomotropic nature and possibility of high accumulation in cells 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we have considered the presence of tertiary nitrogen atoms in their structure, lipophilicity (logP), volume of distribution and half-life in plasma or blood in humans. All filtering criteria are listed in 
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and the results of this analysis are presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> .
