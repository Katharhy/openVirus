<p>Following autopsy, the body was closed in the standard fashion and cleaned with damp towels and disinfectant. A clean body table with a clean body bag and plastic shroud spread out on it had been placed in the isolation cooler airlock by the second technician. This was moved into the isolation suite, and the body was transferred onto the clean shroud, wrapped tightly, sealed with tape, and then zipped into the clean body bag. This procedure allowed the outer surfaces of the shroud and body bag to remain essentially clean. Once sealed, the outer bag was labeled and signed by the pathologist and technician, each verifying the identity of the decedent. The outer surface of the body bag was then sprayed with disinfectant, and the body table was removed to the isolation cooler where residual liquid disinfectant was removed, and the bag labeled as infectious.</p>
