<p>External examination revealed an obese (body mass index 38 kg/m
 <sup>2</sup>) middle-aged adult woman with fully developed rigor mortis and blanching livor mortis. Changes of lower extremity venous stasis and scarring consistent with the history of lower leg ulcers were present. On internal examination, there were no pleural effusions or other abnormal fluid collections. Thick mucus was noted in the airways, however. The lungs were moderately heavy and edematous (right: 818 g, left: 705 g) and had a relatively firm texture throughout. Areas of hemorrhage were evident in the right upper and middle lobes and to a lesser extent in the left lower lobe (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>.) Hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes appeared enlarged.
