<p>The autopsy was performed with minor modifications to standard procedures. In order to minimize potential organism aerosolization, the sink-mounted vacuum aspirator, sink drain tissue grinder, and station hose were not used. All fluid collections were ladled from body cavities. Although the head was opened with a powered oscillating saw, the upper half of the body, head of the table, and floor surrounding these areas were misted with disinfectant immediately upon cessation of powered sawing and before brain removal. Only one prosector remained in the room during the sawing; for at least 10 minutes afterward (ie, 2 full air changes), no additional personnel entered the room. Cleaning of the body and autopsy table was accomplished with towels that were subsequently discarded. Limited body and specimen photography was accomplished either in situ or on a small photography board near the body.</p>
