<p>An autopsy was performed in a separate negative-pressure isolation suite adjacent to the main morgue room but on its own heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning circuit with 16 air changes per hour. Only 2 operators (ie, a pathologist and a technician) were permitted in the isolation suite during the case. A second technician acted as a circulator and monitored the case via an observation window; communication was facilitated via inexpensive low-power walkie-talkies. A small isolation cooler attached to the isolation room acted as an airlock to facilitate transfer of materials into and out of the isolation suite during the prosection (Fig.
