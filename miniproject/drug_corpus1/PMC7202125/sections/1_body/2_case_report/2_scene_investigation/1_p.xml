<p>Two medicolegal death investigators performed a scene investigation. Family members were interviewed outside the residence, eliciting the information that several of the decedent's coworkers and an adult member of her household had also developed respiratory illness symptoms. At least 6 ft (ie, 2 m) of separation was maintained between investigators and family members during interview. Prior to entering the residence, investigators donned personal protective equipment (PPE) sufficient for contact and droplet precautions including gloves, fluid-resistant gown, a barrier face mask, and goggles.

 </sup> A camera was used to document the scene photographically; otherwise, minimal equipment was brought into the residence. Following documentation, the body was examined and placed in a plastic shroud and then sealed in a body bag and loaded into the transport vehicle. After the body was secured, investigators doffed their PPE and performed hand hygiene with an alcohol-based gel. The body was then transported to the morgue and logged in without opening the outer body bag. The transport vehicle was disinfected with a dilute bleach solution.
