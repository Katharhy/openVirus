<p>Histologic examination of the lungs revealed diffuse proteinaceous edema and dense amphophilic concretions along alveolar septae consistent with hyaline membranes. The lung architecture was preserved, and the septae were of normal thickness, but mild mononuclear infiltrates were present throughout. There was prominent desquamating pneumocyte hyperplasia with focal multinucleated cells and bizarre forms. Acute alveolar hemorrhage and collections of reactive foamy alveolar macrophages were focally present, as were collections of alveolar fibrin (Fig.
