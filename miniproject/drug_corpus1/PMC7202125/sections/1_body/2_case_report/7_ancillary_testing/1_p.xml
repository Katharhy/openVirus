<p>Dacron-tipped swabs of the right and left main bronchi were procured, placed into viral transport medium, and submitted to the Washington State Public Health Laboratory for both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza testing. Bacterial swabs of areas of potential consolidation were placed in Amies transport media tubes and submitted to the University of Washington microbiology laboratory for culture. The reverse transcriptaseâ€“polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for SARS-CoV-2 returned as positive 11.5 hours after submission. Negative influenza results returned several days later. Bacterial cultures were positive for methicillin-sensitive 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Streptococcus viridans</italic>. Given the lack of acute histologic inflammation in the lungs, these bacterial culture results were interpreted as being most likely contaminants or postmortem artifact.
