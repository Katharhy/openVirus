<p>Although much remains to be learned about SARS-CoV-2, recommendations for handling decedents with known or suspected COVID-19 are available from multiple national and international organizations.

 </sup> Additionally, much can be inferred from experiences with prior coronavirus outbreaks such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. In order to ensure safety of scene investigators, ME/Cs, and morgue staff, developing an understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, presentation, and prevention strategies is key. The current case presentation with literature review is intended to better inform and provide practical evidence-based biosafety guidance for ME/C offices encountering COVID-19 at autopsy. As community spread of COVID-19 increases, ME/C offices are encouraged to employ these biosafety principles broadly, as COVID carriers may be presymptomatic or asymptomatic, and yet still present infectious risk at autopsy. Medical examiner/coroner offices are cautioned that suspicious scene investigative history (eg, nursing home resident or individual from homeless encampment) cannot necessarily be relied upon to identify COVID carriers. It is hoped that by documenting and sharing postmortem findings ME/C offices can provide new insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and potentially assist in formulating therapeutic strategies to reduce disease mortality.
