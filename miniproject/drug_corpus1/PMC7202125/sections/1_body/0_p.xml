<p>SARS-CoV-2 is a novel human coronavirus that was detected as the causative agent of human respiratory infection (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. It is related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, other human coronaviruses responsible for outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome first detected in China in 2002–2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively.

 </sup> Of those known to be COVID-19 positive, approximately 20% to 30% will develop more severe disease necessitating hospitalization. Such disease may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, multiorgan failure, and death.
