 </sup> Inevitably, medical examiner/coroner (ME/C) offices will encounter increased numbers of SARS-CoV-2–infected decedents at autopsy as a result of COVID-19 spread. While in some cases a history of fever and/or respiratory distress (eg, cough or shortness of breath) may suggest the diagnosis, epidemiologic studies indicate that the majority of individuals infected with COVID-19 develop mild to no symptoms.

 </sup> Even those dying with—but not of—COVID-19 may still be infectious. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from presymptomatic/asymptomatic individuals has been documented, although the frequency remains to be established.

 </sup> Medical examiner/coroners must use their judgment to determine whether postmortem COVID-19 testing and/or autopsy should be pursued. In addition to suggestive antemortem signs/symptoms, epidemiologic factors may also help guide decisions such as history of contact with a known COVID-19–positive case, or being a part of a cluster of respiratory illness cases in a closed setting (eg, a nursing care facility).

 </sup> The presented autopsy case and literature review are intended to help familiarize ME/C offices with COVID-19 disease features, diagnostic strategies, and key biosafety principles.
