<p>While much literature has been published regarding COVID-19 signs/symptoms and clinical course, there is currently a paucity of data regarding expected postmortem gross and histologic findings. The case presented herein adds to those few previously published studies. Lungs are often heavy and histologically reveal edema with focal/diffuse hyaline membrane formation, pneumocyte hyperplasia, patchy mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, some multinucleated cells, and a lack of definitive intranuclear or intracytoplasmic viral inclusions.

 </sup> Overall, pulmonary pathologic features generally appear consistent with early/organizing diffuse alveolar damage and resemble those seen in SARS autopsies

 </sup> While myocarditis has been reported in association with COVID-19, it appears to be a less common complication.

 </sup> Most typically (as in the presented case), minimal mononuclear myocardial inflammatory involvement is found. Rarely, COVID-19–associated encephalitis has been reported.
