<p>In an experimental study, viable SARS-CoV-2 was detected up to 72 hours after being placed onto plastic and stainless-steel surfaces; it also remained viable in an experimentally created aerosol for at least 3 hours, although infectious titers per liter of air decreased over time.

 </sup> A recent review and analysis of literature found that generally human coronaviruses can remain infectious for up to 9 days on inanimate surfaces, depending on surface type and temperature; at temperatures ≥30°C (ie, 86°F), viral persistence shortened.

 </sup> Given that SARS-CoV-2 may remain viable on a variety of inanimate surfaces for a matter of days, careful morgue decontamination procedures are key. Surface disinfection with diluted household bleach solutions (ie, of 0.1% sodium hypochlorite), 0.5% hydrogen peroxide solutions, or alcohol solutions (ie, with at least 70% ethanol) has been shown to inactivate human coronaviruses within 1 minute.

 </sup> For hospital-grade disinfectants, staff should verify their suitability for use against SARS-CoV-2 and ensure disinfectants remain on surfaces in accordance with US Environmental Protection Agency recommendations.

 </sup> While conclusive data regarding how long infectious human remains may harbor infectious SARS-CoV-2 are lacking, autopsies in cases of SARS found that SARS-CoV could be recovered from lung tissue and grown in cell culture up to 7 days after death.

 </sup> Considering that there is reportedly 75% to 80% similarity between the viral genomes of SARS-CoV-2 (causative agent of COVID-19) and SARS-CoV (causative agent of SARS), these results suggest that protective precautions are called for even in cases of delayed suspected COVID-19 death investigations or autopsies.

 </sup> While limited data exist regarding formalin inactivation of SARS-CoV-2–infected tissue, formalin fixation at room temperature has been shown to inactivate most of SARS-CoV (ie, close to assay detection limits) within a day.
