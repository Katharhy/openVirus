<p>In cases of suspected COVID-19 in which full autopsies are performed, submission of SARS-CoV-2 swabs from both upper and bilateral lower respiratory tracts is recommended by the CDC.

 </sup> If NP and bilateral tracheobronchial/lung swabs are procured, it is recommended they be submitted in separate vials each containing 2 to 3 mL of viral transport medium.

 </sup> Medical examiner/coroner offices, however, must be cognizant of their current state health department testing capacity and proceed accordingly.

 </sup> A rational strategy for minimizing the number of swab submissions per autopsy is to submit swabs only from the lower respiratory tract. Additionally, sampling both lungs with a single swab may increase recovery of viral RNA. Concurrent testing for other causes of respiratory illness such as influenza is also strongly encouraged.

 </sup> In order to preserve limited viral testing kit supply, ME/C offices are encouraged to communicate with their testing laboratories to verify whether COVID-19, as well as other respiratory viral pathogen testing, can be performed on a single swab. Prosectors should submit separate samples for bacterial/fungal organisms as indicated. In cases of suspected COVID-19 in which autopsy is not performed, NP swab testing for COVID-19, as well as other respiratory pathogens, is recommended.
