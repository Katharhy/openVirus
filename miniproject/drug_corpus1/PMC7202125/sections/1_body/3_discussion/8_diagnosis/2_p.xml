<p>Only synthetic fiber swabs with plastic shafts should be submitted for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing, as others may inactivate virus or otherwise inhibit the testing. In the event that swabs were not procured at autopsy, fixed autopsy tissue specimens may also be submitted to CDC in suspected COVID-19 deaths for immunohistochemical, molecular, or other assay characterization.

 </sup> Recent diagnostic advancements include the Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization enabling US laboratories already certified for high-complexity testing to develop and validate their own SARS-CoV-2 testing; this markedly augmented diagnostic capability as previously all testing was performed mainly by US public health laboratories.

 </sup> Recently, a serologic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing to assess for COVID-19 antibodies has received Food and Drug Administration approval, and more are in development; these are expected to prove of utility in more accurately calculating disease transmission and mortality rates.
