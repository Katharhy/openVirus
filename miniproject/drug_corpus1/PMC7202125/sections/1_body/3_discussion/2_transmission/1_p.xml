<p>It is suspected that SARS-CoV-2—similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV—began as a zoonotic coronavirus that subsequently spread to humans.

 </sup> Community- and health care–associated person-to-person transmission were documented early in the pandemic, and direct or close contact with infectious persons is believed to be the major mode of transmission.

 </sup> Transmission occurs through exposure to infectious droplets originating from the respiratory tract; infectious droplets may be released from an infected individual via sneezing, coughing, talking, or undergoing an aerosolizing procedure such as intubation or autopsy.

 </sup> Reportedly droplets neither typically spread beyond 6 ft (2 m) nor linger in air, although some evidence has suggested a longer range of spread may be possible.

 </sup> Less commonly infection may arise as a result of indirect transmission through fomites, especially if the eyes, face, or mouth are contacted after touching an infected surface.

 </sup> SARS-CoV-2 has also been detected in blood and anal swabs; increasing evidence suggests that fecal-oral transmission may be another potential route of spread.
