<p>Each office is advised to carefully assess its own infrastructure, supplies, and staffing to determine whether suspected or confirmed COVID-19 deaths can be safely prosected on site. Current CDC and World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations are that suspected/confirmed COVID-19 autopsies be prosected in an airborne infection isolation rooms at negative pressure relative to surrounding areas and ideally with at least 12 air changes per hour (although 6 will suffice in older structures.)

 </sup> Air from isolation rooms should be exhausted directly outside or else pass through a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter if recirculated.
