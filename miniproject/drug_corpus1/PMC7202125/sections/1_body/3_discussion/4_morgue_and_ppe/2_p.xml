 </sup> In order to preserve eyewear, preferential use of powered air purifying respirators or goggles, which can be reused following appropriate disinfection, should be considered.

 </sup> In general, PAPRs are preferable to N95 respirator masks as they provide even higher protection to prosectors and—with appropriate disinfection of reusable elements after use—can be repeatedly used, thus assisting with PPE conservation efforts.

 </sup> Powered air-purifying respirator filters should be replaced in accordance with manufacturer recommendations. Some studies have suggested the possibility of decontaminating and reusing N95 masks via UV germicidal irradiation, hydrogen peroxide vapor sterilization, and simply allowing respirators to hang to dry for 3 days.
