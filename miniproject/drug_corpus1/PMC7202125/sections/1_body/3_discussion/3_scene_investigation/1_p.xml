<p>As in the current presented case, investigators are advised to mitigate risk of potential SARS-CoV-2 exposure at death scenes by standing at a distance of 6 ft or greater when conducting interviews and requesting interviewees to remain outside the residence while investigators enter. As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recently issued recommendations for the public to wear cloth facial coverings when at risk of social-based transmission, scene investigators may consider encouraging interviewees to don cloth facial masks.

 </sup> Scene investigators should don contact and droplet precaution PPE when entering residences. Decontamination of all potentially contaminated equipment, careful body bagging procedures, and investigator hand hygiene are also encouraged. Anecdotally, this has been the scene investigative policy of the Snohomish County Medical Examiner's Office, which despite being the country with the second highest number of positive/confirmed COVID cases in the state of Washington has had no scene investigators who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 to date. In order to more efficiently triage cases, ME/C offices may elect to have scene investigators procure nasopharyngeal (NP) viral testing swabs at the scene. Scene investigative recommendations are summarized in Table
