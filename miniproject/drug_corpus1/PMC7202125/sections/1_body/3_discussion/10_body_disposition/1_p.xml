<p>Neither CDC nor WHO guidelines require double-bagging of known COVID-19–positive decedents; however, ME/C offices should ensure that any body fluids leaking from orifices are contained.

 </sup> Utilizing cotton packing of orifices, a plastic shroud, or a second body bag is a potential method of preventing fluid leakage. Following appropriate decontamination of the body bag, a method of clearly designating the infectious nature of contents to funeral home personnel should be used (eg, body bag notification sticker); ME/C offices may want to consider modifying body release procedures to preclude contamination risks of opening body bag in morgue for funeral personnel identification.

 </sup> While decedents can be buried or cremated as per current state requirements, burial may result in storage difficulties as social distancing–related funeral service delays. Further details of recommended funeral home/mortuary protocol in cases of COVID-19–positive decedents can be accessed on both the CDC and the National Funeral Directors Association websites.

 </sup> Medical examiner/coroner offices are encouraged to closely collaborate with funeral homes/mortuaries to ensure body transportation and storage needs are met. In jurisdictions with a required waiting period prior to cremation (eg, 48 hours), investigating the possibility of a waiver in order to alleviate decedent storage issues may be advisable.
