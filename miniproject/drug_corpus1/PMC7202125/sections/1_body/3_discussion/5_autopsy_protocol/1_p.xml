<p>Aerosol generation at autopsy may occur through inadvertent splashing of fluids, puncturing of fluid pockets under pressure, and using vacuum-assisted suction devices and sink-mounted tissue grinders.

 </sup> However, the most likely aerosol-generating autopsy procedure is use of powered oscillating bone saws, particularly during brain removal.

 </sup> High densities of aerosolized particles are generated in the region of the saw placing the user at risk. While N95 respirator masks physically filter 95% of particles at least 1 μm in size from the inspired air, CDC and OSHA guidelines nonetheless suggest avoiding use of an oscillating bone saw at autopsy in cases of suspected/confirmed COVID-19. If a saw is used, it is recommended that a vacuum shroud be attached to assist in capturing aerosols.

 </sup> Other oscillating saw aerosol reduction techniques to consider include moistening the saw blade before cutting, using autopsy tables with built-in ventilation, tenting plastic around the decedent's neck and head to entrap aerosols, and wearing a HEPA-filtered PAPR rather than N95 mask.

 </sup> As in the current presented case, other general splash and aerosol reduction techniques (eg, eschewing use of vacuum assisted aspirator, sink tissue grinder, or hose) are also advised. Autopsy protocol recommendations are summarized in Table
