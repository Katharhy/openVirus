<p>In deaths occurring outside the hospital setting, ME/C offices are tasked with determining whether deaths are attributable to COVID-19 and performing autopsies as needed.

 </sup> Medical examiner/coroner offices may elect to triage cases by taking viral NP swabs in suspected COVID-19 deaths and reserve autopsy for those decedents with negative testing results or else cases in which SARS-CoV-2 infection is thought to be incidental rather than the cause of death. Performing an NP swab for SARS-CoV-2 requires neither a negative-pressure room nor N95 respirator; basic contact and droplet precaution PPE are sufficient.

 </sup> In cases in which autopsy is merited, the above described precautions should be followed to prevent morgue staff–acquired COVID-19 infection. Some offices have elected to perform limited autopsies (eg, precluding brain/spinal cord removal) in cases of suspected/known COVID-19 positivity to reduce morgue staff aerosol exposure. Others have incorporated antemortem or postmortem CT radiology as a means of helping triage decedents meriting testing and/or autopsy.

 </sup> Establishing collaborative relations with larger ME/C offices capable of safely autopsying suspected highly infectious disease cases should be encouraged. Globally, mobile biosafety autopsy facilities/laboratories with sophisticated infrastructure have been deployed during disease epidemics such as SARS and Ebola virus; advantages include the ability to mobilize rapidly to areas of need with minimal footprint.

 </sup> Such mobile facilities may be advisable in the United States as well.
