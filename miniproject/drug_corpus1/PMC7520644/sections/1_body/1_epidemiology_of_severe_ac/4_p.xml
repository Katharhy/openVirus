<p>SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV belong to the same 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> genus, and they share about 80% nucleotide identity. However, despite the close relation between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the latter seems to cause milder infections[
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Moreover, SARS and MERS were characterized mainly with nosocomial spread, whereas SARS-CoV-2 has community transmission[
