<p>Under the experimental circumstances tested, the stability of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of SARS-CoV-1. This indicates that their different epidemiologic features are probably due to other factors, such as high viral concentrations in the upper airways and the potential asymptomatic spread of SARS-CoV-2[
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Also, the aerosol and fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is likely since the virus can remain infectious depending on the inoculum shed. It was shown that the virus is viable in aerosols for hours and on surfaces up to days. These findings mirror those of SARS-CoV-1, in which both the nosocomial and super-spreading transmissions were observed. All of these characteristics provide information for pandemic mitigation efforts[

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Transmission due to droplets is documented in close contact (considered within 1-1.5 m) with a symptomatic person (
 <italic>e.g</italic>., coughing or sneezing). The risk is estimated by the exposition of mucosae (mouth and nose) or conjunctiva (eyes) to potentially infective respiratory droplets. Fomites in the immediate environment around the infected person can also lead to transmission[
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, the virus can be spread directly by infected people and indirectly through surfaces or objects used by the infected person[
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].
