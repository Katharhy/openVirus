<p>SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 enter the host cell by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor, while the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 receptor is required for MERS-CoV entry. After the virus enters the cell, viral RNA is released and involved in consecutive processes of new viral particle formation, which are then released[
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. ACE-2 receptors are mainly expressed in the vascular epithelium, renal tubular epithelium, and Leydig cells in the testes. For this reason, SARS-CoV might lead to hypogonadism and harm male fertility. In the respiratory system, SARS-CoV-2 enters the alveoli by binding to the ACE-2 receptors, predominantly expanded on the type II pneumocytes[
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Once infected, type II pneumocytes are destroyed, and surfactant production is reduced. Macrophages are then recruited to destroy the damaged tissue of the lungs. Macrophages secrete interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFÎ±), which cause vasodilatation and high temperature and enhance neutrophils and lymphocytes migration to the affected area. Alveoli edema causes respiratory failure due to blood-gas exchange disturbance. Nonstructural proteins might affect the innate immune response of the host and play a crucial role in the viral virulence and pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection[
