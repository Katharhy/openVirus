<p>As already mentioned above, COVID-19 is an infection that has shortly become a health problem of global concern. Although COVID-19 is not the first outbreak of a coronaviral disease, neither SARS nor MERS led to such a high number of cases worldwide. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and much more virulent than both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The continuous expansion of COVID-19 could be explained with the viral-specific characteristics and virulence factors[

CoV are divided into four genera: α, β, γ, and δ. Along with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the current coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is classified as a β-coronavirus. Its genome sequence is about 88% identical to that of two bat-derived SARS-like viruses, and about 80% and 50% identical to the genome sequences of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively[

S protein is a glycoprotein essential for viral entry by attachment and fusion to the cellular membrane (Figure
