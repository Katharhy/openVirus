<p>However, recent data conclude that even reduced in numbers, Th and Tc cells are overactivated in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2[

However, once presented in the organism, CD4+ and CD8 + anti-virus memory T cells persist in the bloodstream of recovered patients for up to 4 years, even in the absence of viral antigens[

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and MERS-CoV-specific CD8+ T cells in mice, mainly involved in viral clearance[
