The reason for the decline in the antibodies levels remains unclear, even though some hypotheses are related to the short-life of memory B cells, particularly to coronavirus, hiding in the secondary lymphoid organs, such as lymph nodes and the spleen as well as in the bone marrow and the lungs.

Furthermore, some of the memory B cells of some patients reacted to the proteins from the live virus
