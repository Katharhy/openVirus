<p>Usually, COVID-19 survivors developed antibodies from 2-15 d after developing symptoms, as the immune response is broadly reminiscent of the typical anti-viral reaction[
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The majority of patients produced antibodies against the spike protein[
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Moreover, it was shown that the levels of antibodies correlated with patients age and the severity of the disease. The drawback of testing antibodies is that in mild cases, it is more likely not to produce detectable antibodies. Besides, it is not known whether these antibodies are protective or not. Some 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies showed that they are neutralizing and prevent the virus from entering the host cells[
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, we always have in mind that cellular immunity against the virus is more critical for viral clearance than the humoral. Thus, the role of Th, T cytotoxic, and NK cells should not be neglected. Studies that included survivors from the 2003 SARS epidemic have recently shown that neutralizing antibodies were found, 17 years after the infection[
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Similar results were reported for the MERS epidemic, although the levels of neutralizing antibodies faded significantly after 5 years.
