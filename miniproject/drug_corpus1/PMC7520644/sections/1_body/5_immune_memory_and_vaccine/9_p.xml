This suggests that the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 intended to neutralize and eliminate the virus may be insufficient in at least some of the patients. Furthermore, this observation can predict that vaccines may not be effective in these individuals. Recovered patients who have not reached a severe stage should be monitored for the presence of the virus along with the measurement of T/B cell responses. All of these scenarios need to be considered when defining vaccine development strategies. Besides, since there are many types or subtypes of coronavirus, vaccines aimed directly at SARS-CoV-2 seems to be challenging to develop. Therefore, Edward Jenner's approach should be considered. In other words, the development of a vaccine against the whole family of CoV or against those representatives that cause disease only in animals.</p>
