 <bold>Core Tip:</bold> Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) results from the interaction between the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus and the individualâ€²s immune system, we can assume that its onset and development significantly depend on this communication. Immunological aspects of the disease reflect the importance of the immune system to inhibit the viral factors and to control and regulate the pathophysiological processes during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, immune-mediated and humoral immune responses, immune memory, the cytokine storm, and neuroendocrine-immune regulation are critical factors that can determine the prognosis and outcome for patients. Now, the science is directed to acquiring new data on the immunology, including immune memory against the virus, the development of new technologies for the detection of infection and effective vaccines. However, much more information remains unclear than verified knowledge of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19.
