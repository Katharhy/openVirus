<p>Antibody and plasma therapy are the next therapy option, closely related to the immune mechanisms. It has been reported that many cured patients donate plasma against SARS-CoV-2, as there were clinical trials for SARS-CoV[
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] and MERS-CoV[
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Preliminary data indicate favorable results for use in patients with acute and severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, the development of a recombinant human monoclonal antibody, such as CR3022, is a reasonably easy way to neutralize the virus by attachment to the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. This SARS-specific human monoclonal antibody has the potential to be developed as a drug for SARS-CoV-2 infection[
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Other monoclonal antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV, such as m396 and CR3014, may be alternatives for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2[
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>].
