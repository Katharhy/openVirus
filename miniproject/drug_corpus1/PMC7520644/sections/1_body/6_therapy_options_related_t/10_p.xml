<p>Other therapy strategies are oriented against the cytokine storm. Because lymphocytopenia is commonly seen in severe cases of COVID-19, the cytokine storm caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be mediated by leukocytes other than T cells. High white blood cell counts are common, which, along with lymphocytopenia, is used as a differential diagnostic criterion for COVID-19. In any case, the blocking of IL-6 can be effective, as well as the blocking of IL-1 and TNFÎ±. The approach to blocking these pro-inflammatory cytokines has been adopted in various autoimmune diseases. We also proposed anti-IL-6 therapy in IBD patients as a way of limiting the inflammation and development of colorectal carcinoma[
