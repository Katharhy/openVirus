<p>If used for therapy, antibodies are most effective when administered soon after the onset of symptoms. The antibody acts by altering the inflammatory responses, which is also more easily achieved during the initial immune response, or the asymptomatic stage. The reason for the differences in efficacy is not well understood. Still, it may reflect the fact that the antibody works by neutralizing the initial inoculum from the infectious agent, which is probably much less than that in an already developed infection and a large number of viral copy. In line with this, to be effective, a sufficient amount of antibodies must be administered. When given to a person at risk of infection, this antibody will reach the tissues

The challenges, however, are related to the difficulties in that, as we have mentioned above, some patients do not possess high antibody titers after the illness. Therefore, due to the individual variation of the immune responses, the insufficiently active immune response in some people will be a reason for them to be prone to reinfection.
