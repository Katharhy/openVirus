<p>Passive antibody therapy is the administration of ready-made antibodies against an infectious agent to a susceptible individual to prevent or treat an infectious disease caused by that microorganism. Thus, the passive application of antibodies is the only means of ensuring the immediate and ready immunity of endangered persons. Experience with previous epidemics with other CoV, such as SARS-CoV-1, has shown that survivors' sera may contain neutralizing antibodies to the virus, thus the expected mechanism of action of passive antibody therapy is viral neutralization and elimination. However, other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, are also possible[
