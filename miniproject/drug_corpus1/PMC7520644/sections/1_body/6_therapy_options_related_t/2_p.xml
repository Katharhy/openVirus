<p>During the incubation period, as well as the non-severe stage (stage II, a mild symptomatic period with the presence of a virus in the body), a specific adaptive immune response is required to neutralize and eliminate the virus, which will eventually prevent disease progression to severe stages. The adaptive response, however, occurs more slowly and is activated at a later stage. When the protective immune response is compromised, the virus will spread, and massive damage of the affected tissues and organs will occur, especially in those that highly express ACE-2 receptors, such as the gut and kidneys. This leads to lung inflammation, mostly mediated by pro-inflammatory immune cells. Inflammation of the lungs is the leading cause of life-threatening respiratory failure in the severe stage of the disease (stage III, severe respiratory symptomatic stage with high viral load). Therefore, once severe lung damage occurs, attention should be moved to the inflammation and the efforts to suppress the immune responses and control the symptoms[
