<p id="par0085">The comparison of the genomes of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-Cov-2 showed that they are almost identical. However, protein 8a is present in SARS-CoV and absent in SARS-CoV-2. Another difference is in protein 8b, which has 84 amino acids in SARS-CoV and 121 amino acids in SARS-CoV-2. In addition, in SARS-CoV protein 3b, there are 154 amino acids, while in SARS-CoV-2 there are only 22 amino acids. Further studies need to be carried out in order to characterize how these differences affect functionality and pathogenesis. Although these viruses are in the same clade (Betacoronavirus), MERS-CoV differs in terms of proteins encoded by the pp1ab, pp1a genes, in addition to the E, M, N and accessory proteins 3a, 7a and 8b [
