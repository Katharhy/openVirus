<p id="par0080">The main structural proteins are spike surface glycoprotein (S), small envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N), whereas S protein plays an essential role in binding to receptors in the host cell, determining host tropism. Structural and accessory proteins have several functions, including induction of apoptosis, interference in the innate immune response, and regulation of cell protein expression [

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as one of the main receptors and CD209Â L as an alternative receptor. While MERS-CoV uses dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), also known as CD26 as the primary receptor. Due to this interaction, the enzyme DDP4 began to be widely studied for its association with immune regulation, signal transduction, and apoptosis [
