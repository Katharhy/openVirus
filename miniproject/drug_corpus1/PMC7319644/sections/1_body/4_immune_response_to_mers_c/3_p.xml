<p id="par0095">The induction of immunosuppression throughout MERS-CoV infection by promoting apoptosis of T lymphocytes was identified as another strategy to manipulate the survival pathways by the host’s immune response [
 <xref rid="bib0295" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. DPP4 is thought to play a significant role in the signaling and activating T cells during the course of MERS-CoV infection [

 <xref rid="bib0290" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] observed that helper CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells were more susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. In addition, MERS-CoV can induce T lymphocyte apoptosis by activating intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways. Interestingly, Mahallawi et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], observed a significant increase in the production of the cytokine IL-17 in patients infected with MERS-CoV. Thus, it is suggested that MERS-CoV infection promotes the induction of Th17 cytokines. These Th17 cytokines have the activity of recruiting neutrophils and monocytes to the site of infection or inflammation and lead to the activation of other cytokine and chemokine cascades, such as IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, TGF-β, IL-8, and MCP-1 [
