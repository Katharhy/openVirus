<p id="par0100">The immune system is able to produce neutralizing antibodies, which block each virion and impair its entry into host cells. The detection of these antibodies to MERS-CoV in human serum is considered one of the confirmatory diagnosis. These antibodies are potent tools of the adaptive response to MERS-CoV infection. However, serum detection of anti-MERS-CoV antibodies occurs 14â€“21 days after infection [
