<p id="par0090">One of the characteristics among SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 in infected patients is severe lymphopenia [

 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes count occurs early in the course of the disease and is associated with adverse results. In patients infected with SARS-CoV, this lymphocyte involvement is determined by the expression of CD25, CD28, and CD69, in the subsets of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells [

 <xref rid="bib0275" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In MERS-CoV infection, the virus negatively regulates MHC-I, MHC-II, and CD80/86 in antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which results in inhibition of the T lymphocyte response [
 <xref rid="bib0280" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. These events can further impair the function of B and T cells through negative regulation of DPP4 receptors by MERS-CoV [
