<p id="par0105">Several HLA-A*02:01-restricted T lymphocytes that recognize epitopes of SARS-CoV were identified in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients recovered from SARS. The vast majority of these immunogenic epitopes were specific for SARS-CoV S and N proteins [

 <xref rid="bib0345" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Several CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes characterized in the SARS-CoV M protein have also been identified in PBMC of SARS survivors, however, not known about HLA activation [
 <xref rid="bib0350" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Libraty et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0355" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], detected epitopes of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell restricted to HLA-DR in protein S (S729−745, S358−374 and S427–444) in patients recovered of SARS. CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> memory T cells were found in a patient who recovered from SARS-CoV infection within four years after the acute phase of the infection. Other observations showed that three epitopes (SSP-1, S978 e S1202) of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes to HLA-A*02:01-restricted, have been identified for protein S in patients recovered more than one year after infection. Other studies have been showing that virus-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes produced high levels of effector cytokines (IFN-γ and TNF-α) and cytotoxic molecules (perforin and granzyme B) [
