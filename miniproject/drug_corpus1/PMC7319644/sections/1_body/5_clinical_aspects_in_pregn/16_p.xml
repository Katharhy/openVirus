<p id="par0190">To date, there are two published cases on the obstetric and perinatal aspects of SARS-CoV-2. The first reports on the maternal and perinatal outcomes of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were a retrospective assessment of nine women who had their pregnancies resolved in Wuhan-China (previously mentioned). As for perinatal results, it should be noted that there was no fetal death, neonatal death, or neonatal asphyxia. Four patients had premature labor but under 36 gestational weeks. Two of the four premature newborns had a birth weight of less than 2500 g. All nine neonates had Apgar scores of 1 min above 8 and Apgar scores of 5 min above 9. This study related that no cases of vertical virus transmission were detected [
