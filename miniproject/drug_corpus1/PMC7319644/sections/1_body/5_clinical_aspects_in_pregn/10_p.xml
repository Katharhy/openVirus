<p id="par0160">In the United States, in 2003, a study showed that two out of eight people with confirmed severe disease (SARS-CoV), were pregnant women. The newborn, from a mother who had positive tests for SARS-CoV, did not develop the disease, abnormality, or congenital malformation. In this investigation, serum, blood samples in the cord and placenta from a patient were used at the time of the child-birth for diagnosis. Breast milk samples on days 12 and 30 postpartum were also negative for SARS-CoV. Blood, stool, and nasopharyngeal swab samples and umbilical cord blood samples did not register the presence of the virus. Stool samples from newborns collected on days 12 and 30 after delivery were also negative for viral RNA. Likewise, RT-PCRs and viral cultures of cord blood and placental tissues were all negative for SARS-CoV. The amniotic fluid obtained from the patients was also negative for SARS-CoV. No viral inclusion body or particle was detected in the samples from childbirth [
