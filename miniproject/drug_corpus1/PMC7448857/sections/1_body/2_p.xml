<p>Gemcitabine is a cytidine analog approved by the FDA for the treatment of various cancers [
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Increasing evidence has shown that gemcitabine is an effective broad spectrum antiviral agent against multiple RNA viruses which include Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], Zika virus [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], influenza virus [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and enterovirus. Gemcitabine inhibits both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV with micromolar EC50s (1.22 μM and 4.96 μM, respectively) [
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], which are similar to the EC
 <sub>50</sub> of SARS-CoV-2 (1.24 μM) in our study. It is thought that gemcitabine might exert its antiviral activities by targeting the salvage pathway of pyrimidine biosynthesis and stimulating innate immunity, at least in the cases of enterovirus [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and influenza virus [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. To examine whether it acts by the same antiviral mechanism against SARS-CoV-2, we added additional natural nucleosides (C and U) with gemcitabine in cell culture. Similar to the previous results observed in enterovirus [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the addition of exogenous cytidine significantly inhibited the antiviral activity of gemcitabine against SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>(F)). Our results thus indicated that gemcitabine may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication through the modulation of nucleotide biosynthesis, the same mechanism as did in enterovirus [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although we are unable to draw definitive conclusions regarding the efficacy of gemcitabine against SARS-CoV-2 due to the lack of 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> animal data, its antiviral efficiencies have been demonstrated in the mice models of enterovirus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Additionally, the mean peak plasma concentration of gemcitabine observed in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) could reach 17 µM after bronchial artery infusion or intravenous infusion [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], which is much higher than EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.21 μM in Vero-E6 cell. Altogether, these results support the therapeutic potential of gemcitabine as effective antivirals with low toxicity against SARS-CoV-2. Further 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> evaluation about the antiviral activity of gemcitabine against SARS-CoV-2 infection is going to be carried out in the near future, which will accelerate its application in clinical trials.
