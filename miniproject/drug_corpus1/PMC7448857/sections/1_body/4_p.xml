<p>Lycorine is an active alkaloid abundant in Amaryllidaceae with a wide range of biological functions for cancer and infectious diseases treatment [
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Unlike oxysophoridine, lycorine has been well known to exhibit antiviral activities against enterovirus, flaviviruses, HIV-1, SARS-CoV and hepatitis C virus. Regarding the exact antiviral mechanism of lycorine, however, it remains elusive. Different drug resistant mutations of lycorine have been identified within the viral protease of enterovirus or nonstructural protein 2â€…K of West Nile virus. Meanwhile, it was reported that lycorine was able to (i) inhibit the export of influenza virus nucleoprotein from the nucleus [
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and (ii) downregulate autophagy [
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] or block the elongation of viral RNA translation during EV71 infection [
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] to suppress viral replication. Altogether, we speculate that the mechanism behind the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of lycorine is probably attributed to modulating host factors instead of directly targeting viral factors.
