<p>According to the Koch’s postulates, virus isolation from clinical samples remains the “gold standard” for diagnosing viral infections. The enriched virus minimizes the perturbation from the patients’ samples and increases the signal-to-noise ratio for virus detection. Nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), oropharyngeal swab (OPS), bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), sputum, and stool samples collected from suspicious cases are used for virus isolation.

 </sup> The extracted virus shows obvious cytopathogenic effects in both Vero and Huh7 cells, resulting in observable morphological changes visualized by electron microscopy after nucleocapsid staining.

 </sup> A TMPRSS2-expressing VeroE6 cell line is highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, making it ideal for virus isolation and cytopathic testing.

 </sup> In addition, virus isolation and culture require well-trained personnel and a Biosafety Level 3 environment, which are not available in most healthcare clinics.
