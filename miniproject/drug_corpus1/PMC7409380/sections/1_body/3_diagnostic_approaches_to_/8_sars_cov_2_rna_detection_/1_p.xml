<p>Microarray is a powerful analytical tool, which can simultaneously detect multiple targets in a single sample. A DNA microarray consists of a DNA probe array on a supporting material, where the DNA sequence and location are known to characterize unknown RNA/DNA samples. Today, microarray-based platforms can be classified into different families on the basis of the type of matrix (solid or liquid), the size and density of the probe, the method used for visualizing the hybridization results, and the relative costs. Microarray has the advantages of requiring a small sample volume, a rapid reaction in 15 min, and multiple probes per target, which are widely used in the diagnosis of respiratory tract viral infections.

 </sup> The optical path difference based on the transmission characteristics of the plasmonic gold nanohole determines the pathogen concentration. However, the paper-based microarray integrated with carbon nanodots, which is used for analyte recognition and the smartphone reader, exhibits great potential for viral RNA detection.
