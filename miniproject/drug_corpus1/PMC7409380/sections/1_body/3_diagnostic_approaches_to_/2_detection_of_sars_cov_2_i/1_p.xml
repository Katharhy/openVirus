<p>The assimilated principles from other virus diagnostic techniques lay a solid foundation for the development of novel diagnostic techniques for SARS-CoV-2. A portable platform captures viruses by their sizes, coupled with Raman spectroscopy for identification.

 </sup> The SARS-CoV-2 particles in aerosol can be characterized with on-chip spectroscopy using a photonic cavity enhanced silicon nitride (Si

 </sup> The electrochemical biosensor based on surface imprinted polymers and graphene oxide composites can identify isolated virus, which has a limit of detection (LoD) similar to RT-PCR for Zika virus detection.

 </sup> Capillary biosensor, which is employed for the detection of bacterial and viral pathogens, uses a multicolumn capillary for easy separation, Fe nanoclusters for signal amplification, and a smartphone for image analysis.

 </sup> After capturing the virus, microbeads generate a unique diffraction pattern of “blurry beads” on a smartphone.

 </sup> The smartphone-based colorimetric assay utilizes 3D nanostructures as a scaffold for conjugating antibodies to capture virus particles, where the 3D structure provides more virus binding sites.

 </sup> DNA origami-based aptasensors for virus, viral RNA, and protein detection need further attention due to their 3D structure, simple fabrication, and rapid response.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>
 </sup> Interdigitated organic electrochemical transistors function as transducers to enhance the sensitivity and dynamic detection range of aptasensors.

 </sup> Lab-on-a-chip having a specific biosensor and sensitive detector is desirable for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics without nucleic acid isolation and amplification.
