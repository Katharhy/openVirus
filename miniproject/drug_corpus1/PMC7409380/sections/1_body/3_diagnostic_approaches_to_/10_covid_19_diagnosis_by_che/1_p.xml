<p>COVID-19 is a fetal viral pneumonia, where breath chemical and respiratory behavior sensors may be helpful to diagnose and evaluate prognosis through a time-series readout. The chemoresistive orthogonal sensor array enables a simple and portable breath analyzer in daily settings.

 </sup> Chest CT demonstrates typical radiographic features in most patients with COVID-19, including ground-glass opacity, multifocal patchy consolidation, and/or interstitial changes with a peripheral distribution.

 </sup> Typical CT features are visible in some patients with negative qRT-PCR results but with clinical symptoms.

 </sup> C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and lactate dehydrogenase were positively correlated with the severity of pneumonia assessed on CT.

 </sup> However, the limited number of radiologists is insufficient to accommodate a large number of patients in some regions. Deep learning (DL) typically extracts abstract features in CT images to segment the lesion region and classifies COVID-19 into 6 categories: healthy, ultraearly, early, rapid progression, consolidation, and dissipation stages.
