<p>The transfer learning based on the modified Inception (M-Inception) consists of two parts: the first part uses a pretrained inception network to convert image data into one-dimensional feature vectors, and the second part uses a fully connected network for classification and prediction. The M-Inception reduces the dimension of the features before the classification layer and combines the Decision tree and AdaBoost as classifiers to improve the classification accuracy.

 </sup> The Human-in-the-loop (HITL) strategy assists radiologists in performing automatic annotation and segmentation. The Dice similarity coefficient generated by the system between automatic and manual segmentation is 91.6% Â± 10.0%. The Dice similarity coefficient is an index to measure the spatial overlap between the segmentation result and the ground truth. Fully manual delineation takes 1 to 5 h, but HITL reduces delineation time to 4 min after 3 iterative model updates.
