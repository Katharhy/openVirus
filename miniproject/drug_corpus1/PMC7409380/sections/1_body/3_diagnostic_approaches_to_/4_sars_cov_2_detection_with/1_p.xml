<p>For an unknown virus, genomic sequencing is important for its rapid and complete identification. Genomic sequencing has many advantages in virus detection. First, it enables investigation of the SARS-CoV-2 evolution during transmission and tracking of coronavirus movements.

 </sup> Second, sequencing can effectively exclude other pathogens. Third, genomic sequencing can identify multiple pathogens existing in a single patient, which helps implement reasonable treatments. However, operation and data analysis require expensive equipment, long turnaround time, and professional bioinformatics personnel. Droplet-based single-cell sequencing technology, such as inDrop, Drop-seq, and 10× Genomics with barcoded beads, can deliver primers to the beads and achieve high detection efficiency.

 </sup> Currently, viral genome sequencing has top priority at the current stage of the outbreak, but patients’ genome sequencing will be informative in understanding human susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.
