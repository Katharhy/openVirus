 </sup> The steps of qRT-PCR are as follows: (1) extract RNA from patient samples; (2) reversely transcribe viral RNA into cDNA and then amplify the specific cDNA fragment by PCR; (3) read the fluorescent signal. Smaller Cycle threshold (

 <sub>t</sub> value of qPCR is the cycle number at which the fluorescent signal of a qPCR product rises above the background threshold.
