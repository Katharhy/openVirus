<p>NMPA (8) and US FDA (12) have approved a variety of antibody-based kits, which can be used for the emergency detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in human serum or plasma samples (

 </xref>). Besides, a test kit for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antigen in OPS and NPS samples has been approved by US FDA for emergency use. The immunological method circumvents the extraction of virus nucleic acid and shortens the detection time, which is safer. However, the immunological method is not applicable for the early diagnosis of COVID-19 due to the low antibody concentration at the beginning. Besides, antibody detection is susceptible to the presence of interfering substances (such as rheumatoid factor and nonspecific IgM) in blood samples

 </sup> and antibody responses to SAR-CoV-2 in COVID-19 recovered patients. The SARS-CoV-2 antibody test kits are allowed to be used as a supplementary diagnostic method to nucleic acid test kits, but they cannot be used to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection.
