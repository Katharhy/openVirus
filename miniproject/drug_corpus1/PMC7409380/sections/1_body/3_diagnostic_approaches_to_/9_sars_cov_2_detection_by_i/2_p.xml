<p>Human SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody measurement is an alternative diagnostic method. IgM antibodies are detected after 5–7 days of infection, followed by IgG.

 </sup> A colloidal gold immunochromatographic assay (GICA) strip and a peptide-based magnetic chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay (MCLIA) are used to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies (

 </sup> Compared to GICA and MCLIA, the SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM ELISA kits display a sensitivity of 87.3% with a longer time and more sophisticated operations.

 </sup> Immunoassays can be digital and multiplexing for the detection of multiple SARS-CoV-2 subtypes by using a smartphone fluorescent reader. The reader utilizes an opto-electromechanical hardware that snaps at the back of a smartphone for data collection, interpretation, display, and communication.

 </sup> The sensitivity of the immunosensor can be increased by means of a triple signal amplification strategy based on (i) carboxylic ester hydrolysis, (ii) electrochemical–chemical redox cycling, and (iii) electrochemical–enzymatic redox cycling.
