<p>SARS-CoV-2 infection is initiated with viral entry, in which the S protein first recognizes and binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a host membrane receptor, and then induces fusion of the virus membrane with the host cell membrane.

 </sup> The next step is the entry of the virion or its RNA genome. The viral antigen is then presented by the antigen-presenting cells, which subsequently stimulates humoral and cellular immunity. The primary humoral immune response has a typical pattern of IgA, IgM, and IgG production. IgG antibodies are primarily S- and N-specific antibodies,
