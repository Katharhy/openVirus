  <p>Viral loads detected in oropharyngeal swabs and sputum samples obtained from the five patients with COVID-19. Panel A shows the cycle threshold (Ct) values obtained by RT-PCR assays using primers and probes targeting the E gene and sputum samples from the four cases. Panel B shows the Ct values obtained using oropharyngeal swabs. Case 1 received LPV/r since illness day 5–8, and case 2 received LPV/r since illness day 2–14. Panel C shows the ratios of the Ct values for sputum and oropharyngeal swab samples, and for 67.5% (27/40) of the samples, the ratios were less than or equal to one.</p>
