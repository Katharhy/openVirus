  <p>Chest CT findings, without intravenous contrast, of the five study cases with COVID-19. Panel A (case 1) shows small areas of ground glass (arrows) in the peripheral zones of the lower lobes of the bilateral lungs on illness day 28 (before discharge). Panel B (case 2) shows patchy ground glass infiltrates (arrows) in the right upper lung on illness day 24. Panel C (case 3) shows multiple patchy ground glass infiltrates (arrows) in the bilateral lung on illness day 25. Panel D (case 4) shows a few patchy ground glass infiltrates (arrows) in the bilateral lungs on illness day 25. Panel E (case 5) shows normal finding in the bilateral lungs on day 32. CT scans were performed after at least two consecutive tests were negative in these 5 cases.</p>
