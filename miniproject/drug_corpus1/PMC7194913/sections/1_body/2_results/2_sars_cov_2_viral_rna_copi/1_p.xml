<p id="p0045">In five cases, oropharyngeal swabs and sputum samples were obtained simultaneously on every other day, and staring the Ct values are shown in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A and B. In total, there were 40 testing points with detectable virus before the four patients were de-quarantined (after two consecutive tests with Ct values of 40), and the data showed that viral loads of detecting SARS CoV-2 in sputum was higher. At 67.5% (27/40) of the testing time points, the ratio of the Ct value for sputum to the Ct value of the oropharyngeal swab was less than or equal to one, indicating higher viral loads of detection in sputum, compared to 32.5% (13/40) for oropharyngeal swabs. Therefore, the viral loads of sputum detection is speculated to be higher than the viral loads of oropharyngeal swab detection (
