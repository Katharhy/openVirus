He was requested to home quarantine due to a history of SARS CoV-2 exposure, and was confirmed to have COVID-19 the following day. Both oropharyngeal swabs and sputum were negative on three consecutive testing days (illness days 23, 25, and 27). He was discharged on illness day 25 in stable condition, and a chest CT was performed (
