 <bold>Case 1:</bold> A 56-year-old Taiwanese woman was admitted with chief complaint of 2-day history of subjective fever and dry cough. On admission (illness day 3), the patient reported that she had no shortness of breath, nausea or diarrhea. Oropharyngeal swab and sputum specimens were positive for COVID-19 (SARS CoV-2) by real-time reverse transcription–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays with primers and probes targeting the E genes of SARS CoV-2. She received lopinavir (200 mg)/ritonavir (50 mg) (LPV/r) as two pills twice daily since illness day 5. On illness day 6–8, episodes of vomiting and severe watery diarrhea developed which was consistent with the side effects of LPV/r, and LPV/r was discontinued on illness day 8. The tests of SARS CoV-2 remained positive until illness day 23. On illness day 28, a chest CT was performed (
