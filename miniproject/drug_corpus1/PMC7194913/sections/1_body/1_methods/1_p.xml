<p id="p0015">Oropharyngeal swabs and sputum samples were obtained from the admitted patients for SARS CoV-2 testing every other day and were tested assay using primers and probes targeting the E and RdRP gene as described by the WHO for diagnostic detection of SARS CoV-2 by real-time RT-PCR.

 </xref> Amplification and detection are accomplished using TaqMan chemistry on the ABI 7500, and an internal positive amplification control (IPC) is included with each specimen. A sample can be interpreted as positive when the analysis of the IPC indicates that amplification has occurred in the reaction tube and signal from target reporter dye has been detected from E/RdRp1/RdRp2/N genes. Cycle threshold (Ct) values are inversely related to the viral RNA copy number, and Ct values of 30.76, 27.67, 24.56, and 21.48, correspond to 1.5 × 10
