<p id="p0075">Lopinavir is an antiretroviral agent, boosted by ritonavir, that is widely used for treating HIV. Experiences using LPV/r to treat SARS-CoV have been reported in several studies. Cao and co-workers showed 199 adult patients with severe COVID-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care, and mortality at 28 days was similar in LPV/r group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs. 25.0%; 95% CI, −17.3 to 5.7).

 </xref> Adverse events, including the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or death within 21 days, were significantly lower in the LPV/r group than in the historic controls (2.4% vs. 28.8%, p &lt; 0.001). In addition, a significant reduction in the need for rescue pulsed steroids (p &lt; 0001) and significantly lower nosocomial infections were also noted in patients treated with LPV/r (p = 0.043). Chan and colleagues demonstrated that the addition of LPV/r as an initial treatment was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the overall death rate (2.3% vs 15.6%) and intubation rate (0% vs 11.0%) when compared with matched controls (both p &lt; 0.05).

 </xref> Based on the similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS CoV-2, we prescribed LPV/r for our first two cases and presumed that it would suppress the viral load. Unfortunately, there was no obvious shortening effect on viral shedding in our limited dataset. In the future, peptides or small compounds that bind to carboxypeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a cellular receptor for both SARS viruses, may be potential treatment agents.

 </xref> The effective treatment is lacking, and some clinical trials investigating the efficacy are conducting globally. Currently, effective infection control intervention is the only way to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
