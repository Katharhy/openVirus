<p id="p0080">There are some limitations to this study. First, the study population was small because there were only a few confirmed and recovered cases of COVID-19 in Taiwan. Second, no documented effective medication could be used in a parallel group. However, the strength of our study is the complete dataset of Ct values obtained during hospitalization, and sputum and oropharyngeal swab specimens collected every 2 or 3 days to document the serial change in SARS CoV-2 viral shedding.</p>
