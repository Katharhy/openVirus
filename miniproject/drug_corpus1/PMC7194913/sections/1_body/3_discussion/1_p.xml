<p id="p0055">This analysis of five cases of COVID-19 in Taiwan showed that SARS CoV-2 detection in sputum specimens was more sensitive than detection in oropharyngeal swabs, as 67.5% of the Ct value ratios of sputum to oropharyngeal swabs were less than or equal to one. Therefore, the viral loads of sputum detection is speculated to be higher than that of oropharyngeal swab detection. In addition, an increase of Ct values between these two time points was 0.9 per day in case 1 and 2, compared to an increase of 1.0 per day in the non-LPV/r-treated cases (3, 4 and 5); therefore, we concluded that LPV/r did not shorten the duration of SARS CoV-2 viral shedding in patients with mild pneumonia.</p>
