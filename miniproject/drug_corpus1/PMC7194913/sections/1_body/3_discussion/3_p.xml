 </xref> Chloroquine is an immune-modifier that can be distributed throughout the body, including the lungs. Hydroxychloroquine has in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 and may have immunomodulating properties. Mechanisms may include inhibition of viral enzymes or processes such as viral DNA and RNA polymerase, viral protein glycosylation, virus assembly, new virus particle transport, and virus release. Other mechanisms may also involve ACE2 cellular receptor inhibition, acidification at the surface of the cell membrane inhibiting fusion of the virus, and immunomodulation of cytokine release. Pre-clinical in vitro data suggest hydroxychloroquine has activity against SARSCoV-2.

 </xref> Hydroxychloroquine (EC50 = 0.72 μM) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50 = 5.47 μM) to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro in Yao X's study.

 </xref> In case 2, hydroxychloroquine was added since illness day 18 after virus was not detected two days later, so it could not be concluded the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine. An open-label, non-randomized clinical trial compared hydroxychloroquine treatment (n = 26) to an untreated negative control group.

 </xref> Preliminary data showed the proportion of patients that had negative PCR results significantly differed between treated patients and untreated controls. On day 6, 70% of hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were virologically cured compared to 12.5% in the untreated control group.
