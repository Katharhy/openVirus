 </xref> The first reported case in the USA showed a prompt reduction in fever and much-improved clinical symptoms after administration of remdesivir on day 12 of illness after administration of remdesvir starting on day 10 of illness.

 </xref> Thereafter, the effectiveness of remdesivir garnered much attention worldwide. However, chest roentgenography of the aforementioned US case showed only relatively mild infiltrations, and the rRT-PCR assay of a oropharyngeal swab was negative on illness day 12, soon after remdesivir was first administered. Thus, the suppression of SARS CoV-2 activity by remdesivir needs to be further investigated, and as of now, there have been only a few clinical experiences.
