<p>Parasites often share their hosts with other parasites, meaning that hosts infected by a single, homogenous parasite population represent a rare exception. More commonly, hosts are infected by a variety of pathogenic organisms—any of which we refer to as ‘parasites’—that may themselves comprise multiple genetic variants (‘strains’). Such diversity within the host can lead to competition for resources or for respite from the shared threat of host immune defenses. Within-host competition has long been a focus of theoretical and experimental research in evolutionary ecology, and it is now widely appreciated that competition can alter the evolutionary trajectories of key parasite traits like virulence (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="eoaa004-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]). Equally widespread is the recognition that medical and public health interventions also drive the evolution of parasite traits; drug resistance, for example, has made its way to the forefront of our common conscience and our newsfeeds. Yet the interactions between these two sources of selection pressure are underexplored despite their inextricable linkage: by limiting transmission between hosts and/or inhibiting replication within hosts, control efforts—when successful—are likely to reduce the frequency and intensity of within-host competition. The evolutionary consequences of such interactions for parasite traits are as yet unmapped, and the implications for host health and disease control remain uncertain.
