<p>Within-host competition and public health interventions are both highly potent sources of selection on parasite traits. Failing to account for the potential interactions between these sources of selection can result in over- (or, sometimes, under-) estimating the long-term efficacy of interventions, including resilience in the face of parasite evolution. Comparing across case studies, we find a lack of consistent patterns in how competition alters epidemiology and vice versa, precluding robust, general predictions about parasite evolution. Indeed, current evidence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="eoaa004-F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>) suggests a range of potential evolutionary outcomes following control, both positive and negative from a public health perspective. A critical challenge lies in translating theory and experiments in model systems to expectations for evolutionary responses in parasites of global health concern, especially those subject to large-scale control efforts. Guiding principles may emerge from a better understanding of the mechanisms that govern within-host interactions in these cases, narrowing the range of possible evolutionary outcomes. Tracking the knock-on consequences of interventions requires long-term data, ideally obtained through active surveillance efforts that can detect how coinfections contribute to transmission and health burdens. In the meantime, existing data show that the epidemiological feedbacks of altering competition can drive parasite evolution in subtle, but important ways that deserve more attention.
