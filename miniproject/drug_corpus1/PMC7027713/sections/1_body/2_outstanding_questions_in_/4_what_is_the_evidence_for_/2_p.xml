<p>Even in the absence of competition, theory demonstrates the potential for indirect selection via epidemiological feedbacks. For example, epidemic expansion can select for earlier transmission from malaria infections and more aggressive parasite proliferation, to the detriment of host health [
 <xref rid="eoaa004-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. That outcome arises from the fact that while an epidemic is expanding, most infections are in the early stages. Parasites therefore pay little cost for traits, like aggressive proliferation, that jeopardize transmission late in the course of infection [
 <xref rid="eoaa004-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and references therein]. By limiting the frequency of infections in early stages, theory predicts that slowing epidemic expansion should yield public health benefits beyond reducing prevalence [
 <xref rid="eoaa004-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For malaria, those benefits could be even greater if control efforts also reduce the frequency of coinfections thought to be costly to health [
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="eoaa004-F1">Fig. 1B(</xref>ii)]. Although multiple sources of indirect selection may align to drive parasite evolution in ways beneficial to public health, other systems may yield more nuanced outcomes; such synergism would not be expected when a reduction in competition hastens host mortality [
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="eoaa004-F1">Fig. 1B(</xref>i)]. With further theory across a range of systems, generalities may emerge about when indirect selection is likely to reinforce the public health gains of limiting transmission.
