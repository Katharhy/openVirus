<p>Detecting such long-term, evolutionary consequences of control—especially indirect effects—is a further challenge, but lab studies can nonetheless highlight possible outcomes. For example, artificial evolution experiments suggest that targeting control to superspreaders could have unintended consequences for the evolution of parasite traits underlying transmission. Bashey and Lively [
 <xref rid="eoaa004-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] artificially selected for entomopathogenic nematodes that produced many or few juveniles after invading their insect hosts. The nematodes selected to produce few juveniles also produced larger ones, expected to be more transmissible to new hosts [

Extrapolating from these experimental results, public health interventions that isolate superspreaders (e.g. quarantining hosts with high rates of shedding) could select for increased per-propagule infectivity to compensate for lower shedding rates among the hosts who can still contribute to transmission (
