<p>Direct evolutionary responses to interventions, like drug resistance, are a predictable consequence of disease control, but control efforts may also exert unexpected, indirect evolutionary pressures on parasite traits. Feedbacks between competition and control represent a potentially crucial source of indirect selection; e.g. if control efforts reduce the frequency of coinfections (e.g. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="eoaa004-F1">Fig.Â 1A and B</xref>), parasites may evolve in response to that altered competitive landscape. Devising experiments to detect those outcomes requires clear theoretical predictions about how parasite traits will evolve, but the complexity and idiosyncratic nature of competitive interactions (as outlined above) makes constructing those models a substantial, ongoing challenge (for an example of such a model, see [
