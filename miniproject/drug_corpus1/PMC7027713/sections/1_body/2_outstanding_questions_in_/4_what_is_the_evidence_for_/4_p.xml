<p>Whether the effect is to enhance or undercut control efforts, theory and experimental data demonstrate convincingly that interventions can impose indirect selection on clinically and epidemiologically relevant parasite traits. A major outstanding challenge is translating this work to human parasites and determining how to detect these subtler evolutionary consequences of intervention efforts. Only then can we evaluate if they represent an important consideration in designing intervention strategies.</p>
