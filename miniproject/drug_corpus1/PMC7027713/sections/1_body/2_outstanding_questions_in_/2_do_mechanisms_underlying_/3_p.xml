<p>The mechanisms underlying competition also determine any priority effects, where an initial infection alters the within-host environment—positively or negatively—for subsequently colonizing strains. An initial infection could make a host more vulnerable to later colonizing strains, for example by exhausting host defenses. Alternately, a combination of resource and immune-mediated apparent competition could reduce the success of parasites that subsequently colonize a host. These priority effects can influence individual health outcomes as well as evolutionary patterns, like the emergence of drug resistance. In projecting the spread of drug resistance, it is useful to recognize that drug-resistant strains are likely to appear at low density in hosts already occupied by drug-sensitive strains. Applied to malaria infections, models show that this numerical disadvantage makes resistant strains more extinction-prone, a disadvantage compounded by priority effects arising from immune-mediated competition [

In sum, the bulk of evidence suggests that mechanistic understanding of competition is key to evaluating the long-term efficacy of public health interventions.
