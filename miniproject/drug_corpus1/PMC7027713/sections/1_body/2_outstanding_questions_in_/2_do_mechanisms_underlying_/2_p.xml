<p>We suggest that the answer to this question is not necessarily. If interventions can be found that mimic the beneficial effects of competition and improve clinical outcomes, then—whatever the underlying mechanisms—those interventions should probably be deployed. However, an understanding of mechanisms is likely to prove crucial for predicting the longer-term consequences of those interventions, and in particular, the parasite evolutionary responses that may erode or bolster their direct effects. For example, intensifying resource competition may select for faster proliferating strains that cause more harm to hosts. In contrast, enhancing interference competition could select for slower-proliferating strains that produce more energetically expensive compounds (e.g. bacteriocins) and cause less harm to hosts [
