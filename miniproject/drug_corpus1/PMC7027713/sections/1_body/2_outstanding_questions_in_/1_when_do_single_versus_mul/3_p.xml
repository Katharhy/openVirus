<p>A similar ‘one-versus-many’ distinction emerges from studying transmission of drug-resistant malaria strains. In untreated rodent malaria infections, drug-resistant strains are competitively suppressed by drug-sensitive competitors and fail to transmit, regardless of whether competitors comprise one or more strains [

Unlike our optimistic view for virulence in HIV infections, as control efforts succeed in reducing the prevalence of malaria infections, and coincidentally increasing the frequency of single infections, drug-resistant strains may transmit more efficiently (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="eoaa004-F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). In a further contrast with HIV infections, the number of ‘distinct’ competitors seems crucial for understanding disease severity in this system. In experimental infections, increasing the number of strains elevates the total parasite burden and exacerbates infection-induced anemia [3, and references therein]. Thus, projecting how control efforts will alter virulence in malaria requires understanding the distribution of strains within hosts, resolution that is not required to predict consequences for the spread of drug resistance. Altogether, evidence suggests that comparing single versus multiple infections is sometimes useful (and, indeed, sufficient) for predicting health outcomes, but the patterns vary considerably across and even within systems.
