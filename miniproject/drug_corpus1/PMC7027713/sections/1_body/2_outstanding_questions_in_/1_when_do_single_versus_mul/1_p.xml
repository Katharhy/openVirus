<p>In evolutionary theory, infections are often categorized into two types: single or multiple infections, with the latter implying two or more different parasite strains (or species). This simple dichotomy belies both the complexity of many human infectious diseases and the myriad potential outcomes of competitive interactions within the host, but it is nonetheless predicted to have a large impact on host health. Is there any evidence that the ‘precise’ diversity of an infection—the number of strains represented by the ‘multiple’ moniker—needs to be considered to understand clinical outcomes?</p>
