<p>For HIV infections, the answer seems to be no. A lot can be predicted about clinical outcomes from knowing simply whether an infection was founded by one viral strain or more. Infections founded by more than one strain tend to be more virulent as they yield higher viral loads, which in turn hasten progression to AIDS; in reality, most new infections are founded by single strains [2 and references therein; NB: we use ‘strain’ here for consistency rather than ‘variant’ as favored in that literature]. The preponderance of infections founded by single strains arises in part from the fact that transmission of multiple viral particles is a prerequisite for inoculation with multiple strains. Transmission of many viral particles is particularly likely early on in HIV infections, before viral populations have diversified, and so relatively few strains are available for transmission [
