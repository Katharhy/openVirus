<p>Within-host interactions have the potential to alter critical epidemiological rates such as transmission, virulence and recovery. But are there predictable patterns across, or even within, host-parasite systems? Recovery rates are challenging to quantify, especially for human infections where the timing of inoculation is often unknown. However, times series of human malaria infections—crucially, with known inoculation dates—provide a basis for understanding the drivers of infection length. Childs and Buckee [
 <xref rid="eoaa004-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] used those data to model transmission and infection duration in single versus coinfections, finding that the addition of a second strain can truncate or extend infection, and may (or may not) make the host more infectious. Outcomes in these cases depended on the timing of the infection and details about host immunity and prior exposure, belying the existence of simple rules for adjusting epidemiological rates in the context of multiple infections.
