<p>A related challenge is that when diverse parasites generate similar symptoms, it is difficult to even identify multiple infections, much less estimate their influence on epidemiological processes. For example, Zika, dengue and chikungunya viruses frequently co-circulate and present with similar, dengue-like symptoms, so that infections composed of more than one of these viruses may go undetected [reviewed in 8]. Passive case detection relies on patients presenting at clinics and so cannot reveal whether infections with multiple viruses are more (or less) severe; that determination requires data that are currently lacking on the prevalence of single versus multiple infections among hosts with subclinical infections, i.e. cases where acute symptoms are mild or absent [

 <xref rid="eoaa004-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], rendering individuals potentially more susceptible to that virus than if they had been exposed sequentially. Thus, predicting the epidemiological consequences of co-circulation, including the impact of coinfection on the progression of future epidemics, depends critically on timing (akin to the priority effects noted earlier). Common principles may become apparent as more data, generated through active surveillance, is brought to bear on the question of individual health outcomes of coinfected hosts and broader patterns of circulation. For now, existing data show that multiple infections alter key epidemiological parameters in hugely varied ways, defying straightforward generalizations.
