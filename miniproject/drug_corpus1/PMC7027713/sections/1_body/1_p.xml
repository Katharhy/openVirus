<p>Seeking to fill this gap and elucidate common principles—or lack thereof—shaping parasite evolution in the presence of competition and disease control, we recently held an interdisciplinary workshop on this topic at Princeton University. The workshop was organized by Nicole Mideo and Megan A. Greischar as part of the NSF-funded Infectious Disease Evolution Across Scales (IDEAS) Research Coordination Network, with a combination of invited speakers and participants selected based on blinded review of applications (see author list). Here, we use the main discussion points of the workshop as a guide to define the level of understanding required to anticipate the evolutionary impact of feedbacks among within-host interactions, epidemiological processes and disease control, and we identify key open challenges for generating this understanding.</p>
