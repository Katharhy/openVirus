  <p>Empirical insights on epidemiological feedbacks driving parasite evolution. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Reducing transmission could lower multiple infection prevalence and thereby facilitate faster spread of resistance. Competition suppresses the transmission of drug resistance in rodent malaria parasites [

   <bold>B</bold>) Reducing transmission decreases multiple infection prevalence, increasing (i) or decreasing (ii) virulence, depending on the mechanism of competition. (i) Entomopathogenic nematodes release mutualistic bacteria (colored shapes) into host caterpillars after invading. Bacteria and nematodes grow separately until host death, when nematodes reacquire bacteria and exit the cadaver. Bacteria strains interfere with one another—delaying host death—by producing bacteriocins [reviewed in 1]. (ii) Coinfecting rodent malaria strains (colored shapes) compete for resources, and diverse infections generate greater anemia [

   <bold>C</bold>) Isolating superspreaders generates selection on per-parasite transmissibility
   <italic>.</italic> Artificial selection for production of many nematodes (black squiggles) emerging from caterpillar cadavers (i.e. superspreading) resulted in smaller nematodes—expected to reduce transmissibility—compared with selection for the production of few nematodes [
