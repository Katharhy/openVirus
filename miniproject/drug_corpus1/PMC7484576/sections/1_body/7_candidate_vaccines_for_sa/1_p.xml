<p>It is extremely critical to discover effective and safe vaccines to counter COVID-19 pandemic, limit its rapid dissemination, and eventually circumvent its future reappearance. 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarizes an overview of vaccine production platforms and vaccine candidates for various Coronaviruses.

 </sup> To date, no vaccines have been approved in humans to combat coronavirus-induced respiratory infections. Only IBV vaccines have been registered in animals for the management of upper respiratory-tract infections of CoV in chickens.

 </sup> Since the COVID-19 shares substantial sequence similarity with the earlier two devastating coronaviruses (MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV), the vaccinations developed for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV would greatly expedite the development of anti-COVID-19 vaccines. Important criteria to be considered for all vaccines include the protective efficacy, safety, and duration of vaccine-acquired immunity, but the high manufacturing capacity and rapid development is also indispensable for vaccines in the face of emerging pandemics.

 </sup> Even though attenuated and traditional inactive vaccines are being appraised, high-titer preparation of these vaccines in cell culture under the conditions of biosafety level-3 is a great challenge.
