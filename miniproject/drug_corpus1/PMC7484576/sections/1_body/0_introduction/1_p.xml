<p>Several coronaviruses are prevalent in humans causing only colds and slight upper respiratory infections. Nevertheless, the widespread outbreaks of coronavirus infections have become increasingly pervasive in humans. The first pandemic of the twenty-first century caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002–2003. After a decade, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) appeared, and infections continue to expand in the Middle East. Now, after seven years of MERS-CoV, another coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 with more devastating effects has again emerged,

 </sup> and the associated disease COVID-19 has disseminated to over 200 different countries of the world. Across virtually all counties worldwide, millions of people have been infected, and hundreds of thousands have died.

 </sup> Additionally, the lives of millions of people have been substantially affected because of quarantines and mandatory isolations. The ripple influence of this pandemic has brought potential challenges to worldwide healthcare systems and might trigger a “far-reaching” global economic crisis if the virus spread is not strictly curbed.

 </sup> Given the sequence analysis, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 shows 80% and 54% close relation to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively.

 </sup> Until now, there is a very limited arsenal to fight against lethal infections with no officially registered vaccines or treatments to combat any of these deadly CoV-induced syndromes, including SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 binds to the similar host-cell receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) and might exhibit common pathogenic mechanisms and limited cross-neutralizing antibodies.

 </sup> This acquaintance along with improved knowledge of coronavirus reproduction approaches and improvements in vaccine technology since SARS-CoV advocates that vaccine for COVID-19 might be coming more promptly than earlier but regrettably may not be available to curtail the recent outbreak.
