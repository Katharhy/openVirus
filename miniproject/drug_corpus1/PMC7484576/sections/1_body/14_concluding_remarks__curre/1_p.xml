<p>In the scenario of this deadly pandemic, it is very critical to rapidly develop, produce, and deploy first-generation vaccines. A combination of synthetic nucleic acid (DNA or mRNA)-based vaccination with S (and possibly N) glycoprotein booster are leading candidate vaccines taken into consideration the aforementioned criteria. Issuance of conditional licensures is an approach that can be employed to expedite the utilization of veterinary vaccines during the COVID-19 epidemics based on human safety and protection levels to decrease mortalities in the highest-risk populations (especially elder, healthcare workers and patients with multiple comorbidities). Furthermore, more efficacious and potent second-generation vaccines should be prepared in parallel to greatly reduce disease, prevent disability, number of deaths, and block shedding. Since the virulence mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 in humans remains uncertain, therefore, vaccine strategies should also need to be changed if the virus attacks both the enteric and respiratory tracts and is also shedding in the stool of infected people. Parenteral S vaccine booster and oronasal vaccine prime might be the optimal candidates for preventing both respiratory and intestinal infections, as well as blocking nasal and fecal shedding as have been deployed for some animal CoV. It is highly likely to the spillover of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2-like CoVs from potential animal reservoirs in the future. These facts warrant developing newer approaches for vaccine generation with the potential to provoke wider heterologous and cross-protection immunity against coronavirus within each betaCoV family. For this, the focus should be devoted to targeting additional proteins (N, S2, etc.) and conserved internal virus epitopes that have shown the capacity to induce broad-spectrum cross-protective and cross-reactive immunity.</p>
