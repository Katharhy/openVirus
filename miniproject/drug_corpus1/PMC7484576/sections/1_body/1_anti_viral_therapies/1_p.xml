<p>Interferon-α (IFN-α) is a member of type I interferons family that provides one of the frontlines of host resistance against viral invade and infectivity. IFN-α inhibits virus infection by direct interference with the replication cycle and boosting up innate and acquired immune responses to infection. In-vitro trials-based studies revealed the effective ability of IFN-α to suppress the reproduction of SARS-CoV.

 </sup> IFN-α-vaccinated Cynomolgus monkeys have been found to be less vulnerable and protected from infectious diseases caused by SARS-CoV.

 </sup> Furthermore, the therapeutic benefits of synthetic recombinant IFN-α have been demonstrated for patients infected with SARS-CoV in a pilot-scale investigation.

 </sup> Therefore, IFN-α might be advocated as a candidate medication for the therapeutic treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
