<p>Lopinavir-ritonavir was recognized as a first protease-inhibiting agent,

 </sup> which can attach to the endopeptidase C30 of SARS-CoV-2 protease,

 </sup> and thus exerting potential anti-viral activities by impeding the formation of key proteins of the SARS-CoV-2. Evidence suggests that lopinavir-ritonavir treatment either in individual or amalgamation with other anti-viral therapies has improved the outcome of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infected patients by ameliorating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

 </sup> A comparative illustration of healthy and infected alveolus due to ARDS is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1</xref>. Considering the similar nature SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, lopinavir-ritonavir could exhibit a beneficial impact to encounter COVID-19 infectious disease. However, additional investigations are required to elucidate this opportunity.
