 </sup> demonstrated the effective suppression activity of chloroquine for the newly emerged novel CoVID-19 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Out of five different FDA-registered broad-spectrum drugs and two anti-viral agents tested against a new clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2, chloroquine was observed to be extremely efficacious in preventing and controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection.

 </sup> It is a cheap drug, which has been utilized for more than seven decades, and hence it could be a potentially applicable choice against COVID-19. Further, a safe track promotes its assessment in human patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19).
