<p>Chymotrypsin‐like (3C‐like) and papain‐like protease (PLP) are two proteins encoded by a coronavirus. In addition to exhibit a key role in the replication of coronavirus, both of these proteins also possess the function to inhibit innate immune responses of the host. Therefore, these proteins could be attractive anti-viral drug targets to deal with the coronavirus.

 </sup> Cinanserin is a well‐known serotonin antagonist. Due to the suppression of 3-chymotrypsin‐like protease, cinanserin was considered as a potential and timely candidate for inhibiting the reproduction of SARS‐CoV.

 </sup> Since 3-chymotrypsin‐like protease has also been determined in COVID‐19,

 </sup> thus, cinanserin can be a suitable therapeutic option for suppressing the infection caused by SARS-CoV-2. Flavonoids are an imperative group of naturally occurring products, including many subgroups such as flavones, chalcones, flavonols, and isoflavones.

 </sup> Apart from well-known antioxidant properties, these compounds also possess promising anti-viral effects. Jo et al.

 </sup> revealed that the anti‐corona viral properties of bioactive flavonoids, including rhoifolin, Herbacetin, and pectolinarin are attributed to the hampering of 3C‐like protease. Some flavonoid compounds particularly isobavachalcone, helichrysetin, Herbacetin, and quercetin 3‐β‐d‐glucoside have also shown ability to inhibit the enzyme activity of MERS-CoV. Similarly, bioflavonoids from
