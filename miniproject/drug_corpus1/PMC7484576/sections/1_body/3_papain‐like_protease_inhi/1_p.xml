<p>Papain‐like protease encoded by human coronavirus has a unique and novel deubiquitinating activity. It is a promising interferon antagonist and inhibits the inherent immunological response of the host against the virus. Diarylheptanoids is a bioactive compound that can be obtained from the stem bark of Japanese alder plant. It exhibited the inhibiting ability of the papain-like protease of SARS-CoV.
