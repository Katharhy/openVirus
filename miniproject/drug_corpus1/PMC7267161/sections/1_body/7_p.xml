   <p>We need to closely monitor any change in alcohol use. The tendency for some affected individuals to increase their drinking during prior epidemics may be indicative of self‐medication, which can have long‐term deleterious effects, including exacerbating alcohol's role in the ‘diseases and deaths of despair’

   <p>The current situation is unique in terms of mass physical distancing and use of social media for interaction and may trigger different behaviours. Any increase in alcohol use, however, would not only add to the usual disease burden associated with alcohol

   <p>This monitoring effort should not only look at the overall level of consumption but should differentiate by gender and socio‐economic status. The above‐mentioned review 
    <xref rid="dar13074-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> already identified gender differences, and alcohol‐attributable harm differs markedly by socio‐economic status. For instance, the increases of alcohol‐attributable mortality in North America have been almost exclusively borne by the lower socio‐economic strata
