<p>The current pandemic caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) outbreak 
 <xref rid="dar13074-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> has many implications, one of them being the potential impact on health behaviour, including the consumption of alcohol. As there is no scientific evidence on the impact of the pandemic yet, we conducted a quick search of the literature on the impact of other recent public health crises—either triggered by other infections or by strong economic downturns—on the levels and patterns of alcohol use (for search terms, see Appendix). From this, two potential main mechanisms that are not mutually exclusive emerge, with accompanying hypotheses about the possible impact of COVID‐19 on alcohol use (see the systematic review on the impact of economic crises on alcohol consumption by de Goeij
