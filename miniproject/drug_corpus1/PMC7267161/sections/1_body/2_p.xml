   <p>As crises like the COVID‐19 pandemic are usually associated with unemployment and reduced working hours leading to income reductions for larger parts of the population, this might lead to tighter budgets and a decrease in alcohol use and attributable problems. While the exact impact on unemployment will differ by country and the countermeasures enacted by governments, the potential size of this factor can be seen in the USA, where unemployment insurance claims had already reached new record heights in March 2020

   <p>The availability restrictions in the pandemic—linked to measures such as the closing of on‐premise consumption sites—could also lead to reductions in the level of alcohol use and attributable harm. Again, on‐premise consumption varies by country and type of alcoholic beverage but can be sizable, as in the UK in 2016, when about half of the beer was consumed on‐premise (Nielsen Survey, cited by Statista 
    <xref rid="dar13074-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>). In some countries, not only was on‐premise consumption restricted, but a total temporary ban of selling alcoholic beverages was implemented, and in one instance (Northern France), it was already retracted in late March

   <p>South Africa can also serve as an example of more restrictive availability interventions that have developed over the past days. On 18 March 2020, as part of its COVID‐19 Disaster Management Strategy, the government announced a number of limitations on the sale, distribution and transportation of liquor, including among other things: a 50‐person limit on the number of people that can be accommodated in on‐site consumption premises selling liquor, including taverns, restaurants and clubs at any time; a ban on the granting of special events liquor licenses; a stipulation that all on‐site consumption premises selling liquor must be closed between 18:00 and 09:00 the next morning on weekdays and Saturdays and from 13:00 on Sundays and public holidays; and the requirement that all off‐site consumption premises selling liquor must be closed between 18:00 and 09:00 the next morning on weekdays and Saturdays and from 13:00 on Sundays and public holidays

A week later, as one of the measures instituted as part of a 21‐day state lockdown from midnight on 26 March 2020 to control the spread of the coronavirus, even more stringent controls on alcohol were imposed. Alcohol was not included in the list of essential goods and services that could be purchased during the lockdown period. Specific mention was made that among the list of premises closed to the public during the lockdown were on‐site consumption premises, including taverns and shebeens, where liquor is sold, and off‐site consumption premises, including bottle stores and areas of supermarkets where alcohol was sold 
    <xref rid="dar13074-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>. In explaining the measures, the Minister of Police indicated that the ‘expected decline in accidents and assaults due to the ban on buying alcohol will free up much‐needed space in hospitals during the coronavirus crisis’ 
    <xref rid="dar13074-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>. He further indicated that nobody would be able to transport alcohol during the lockdown. As of 25 March 2020, several liquor traders and consumers had been arrested and were facing charges for contravention of the 
    <italic>National Disaster Management Act</italic>. In addition, the regulatory authorities were looking at revoking or cancelling the trading licenses of traders contravening this Act
