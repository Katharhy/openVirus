 <p>The dynamics of viral load (VL) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and its association with different clinical parameters remain poorly characterized in the US patient population. Herein, we investigate associations between VL and parameters, such as severity of symptoms, disposition (admission versus direct discharge), length of hospitalization, admission to the intensive care unit, length of oxygen support, and overall survival in 205 patients from a tertiary care center in New York City. VL was determined using quantitative PCR and log10 transformed for normalization. Associations were tested with univariate and multivariate regression models. Diagnostic VL was significantly lower in hospitalized patients than in patients not hospitalized (log10 VL = 3.3 versus 4.0; 
  <italic>P</italic> = 0.018) after adjusting for age, sex, race, body mass index, and comorbidities. Higher VL was associated with shorter duration of the symptoms in all patients and hospitalized patients only and shorter hospital stay (coefficient = −2.02, −2.61, and −2.18; 
  <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, 
  <italic>P</italic> = 0.002, and 
  <italic>P</italic> = 0.013, respectively). No significant association was noted between VL, admission to intensive care unit, length of oxygen support, and overall survival. Our findings suggest a higher shedding risk in less symptomatic patients, an important consideration for containment strategies. Furthermore, we identify a novel association between VL and history of cancer. Larger studies are warranted to validate our findings.
