<p id="p0035">Descriptive analyses of the baseline characteristics and clinical parameters in frequencies and proportions for categorical variables and medians and interquartile ranges for continuous variables were performed. Wilcoxon rank-sum test (two sided) and Pearson's χ
 <sup>2</sup> test were used to assess the difference between hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients for continuous and categorical baseline characteristics, respectively. The Fisher exact test was used instead for analyzing categorical variables when one or more of the observed cell counts were less than five. Viral load was log10 transformed for normalization before analysis. The association between VL on admission and clinical parameters was assessed among all patients and patients who were hospitalized. Specifically, simple linear regression of continuous clinical parameters against the viral load was fitted to the data to assess the association between VL and clinical parameters. Logistic regression for dichotomous clinical parameters against the viral load was fitted to the data to assess the association between VL and clinical parameters. The associations were further assessed with regression models adjusting for age, sex, race, body mass index (BMI), and comorbidities. The effect sizes of association were shown as regression coefficients and 95% CIs for continuous parameters and odds ratios and 95% CIs for dichotomous parameters. Analyses were performed using R version 3.6.1 (
