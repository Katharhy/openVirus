<p id="p0030">For qualitative RT-PCR, the cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative Assay (Emergency Use Authorization; Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) for use with cobas 6800/8800 systems (Roche) was used, following the manufacturer's instructions. The system is based on fully automated sample preparation (nucleic acid extraction and purification), followed by PCR amplification and detection of two target regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Roche). The result was considered valid only when the C
 <sub>T</sub> value of the reference gene was &lt;40. The result was considered positive when the C
 <sub>T</sub> values of both target genes were &lt;40 and negative when they were both ≥40. For quantitative real-time RT-PCR, the CDC's SARS-CoV-2 assay test was used. This assay uses the US CDC design, targeting three regions of the virus 
 <italic>nucleocapsid N</italic> gene. An additional primer/probe targeting the human 
 <italic>RNAse P</italic> gene is included, serving as the internal control. Viral RNA was extracted within using the Promega (Madison, WI) Maxwell RSC Instrument and Swab kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions. All quantitative RT-PCR assays were performed using Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA) TaqPath 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix, CG (catalog number A15299) on the Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) 7500 Fast Dx RealTime PCR Instrument. Similarly, the result was considered valid only when the C
 <sub>T</sub> value of the reference gene was &lt;40. The result was considered positive when the C
 <sub>T</sub> values of all three targets were &lt;40 and negative when they were both ≥40. Using the positive controls provided by the CDC, which are normalized to 1000 copies/μL, we converted the different C
 <sub>T</sub> positive in copies/μL. This was done using the ΔΔC
 <sub>T</sub> method, applying the formula: Power (2, (CT (sample, N1 gene) -CT (PC, N1 gene))-(CT (sample, RP gene) -CT (PC, RP gene)))∗1000.
