<p id="p0025">Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from all patients presenting to our emergency department with suspected COVID-19 infection. Collection of the nasopharyngeal sample was performed by trained medical personnel. The nasopharyngeal samples were transferred to viral transport media immediately after collection and transported to microbiology and molecular pathology for further testing. A total of 205 sequential patients without any exclusions were tested using both qualitative RT-PCR and quantitative RT-PCR to obtain diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 viral load (CDC kit that was submitted for US Food and Drug Administration review under emergency authorization utilization on March 24, 2020) at initial presentation.</p>
