<p id="p0050">Univariate analysis showed an inverse correlation between duration of symptoms and viral load (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.005) in all enrolled patients and hospitalized patients, respectively (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). A similar inverse correlation was noted between length of hospitalization and viral load in hospitalized patients (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.013) (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Multivariate analysis, adjusting for age, sex, race, BMI, and comorbidities, corroborated these findings, showing a significant inverse correlation between viral load and the duration of symptoms (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.008) and a trend with length of hospitalization (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.078) (
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). As noted above, higher viral loads also showed an inverse correlation with COVID-19 severity across the cohort and in the subgroup of hospitalized patients, which marginally did not meet statistical significance in a univariate analysis (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.056 and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.097) (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), but was statistically significant in the hospitalized group after adjusting for age, sex, race, BMI, and comorbidities (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.045) (
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). A total of 14 patients (35% of the hospitalized patients and 7% of the whole cohort) were admitted to the ICU, and 8 of them died (22.5%) (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Viral load showed no statistically significant correlation with duration of oxygen support, admission to ICU, or mortality (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Tables 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Assessment of the relationship of the diagnostic viral load with separate comorbidities in all enrolled patients showed a significant positive correlation with a history of cancer (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.033) (
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>) and cardiovascular disorders (such as coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, and chronic heart failure), other than hypertension (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.022) (
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Both associations were still statistically significant when adjusted for age (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.019 and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.005, respectively) (
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>).
