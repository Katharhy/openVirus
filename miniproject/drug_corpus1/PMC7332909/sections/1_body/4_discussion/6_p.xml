<p id="p0080">Although it seems that diagnostic viral load has no prognostic utility in terms of outcome prediction, it is an important surrogate epidemiologic marker of infectivity, notably in mildly symptomatic, nonhospitalized patients. Therefore, our analysis provides the rationale to implement diagnostic viral load in combination with qualitative methods as part of the initial diagnostic armamentarium for patients presenting to emergency department with suspicion of COVID-19. Nevertheless, although this implementation is most crucial in the asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patient population, the manual nature of the quantitative assay could limit its large-scale integration in the diagnostic laboratory workflow. Automation of quantitative methods could overcome this issue in the future.</p>
