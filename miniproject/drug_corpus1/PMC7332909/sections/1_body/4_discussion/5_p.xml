<p id="p0075">This study is limited in that the analyzed cohort was predominantly composed of nonhospitalized patients and only a small subset of patients exhibited severe COVID-19 infection. Also, viral loads were only obtained from the upper respiratory tract using nasopharyngeal swabs and at a single time point. Although this is the recommended specimen by the CDC, additional synchronous and longitudinal sampling from other sources, such as lower respiratory tract and bronchoalveolar lavages (in intubated patients), would have been important comparator to have. Although dangerous because of technical challenges of specimen collection and increased risk of viral exposure, further exploration of quantitative viral loads from lower respiratory tract tissue and blood in patients exhibiting severe disease may prove to be a better predictor for clinical outcomes.</p>
