<p id="p0060">We showed that diagnostic viral load is higher in nonhospitalized patients and has a significant inverse correlation with duration of symptoms. This inverse relationship of viral load and duration of symptoms was also observed in the hospitalized subgroup, assessed in a univariate and multivariate analysis. These results corroborate that viral loads peak shortly after symptom onset and support the results of initial Asian cohorts, which established that viral load peaks during the presymptomatic stage of the disease and slowly declines to become undetectable by day 18 to 21.

 </xref> Furthermore, we showed that viral loads are inversely correlated with disease severity. We believe that higher viral loads are seen in mild disease rather than severe disease, as they reflect the time from onset of infection. These findings are interesting when interpreted within our current knowledge of the natural history of COVID-19. Although many COVID-19 patients recover from their initial symptoms over the course of 14 to 21 days, a sizable proportion of patients show clinical deterioration to severe disease, which usually occurs a week after symptom onset.

 </xref> In the current study cohort, viral loads detected from nasopharyngeal sampling in patients requiring hospitalization (most of whom had severe or critical symptoms) were obtained at a later time point in the disease course. This fact is on par with prior studies demonstrating that longer disease duration is not necessarily associated with a higher viral load but rather a lower viral load.

 </xref> The results also show that patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms may represent the most important overlooked source of shedding given the higher viral load. We believe containment strategies can utilize quantitative viral loads to identify patients with high viral titers. In the hospital triage setting, the information from the viral load can be utilized to determine which patient would receive a negative pressure room. In the outpatient setting, clinicians can utilize viral load as a quantitative metric to reinforce the importance of self-isolation and face coverings to reduce the risk of spreading the infection.
