<p id="p0070">Moreover, studies thus far have not assessed the relationship between viral load and COVID-19 clinical outcomes. We showed that there was no significant association between viral load and clinical outcomes, including length of stay, oxygen support requirement, or survival. Interestingly, multiple publications have highlighted severe cases of COVID-19 with high morbidity occurring late in the disease process, suggesting that severe symptoms are likely unrelated to high viral titers.

 </xref> Instead, deterioration of patients seems to be related to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multisystem organ failure, related to immunologic hyperactivation, characterized by high levels of cytokines, like IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-Î±, lymphocyte activation, T-helper 17 differentiation, and concomitant severe lymphopenia, most likely due to activation-induced cell death.
