 </xref> found that patients with COVID-19 infections had upper respiratory viral load peaks within the first week of symptom development. Despite 100% seroconversion of the study cohort by day 14 and cessation of symptoms, patients continued to have active viral replication in upper respiratory tract tissue detectable by PCR. Although this study does not provide a temporal characterization of viremia in COVID-19 patients, significantly prolonged symptomatic interval/duration in patients with severe disease was observed. Conversely, patients with a shorter symptomatic interval present mild symptoms, as witnessed in the nonhospitalized patients in our cohort. Chen et al

 </xref> described the temporal progression of COVID-19 in 249 patients from Shanghai; the authors identified that ICU patients remained PCR positive and have a prolonged symptom interval/duration compared with non-ICU patients. Moreover, Liu et al

 </xref> showed that mild cases have significantly lower viral loads compared with severe cases. Nonetheless, in both studies, cohorts were composed solely of hospitalized patients, as opposed to the current study, which included both nonhospitalized and hospitalized patients.
