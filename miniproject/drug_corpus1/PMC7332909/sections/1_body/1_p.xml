<p id="p0015">To date, there are no studies investigating association between viral load with different clinical parameters and outcome in the US patient population. Herein, we sought to identify potential associations between viral load obtained from SARS-CoV-2â€“positive patients at the emergency department in a tertiary care center in New York City and its association with different clinical parameters. These parameters included severity of symptoms, disposition (admission versus direct discharge), length of hospitalization, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), length of need for oxygen support, and overall survival. We also sought to address whether certain comorbidities are associated with a higher viral load or not.</p>
