    "Covid-19 disease is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a virus belonging to the coronavirus family. Covid-19 is so new that there is currently no specific vaccine or treatment. Clinical trials are currently underway. InÂ vitro tests are also being conducted to assess the efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of this epidemic, which is considered a pandemic by the WHO. We note that the content of this review is dated. The information it contains is subject to change and modification as the epidemic progresses."
