<p id="p0020">The authors focus their attention on a high-risk gbMSM population who show the highest number of previous condomless sexual intercourses. In this population, the use of INSTIs is advisable not only to reduce HIV risk by dropping the time of HIV-RNA detectability (defined as HIV-RNA &gt; 200 cp/mL), but also by reducing the risk of potential drug–drug interaction with chem-sex compounds 
 <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The burden of drugs resistance to antiretrovirals is still the main cause of virologic failure, at least in developed countries. The impact of INSTI drug resistance within the first-line treatment is still very limited 
 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, thus this pharmacological class is potentially useful in all HIV-1-infected individuals who start their first ART.
