<p id="p0015">Although these data are sound, some potential pitfalls should be acknowledged to correctly interpret the findings reported by Zhu J et al. Firstly, the time span covered by the study is between 2011 and 2016 and only 376/1459 (25.8%) of the patients in the cohort started the treatment with and INSTI-based regimen. These findings are partially overcome by the widespread use of INSTIs in recent years due to the high efficacy, improved safety profile and, more recently, dolutegravir-based antiretroviral drug regimens implementation strategies in resource limited setting. Secondly, 46% of the patients started antiretroviral treatment with &lt;Â 350 CD4 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup>, reflecting the prescription recommendations followed until 2015, when the INSIGHT START trial demonstrated the incontrovertible beneficial effects of starting ART irrespectively of the CD4 cells count

In other words, the findings of the authors should be considered as confirmatory and add a strong scientific evidence to a change in the prescribing behaviour occurring in everyday clinical practice. Moreover, the study relies on the assumption that there are no changes in the behaviours of a newly infected PLWH. However, it could not be excluded that changes in the sexual behaviours after the diagnosis - due to extensive counselling and a novel risk perception - could impact on the risk of HIV transmission
