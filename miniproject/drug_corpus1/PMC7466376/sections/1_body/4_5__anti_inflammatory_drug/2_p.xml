<p>Other drugs that have been proposed against SARS-CoV-2 are JAK inhibitors that have been approved for myelofibrosis and rheumatoid arthritis such as ruxolitinib, fedratinib and baricitinib. These drugs are potent anti-inflammatories that may be useful against the effects of the elevated cytokine levels (including IFN-Î³) which are commonly present in people with COVID-19. They act by inhibiting the JAK-STAT signaling and even if the three of them have similar effects, the high affinity for AAK-1of baricitinib suggests that it is the best of the group. This is even potentiated since it can be orally given once a day having little side-effects. Furthermore, baricitinib may be combined with antivirals that act directly (lopinavir or ritonavir and Remdesivir) and which are now being tested in the COVID-19 epidemic, due to its reduced interaction with drugs that metabolize the CYP enzymes. Combinations of baricitinib with direct-acting antivirals could diminish viral replication, viral infectivity and the anormal host inflammatory response [
