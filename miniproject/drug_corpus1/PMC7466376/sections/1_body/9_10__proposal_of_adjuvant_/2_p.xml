<p>In a study by our group, still in the process of being published, we saw that the use of antioxidants showed a statistically significant improvement in patients with pulmonary sepsis. Oxidative stress is elevated during critical illness and the oxidative damage participates in organ failure. The administration of glutamine or antioxidant vitamins, given in the nutritional support or as separate medications during prophylaxis may attenuate OS [
