<p>Chloroquine suppresses the entrance of viruses into host cells and inhibits glycosylation of viral proteins [
 <xref rid="B47-medicina-56-00386" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Chloroquine was effective in decreasing viral replication, in a concentration (EC) 90 of 6.90 Î¼M that is reached with the common dosing of this drug, since it easily penetrates in tissues, such as the lung [

Chloroquine blocks viral infection by alkalinizing the endosomal pH in the phagolysosome and by blocking the glycosylation of cellular receptor of SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-1A also has a pH-dependent mechanism of entering to target cells after its union to the DC-SIGN receptor. The activation that occurs in the acidic pH endosomes leads to fusion of the virus to the endosomal membranes leading to the liberation of its genome to the cytosol. When there is no antiviral drug, the virus is conducted to the lysosomes where there is an acidic pH which together with the activity of enzymes destroys the viruses, releasing the nucleic acid and the required enzymes for replication [
