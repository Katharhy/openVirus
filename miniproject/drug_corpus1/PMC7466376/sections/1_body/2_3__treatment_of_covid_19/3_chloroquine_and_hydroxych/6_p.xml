<p>Chloroquine also diminishes the activity of the enzyme quinone reductase 2, which is a structural neighbor of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase [
 <xref rid="B54-medicina-56-00386" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], that participates in the sialic acid biosynthesis. This acid is an acidic monosaccharide located at the end of sugar chains that are located on cell transmembrane proteins that participate in ligand recognition. When chloroquine interferes with the biosynthesis of sialic acid could be responsible for the broad antiviral spectrum of that drug since some viruses use sialic acid residues as receptors such as the orthomyxoviruses and the human coronavirus HCoV-O43 [
