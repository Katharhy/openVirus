<p>In the present global infection of SARS-CoV-2, treatment with hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, resulted in 100% of patients that were virologically cured in contrast with only 57.1% of subjects treated with hydroxychloroquine alone and 12.5% with the control group. It was therefore concluded that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine should be used in patients suffering from pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2.</p>
