<p>Chloroquine also alters the immune system functioning through activation of cell signaling and pro-inflammatory cytokine control [
 <xref rid="B49-medicina-56-00386" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Chloroquine suppresses phosphorylation of caspase-1 and of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in THP-1 cells. Activation of cells via mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling is necessary for the viruses to replicate. In the model of HCoV-229 coronavirus, chloroquine inhibited the virus by suppression of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Moreover, chloroquine reduced IL-1β release and diminished interleukin IL-1β mRNA expression in THP-1 cells. Chloroquine also decreased IL-6 and IL-1 in monocytes and macrophages [

The drug also suppresses IL-6, IL-12, TNF-α, IFN-α, β and γ and may interfere with the ACE2 the glycosylation of the receptor, thus suppressing the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 to target cells [
