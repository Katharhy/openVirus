<p>Given that there is a lack of a vaccine against this virus, a two-phase combined therapy strategy is required. The first phase is aimed to lower the viral load that is the source and origin of the chronic inflammatory condition leading to severe sepsis and multiple organ failure. The uncontrolled inflammatory condition might be decreased by the use of antioxidants. The second phase is aimed to reduce the sepsis condition, thereby reducing multiple organ failure. Since the two phases converge simultaneously, the therapy strategy should be selected avoiding subsequent collateral damage for the patient.</p>
