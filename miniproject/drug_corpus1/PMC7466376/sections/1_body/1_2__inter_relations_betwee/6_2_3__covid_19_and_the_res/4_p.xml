<p>The synthesis and liberation into the blood stream of extrathyroidal procalcitonin is increased during bacterial infections and is maintained by IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α. Procalcitonin is a mediator in the systemic inflammatory response syndrome which is a well-known characteristic of multi-organ failure, septic shock and severe sepsis [

Therefore, procalcitonin value is sustained within the normal levels in patients with SARS-CoV-2 non-complicated infection and its elevation may indicate bacterial co-infection in patients developing the severe form of the disease [
