<p>In COVID-19, there is a decreased lymphocyte count, elevated leukocyte count and neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio and lower percentages of basophils, eosinophils and monocytes. Severe cases usually have high levels of inflammatory cytokines and of biomarkers related to infection and the number of T lymphocytes CD3+ and CD4+ were significantly decreased and were more hampered in severe cases. This suggests, a deregulated immune system but no important change in CD8+ and B cells. Cytokines and chemokines importantly participate in immunopathology and immunity during viral infections [

SARS-CoV-2 may have direct cytopathic effects and may lead to evasion of host immune responses which play a major role in the severity of COVID-19. The first line of defense against viral infections is a rapid and regulated innate immune response; however, when the immune response is uncoordinated, it will result in an excessive inflammation which may even cause death [
