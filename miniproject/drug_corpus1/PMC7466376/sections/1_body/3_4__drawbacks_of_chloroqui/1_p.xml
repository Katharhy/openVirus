<p>Cardiovascular side effects, particularly prolongation of the QT interval in the electrocardiogram and hypotension have been found with the use of several quinolines and other structurally related antimalarial drugs. A prolongation of the QT interval is a non-specific biomarker of risk for the development of Torsade de Pointe which may turn into potentially lethal polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Therefore, there is a need to review the cardiovascular safety of quinoline and other structurally related antimalarials when used massively during a pandemic.</p>
