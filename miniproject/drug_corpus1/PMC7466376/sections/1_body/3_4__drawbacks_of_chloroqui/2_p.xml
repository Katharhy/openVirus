<p>There are currently several clinical trials registered on the effects of the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. There is a Clinical Trial in which these drugs will be used in combination with others. However, even if it is true that we are in an emergency to combat COVID-19, we must always keep in mind that the cause of death may be due to other factors that are associated with treatment in addition to the infection by the virus.
