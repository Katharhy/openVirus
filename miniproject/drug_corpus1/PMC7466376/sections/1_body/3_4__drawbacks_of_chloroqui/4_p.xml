<p>Myocardial inflammation and fibrosis could be related to rhythm disorders having different underlying pathophysiology. Cardiomyocyte necrosis can be caused by inflammatory processes and oxidative stress that lead to structural remodeling. Moreover, chronic inflammation links autoimmune disease to autonomic dysfunction that includes sympathetic over-activation and a decrease in parasympathetic function. Cardiac arrhythmia may also be caused by autoantibody-mediated inhibition of type 2 muscarinic cholinergic receptors, Î²1-adrenergic receptor signaling potassium or L-type calcium currents. In autoimmune disease patients, drug-induced arrhythmias, caused by chloroquine, methotrexate and corticosteroids may also appear [
