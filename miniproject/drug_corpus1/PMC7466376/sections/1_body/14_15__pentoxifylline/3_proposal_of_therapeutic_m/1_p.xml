<p>The design of the study testing the usefulness of antioxidants as an adjuvant in the treatment of COVID-19 must be non-randomized regarding the use of each of the antioxidants, which may or may not be used with pentoxifylline. Its concomitant use may or may not be added to the use of macrolides, hydroxychloroquines or antivirals in the standard dose. The decision must be based on the baseline comorbid condition of the patient infected with SARS-Cov-2 and medications used for chronic diseases at the time of admission. To do this, a therapeutic decision tree and an individualized management algorithm for each patient must be carried out. 
 <xref rid="medicina-56-00386-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> describes the proposal algorithm for therapeutic management with antioxidants for COVID-19 patients.
