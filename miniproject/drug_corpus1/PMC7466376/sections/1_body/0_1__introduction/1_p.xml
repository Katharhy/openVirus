<p>In December 2019 there was an outbreak of a novel disease called Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus consists of a positive-sense single-stranded RNA surrounded by a membrane in which proteins are inserted. It is a variant of the SARS-CoV-1 with which it shares 82% of the genome sequence and of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) with a 50% genome sequence homology [
 <xref rid="B1-medicina-56-00386" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The RNA genome codes for non-structural and structural proteins. It codifies for four groups of proteins—(1) viral envelope proteins (E) that include the spike structural glycoprotein (S) with prominent projections on the surface and which is crucial for virus attachment to the host and determines tropism and transmission capacity [
 <xref rid="B2-medicina-56-00386" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], the nucleocapsid (N) protein which determines the shape of the viral particle and binds to the nucleocapsid [
 <xref rid="B3-medicina-56-00386" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and the matrix protein (M) which helps in the RNA binding to the host transcription complex participating in viral replication [
 <xref rid="B4-medicina-56-00386" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], (2) proteases nsp3 and nsp5, (3) a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) which is a non-structural protein that increases the rate of replication of RNA from templates [
 <xref rid="B5-medicina-56-00386" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and (4) a set of 4 or more 3′ conterminal sub-genomic mRNAs which are a replicase whose genes are composed of two overlapping open reading frames [
 <xref rid="B5-medicina-56-00386" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The ability of this virus and other coronaviruses to mutate makes them zoonotic pathogens of concern since it facilitates the transmission between animals and humans [
 <xref rid="B6-medicina-56-00386" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The evolutionary analysis of the virus shows that the SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the isolated Bat coronavirus RaTG13 (GenBank No.MN996532), with 96.2% nucleotide homology in the whole genome [
 <xref rid="B7-medicina-56-00386" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and therefore, this virus might have evolved from the bat coronavirus. The infection by this virus started in Hubei, in the city of Wuhan, in China and rapidly spread throughout this country and the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) ranked it as a world pandemic in March.
