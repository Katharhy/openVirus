<p>Corticosteroids are commonly employed in septic shock even if there exists uncertainty about their efficiency. Most patients in septic shock trials also show bacterial infection that results in myocardial insufficiency and vasoplegic shock. However, invasive ventilation results in elevated intrathoracic pressure, which results in shock in severe hypoxemic respiratory failure and impairs the filling of the heart and not vasoplegia. Therefore, the treatment using corticosteroid should not be employed for lung injury induced by SARS-CoV-2 [
