<p>In clinical trials, supplementation with a bolus of 150 mg/kg NAC followed by 50 mg/kg/day of NAC for 4 days in patients with acute lung injury ALI or ARDS improved the oxygenation rate from the first to the fourth day and reduced mortality. However, it had no effect on mechanical ventilation time [

The hemodynamic effect on biomarkers of inflammation in patients with septic shock and NAC treatment in a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials have been evaluated. The results showed that NAC treatment improved oxygenation, static lung compliance, decreased levels of IL-8 and soluble TNF-Î±-receptor p55. A shorter mechanical ventilation time and shorter stay in the ICU was found in patients treated with NAC [
