<p>The NAC effect on hepatic blood flow, hepatosplenic oxygen transport and liver function in patients with early-stage septic shock was evaluated in another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that showed the authors found that hepatosplenic flow and liver function improved after the NAC infusion and this was secondary to the increase in the cardiac index [

Another study evaluated the levels of microalbuminuria and organic dysfunction in patients with severe sepsis after the administration of NAC 50 mg/kg/4 h followed by 100 mg/kg/24 h. Microalbuminuria levels were similar in both groups and the NAC group showed an increase in the SOFA score, particularly cardiovascular failure [
