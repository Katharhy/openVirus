<p>Immune system hyperreaction was also described in the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic, which was the first known pandemic to report an excess risk of death among individuals 25–35 years old [

Although cytokines storms seem to be induced by both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, given the early stage in our understanding regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection, to conclude that the immunomodulatory or immune suppressive effects of these two viruses are highly similar might be premature, few studies proved that influenza aggravated the pulmonary status of individuals with TB so that latent TB could become active, a closed cavity might open, and various lesions might progress, leading to further deterioration of pulmonary function [

In this regard, a mouse coronavirus model demonstrated the ability to reactivate dormant MTB from CD271 + mesenchymal stem cells through the altruistic stem cell-based defense mechanism, predicting a potential increase of TB in SARS-CoV-2 era. Additionally, in a cohort of 49 patients with active TB and COVID-19, the diagnosis of COVID-19 preceded or was simultaneous (within seven days) with TB in 23 patients, raising the suspicion that SARS-CoV-2 infection might boost the development of active TB. However, this remains purely speculative as individuals with latent TB infection were not followed up over time [
