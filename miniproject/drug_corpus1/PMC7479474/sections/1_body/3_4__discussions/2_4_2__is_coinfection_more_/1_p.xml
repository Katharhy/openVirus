<p>Although the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 is not fully understood, it seems most likely similar to the one of SARS-CoV-1. Substantial evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection could initiate an aggressive inflammation by increasing cytokines secretion such as interleukin-1
 <italic>β</italic> (IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>), interferon-
 <italic>γ</italic> (IFN-
 <italic>γ</italic>), tumor necrosis factor-
 <italic>α</italic> (TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>), interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-4 (IL-4), and interleukin-10 (IL-10), their plasma levels being associated with disease severity, leading to a so-called “
 <italic>cytokine storm</italic>,” thus explaining some young adults' disease severity [
