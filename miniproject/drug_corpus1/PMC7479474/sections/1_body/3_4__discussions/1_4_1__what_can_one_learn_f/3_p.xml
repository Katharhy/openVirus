<p>Its high transmissibility rate reminds of the 1918-19 influenza pandemic when it has been estimated that almost a third of the world's population is affected with a mortality rate of 2.5% [

One of the most notable is that death was less frequent amidst healthcare workers in influenza pandemics as it was the case in SARS, MERS, and now COVID-19 pandemic [

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Also, it has been suggested that influenza viruses, as well as SARS-CoV-2, significantly upregulate angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. This upregulation facilitates novel coronavirus entrance into the host cell and makes patients infected by influenza more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
