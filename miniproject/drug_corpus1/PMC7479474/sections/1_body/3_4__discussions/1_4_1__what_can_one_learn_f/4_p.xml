<p>Some studies have shown that, in a patient with TB, induction of type I interferons (IFNs) determined by influenza infection could be detrimental [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], impeding the immune-competent host's ability to limit bacterial replication. Thus it promotes the infection [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and precipitates TB mortality rate (pneumonia and influenza death rates among the age group most affected by TB exceeded in 1918 the TB mortality rate noted before and after the pandemic) [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Higher TB death rates were noted in winter months (coinciding with seasonal influenza outbreaks), which led to the suggestion of PTB being an independent risk factor for influenza-associated mortality [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In contrast, few studies suggested no association between influenza coinfection and PTB's progression or severity [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. One murine model demonstrated that although influenza infection increased the IFN-
 <italic>Î³</italic> secretion, it had little effect on bacterial load in chronically infected mice with BCG [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Half of the analytical studies included in a recent systematic review showed no evidence on influenza affecting PTB presentation or its outcomes or, conversely, PTB affecting influenza presentation and outcomes [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Nevertheless, the magnitude of TB burden in a given setting might be an essential factor that should be considered in any study regarding PTB because its results might be biased [
