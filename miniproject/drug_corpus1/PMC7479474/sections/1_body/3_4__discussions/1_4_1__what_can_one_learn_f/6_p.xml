<p>TB in SARS patients has been reported in several studies from TB endemic countries such as Singapore, China, or Taiwan [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], all with known TB patients that acquired SARS and in individuals that developed TB after recovery from SARS [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The transient immunosuppression characterized both conditions [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], a reason for poorer IgG antibody response and a delayed viral clearance in coinfected SARS patients [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Also, the use of corticoid therapy in SARS added even more on immunosuppression [
