<p>Tuberculin skin test (TST) and with a greater sensibility and specificity, the interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) are widely used for TB screening [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Given their results are influenced by the host's immune response after MTB (or BCG) exposure [
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], there is a gap for diagnostic errors in individuals with an impaired immune system, such as in a concurrent severe infection [

 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Increased age, low peripheral lymphocyte count, high body mass index, and immunosuppressive therapies were also associated with false-negative results [
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] that could lead to missing TB diagnose. Moreover, an excess of inflammatory markers could affect IGRAs sensitivity, and the high value of C-reactive protein (CRP) might be a confounder for false-negative results [
