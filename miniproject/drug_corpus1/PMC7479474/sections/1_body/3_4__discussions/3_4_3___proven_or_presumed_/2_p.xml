<p>Since 1921 a vaccine is used widely for TB prevention, a live-attenuated strain of the bovine tubercle bacillus named bacillus Calmetteâ€“Guerin (BCG) [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In 1927, it was observed that BCG-vaccinated newborns had a three times lower mortality rate in their first year of life than the unvaccinated ones [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Later was noted a decrease in infectious morbidities, protecting both mice (against secondary fungal or parasitic infections with 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> or 
 <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> through tissue macrophages activation) [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and infants (against acute lower respiratory infections). Thus, the risk of acute lower respiratory infections in BCG-vaccinated infants seemed to be 37% lower than in unvaccinated controls among children &lt;5 years old [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. However, there seem to be no proven data regarding the duration of these beneficial effects [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], and there is data suggesting that subsequent administration of different vaccines was associated with altering the nonspecific immunity [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], so one might safely presume that the chance of a BCG vaccine received decades ago in childhood could influence the course of one pandemic in adulthood which would be low.
