<p>The electronic database of PubMed was systematically searched for relevant articles from the inception until March 2020. The search terms used were [“
 <italic>tuberculosis</italic>” OR “TB”], AND [“
 <italic>flu</italic>” OR “
 <italic>influenza</italic>”], AND [“
 <italic>SARS</italic>” OR “
 <italic>SARS-CoV</italic>” OR “
 <italic>SARS-CoV-1</italic>”], AND 
 <italic>MERS-CoV</italic>. The search process included article identification, removing the duplicates, screening titles and abstracts, and assessing eligibility of the selected full texts. Additionally, reference lists of valid articles were checked for studies of relevance. Articles were included if they involved data about past TB, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV epidemics, TB-influenza viruses, and TB-SARS-CoV-1 coinfections or clinical or laboratory research on the immune responses during coinfections. Journal articles published with full text or abstracts in English were eligible for inclusion.
