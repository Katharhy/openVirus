<p>Articles were exported from CORD-19 and merged locally for further processing. Articles of interest were retrieved by administering the query “COVID” OR “COVID-19” OR “2019-nCoV” OR “SARS-CoV-2” OR “Novel coronavirus” OR “Tuberculosis” OR “
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>” OR “Flu” OR “Influenza” OR “Coinfection” OR “Vaccine” OR “Immunization.” Data mining was further applied to select only articles that met our topics of interest about coinfections between particular pathogens stated earlier and COVID-19 developing vaccines. The study selection process and number of papers identified in each phase are illustrated in the flowchart (
