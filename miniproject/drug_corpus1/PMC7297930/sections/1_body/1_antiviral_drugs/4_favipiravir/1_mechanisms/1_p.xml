Based on the anticipated synergistic effect of viral inhibition and immune enhancement, a randomized control trial (THDMS-COVID-19) combining various regimens including protease inhibitors, oseltamivir, favipiravir, and hydroxychloroquine was initiated to test whether the cocktail formula is effective for treating COVID-19 [
