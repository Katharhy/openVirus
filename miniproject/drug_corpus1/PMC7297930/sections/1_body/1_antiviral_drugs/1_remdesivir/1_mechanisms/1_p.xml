<p id="Par3">By reducing viral replication and binding to the active site on RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2, remdesivir has been viewed as one of the most potentially effective regimens [

Currently, Gilead Sciences is launching several clinical trials to evaluate its effect in patients with moderate or severe COVID-19 compared with those treated with standard care. On April 10, 2020, the company announced it was expanding the enrolled number and changing the end points and subsequently released the preliminary report in the

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Of 53 patients who received at least one dose of remdesivir, 36 (68%) had improved oxygen support, including 17 of 30 patients (57%) receiving mechanical ventilation who were extubated during a median follow-up of 18Â days. A total of 25 patients (47%) were discharged, and 7 (13%) died. Overall, the mortality was 18% (6 of 34) among patients who received invasive ventilation and 5% (1 of 19) among those who did not. Although 68% of the patients demonstrated clinical improvements, the major weakness of this study was a lack of placebo and the non-randomized study design. Further investigation is urgently required.
