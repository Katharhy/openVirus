<p id="Par9">Ritonavir/lopinavir, a combination drug also called Kaletra, was approved in USA in 2000 to treat HIV infection [

With the capability to inhibit the protease of HIV, an important enzyme that cleaves a long protein chain into peptides during the assembly of new viruses, ritonavir/lopinavir may also be able to bind SARS-CoV-2 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) and consequently suppress its replication [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar. However, the authors indicated that the overall mortality in this trial (22.1%) was substantially higher than the 11 to 14.5% mortality reported in initial descriptive studies of hospitalized patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 [

Several ongoing trials continue to investigate the therapeutic effects of ritonavir/lopinavir on SARS-CoV-2 [
