<p id="Par10">Lopinavir is extensively metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 system, almost exclusively by CYP3A [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. It also inhibits drug transporters such as P-gp, BCRP, and OATP1B1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Thus, ritonavir/lopinavir is prone to increase plasma concentrations of medications primarily metabolized by CYP3A or substrates of these drug transporters. Ritonavir/lopinavir may require dose reductions or avoidance of CYP3A-mediated drugs such as rivaroxaban and apixaban. Ritonavir/lopinavir can also influence the activity of P2Y12 inhibitors through CYP3A4 inhibition, which results in decreased serum concentrations of the active metabolites of clopidogrel and prasugrel and increased serum concentrations of ticagrelor. The VerifyNow P2Y12 assay may be used to monitor the effect of antiplatelet agents [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Other agents metabolized by CYP3A are statins. Among them, rosuvastatin undergoes minimal metabolism by CYP450, so no CYP450-based interaction with lopinavir/ritonavir is expected. Otherwise, atorvastatin, pravastatin, and pitavastatin can also be considered at a low starting dose.
