<p id="Par23">HCQ has an inhibitory effect on the funny current channels (
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>f</sub>), a hyperpolarization-activated current ion channel, along with delayed rectifier potassium currents (
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>Kr</sub>) and L-type calcium ion currents (
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>CaL</sub>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. By blocking these channels, HCQ causes QT prolongation and should be avoided with concomitant QT-prolonging medications such as azithromycin, metabolic derangements, and renal failure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Of note, hydroxychloroquine has a long half-life of 40 days [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. ECG monitoring is recommended during this therapy. HCQ also has the potential for intermediate to delayed myocardial toxicity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Prolonged exposure (&gt; 3 months) or a higher weight-based dose of HCQ may cause restrictive or dilated cardiomyopathy, especially in patients with preexisting cardiac disease or renal failure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. On April 11, 2020, the 
 <italic>Wall Street Journal</italic> reported that since March 27, the Pharmacovigilance Center in Nice, France, received up to 54 cases developing cardiovascular complications post-hydroxychloroquine use for the treatment of COVID-19 [
