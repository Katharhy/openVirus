<p id="Par21">Hydroxychloroquine has actions, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism similar to those of chloroquine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. As an anti-malarial and anti-autoimmune agent, by sequestering protons in lysosomes, HCQ increases the intracellular pH in antigen-presenting cells, which is required for virus/cell fusion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. It was also shown to suppress the replication of SARS-CoV by interfering with the glycosylation of its cellular receptor ACE2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Recent in vitro testing revealed its ability to effectively reduce the viral copy number of SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Several small-scale clinical trials demonstrated various degrees of therapeutic effects of HCQ for treating COVID-19-associated pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. A small open-label non-randomized clinical trial in France demonstrated a positive effect of HCQ in combination with azithromycin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Upon this finding, although the US FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization for hydroxychloroquine in treating COVID-19, the trial design has been questioned. Most importantly, a high dose of HCQ could cause serious toxicities including cardiomyopathy and fatal arrhythmia [
