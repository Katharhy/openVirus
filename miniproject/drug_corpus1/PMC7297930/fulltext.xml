COVID-19 significantly affects multiple systems including the cardiovascular system. Most importantly, in addition to the direct injury from the virus per se, the subsequent cytokine storm, an overproduction of immune cells and their activating compounds, causes devastating damage. To date, emerging anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatments are warranted to control epidemics. Several candidate drugs have been screened and are currently under investigation. These primarily include antiviral regimens and immunomodulatory regimens. However, beyond the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects, these drugs may also have risks to the cardiovascular system, especially altering cardiac conduction. Herein, we review the cardiovascular risks of potential anti-COVID-19 drugs.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>Potential cardiotoxicity</kwd><kwd>Complications</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Although there are lacking drugs evident for treating Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), scientists remain attempting to identify those with therapeutic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].

Ritonavir/lopinavir may require dose reductions or avoidance of CYP3A-mediated drugs such as rivaroxaban and apixaban. Ritonavir/lopinavir can also influence the activity of P2Y12 inhibitors through CYP3A4 inhibition, which results in decreased serum concentrations of the active metabolites of clopidogrel and prasugrel and increased serum concentrations of ticagrelor.

Most importantly, given that patients affected by this disease commonly have cardiovascular comorbidities, a careful evaluation of the possible cardiovascular complications of these drugs is crucial. Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> summarizes the updated drugs with anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential, pharmacologic mechanisms, preliminary results of studies, ongoing clinical trials, drug metabolism, and the possible cardiovascular complications. Most of the drugs are based on repurposing therapeutic agents previously designed for other applications. These agents can be divided into two categories, including those with antiviral or immune-modulating effects. We reviewed several drugs with updated information until the middle April 2020. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows that among the aforementioned drugs, remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin, and interferon-&#x003b2;1 have been less reported with cardiovascular complications. We believe that this review provides additional cardiovascular concerns along with the aggressive exploration of candidate drugs with anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The cardiovascular risks of potential anti-COVID-19 drugs</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Drugs</th><th>Pharmacologic mechanism</th><th>Evidences of anti-COVID-19</th><th>FDA approved Indications</th><th>Clinical trials for COVID-19<sup>#</sup></th><th>CV drug interactions</th><th>Cardiovascular risks</th><th>Other organ toxicity</th><th>Ref.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="9">Anti-viral drugs</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;&#x000a0;Remdesivir</td><td>A nucleotide prodrug, transforming to adenosine analogue, causing RNA pre-mature termination and inhibiting viral replication</td><td>&#x02022; Reducing viral copy numbers in SARS-CoV-2 and binding to the active site on RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2</td><td>RSV, Junin virus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, and research on Ebola virus</td><td><p>NCT04302766</p><p>NCT04280705</p><p>&#x02022; NCT04292730; NCT04292899*</p></td><td>A substrate of CYP2C8, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and transporters OATP1B1 and P-gp but due to rapid distribution, metabolism and clearance, drug interaction is minimal.</td><td>CV toxicity has yet to be reported</td><td>Liver toxicity (rare)</td><td>14, 15, 17, 73</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;&#x000a0;Atazanavir</td><td>An analog of the peptide chain substrate binding to the active site HIV protease and preventing the pro-form of viral proteins cleaving into the working form.</td><td>Binding to SARS-CoV-2 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro); Atazanavir inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication and pro-inflammatory cytokine in vitro experiments</td><td>HIV</td><td>Not yet lunched</td><td>An inhibitor of CYP3A4, UGT1A1, CYP2C8, and OATP1B1</td><td>Dose-dependent PR and QTc prolongations</td><td>Liver toxicity</td><td>21&#x02013;24</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;&#x000a0;Ritonavir/lopinavir</td><td>A nucleoside analogue <italic>and</italic> protease inhibitor of HIV; SARS, MERS?</td><td>Binding to SARS-CoV-23C-like proteinase (3CLpro); Though no significant benefits in clinical improvement and mortality in a randomized clinical trial (ChiCTR2000029308)</td><td>HPV; HIV</td><td><p>NCT04252885</p><p>NCT04275388</p><p>NCT04276688</p><p>NCT04286503</p><p>NCT02845843</p><p>NCT04307693</p><p>NCT04261907</p><p>NCT04295551</p><p>NCT00578825</p></td><td>Inhibitors of CYP3A and drug transporters such as P-gp, BCRP, and OATP1B1</td><td>PR/QTc prolongation; rare reports of 2nd or 3rd degree AVB; lopinavir/ritonavir; decreased serum concentrations of clopidogrel and prasugrel but increase statins, ticagrelor, rivaroxaban, and apixaban</td><td>Liver toxicity, pancreatitis, GI upset, neurotoxicity</td><td>22, 26, 28, 29, 33, 42, 73</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;&#x000a0;Favipiravir</td><td>A selective inhibition of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase</td><td>Suppressing viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2; in vitro?</td><td>Influenza viruses, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus, foot-and-mouth disease virus</td><td><p>NCT04303299 (THDMS-COVID-19); NCT04310228;</p><p>ChiCTR2000029600 (plus IFN-&#x003b1;)</p></td><td>Only a weak inhibitor of CYPs 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4</td><td>Minimal clinically significant drug interactions</td><td>Not reported</td><td>34&#x02013;38</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;&#x000a0;Ribavirin</td><td>A nucleoside inhibitor, stopping viral RNA synthesis and mRNA capping</td><td>Binding to the active site on RNA polymerase on SARS-CoV-2; in vitro?</td><td>HCV, RSV and some viral hemorrhagic fevers</td><td>NCT04276688</td><td>No report of cytochrome P450 enzyme mediated metabolism of ribavirin.</td><td>Ribavirin has no characterized direct CV toxicity; ribavirin has variable effects on warfarin dosing</td><td>Liver toxicity, hematologic disorder</td><td>40, 43, 44</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;&#x000a0;Ivermectin</td><td>An influx of Cl&#x02212; ions through the cell membrane of invertebrates by activation of specific ivermectin-sensitive ion channels.</td><td>Inhibiting the nuclear transport activity of SARS-CoV-2; currently on in vitro study</td><td>Head lice, scabies, strongyloidiasis, trichuriasis, ascariasis, and lymphatic filariasis</td><td>Not yet lunched</td><td>An inducer of several cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, including CYP1A, 2B, and 3A</td><td>Tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, PR interval prolongation</td><td>Dermatitis, GI upset</td><td>4, 45&#x02013;51</td></tr><tr><td colspan="9">Immune-modulating drugs</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;&#x000a0;Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)</td><td>Sequestering protons in lysosomes to increase the intracellular pH; interfering with the glycosylation of its cellular receptor, ACE2; reduce the viral copy number of SARS-CoV-2.</td><td>Reducing viral copy numbers in SARS-CoV-2; Under debates between China and France?</td><td>Anti-malaria.
