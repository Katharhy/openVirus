<p>Replacement of a resident influenza subtype by a new pandemic virus within a year or two of pandemic virus emergence, as occurred during the 1957 and 1968 pandemics, provides strong population-level evidence for broadly protective immunity induced by one subtype and protective against another subtype (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008583.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Replacement signals competition between influenza A subtypes in human populations, likely mediated by heterosubtypic cross-immunity. Various heterosubtypic cross-protective immune mechanisms likely act in combination (e.g. B cell or T cell mediated) and their impact on infection, disease, and transmission remains difficult to untangle [

Harnessing broadly cross-protective immune mechanisms is critical for the development of universal influenza vaccines, and dissecting their effects over a lifetime of influenza exposures in large populations will help guide the development and implementation of universal influenza vaccines. Below, we review broadly protective immune mechanisms in detail, their putative population profiles, and their expected impact on disease dynamics.
