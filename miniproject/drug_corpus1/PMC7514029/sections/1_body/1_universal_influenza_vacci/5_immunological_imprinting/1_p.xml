<p>Here, we use the term immunological imprinting to refer to the theory that influenza exposures early in life shape and limit future immune responses to influenza infection; by this definition, imprinting is related to birth year. This concept originated in 1960, when Thomas Francis coined the term”Original Antigenic Sin” (OAS) to describe how the first influenza infection “governs the response to vaccination with other strains” [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008583.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). The theory of antigenic seniority is a variation on OAS, in which there is a hierarchy of immune responses to viruses encountered during a lifetime, with the first virus generating the highest antibody titers compared to viruses seen later in life [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The theories of antigenic sin and seniority have been primarily developed to interpret antibody responses to variable epitopes on the head of the H3 HA [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The concepts of imprinting, OAS, antigenic seniority, and back-boosting all relate to the unique consequences of early life exposures. The mechanisms behind immune imprinting and even the existence of OAS are being actively debated [
