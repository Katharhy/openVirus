<p>The HA stem is a relevant region of the influenza virus for vaccine purposes because it is conserved across different influenza subtypes that infect host species that may be sources of new pandemic variants. To date, 16 antigenically distinct HA subtypes (H1-H16) have been identified in wild birds, the reservoir of influenza viruses. Based upon HA stem sequences, HAs segregate phylogenetically into two major groups: Group 1 includes the human seasonal H1 and avian H5 subtypes, as well as the H2 subtype that circulated in humans during 1957–68, while group 2 includes the human seasonal H3 and avian H7 strains (

Monoclonal antibodies specific to the HA stem and present in the serum of influenza-infected individuals are usually group specific but may not bind all virus strains within a group. Rare antibodies have also been identified that bind to both group 1 and group 2 viruses [
