<p>Computational models can be useful to test the plausibility of various imprinting mechanisms given a set of surveillance observations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008583.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Testable hypotheses include whether there is evidence of lifelong immune protection at the HA group level or narrower protection at the level of the HA or NA subtype. Another question of interest is whether HA imprinting is stronger for group 1 or group 2 viruses. A number of studies have started to confront these immunologic scenarios by analyzing influenza surveillance data stratified by birth year and virus subtype [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The early life influenza exposure of each birth cohort is reconstructed probabilistically, based on information on influenza circulation since 1918. Critical breakpoints in these studies are the pandemic years of 1957, 1968, and 1977, which signal the beginning of new influenza exposure histories for cohorts born in distinct influenza eras. Reconstruction of exposure histories after 1977 is more complicated due to cocirculation of H1N1 and H3N2 viruses since that time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008583.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Detailed information on the intensity of H1 and H3 epidemics each year in various locations is important to accurately model exposure histories but difficult to obtain.
