<p>In addition to modeling of population-level surveillance data, mechanistic models can guide interpretation of immunologic data collected from prospective cohort studies or cross-sectional surveys [

Existing research has primarily focused on interpretation of serologic markers, through the lens of hemagglutination inhibition titers, to determine cross-reactivity between antibody responses to different influenza strains (see profile of HA antibody titers throughout a lifetime of exposure in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008583.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). In the future, modeling approaches could be applied to a broader range of biologic markers that are becoming available to fully capture the specificity of the immune profile of different birth cohorts. Analysis of somatic hypermutation in cohorts of varying birth years and ages could help define the changing effect of immune imprinting over the human life span [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Birth year analyses of T-cell responses would provide a better sense of the role of cellular immunity in imprinting. Mathematical models are useful to interpret immunological markers because they can incorporate measurement errors that affect biological assays [

For instance, the hemagglutination inhibition test is prone to measurement errors and repeatability issues, and to be conservative, a 4-fold rise over baseline is typically defined as evidence of infection. Because of this strict definition, a fraction of true infections may be missed. In a Vietnamese cohort study, a “data-augmentation” approach was applied to reconstruct the distribution of unobserved infections, given a set of hemagglutinin inhibition titers in a large population and repeat serology in a subset of individuals [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The analysis showed that a fraction of individuals with a weak (2-fold) rise in titers could not be explained by measurement error alone and that applying a strict 4-fold criteria would underestimate attack rates [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Modeling of serologic data is an active area of influenza modeling research; it is expected to contribute to our understanding of the build-up of population immunity over a lifetime of exposure.
