<p>Despite decades of research, influenza immunity remains a complex topic about which we only have a limited understanding. Influenza A subtypes are classified based on their surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), with influenza H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2 having circulated in humans since the 1918 pandemic (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008583.g001">Fig 1</xref> for a timeline of antigen circulation). Individuals are exposed to a variety of influenza strains throughout life, while periodic cycling of influenza subtypes and strains shapes the immune response of different birth cohorts. Similarly to many other pathogens, influenza attack rates are highest in immunologically naïve children [

Although older individuals experience greater rates of hospitalization and death than the young during seasonal influenza epidemics, older individuals tend to be less affected during pandemics because their immune systems have often already seen similar viruses in childhood. This phenomenon of “senior sparing” was observed in individuals aged 50 years and over during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, prompting the theory that exposure to related H1N1 viruses in childhood may have conferred long-lasting protective immunity [
