<p>School-age children are considered high-transmitter groups for influenza, due to high susceptibility to influenza, increased contacts, and long duration of viral shedding [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Hence, large-scale pediatric immunization programs have the potential to provide herd immunity benefits to all age groups, including seniors who fail to mount a robust immune response to vaccination [

Given the importance of children for vaccination programs, a key area for computational modeling in the coming years will be to extract signals of imprinting in surveillance data to determine whether imprinting primarily results from a child’s first, or first few, natural infection(s). A related question is whether the negative consequences of imprinting, if any, can be overcome later in life by subsequent infections or vaccinations. Longitudinal birth cohort studies will be particularly informative to compare the development of immune responses between children in high and low vaccination settings [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Another important question is whether development of broadly cross-protective immunity is impaired in vaccinated infants, compared to unvaccinated infants whose first exposure to influenza is via natural infection. Findings might in turn lead to strategies that promote development of a long-lasting broadly protective immunity among infants and children through universal influenza vaccines. However, the difficulty of such analyses should not be underestimated; large, high-quality data sets collected over several decades would be necessary to detect what may be small differences in the strength of imprinting protection between cohorts of vaccinated and unvaccinated children. On the other hand, influenza attack rates are high in children, which may help identify a signal of protection more quickly than in vaccine studies focused on adults. Although rapid age de-escalation of Phase II and III studies would increase power to detect protection, there is a trade-off with the need for careful monitoring of safety signals in these vulnerable populations.
