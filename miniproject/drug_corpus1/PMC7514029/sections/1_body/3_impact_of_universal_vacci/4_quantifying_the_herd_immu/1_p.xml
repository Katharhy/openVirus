<p>Herd immunity is an important consideration for any vaccination program, and there is much to learn here in the context of conventional influenza vaccines that have been used for decades. While these vaccines are regarded as suboptimal with respect to direct protection, their indirect transmission benefits also remain debated. The Japanese experience with mass vaccination of schoolchildren in the 1950 to 1970s, along with modeling studies, have pointed at the herd immunity benefits that would be expected from large-scale influenza immunization efforts [

Routine influenza immunization programs have become well-established in high-income countries, and new programs are being rolled out in middle-income settings. The time is ripe for modeling of surveillance data in different geographic contexts to estimate and, possibly, reconcile the transmission benefits of conventional vaccines [

Another promising avenue includes modeling of detailed individual-level data on the transmission of influenza outbreaks in closed settings, such as military camps, households, or college dormitories, where a fraction of the population is vaccinated.
