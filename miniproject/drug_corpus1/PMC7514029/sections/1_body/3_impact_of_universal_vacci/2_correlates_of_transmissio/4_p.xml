<p>A related question is how much transmission occurs, if any, from asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic individuals. Ferret experiments indicate that transmission can occur prior to symptom development [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Household studies have shown decreased shedding in pauci- and asymptomatic individuals infected with influenza, relative to symptomatic individuals; however, the potential for onwards transmission remains unclear [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008583.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. In humans, the contribution of asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic transmission could be modulated by the behavior and contacts of individuals with few or no symptoms. A potentially detrimental effect of a vaccine that considerably reduces disease severity might be to increase influenza transmission outside of the home due to increased contacts and mobility, relative to more severely ill individuals. If the transmission reduction conferred by a broadly protective vaccine was compensated by an increase in contacts in those who shed the virus, then broadly protective vaccination programs could result in larger epidemics than well-matched conventional vaccines. This hypothetical issue should be weighed in against the imperfect match of conventional vaccines in seasonal influenza situations and the lack of rapidly available conventional vaccines in pandemic situations. Mathematical models could highlight the particular conditions under which the unintended consequences of universal influenza vaccination could occur and assess the trade-offs against existing formulations [
