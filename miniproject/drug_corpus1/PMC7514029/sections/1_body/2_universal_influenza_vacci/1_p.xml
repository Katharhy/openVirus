<p>The evolution of influenza A viruses is notoriously difficult to predict. Not only does the virus evolve through rapid mutation of surface HA and NA proteins to evade antibody detection, but entire segments of the genome can be reshuffled through reassortment between different viruses coinfecting the same cell. The evolution of the HA protein follows a distinct ladder-like pattern in humans, driven by continual antibody-induced selection that results in global sweeps of new variants every three to five years. Manufacturing effective seasonal vaccines requires biannual predictions of the next year’s dominant strain, a process that has been informed in recent years by the increased availability of genetic sequence data, including from understudied tropical and subtropical regions, and the development of new visualization tools and predictive methods [
