<p>To understand the plasticity of the influenza virus, it is worth exploring two examples involving resistance to antiviral drugs. First, in 2005, H3N2 viruses that were resistant to the adamantane class of antivirals rapidly reached fixation globally, leading to the entire discontinuation of this class of drugs [

The S31N substitution appears to have originated in Asia, where cheap, over-the-counter adamantane drugs were anecdotally more widely used than in Europe and North America [
