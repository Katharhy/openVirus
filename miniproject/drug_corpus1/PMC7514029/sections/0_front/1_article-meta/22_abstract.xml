 <p>There is a lot of interest in developing universal influenza vaccines that could elicit broad protection against multiple strains of influenza viruses. This impetus is generating intense basic science research in the field of influenza immunology, in the hope that new vaccine candidates can be identified, reach clinical trials, and deliver robust influenza responses. However, there are important downstream questions about using universal influenza vaccines in large populations that should be considered during the development and implementation of these novel products. Important questions include how early childhood influenza exposure limits immune responses to future influenza infections, how universal influenza vaccines could drive viral evolution, and how these new vaccines could impact the epidemiology of influenza in epidemic and pandemic seasons. Here, we synthesize the questions most relevant to predicting the population impacts of universal influenza vaccines and discuss how existing data could be analyzed to address these questions.</p>
