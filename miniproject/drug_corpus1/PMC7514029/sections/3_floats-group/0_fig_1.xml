  <title>Timeline of influenza A virus circulation in humans from 1918 to present.</title>
  <p>Colored boxes represent different eras of influenza A subtype circulation and, hence, imprinting of population cohorts by different subtypes. Group-level imprinting is indicated as purple shading for group 1 (H1 and H2 viruses) and in green for group 2 (H3 virus). Cohorts born after 1977 can be imprinted by either group due to cocirculation of H1 and H3 viruses.</p>
