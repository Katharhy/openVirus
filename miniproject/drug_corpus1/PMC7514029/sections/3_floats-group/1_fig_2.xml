  <title>Immune mechanisms involved in influenza protection, with their evolutionary and epidemiological signatures, and evidence for imprinting by birth year.</title>
  <p>Immune mechanisms are organized by breadth of protection, from broadest to most specific. (A) Protection against all influenza A viruses. (B) Protection at the HA group level. (C) Protection at the subtype level. (D) Strain-specific protection. The strength and duration of protection, and the impact on transmission, remain debated for most of these mechanisms (see also [
