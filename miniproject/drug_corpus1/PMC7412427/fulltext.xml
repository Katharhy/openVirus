Targeting influenza virus-host interactions is a new and emerging field, and therapies based on the combination of virus- and host-directed drugs might significantly improve treatment success.

Introduction</title><p>With 3&#x02013;5 million severe cases worldwide and 300,000&#x02013;700,000 fatalities annually, influenza virus is not only a major threat to public health, but also poses a substantial burden on health care resources. In addition to the annual epidemics, sudden and unpredictable pandemics present global health emergencies. Vaccination is a very effective measure that has been available for more than six decades [<xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, the high mutation rate of the viral genome causing continuous changes (antigenic drift) requires a constant update of the vaccines [<xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Moreover, vaccination does not protect against outbreaks caused by the emergence of new viral subtypes with new surface glycoproteins due to genome reassortment between two different strains (antigenic shift) [<xref rid="B5-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, antiviral drugs are essential additions for effective infection control.</p><p>To initiate the infection process, the hemagglutinin (HA) protruding from the envelope of influenza A virus (IAV) attaches to the host cell via binding to sialic acid moieties on the cell surface, leading to the endocytosis of the virion [<xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The pH drop in late endosomes (LE) elicits HA-mediated fusion of the virus envelope with the endosomal membrane, leading to the subsequent release of the viral genome into the host cell cytosol [<xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. To avoid the rebinding of budding progeny viruses, the IAV surface protein neuraminidase (NA) cleaves the glycosidic linkages of terminal neuraminic acid residues, thus ensuring virus release and spread [<xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Because of the vital functions of sialic acid residues in the IAV infection process, the viral NA constitutes an attractive target for anti-IAV therapy [<xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The NA active site is conserved among IAV and influenza B viruses (IBV), and, therefore, sialic acid analogs as competitive NA inhibitors were already developed in the 1990s. The most commonly used NA inhibitor is oseltamivir; however, the constant risk of emerging resistance to this drug became evident in 2007/2008 when more than 90% of circulating seasonal H1N1 strains in the northern hemisphere acquired a resistance mutation and became insensitive to oseltamivir [<xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The pandemic strain H1N1pdm09 (pdm09), which replaced the old H1N1 lineage in 2009, fortunately did not carry this resistance mutation; therefore, NA inhibitors such as oseltamivir are still recommended for influenza treatment [<xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, the emergence of oseltamivir-resistant IAV and IBV strains has been frequently reported in the last decade [<xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A novel endonuclease inhibitor for treatment of influenza A and influenza B infection, baloxavir marboxil [<xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], was recently approved for medical use in Japan and the United States. While baloxavir marboxil is another success in the development of antiviral medication, especially because of the approval extension for treatment of high-risk patients, oseltamivir is still the leading, most commonly used drug in influenza infection treatment. The second class of approved antivirals are the adamantanes amantadine and rimantadine, which both inhibit the IAV proton channel M2. Nevertheless, due to high resistance rates, especially among the most common, globally circulating H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes, the adamantanes are not recommended anymore for prophylaxis and treatment [<xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The ability of IAV to rapidly develop resistance against antivirals underscores the need for novel therapeutic options aside from direct targeting of the virus. The use of host-directed therapeutics which interfere with host cell factors that are essentially required for a successful replication process is an emerging approach to counteract viral infection [<xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Because the pathogens critically depend on the host cell, an escape from host-directed therapy (HDT) would require substantial changes in the infection cycle and is, therefore, much less likely to occur [<xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In previous studies, we concentrated on the crucial role of host cell cholesterol homeostasis in the IAV infection cycle. Indeed, we could identify the late endosomal cholesterol balance as a druggable host cell target for antiviral intervention [<xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Moreover, the antifungal triazole derivate drug itraconazole, which blocks the LE cholesterol export via inhibition of the late endosomal cholesterol transport protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), displayed antiviral capability against various IAV and IBV subtypes in vitro and in a preclinical murine model of IAV infection [<xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Combination therapy, i.e., the treatment of influenza virus infection with at least two drugs with different modes of action, is considered a promising strategy for circumventing therapy resistance, based on the notion that the virus will stay susceptible to at least one of the drugs. A wide number of studies have investigated the combinatory use of antivirals belonging to the adamantanes and NA inhibitors [<xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In this study, we explored the effect of a combinatory use of the antiviral drug oseltamivir and the host-directed anti-infective drug itraconazole on IAV infection in a cell culture model of polarized bronchial cell monolayers. Combinations of oseltamivir and itraconazole exerted significantly stronger antiviral activities compared to the respective monotherapies, and lower oseltamivir concentrations were required. Assessment of the mode of action indicated that the combination of both drugs showed additivity. The additional antiviral effect of itraconazole might safeguard patients infected with influenza strains with heightened oseltamivir resistance.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-12-00703"><title>2.

To assess polarization on the cytomorphological level, polarized cells grown to confluency were evaluated for the distribution of the tight junction-associated protein Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) as a marker for the apical surface, and the basolateral marker &#x003b2;-catenin. In brief, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with anti-ZO-1 antibodies (rabbit polyclonal, Invitrogen, Waltham, M.S., USA) and anti-&#x003b2;-catenin antibodies (mouse monoclonal, BD Transduction Laboratories, Heidelberg, Germany). Nuclei were visualized with DAPI (300 nM).

Data Analysis</title><p>A priori power analysis (G*Power 3.1, [<xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]) was used to estimate the required sample sizes and post hoc analysis confirmed that powers &#x0003e; 0.99 were achieved. Data were analyzed with Prism 8.00 (GraphPad, San diego, C.A., USA). For dose-response curves, drug concentrations were log-transformed and virus titers were expressed as percentages of the mean virus titer in control cells (treated with the solvent DMSO). For assessment of inhibition, the reduction of viral titers in treated cells was expressed as percentages of titers found in control cells. For the determination of logIC<sub>50</sub> values, data were analyzed by fitting a curve using nonlinear regression and the 4 parameter logistic model with a standard Hill slope of 1.0. To detect a potentially global impact of the combination on the respective individual antiviral drug activity, the best-fit values of the unshared logIC<sub>50</sub> values were compared by extra sum-of-squares F tests. Significant reductions in virus titers compared to control cells were detected by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett&#x02019;s multiple comparisons test. To analyze the significance of itraconazole-mediated reduction at a fixed oseltamivir concentration, the reduction in virus titer was compared to the respective oseltamivir-only sample by two-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett&#x02019;s multiple comparisons test. <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered significant.

Results</title><p>The majority of the most common circulating IAV subtypes already acquired resistance against the approved antiviral drug amantadine and there is increasing evidence that the commonly used drug oseltamivir will sooner or later share this fate. To analyze the effect of a combination treatment with oseltamivir and the host-targeting drug itraconazole, we selected two representatives of the currently circulating H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes, namely a strain of the 2009 pandemic IAV H1N1 viruses (pdm09), which has become the dominant H1N1 lineage and is still oseltamivir-sensitive, and the human seasonal H3N2 isolate A/Panama/2007/99 (Panama) [<xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We utilized the human bronchial epithelial cell line Calu-3 cultured submerged in media on semipermeable supports as an in vitro infection model. After four days of cultivation, the adherent monolayer typically reached a transepithelial electrical resistance of 800 &#x003a9;cm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00703-f001">Figure 1</xref>a), and the tight junction-associated protein Zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) was targeted to the apical surface in a cobblestone (honeycomb) pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00703-f001">Figure 1</xref>b), indicating successful apicobasal polarization of the confluent epithelial monolayers. </p><p>We first tested whether treatment with any of the drugs&#x02014;single or combined&#x02014;affected cell survival. In line with their clinical use, neither oseltamivir nor itraconazole alone had an impact on cell viability. The combination treatments were also well-tolerated, and a notable reduction (25&#x02013;30%) in cell viability was only seen when cells were simultaneously treated with the highest concentrations of oseltamivir (10 &#x000b5;M) and high doses of itraconazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00703-f002">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>To confirm the anti-IAV activity of both drugs, the polarized monolayers were inoculated with 0.1 MOI of either pdm09 or Panama isolate, and the drugs were added 2 h p.i. Both IAV subtypes replicated with high efficiency in control cells treated with solvent only. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00703-f003">Figure 3</xref>, both drugs displayed significant antiviral activity for both strains over the range of concentrations tested (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00703-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Nonlinear fitting of the concentration-response curves determined EC<sub>50</sub> values for the single-drug treatments. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00703-f003">Figure 3</xref>, the half-maximum effective concentration of oseltamivir was reached at 20.56 nM (pdm09) and 23.41 nM (Panama), respectively. Itraconazole EC<sub>50</sub> was 0.47 &#x000b5;M for pdm09 and 0.37 &#x000b5;M for Panama, well in accordance with our previous results of EC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.57 &#x000b5;g/mL, determined for itraconazole-treated A549 cells infected with the M&#x000fc;nster variant of the H1N1 influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) [<xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Next, we screened treatments with oseltamivir/itraconazole combinations for their antiviral activities. The actual virus titers are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00703-f004">Figure 4</xref>. </p><p>We first compared the half-maximum effective concentration of both drugs in combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00703-f005">Figure 5</xref>). For both virus subtypes, oseltamivir logEC<sub>50</sub> values were shifted toward lower concentrations required to reach EC<sub>50</sub> in the presence of itraconazole, and similarly shifted logEC<sub>50</sub> values were also found for itraconazole in combination with oseltamivir.</p><p>Generally, virus titers were potently reduced for all treatments and both virus subtypes. Individually applied, 10 &#x000b5;M oseltamivir was required to achieve &#x02265;90% reduction of maximum virus titers produced in control cells, and 1 &#x000b5;M itraconazole was already sufficient to yield a similar reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00703-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Combinations of 0.5 &#x000b5;M itraconazole with either 0.1 or 1 &#x000b5;M oseltamivir had an inhibitory effect of &#x02265;90%, which was not seen when the drugs were given individually.</p><p>Computation of the 95% confidence intervals of the differences between combinations and the respective single dose of oseltamivir revealed that itraconazole increased the antiviral activity in the range of 0&#x02013;1 &#x000b5;M oseltamivir; however, the differences were less pronounced with increasing concentrations of oseltamivir (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00703-f007">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00703-f008">Figure 8</xref> summarizes the effects of combined treatments. Inhibition of at least 90% could be achieved with either oseltamivir and itraconazole single treatment. Combination treatments, except for the 10 &#x000b5;M oseltamivir treatment, the highest concentration used, tended to yield better inhibitory effects, and &#x02265;90% inhibition already could be reached when 0.5 &#x000b5;M itraconazole was added to 0.1 &#x000b5;M oseltamivir (in case of pdm09) or when cells were treated with 1 &#x000b5;M oseltamivir (for both strains).</p><p>The enhanced antiviral activities seen in the combinatory treatments could result from independent, additive drug responses or from synergistic effects. We therefore applied several commonly used reference models to evaluate drug combination data. The widely used Bliss independence model compares the expected with the observed effects and is based on the assumption that the respective drugs affect independent pathways. Unlike Bliss independence, the Loewe additivity model requires dose-response curves for the monotherapies and the assumption is a shared mechanism of action. The ZIP reference model compares the change in the potency between the monotherapy and the combination dose-response curves. The drug interaction analyses, summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00703-f009">Figure 9</xref>, resulted in consistent patterns across the models. For infection with pdm09, 0.25 &#x000b5;M itraconazole tended to antagonize oseltamivir antiviral action, whereas higher itraconazole doses were synergistic, with an optimum at 0.5 &#x000b5;M itraconazole/0.1 &#x000b5;M oseltamivir. For Panama-infected cells, only the drug combinations 0.01 &#x000b5;M oseltamivir/0.25&#x02013;0.5 &#x000b5;M itraconazole showed synergistic actions. However, all of the observed effects were not pronounced, arguing for rather additive effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-viruses-12-00703"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>We analyzed the antiviral effects of combined treatment with the IAV neuraminidase-targeting drug oseltamivir and itraconazole, a licensed antifungal that we previously reported to efficiently block IAV endosomal escape in cell culture [<xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] on the replication efficiency of two different IAV strains. Itraconazole has been identified as a direct inhibitor of the late endosomal/lysosomal cholesterol transport protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), thus severely disturbing the endosomal cholesterol balance [<xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The LE compartment is a critical host/pathogen interface in the IAV infection cycle, since the fusion of the IAV envelope with the LE limiting membrane is required for the transfer of the virus genome into the host cell cytoplasm, and ultimately into the cell nucleus. In our previous studies, we found that increased cholesterol accumulation via NPC1 blockade impacts IAV infection at multiple steps, (i) by impairing the virus/endosome fusion, (ii) by affecting the release and the infectivity of the virus progeny due to reduced cholesterol transport to the plasma membrane, and (iii) by priming the interferon response [<xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Our findings established the late endosomal cholesterol balance as a druggable cellular target for antiviral intervention. Importantly, we could confirm the therapeutic potential of a drug-repurposing approach in a preclinical mouse model of IAV infection [<xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The EC<sub>50</sub> values for itraconazole-mediated antiviral activity against the two IAV subtypes tested on polarized Calu-3 cells in this study were very similar to the result obtained with another IAV strain in our earlier study, thus underscoring that itraconazole is indeed a promising candidate for the treatment of IAV infections [<xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Such drugs that target host processes required for pathogen replication and spread are considered to provide a novel means to limit infection. Because they impact basic cell functions, the development of viral resistance, as is frequently seen with drugs directly targeting the pathogen, such as the influenza virus NA inhibitor oseltamivir, is less likely [<xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Indeed, screening libraries of already approved compounds for novel uses (drug repurposing), has been established as a core drug development strategy, reducing the time and costs, due to the established safety profiles and known side effects of the tested compounds. Although drug repurposing for host-directed antiviral therapy is an approach that is considered a promising avenue, there are shortcomings to be considered, such as off-target and associated side effects on the host, as repurposed drugs often require high concentrations for their new use. Mechanistically, host-directed antiviral agents will slow down viral replication rather than eradicate the virus, and failure of HDT might result from the inappropriate time window of application (early vs. late infection stages) and a suppression rather than a complete elimination of the infectious agent, requiring long treatment duration which is often associated with poor patient compliance. Recently, combination therapies utilizing both host- and pathogen-directed strategies have been explored to overcome these limitations, as the combined use of two or more drugs might allow reduce the concentrations of the individual drugs in the cocktail [<xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. As expected from established and clinically used drugs, no cytotoxic effects were observed when both, itraconazole and oseltamivir, were used individually and combined application reduced cell viability only at the highest concentrations tested. The pairwise combination was effective in reducing virus titers for both pdm09 and the Panama IAV variant. Oseltamivir and itraconazole EC<sub>50</sub> values indicated that both drugs worked effectively and did not antagonize each other. This assumption was confirmed by Bliss independence drug interaction analysis, which pointed at independent drug actions [<xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Notably, we detected significantly decreased viral titers in the combination treatments when compared to monotherapy with oseltamivir, at lower drug concentrations than required for the single treatments. Moreover, the additional antiviral effect of itraconazole might function as a safeguard mechanism to combat IAV infection caused by strains with heightened oseltamivir resistance.</p><p>Clinical translation to exploit the effectiveness of a drug combination requires detailed knowledge of the pharmacokinetic drug profiles when given in combination, and novel combinations might be associated with hitherto unobserved side effects. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic profiles need to be complementary in order to provide the required bioavailable doses at the same time. Transferring in vitro findings into clinical applications thus remains a challenge and might require the development of novel formulations and delivery approaches. This is especially relevant in the case of itraconazole, which has low a bioavailability after oral application [<xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is limited because of the low water solubility of this very lipophilic compound. Low pH environments as gastric acid promote ionization and thus, absorption [<xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, because the conversion into the soluble form is impaired by conditions impacting the gastric acidity such as fasting, chronic low gastric acidity, infections, and medications, effective itraconazole levels are difficult to adjust. Indeed, acidic beverages improve itraconazole absorption [<xref rid="B38-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Results from our previous study exploring the benefit of itraconazole treatment in IAV-infected mice already documented the antiviral activity in vivo, and the results obtained in this study may help design trials in the treatment of influenza virus infections.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Jonathan Hentrey for help with the plaque assays.</p></ack><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization, S.L. and U.R.; methodology, S.L., U.R.; validation, S.S., J.G.; formal analysis, U.R.; investigation, S.S., J.G.; resources, S.L., S.P.; data curation, U.R., S.S.; writing&#x02014;original draft preparation, U.R.; writing&#x02014;review and editing, S.S., J.G., S.P., S.L., U.R.; visualization, J.G., S.S.; supervision, S.S.; project administration, U.R.; funding acquisition, U.R.
