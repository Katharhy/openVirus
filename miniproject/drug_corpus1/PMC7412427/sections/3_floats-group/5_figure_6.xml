  <p>Analysis of the anti-IAV activity of combination treatment with oseltamivir and itraconazole. Polarized Calu-3 monolayers were infected with 0.1 MOI of (
   <bold>a</bold>) pdm09 or (
   <bold>b</bold>) Panama for 24 h. Oseltamivir and itraconazole were added at the indicated combinations 2 h p.i. Mean percentages of reduction in viral titers Â± SEM, with mean virus titer in control cells (treated with the solvent DMSO) set to 100%; 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3. Dotted line, 90% reduction in viral titer.
