  <p>Analysis of the cytotoxicity of oseltamivir and itraconazole in single or combinatory treatment. Polarized Calu-3 monolayers were treated at the indicated concentrations with oseltamivir, itraconazole, or combinations for 24 h. Data represent mean percentages of viable cells ± SEM, with mean viability in control cells treated with the solvent DMSO (C) set to 100%. Cell death induced by staurosporine (ST) served as a positive control.
