  <p>Analysis of the anti-IAV activity of combination treatments with oseltamivir and itraconazole. Polarized Calu-3 monolayers were infected with 0.1 MOI of (
   <bold>a</bold>) pdm09 or (
   <bold>b</bold>) Panama for 24 h. Oseltamivir and itraconazole were added at the indicated combinations 2 h p.i. For each oseltamivir concentration, mean percentages of reduction in viral titers Â± SEM were compared to the respective oseltamivir treatment without itraconazole. Data are expressed as differences and 95% confidence intervals of the comparisons.
