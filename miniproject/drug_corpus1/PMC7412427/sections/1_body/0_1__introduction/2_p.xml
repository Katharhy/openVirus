<p>To initiate the infection process, the hemagglutinin (HA) protruding from the envelope of influenza A virus (IAV) attaches to the host cell via binding to sialic acid moieties on the cell surface, leading to the endocytosis of the virion [

 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The pH drop in late endosomes (LE) elicits HA-mediated fusion of the virus envelope with the endosomal membrane, leading to the subsequent release of the viral genome into the host cell cytosol [

 <xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. To avoid the rebinding of budding progeny viruses, the IAV surface protein neuraminidase (NA) cleaves the glycosidic linkages of terminal neuraminic acid residues, thus ensuring virus release and spread [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Because of the vital functions of sialic acid residues in the IAV infection process, the viral NA constitutes an attractive target for anti-IAV therapy [

 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The NA active site is conserved among IAV and influenza B viruses (IBV), and, therefore, sialic acid analogs as competitive NA inhibitors were already developed in the 1990s. The most commonly used NA inhibitor is oseltamivir; however, the constant risk of emerging resistance to this drug became evident in 2007/2008 when more than 90% of circulating seasonal H1N1 strains in the northern hemisphere acquired a resistance mutation and became insensitive to oseltamivir [

 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The pandemic strain H1N1pdm09 (pdm09), which replaced the old H1N1 lineage in 2009, fortunately did not carry this resistance mutation; therefore, NA inhibitors such as oseltamivir are still recommended for influenza treatment [

 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, the emergence of oseltamivir-resistant IAV and IBV strains has been frequently reported in the last decade [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A novel endonuclease inhibitor for treatment of influenza A and influenza B infection, baloxavir marboxil [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], was recently approved for medical use in Japan and the United States. While baloxavir marboxil is another success in the development of antiviral medication, especially because of the approval extension for treatment of high-risk patients, oseltamivir is still the leading, most commonly used drug in influenza infection treatment. The second class of approved antivirals are the adamantanes amantadine and rimantadine, which both inhibit the IAV proton channel M2. Nevertheless, due to high resistance rates, especially among the most common, globally circulating H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes, the adamantanes are not recommended anymore for prophylaxis and treatment [
