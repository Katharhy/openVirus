<p>The ability of IAV to rapidly develop resistance against antivirals underscores the need for novel therapeutic options aside from direct targeting of the virus. The use of host-directed therapeutics which interfere with host cell factors that are essentially required for a successful replication process is an emerging approach to counteract viral infection [

 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Because the pathogens critically depend on the host cell, an escape from host-directed therapy (HDT) would require substantial changes in the infection cycle and is, therefore, much less likely to occur [

 <xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In previous studies, we concentrated on the crucial role of host cell cholesterol homeostasis in the IAV infection cycle. Indeed, we could identify the late endosomal cholesterol balance as a druggable host cell target for antiviral intervention [

Moreover, the antifungal triazole derivate drug itraconazole, which blocks the LE cholesterol export via inhibition of the late endosomal cholesterol transport protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), displayed antiviral capability against various IAV and IBV subtypes in vitro and in a preclinical murine model of IAV infection [
