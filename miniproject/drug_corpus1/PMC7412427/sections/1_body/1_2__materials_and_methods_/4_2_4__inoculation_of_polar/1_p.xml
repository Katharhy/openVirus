<p>For infection, the monolayers were washed with PBS and were inoculated at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 of virus diluted in infection-PBS (PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.9 mM CaCl2, 100 U/mL penicillin and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin, 300 µL/well) at 37 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, cells were washed with PBS and further cultured in infection-DMEM (serum-free DMEM containing 0.2% BSA, 1 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.9 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin) at 5% CO2 and 37 °C.

 <italic>p</italic>-tosyl-ʟ-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany, 1 μg/mL) was added to facilitate infection. Cells were treated with itraconazole (Sigma, Darmstadt, Germany, solubilized in DMSO at 2 mg/mL) and/or oseltamivir (Sigma, Darmstadt, Germany, solubilized in H
 <sub>2</sub>O, 10 mg/mL) 2 h post-infection (p.i.). Aliquots of apical culture supernatants were collected at 24 h p.i. and were immediately frozen at −80 °C until titration. To assess antiviral activities, plaque-forming units (PFU) in the cell culture supernatants were expressed as percentages of PFU in supernatants of control cells treated with solvent only which represented maximum infection.
