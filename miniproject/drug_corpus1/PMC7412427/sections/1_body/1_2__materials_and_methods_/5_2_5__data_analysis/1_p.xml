<p>A priori power analysis (G*Power 3.1, [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]) was used to estimate the required sample sizes and post hoc analysis confirmed that powers &gt; 0.99 were achieved. Data were analyzed with Prism 8.00 (GraphPad, San diego, C.A., USA). For dose-response curves, drug concentrations were log-transformed and virus titers were expressed as percentages of the mean virus titer in control cells (treated with the solvent DMSO). For assessment of inhibition, the reduction of viral titers in treated cells was expressed as percentages of titers found in control cells. For the determination of logIC
 <sub>50</sub> values, data were analyzed by fitting a curve using nonlinear regression and the 4 parameter logistic model with a standard Hill slope of 1.0. To detect a potentially global impact of the combination on the respective individual antiviral drug activity, the best-fit values of the unshared logIC
 <sub>50</sub> values were compared by extra sum-of-squares F tests. Significant reductions in virus titers compared to control cells were detected by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test. To analyze the significance of itraconazole-mediated reduction at a fixed oseltamivir concentration, the reduction in virus titer was compared to the respective oseltamivir-only sample by two-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test.
