<p>We analyzed the antiviral effects of combined treatment with the IAV neuraminidase-targeting drug oseltamivir and itraconazole, a licensed antifungal that we previously reported to efficiently block IAV endosomal escape in cell culture [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00703" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] on the replication efficiency of two different IAV strains. Itraconazole has been identified as a direct inhibitor of the late endosomal/lysosomal cholesterol transport protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), thus severely disturbing the endosomal cholesterol balance [

The LE compartment is a critical host/pathogen interface in the IAV infection cycle, since the fusion of the IAV envelope with the LE limiting membrane is required for the transfer of the virus genome into the host cell cytoplasm, and ultimately into the cell nucleus. In our previous studies, we found that increased cholesterol accumulation via NPC1 blockade impacts IAV infection at multiple steps, (i) by impairing the virus/endosome fusion, (ii) by affecting the release and the infectivity of the virus progeny due to reduced cholesterol transport to the plasma membrane, and (iii) by priming the interferon response [

Importantly, we could confirm the therapeutic potential of a drug-repurposing approach in a preclinical mouse model of IAV infection [

 <sub>50</sub> values for itraconazole-mediated antiviral activity against the two IAV subtypes tested on polarized Calu-3 cells in this study were very similar to the result obtained with another IAV strain in our earlier study, thus underscoring that itraconazole is indeed a promising candidate for the treatment of IAV infections [
