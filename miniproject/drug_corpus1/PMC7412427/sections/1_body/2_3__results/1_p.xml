<p>The majority of the most common circulating IAV subtypes already acquired resistance against the approved antiviral drug amantadine and there is increasing evidence that the commonly used drug oseltamivir will sooner or later share this fate. To analyze the effect of a combination treatment with oseltamivir and the host-targeting drug itraconazole, we selected two representatives of the currently circulating H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes, namely a strain of the 2009 pandemic IAV H1N1 viruses (pdm09), which has become the dominant H1N1 lineage and is still oseltamivir-sensitive, and the human seasonal H3N2 isolate A/Panama/2007/99 (Panama) [

We utilized the human bronchial epithelial cell line Calu-3 cultured submerged in media on semipermeable supports as an in vitro infection model. After four days of cultivation, the adherent monolayer typically reached a transepithelial electrical resistance of 800 Î©cm
