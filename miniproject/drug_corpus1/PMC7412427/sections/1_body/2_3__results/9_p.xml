<p>The enhanced antiviral activities seen in the combinatory treatments could result from independent, additive drug responses or from synergistic effects. We therefore applied several commonly used reference models to evaluate drug combination data. The widely used Bliss independence model compares the expected with the observed effects and is based on the assumption that the respective drugs affect independent pathways. Unlike Bliss independence, the Loewe additivity model requires dose-response curves for the monotherapies and the assumption is a shared mechanism of action. The ZIP reference model compares the change in the potency between the monotherapy and the combination dose-response curves. The drug interaction analyses, summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00703-f009">Figure 9</xref>, resulted in consistent patterns across the models. For infection with pdm09, 0.25 µM itraconazole tended to antagonize oseltamivir antiviral action, whereas higher itraconazole doses were synergistic, with an optimum at 0.5 µM itraconazole/0.1 µM oseltamivir. For Panama-infected cells, only the drug combinations 0.01 µM oseltamivir/0.25–0.5 µM itraconazole showed synergistic actions. However, all of the observed effects were not pronounced, arguing for rather additive effects.
