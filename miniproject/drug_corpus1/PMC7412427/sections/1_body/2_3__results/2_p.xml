<p>We first tested whether treatment with any of the drugs—single or combined—affected cell survival. In line with their clinical use, neither oseltamivir nor itraconazole alone had an impact on cell viability. The combination treatments were also well-tolerated, and a notable reduction (25–30%) in cell viability was only seen when cells were simultaneously treated with the highest concentrations of oseltamivir (10 µM) and high doses of itraconazole (
