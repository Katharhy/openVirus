<p>To confirm the anti-IAV activity of both drugs, the polarized monolayers were inoculated with 0.1 MOI of either pdm09 or Panama isolate, and the drugs were added 2 h p.i. Both IAV subtypes replicated with high efficiency in control cells treated with solvent only. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00703-f003">Figure 3</xref>, both drugs displayed significant antiviral activity for both strains over the range of concentrations tested (see also 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00703-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Nonlinear fitting of the concentration-response curves determined EC
 <sub>50</sub> values for the single-drug treatments. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00703-f003">Figure 3</xref>, the half-maximum effective concentration of oseltamivir was reached at 20.56 nM (pdm09) and 23.41 nM (Panama), respectively. Itraconazole EC
 <sub>50</sub> was 0.47 µM for pdm09 and 0.37 µM for Panama, well in accordance with our previous results of EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.57 µg/mL, determined for itraconazole-treated A549 cells infected with the Münster variant of the H1N1 influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) [
