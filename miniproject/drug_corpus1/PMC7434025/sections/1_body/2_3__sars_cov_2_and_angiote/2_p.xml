 </sup> This study included nine SARS-CoV-2-infected pregnant women in Wuhan, whose amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breast milk were collected. All of the specimens were negative for SARS-CoV-2, which indicates no evidence of vertical transmission.

 </sup> But a study indicated that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, was highly expressed in maternal–fetal interface cells, suggesting the possibility of vertical transmission.

 </sup> More studies to clarify the role of ACE2 in pregnancy are warranted.
