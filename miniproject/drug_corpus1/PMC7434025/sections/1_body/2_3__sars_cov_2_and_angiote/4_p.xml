 </sup> The ACE cleaves angiotensin I to angiotensin II. ACE2 was first identified in the year 2000, which converts angiotensin I to angiotensin 1–9 and angiotensin II to angiotensin 1–7. ACE2 is a negative regulator in the RAAS. It provides a binding site for the S-protein of coronavirus.

 </sup> There was structural evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein has a higher affinity to ACE2 than the SARS-CoV S protein.

 </sup> Although ACE2 is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, it plays a protective role in acute lung injury.

 </sup> Local activation of the RAAS responses to viral insults in pregnancy may mediate vasoconstriction, acute lung injury, adverse myocardial remodeling, preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, and miscarriage.

 </sup> Studies proposed that ACE2 has transient overexpression and increased activity during pregnancy, especially in the placenta.

 </sup> But if pregnant women are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 is currently not known. We proposed the deduction effect of ACE2 in pregnancy (Fig.
