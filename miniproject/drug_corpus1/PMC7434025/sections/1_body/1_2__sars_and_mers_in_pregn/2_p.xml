 </sup> Three pregnant women died. Seven women were in the first trimester, and four had a spontaneous abortion. Five women were more than 24 weeks of gestational age, and four had preterm delivery. Two of the pregnant women recovered from SARS but had intrauterine growth restriction of the ongoing pregnancy. None of the newborn babies had SARS. Fatality rate (25%), intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate (50%), and mechanical ventilation rate (33%) were higher than nonpregnant women. The pregnant women were treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and in severe cases, ribavirin was used.

 </sup> However, ribavirin has a teratogenic effect in animal.

 </sup> Women who are in early pregnancy should consider termination with treating of ribavirin. In a study of placental pathology of patients, there was increased intervillous or subchorionic fibrin and extensive fetal thrombotic vasculopathy, which may result due to the hypoxic respiratory disease.

 </sup> Nevertheless, villitis, which is the evidence of maternal hematogenous infection that transmit to the fetus, was not found.
