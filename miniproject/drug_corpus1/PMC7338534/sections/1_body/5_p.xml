<p id="Par7">Rapid and affordable antibody-based HIV and COVID-19 testing capacity must be escalated in the developing world. One possible strategy is to share plasmids with biomedical facilities in low- and middle-income countries, which could then locally produce the reagents for antibody-based testing, circumventing the high costs and waiting times associated with importing such tests from abroad

 </sup>, so sharing parts and reagents (e.g., plasmids, purified antibodies) may be more desirable than already assembled testing kits. Importantly, conventional antibody-based HIV testing may miss early infection
 <sup>

 </sup>. Hence, methods to detect viral nucleic acids directly remain desirable. Recently developed CRISPR-based methods to detect specific viral RNA sequences amenable to lyophilization, long-term storage, and reconstitution on paper represent a promising approach to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV, both RNA viruses, in locations with little to no healthcare infrastructures

 </sup>. More bilateral and multilateral scientific collaborations between high- and low- and middle-income countries should be encouraged to gradually foster productive scientific collaboration and build local biomedical infrastructure
