<p id="Par4">The infrastructure for collecting and administering plasma exists. The risks are known and rather low when the healthcare infrastructure is optimal. More than 16,000 patients at hundreds of US hospitals have received convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19. A study in New York City found that convalescent plasma recipients had improved survival and less-supplemental oxygen requirements than control patients
