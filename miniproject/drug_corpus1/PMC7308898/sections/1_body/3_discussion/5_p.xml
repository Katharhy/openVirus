<p>The role played by TDR in supporting LMICs to strengthen capacity for clinical and implementation/operational research is in line with the WHO R&amp;D blueprint

 </sup> (the global strategy and preparedness plan that allows the rapid activation of research and development activities during epidemics). The development of the R&amp;D blueprint in the aftermath of the 2014–2015 Ebola epidemic in West Africa was a recognition of the need to galvanize research, with the aim “to fast-track the availability of effective tests, vaccines and medicines that can be used to save lives and avert large scale crisis”

 </sup>. The focus on R&amp;D needs to be complemented by efforts to promote implementation research, which helps to make sure that as new diagnostics, drugs and vaccines emerge from R&amp;D pipelines they are evaluated in clinical trials and approved, they are made available to all who could benefit from them. Resources are needed to strengthen capacity for implementation/operational research, as well as for clinical research, in the LMICs where outbreaks are likely to occur
