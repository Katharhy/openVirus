<p>Fortunately, most countries, most of the time, do not have such outbreaks, so the opportunities for developing capacity for research through “on the job” learning during an outbreak are limited. This has two key implications. Firstly, developing capacity for research on infectious diseases, including: outbreaks takes place to a large extent before an outbreak (or between outbreaks) and is blind to the next specific infectious agent. Secondly, developing adaptable capacity for research on other health problems contributes to generic research capacity, which becomes applicable during infectious disease outbreaks. TDR supports a number of long-term programmes to strengthen capacity for research on infectious diseases: the Postgraduate Training Scheme (PGTS) on implementation research, the Clinical Research and Development Fellowship (CRDF) scheme on clinical research, and the Structured Operational Research Training InitiaTive (SORT IT) on operational research, a partnership-based initiative led by TDR and implemented in collaboration with various partners (
