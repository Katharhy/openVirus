<p>From the records of each training programme, we identified individuals who had completed training during the relevant timespan of each programme: 1999–2018 for the CRDF scheme, 2015–2020 for the PGTS, and 2009–2019 for SORT-IT. For those people with available contact details, we sent online questionnaires by e-mail (in March 2020 for SORT-IT and in April 2020 for the CRDF and PGTS) asking if they were currently involved in the COVID-19 response. We asked about the nature of their involvement, and if they were applying their acquired skills in responding to various key areas for tackling the pandemic.</p>
