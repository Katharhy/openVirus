<p>As part of monitoring and evaluation of TDR supported training programmes, routine online surveys are conducted to gather information for improving the quality and performance of such trainings. Participation in this survey was voluntary and individual consent was obtained for use of anonymized data for reporting and dissemination, including through publications, via the use of a yes/no tick box question within the questionnaires. As this study was part of routine monitoring and evaluation of a training programme, and potential ethical concerns were addressed (responders were all adults, response was voluntary, data were anonymized, personal identifiers were removed and no sensitive personal questions were included that could risk psychological or social harm), this was thus considered a minimal risk study and specific ethical approval for sending questionnaires was not required.</p>
