 <bold>Response: We have now clearly indicated that for the 77% applying SORT IT skills, the denominator is “those involved with COVID-19” which is 411. Understandably, if one is not involved with COVID-19, it would be impossible to apply SORT IT skills. We thus prefer to keep the denominator of 411 and not 699. </bold>
