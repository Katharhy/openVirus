<p> Some limitations of interpretation of the data could be highlighted in a short paragraph in the discussion, such as: 
 <list list-type="order">
  <list-item>
   <p>There is no group for comparison that represents the numbers (%) of those not trained who are involved in some way in the COVID response.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Could responders represent a biased sample, by nature of actively participating in this evaluation? The total numbers of past trainees involved may not be as high as “seven-in-ten”.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>The extent and quality of contribution to the COVID response is not clearly defined</p>
  </list-item>
 </list>
