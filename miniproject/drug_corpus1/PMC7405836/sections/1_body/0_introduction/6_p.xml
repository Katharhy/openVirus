<p>Comparing the genome of SARS-CoV-2 with that of the closely related SARS/SARS-like CoV revealed that the sequence coding for the spike protein, with a total length of 1,273 amino acids, showed 27 amino acid substitutions. Six of these substitutions are in the region of the receptor-binding domain (RBD), and another six substitutions are in the underpinning subdomain (SD) (

COVID-19 is associated with afflictions of the lungs in all cases and generated characteristic chest computer tomography findings, such as the presence of multiple lesions in lung lobes that appear as dense, ground-glass opaque structures that occasionally coexist with consolidation shadows (
