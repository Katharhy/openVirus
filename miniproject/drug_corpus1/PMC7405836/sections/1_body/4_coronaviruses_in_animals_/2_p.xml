 <italic>Deltacoronavirus</italic> have been discovered in the past from birds, like Wigeon coronavirus HKU20, Bulbul coronavirus HKU11, Munia coronavirus HKU13, white-eye coronavirus HKU16, night-heron coronavirus HKU19, and common moorhen coronavirus HKU21, as well as from pigs (porcine coronavirus HKU15) (

Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) are some of the coronaviruses of swine. Among them, TGEV and PEDV are responsible for causing severe gastroenteritis in young piglets with noteworthy morbidity and mortality. Infection with PHEV also causes enteric infection but can cause encephalitis due to its ability to infect the nervous system (
