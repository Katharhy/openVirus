<p>Bovine coronaviruses (BoCoVs) are known to infect several domestic and wild ruminants (
 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>). BoCoV inflicts neonatal calf diarrhea in adult cattle, leading to bloody diarrhea (winter dysentery) and respiratory disease complex (shipping fever) in cattle of all age groups (
 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>). BoCoV-like viruses have been noted in humans, suggesting its zoonotic potential as well (
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>). Feline enteric and feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) viruses are the two major feline CoVs (
 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>), where feline CoVs can affect the gastrointestinal tract, abdominal cavity (peritonitis), respiratory tract, and central nervous system (
 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>). Canines are also affected by CoVs that fall under different genera, namely, canine enteric coronavirus in 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic> and canine respiratory coronavirus in 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>, affecting the enteric and respiratory tract, respectively (

 <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>). IBV, under 
 <italic>Gammacoronavirus</italic>, causes diseases of respiratory, urinary, and reproductive systems, with substantial economic losses in chickens (

 <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>). In small laboratory animals, mouse hepatitis virus, rat sialodacryoadenitis coronavirus, and guinea pig and rabbit coronaviruses are the major CoVs associated with disease manifestations like enteritis, hepatitis, and respiratory infections (
