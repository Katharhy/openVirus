<p>Furthermore, the pangolins are an endangered species of animals that harbor a wide variety of viruses, including coronaviruses (
 <xref rid="B144" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>). The coronavirus isolated from Malayan pangolins (
 <italic>Manis javanica</italic>) showed a very high amino acid identity with COVID-19 at E (100%), M (98.2%), N (96.7%), and S genes (90.4%). The RBD of S protein in CoV isolated from pangolin was almost identical (one amino acid difference) to that of SARS-CoV-2. A comparison of the genomes suggests recombination between pangolin-CoV-like viruses with the bat-CoV-RaTG13-like virus. All this suggests the potential of pangolins to act as the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 (
