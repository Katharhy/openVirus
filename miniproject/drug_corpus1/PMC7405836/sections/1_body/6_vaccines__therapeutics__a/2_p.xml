<p>The majority of the treatment options and strategies that are being evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) have been taken from our previous experiences in treating SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other emerging viral diseases. Several therapeutic and preventive strategies, including vaccines, immunotherapeutics, and antiviral drugs, have been exploited against the previous CoV outbreaks (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) (

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The primary cause of the unavailability of approved and commercial vaccines, drugs, and therapeutics to counter the earlier SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV seems to owe to the lesser attention of the biomedicine and pharmaceutical companies, as these two CoVs did not cause much havoc, global threat, and panic like those posed by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Moreover, for such outbreak situations, the requirement for vaccines and therapeutics/drugs exists only for a limited period, until the outbreak is controlled. The proportion of the human population infected with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was also much lower across the globe, failing to attract drug and vaccine manufacturers and producers. Therefore, by the time an effective drug or vaccine is designed against such disease outbreaks, the virus would have been controlled by adopting appropriate and strict prevention and control measures, and patients for clinical trials will not be available. The newly developed drugs cannot be marketed due to the lack of end users.
