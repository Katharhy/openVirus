<p>Appropriate RBD-specific MAbs can be recognized by a relative analysis of RBD of SARS-CoV-2 to that of SARS-CoV, and cross-neutralizing SARS-CoV RBD-specific MAbs could be explored for their effectiveness against COVID-19 and further need to be assessed clinically. The U.S. biotechnology company Regeneron is attempting to recognize potent and specific MAbs to combat COVID-19. An ideal therapeutic option suggested for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is the combination therapy comprised of MAbs and the drug remdesivir (COVID-19) (

The SARS-CoV-specific human MAb CR3022 is found to bind with SARS-CoV-2 RBD, indicating its potential as a therapeutic agent in the management of COVID-19. It can be used alone or in combination with other effective neutralizing antibodies for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 (

Furthermore, SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, like m396 and CR3014, failed to bind the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, indicating that a particular level of similarity is mandatory between the RBDs of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 for the cross-reactivity to occur.
