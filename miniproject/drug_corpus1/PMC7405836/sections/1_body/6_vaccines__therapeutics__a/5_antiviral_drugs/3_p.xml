<p>Remdesivir, a novel nucleotide analog prodrug, was developed for treating Ebola virus disease (EVD), and it was also found to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in primary human airway epithelial cell culture systems (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> study has proven that remdesivir has better antiviral activity than lopinavir and ritonavir. Further, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies conducted in mice also identified that treatment with remdesivir improved pulmonary function and reduced viral loads and lung pathology both in prophylactic and therapeutic regimens compared to lopinavir/ritonavir-IFN-Î³ treatment in MERS-CoV infection (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). All these findings indicate that remdesivir has to be further evaluated for its efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 infection in humans. The broad-spectrum activity exhibited by remdesivir will help control the spread of disease in the event of a new coronavirus outbreak.
