<p>Recently emerged viruses, such as Zika, Ebola, and Nipah viruses, and their grave threats to humans have begun a race in exploring the designing and developing of advanced vaccines, prophylactics, therapeutics, and drug regimens to counter emerging viruses (

Nevertheless, owing to extensive diversity in antigenic variants, cross-protection rendered by the vaccines is significantly limited, even within the strains of a phylogenetic subcluster (

Recently, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 was established as the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), and the virus was found to enter the host cell mainly through endocytosis. It was also found that the major components that have a critical role in viral entry include PIKfyve, TPC2, and cathepsin L. These findings are critical, since the components described above might act as candidates for vaccines or therapeutic drugs against SARS-CoV-2 (
