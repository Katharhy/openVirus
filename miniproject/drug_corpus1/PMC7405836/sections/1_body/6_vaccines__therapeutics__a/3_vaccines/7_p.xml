<p>Scientists from all over the world are trying hard to develop working vaccines with robust protective immunity against COVID-19. Vaccine candidates, like mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, INO-4800 DNA coronavirus vaccine, and adenovirus type 5 vector vaccine candidate (Ad5-nCoV), are a few examples under phase I clinical trials, while self-amplifying RNA vaccine, oral recombinant COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162, plant-based COVID-19 vaccine, and Ii-Key peptide COVID-19 vaccine are under preclinical trials (

Different phases of trials are ongoing for live attenuated virus vaccines, formaldehyde alum inactivated vaccine, adenovirus type 5 vector vaccine, LNP-encapsulated mRNA vaccine, DNA plasmid vaccine, and S protein, S-trimer, and Ii-Key peptide as a subunit protein vaccine, among others (

The process of vaccine development usually takes approximately ten years, in the case of inactivated or live attenuated vaccines, since it involves the generation of long-term efficacy data. However, this was brought down to 5 years during the Ebola emergency for viral vector vaccines. In the urgency associated with the COVID-19 outbreaks, we expect a vaccine by the end of this year (
