<p>The heterologous immune effects induced by Bacillus Calmette Guérin (BCG) vaccination is a promising strategy for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic and requires further investigations. BCG is a widely used vaccine against tuberculosis in high-risk regions. It is derived from a live attenuated strain of

However, childhood BCG vaccination was found to be associated with a rate of COVID-19-positive test results similar to that of the nonvaccinated group (

Population genetic studies conducted on 103 genomes identified that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has evolved into two major types, L and S. Among the two types, L type is expected to be the most prevalent (∼70%), followed by the S type (∼30%) (

This finding has a significant impact on our race to develop an ideal vaccine, since the vaccine candidate has to target both strains to be considered effective. At present, the genetic differences between the L and S types are very small and may not affect the immune response. However, we can expect further genetic variations in the coming days that could lead to the emergence of new strains (
