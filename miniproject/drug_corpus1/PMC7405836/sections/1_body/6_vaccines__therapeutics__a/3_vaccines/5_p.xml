<p>Dual vaccines have been getting more popular recently. Among them, the rabies virus-based vectored vaccine platform is used to develop vaccines against emerging infectious diseases. The dual vaccine developed from inactivated rabies virus particles that express the MERS-CoV S1 domain of S protein was found to induce immune responses for both MERS-CoV and rabies virus. The vaccinated mice were found to be completely protected from challenge with MERS-CoV (

The intranasal administration of the recombinant adenovirus-based vaccine in BALB/c mice was found to induce long-lasting neutralizing immunity against MERS spike pseudotyped virus, characterized by the induction of systemic IgG, secretory IgA, and lung-resident memory T-cell responses (
