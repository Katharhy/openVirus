<p>The S protein plays a significant role in the induction of protective immunity against SARS-CoV by mediating T-cell responses and neutralizing antibody production (
 <xref rid="B168" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>). In the past few decades, we have seen several attempts to develop a vaccine against human coronaviruses by using S protein as the target (
 <xref rid="B168" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B169" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>). However, the developed vaccines have minimal application, even among closely related strains of the virus, due to a lack of cross-protection. That is mainly because of the extensive diversity existing among the different antigenic variants of the virus (
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>). The contributions of the structural proteins, like spike (S), matrix (M), small envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, of SARS-CoV to induce protective immunity has been evaluated by expressing them in a recombinant parainfluenza virus type 3 vector (BHPIV3). Of note, the result was conclusive that the expression of M, E, or N proteins without the presence of S protein would not confer any noticeable protection, with the absence of detectable serum SARS-CoV-neutralizing antibodies (
 <xref rid="B170" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>). Antigenic determinant sites present over S and N structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 can be explored as suitable vaccine candidates (
 <xref rid="B294" ref-type="bibr">294</xref>). In the Asian population, S, E, M, and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are being targeted for developing subunit vaccines against COVID-19 (
