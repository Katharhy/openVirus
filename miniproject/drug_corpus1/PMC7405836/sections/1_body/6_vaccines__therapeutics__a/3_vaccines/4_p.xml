<p>Multiepitope subunit vaccines can be considered a promising preventive strategy against the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 
 <italic>In silico</italic> and advanced immunoinformatic tools can be used to develop multiepitope subunit vaccines. The vaccines that are engineered by this technique can be further evaluated using docking studies and, if found effective, then can be further evaluated in animal models (

The immunoinformatics approach has been used for recognizing essential epitopes of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and B cells from the surface glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Recently, a few epitopes have been recognized from the SARS-CoV-2 surface glycoprotein. The selected epitopes explored targeting molecular dynamic simulations, evaluating their interaction with corresponding major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. They potentially induce immune responses (

RV can be made to express MERS-CoV S1 protein on its surface so that an immune response is induced against MERS-CoV. The RV vector-based vaccines against MERS-CoV can induce faster antibody response as well as higher degrees of cellular immunity than the Gram-positive enhancer matrix (GEM) particle vector-based vaccine. However, the latter can induce a very high antibody response at lower doses (
