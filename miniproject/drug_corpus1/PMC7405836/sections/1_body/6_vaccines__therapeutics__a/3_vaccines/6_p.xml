<p>The collaborative effort of the researchers of Rocky Mountain Laboratories and Oxford University is designing a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine to counter COVID-19 (

 <xref rid="B181" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>). CEPI has a collaborative project with Inovio for designing a MERS-CoV DNA vaccine that could potentiate effective immunity. CEPI and the University of Queensland are designing a molecular clamp vaccine platform for MERS-CoV and other pathogens, which could assist in the easier identification of antigens by the immune system (

On 16 March 2020, Jennifer Haller became the first person outside China to receive an experimental vaccine, developed by Moderna, against this pandemic virus. Moderna, along with China’s CanSino Biologics, became the first research group to launch small clinical trials of vaccines against COVID-19. Their study is evaluating the vaccine’s safety and ability to trigger immune responses (
