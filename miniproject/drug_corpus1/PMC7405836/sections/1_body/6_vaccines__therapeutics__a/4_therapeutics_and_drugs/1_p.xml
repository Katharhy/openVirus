<p>There is no currently licensed specific antiviral treatment for MERS- and SARS-CoV infections, and the main focus in clinical settings remains on lessening clinical signs and providing supportive care (

Effective drugs to manage COVID-19 patients include remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir alone or in a blend with interferon beta, convalescent plasma, and monoclonal antibodies (MAbs); however, efficacy and safety issues of these drugs require additional clinical trials (

In addition, the use of hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab for their potential role in modulating inflammatory responses in the lungs and antiviral effect has been proposed and discussed in many research articles. Still, no fool-proof clinical trials have been published (
