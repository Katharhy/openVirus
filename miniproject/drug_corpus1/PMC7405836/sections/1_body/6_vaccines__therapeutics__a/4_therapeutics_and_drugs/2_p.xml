Presently, the main course of treatment for severely affected SARS-CoV-2 patients admitted to hospitals includes mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admittance, and symptomatic and supportive therapies. Additionally, RNA synthesis inhibitors (lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), remdesivir, neuraminidase inhibitors, peptide (EK1), anti-inflammatory drugs, abidol, and Chinese traditional medicine (Lianhuaqingwen and ShuFengJieDu capsules) could aid in COVID-19 treatment. However, further clinical trials are being carried out concerning their safety and efficacy (

It might require months to a year(s) to design and develop effective drugs, therapeutics, and vaccines against COVID-19, with adequate evaluation and approval from regulatory bodies and moving to the bulk production of many millions of doses at commercial levels to meet the timely demand of mass populations across the globe (
