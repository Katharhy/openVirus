<p>Recently, an experimental study with rhesus monkeys as animal models revealed the absence of any viral loads in nasopharyngeal and anal swabs, and no viral replication was recorded in the primary tissues at a time interval of 5â€‰days post-reinfection in reexposed monkeys (

The subsequent virological, radiological, and pathological observations indicated that the monkeys with reexposure had no recurrence of COVID-19, like the SARS-CoV-2-infected monkeys without rechallenge. These findings suggest that primary infection with SARS-CoV-2 could protect from later exposures to the virus, which could help in defining disease prognosis and crucial inferences for designing and developing potent vaccines against COVID-19 (
