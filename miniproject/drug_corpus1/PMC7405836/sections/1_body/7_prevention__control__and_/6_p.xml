<p>The occurrence of COVID-19 infection on several cruise ships gave us a preliminary idea regarding the transmission pattern of the disease. Cruise ships act as a closed environment and provide an ideal setting for the occurrence of respiratory disease outbreaks. Such a situation poses a significant threat to travelers, since people from different countries are on board, which favors the introduction of the pathogen (

The success of preventive measures put forward by every country is mainly dependent upon their ability to anticipate the approaching waves of patients. This will help to properly prepare the health care workers and increase the intensive care unit (ICU) capacity (

Instead of entirely relying on lockdown protocols, countries should focus mainly on alternative intervention strategies, such as large-scale testing, contract tracing, and localized quarantine of suspected cases for limiting the spread of this pandemic virus. Such intervention strategies will be useful either at the beginning of the pandemic or after lockdown relaxation (
