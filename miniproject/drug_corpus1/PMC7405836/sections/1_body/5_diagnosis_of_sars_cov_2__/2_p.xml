<p>Recently, 95 full-length genomic sequences of SARAS-CoV-2 strains available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information and GISAID databases were subjected to multiple-sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses for studying variations in the viral genome (
 <xref rid="B260" ref-type="bibr">260</xref>). All the viral strains revealed high homology of 99.99% (99.91% to 100%) at the nucleotide level and 99.99% (99.79% to 100%) at the amino acid level. Overall variation was found to be low in ORF regions, with 13 variation sites recognized in 1a, 1b, S, 3a, M, 8, and N regions. Mutation rates of 30.53% (29/95) and 29.47% (28/95) were observed at nt 28144 (ORF8) and nt 8782 (ORF1a) positions, respectively. Owing to such selective mutations, a few specific regions of SARS-CoV-2 should not be considered for designing primers and probes. The SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence could pave the way to study molecular biology and pathobiology, along with developing diagnostics and appropriate prevention and control strategies for countering SARS-CoV-2 (
