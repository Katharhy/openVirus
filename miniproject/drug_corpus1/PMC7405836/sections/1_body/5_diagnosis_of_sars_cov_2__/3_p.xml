<p>Nucleic acids of SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from samples (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>) such as bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, sputum, nasal swabs, fiber bronchoscope brush biopsy specimen, pharyngeal swabs, feces, blood, and urine, with different levels of diagnostic performance (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B245" ref-type="bibr">245</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B246" ref-type="bibr">246</xref>). The viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 were measured using N-gene-specific quantitative RT-PCR in throat swab and sputum samples collected from COVID-19-infected individuals. The results indicated that the viral load peaked at around 5 to 6â€‰days following the onset of symptoms, and it ranged from 10
 <sup>4</sup> to 10
 <sup>7</sup> copies/ml during this time (
 <xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>). In another study, the viral load was found to be higher in the nasal swabs than the throat swabs obtained from COVID-19 symptomatic patients (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>). Although initially it was thought that viral load would be associated with poor outcomes, some case reports have shown asymptomatic individuals with high viral loads (
 <xref rid="B247" ref-type="bibr">247</xref>). Recently, the viral load in nasal and throat swabs of 17 symptomatic patients was determined, and higher viral loads were recorded soon after the onset of symptoms, particularly in the nose compared to the throat. The pattern of viral nucleic acid shedding of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients was similar to that of influenza patients but seemed to be different from that of SARS-CoV patients. The viral load detected in asymptomatic patients resembled that of symptomatic patients as studied in China, which reflects the transmission perspective of asymptomatic or symptomatic patients having minimum signs and symptoms (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>). Another study, conducted in South Korea, related to SARS-CoV-2 viral load, opined that SARS-CoV-2 kinetics were significantly different from those of earlier reported CoV infections, including SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="B253" ref-type="bibr">253</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 transmission can occur early in the viral infection phase; thus, diagnosing cases and isolation attempts for this virus warrant different strategies than those needed to counter SARS-CoV. Studies are required to establish any correlation between SARS-CoV-2 viral load and cultivable virus. Recognizing patients with fewer or no symptoms, along with having modest detectable viral RNA in the oropharynx for 5 days, indicates the requirement of data for assessing SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics and updating the screening procedures in the clinics (
