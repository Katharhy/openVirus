<p>Chest CT is an ideal diagnostic tool for identifying viral pneumonia. The sensitivity of chest CT is far superior to that of X-ray screening. The chest CT findings associated with COVID-19-infected patients include characteristic patchy infiltration that later progresses to ground-glass opacities (

These abnormalities progress from the initial focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities and will further progress to or coexist with lung consolidation changes within 1 to 3 weeks (

Radiologists can help in the early diagnosis of lung abnormalities associated with COVID-19 pneumonia. They can also help in the evaluation of disease severity, identifying its progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome and the presence of secondary bacterial infections (

Even though chest CT is considered an essential diagnostic tool for COVID-19, the extensive use of CT for screening purposes in the suspected individuals might be associated with a disproportionate risk-benefit ratio due to increased radiation exposure as well as increased risk of cross-infection. Hence, the use of CT for early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in high-risk groups should be done with great caution (
