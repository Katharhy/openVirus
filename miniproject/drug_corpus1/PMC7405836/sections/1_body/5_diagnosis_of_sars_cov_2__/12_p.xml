<p>Tracking and mapping of the rising incidence rates, disease outbreaks, community spread, clustered transmission events, hot spots, and superspreader potential of SARS-CoV-2/COVID warrant full exploitation of real-time disease mapping by employing geographical information systems (GIS), such as the GIS software Kosmo 3.1, web-based real-time tools and dashboards, apps, and advances in information technology (

Researchers have also developed a few prediction tools/models, such as the prediction model risk of bias assessment tool (PROBAST) and critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modeling studies (CHARMS), which could aid in assessing the possibility of getting infection and estimating the prognosis in patients; however, such models may suffer from bias issues and, hence, cannot be considered completely trustworthy, which necessitates the development of new and reliable predictors (
