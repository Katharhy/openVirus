<p>The lower respiratory tract sampling techniques, like bronchoalveolar lavage fluid aspirate, are considered the ideal clinical materials, rather than the throat swab, due to their higher positive rate on the nucleic acid test (
 <xref rid="B148" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>). The diagnosis of COVID-19 can be made by using upper-respiratory-tract specimens collected using nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. However, these techniques are associated with unnecessary risks to health care workers due to close contact with patients (
 <xref rid="B152" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>). Similarly, a single patient with a high viral load was reported to contaminate an entire endoscopy room by shedding the virus, which may remain viable for at least 3 days and is considered a great risk for uninfected patients and health care workers (
 <xref rid="B289" ref-type="bibr">289</xref>). Recently, it was found that the anal swabs gave more positive results than oral swabs in the later stages of infection (
 <xref rid="B153" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>). Hence, clinicians have to be cautious while discharging any COVID-19-infected patient based on negative oral swab test results due to the possibility of fecal-oral transmission. Even though the viral loads in stool samples were found to be less than those of respiratory samples, strict precautionary measures have to be followed while handling stool samples of COVID-19 suspected or infected patients (
 <xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>). Children infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience only a mild form of illness and recover immediately after treatment. It was recently found that stool samples of SARS-CoV-2-infected children that gave negative throat swab results were positive within ten days of negative results. This could result in the fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infections, especially in children (
 <xref rid="B290" ref-type="bibr">290</xref>). Hence, to prevent the fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2, infected COVID-19 patients should only be considered negative when they test negative for SARS-CoV-2 in the stool sample.
