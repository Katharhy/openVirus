<p>Coronaviruses are positive-sense RNA viruses having an extensive and promiscuous range of natural hosts and affect multiple systems (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Coronaviruses can cause clinical diseases in humans that may extend from the common cold to more severe respiratory diseases like SARS and MERS (

 <xref rid="B279" ref-type="bibr">279</xref>). The recently emerging SARS-CoV-2 has wrought havoc in China and caused a pandemic situation in the worldwide population, leading to disease outbreaks that have not been controlled to date, although extensive efforts are being put in place to counter this virus (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). This virus has been proposed to be designated/named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), which determined the virus belongs to the 
 <italic>Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus</italic> category and found this virus is related to SARS-CoVs (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the order 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic>, family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>, subfamily 
 <italic>Orthocoronavirinae</italic>, which is subdivided into four genera, 
 <italic>viz.</italic>, 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Gammacoronavirus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Deltacoronavirus</italic> (

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). The genera 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> originate from bats, while 
 <italic>Gammacoronavirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Deltacoronavirus</italic> have evolved from bird and swine gene pools (
