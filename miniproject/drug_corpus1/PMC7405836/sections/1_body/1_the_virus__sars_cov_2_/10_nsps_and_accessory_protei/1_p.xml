<p>Besides the important structural proteins, the SARS-CoV-2 genome contains 15 nsps, nsp1 to nsp10 and nsp12 to nsp16, and 8 accessory proteins (3a, 3b, p6, 7a, 7b, 8b, 9b, and ORF14) (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). All these proteins play a specific role in viral replication (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Unlike the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 does not contain 8a protein and has a longer 8b and shorter 3b protein (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The nsp7, nsp13, envelope, matrix, and p6 and 8b accessory proteins have not been detected with any amino acid substitutions compared to the sequences of other coronaviruses (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).
