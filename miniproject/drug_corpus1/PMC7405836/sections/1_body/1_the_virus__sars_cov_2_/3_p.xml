<p>Based on molecular characterization, SARS-CoV-2 is considered a new 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> belonging to the subgenus 
 <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). A few other critical zoonotic viruses (MERS-related CoV and SARS-related CoV) belong to the same genus. However, SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a distinct virus based on the percent identity with other 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>; conserved open reading frame 1a/b (ORF1a/b) is below 90% identity (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). An overall 80% nucleotide identity was observed between SARS-CoV-2 and the original SARS-CoV, along with 89% identity with ZC45 and ZXC21 SARS-related CoVs of bats (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). In addition, 82% identity has been observed between SARS-CoV-2 and human SARS-CoV Tor2 and human SARS-CoV BJ01 2003 (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). A sequence identity of only 51.8% was observed between MERS-related CoV and the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis of the structural genes also revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is closer to bat SARS-related CoV. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 might have originated from bats, while other amplifier hosts might have played a role in disease transmission to humans (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Of note, the other two zoonotic CoVs (MERS-related CoV and SARS-related CoV) also originated from bats (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Nevertheless, for SARS and MERS, civet cat and camels, respectively, act as amplifier hosts (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).
