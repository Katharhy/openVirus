<p>Coronavirus genomes and subgenomes encode six ORFs (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The majority of the 5′ end is occupied by ORF1a/b, which produces 16 nsps. The two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, are initially produced from ORF1a/b by a −1 frameshift between ORF1a and ORF1b (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The virus-encoded proteases cleave polyproteins into individual nsps (main protease [Mpro], chymotrypsin-like protease [3CLpro], and papain-like proteases [PLPs]) (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 also encodes these nsps, and their functions have been elucidated recently (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Remarkably, a difference between SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs is the identification of a novel short putative protein within the ORF3 band, a secreted protein with an alpha helix and beta-sheet with six strands encoded by ORF8 (
