<p>The coronavirus E protein is the most enigmatic and smallest of the major structural proteins (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). It plays a multifunctional role in the pathogenesis, assembly, and release of the virus (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). It is a small integral membrane polypeptide that acts as a viroporin (ion channel) (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). The inactivation or absence of this protein is related to the altered virulence of coronaviruses due to changes in morphology and tropism (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). The E protein consists of three domains, namely, a short hydrophilic amino terminal, a large hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and an efficient C-terminal domain (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). The SARS-CoV-2 E protein reveals a similar amino acid constitution without any substitution (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).
