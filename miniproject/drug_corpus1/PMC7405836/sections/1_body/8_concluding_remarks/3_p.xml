<p>The present outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 was, indeed, expected. Similar to previous outbreaks, the current pandemic also will be contained shortly. However, the real question is, how are we planning to counter the next zoonotic CoV epidemic that is likely to occur within the next 5 to 10â€‰years or perhaps sooner? Our knowledge of most of the bat CoVs is scarce, as these viruses have not been isolated and studied, and extensive studies on such viruses are typically only conducted when they are associated with specific disease outbreaks. The next step following the control of the COVID-19 outbreak in China should be focused on screening, identification, isolation, and characterization of CoVs present in wildlife species of China, particularly in bats. Both

 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies (using suitable animal models) should be conducted to evaluate the risk of future epidemics. Presently, licensed antiviral drugs or vaccines against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are lacking. However, advances in designing antiviral drugs and vaccines against several other emerging diseases will help develop suitable therapeutic agents against COVID-19 in a short time. Until then, we must rely exclusively on various control and prevention measures to prevent this new disease from becoming a pandemic.
