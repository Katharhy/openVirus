<p>Following the outbreak of SARS in China, SARS-CoV-like viruses were isolated from Himalayan palm civets (
 <italic>Paguma larvata</italic>) and raccoon dogs (
 <italic>Nyctereutes procyonoides</italic>) found in a live-animal market in Guangdong, China. The animal isolates obtained from the live-animal market retained a 29-nucleotide sequence that was not present in most of the human isolates (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>). These findings were critical in identifying the possibility of interspecies transmission in SARS-CoV. The higher diversity and prevalence of bat coronaviruses in this region compared to those in previous reports indicate a host/pathogen coevolution. SARS-like coronaviruses also have been found circulating in the Chinese horseshoe bat (
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Rhinolophus sinicus</named-content>) populations. The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies carried out on the isolated virus confirmed that there is a potential risk for the reemergence of SARS-CoV infection from the viruses that are currently circulating in the bat population (
