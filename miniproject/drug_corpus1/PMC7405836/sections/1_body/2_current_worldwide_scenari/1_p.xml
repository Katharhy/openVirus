<p>This novel virus, SARS-CoV-2, comes under the subgenus 
 <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> of the 
 <italic>Orthocoronavirinae</italic> subfamily and is entirely different from the viruses responsible for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 is a group 2B coronavirus (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from patients share 79.5% sequence similarity to the sequence of SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>).
