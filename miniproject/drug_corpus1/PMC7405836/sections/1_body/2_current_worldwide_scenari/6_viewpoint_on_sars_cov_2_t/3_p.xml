<p>Notably, the reanalysis of the COVID-19 pandemic curve from the initial cluster of cases pointed to considerable human-to-human transmission. It is opined that the exposure history of SARS-CoV-2 at the Wuhan seafood market originated from human-to-human transmission rather than animal-to-human transmission (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>); however, in light of the zoonotic spillover in COVID-19, is too early to fully endorse this idea (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Following the initial infection, human-to-human transmission has been observed with a preliminary reproduction number (R
 <sub>0</sub>) estimate of 1.4 to 2.5 (

 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>), and recently it is estimated to be 2.24 to 3.58 (
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>). In another study, the average reproductive number of COVID-19 was found to be 3.28, which is significantly higher than the initial WHO estimate of 1.4 to 2.5 (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). It is too early to obtain the exact R
 <sub>0</sub> value, since there is a possibility of bias due to insufficient data. The higher R
 <sub>0</sub> value is indicative of the more significant potential of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a susceptible population. This is not the first time where the culinary practices of China have been blamed for the origin of novel coronavirus infection in humans. Previously, the animals present in the live-animal market were identified to be the intermediate hosts of the SARS outbreak in China (

 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). One of the main principles of Chinese food culture is that live-slaughtered animals are considered more nutritious (
