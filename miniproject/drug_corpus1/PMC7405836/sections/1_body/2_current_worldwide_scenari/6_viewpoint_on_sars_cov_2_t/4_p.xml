<p>After 4 months of struggle that lasted from December 2019 to March 2020, the COVID-19 situation now seems under control in China. The wet animal markets have reopened, and people have started buying bats, dogs, cats, birds, scorpions, badgers, rabbits, pangolins (scaly anteaters), minks, soup from palm civet, ostriches, hamsters, snapping turtles, ducks, fish, Siamese crocodiles, and other animal meats without any fear of COVID-19. The Chinese government is encouraging people to feel they can return to normalcy. However, this could be a risk, as it has been mentioned in advisories that people should avoid contact with live-dead animals as much as possible, as SARS-CoV-2 has shown zoonotic spillover. Additionally, we cannot rule out the possibility of new mutations in the same virus being closely related to contact with both animals and humans at the market (
