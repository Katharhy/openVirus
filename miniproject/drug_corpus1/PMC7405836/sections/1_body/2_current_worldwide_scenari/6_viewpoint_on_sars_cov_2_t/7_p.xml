<p>Increasing reports of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage and wastewater warrants the need for further investigation due to the possibility of fecal-oral transmission. SARS-CoV-2 present in environmental compartments such as soil and water will finally end up in the wastewater and sewage sludge of treatment plants (
 <xref rid="B328" ref-type="bibr">328</xref>). Therefore, we have to reevaluate the current wastewater and sewage sludge treatment procedures and introduce advanced techniques that are specific and effective against SARS-CoV-2. Since there is active shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in the stool, the prevalence of infections in a large population can be studied using wastewater-based epidemiology. Recently, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to enumerate the copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrated from wastewater collected from a wastewater treatment plant (
 <xref rid="B327" ref-type="bibr">327</xref>). The calculated viral RNA copy numbers determine the number of infected individuals. The increasing reports of virus shedding via the fecal route warrants the introduction of negative fecal viral nucleic acid test results as one of the additional discharge criteria in laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 (
