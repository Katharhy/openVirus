<p>Phylogenetic analysis of 10 whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 showed that they are related to two CoVs of bat origin, namely, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, which were reported during 2018 in China (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been confirmed to use ACE2 as an entry receptor while exhibiting an RBD similar to that of SARS-CoV (

 <xref rid="B254" ref-type="bibr">254</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B255" ref-type="bibr">255</xref>). Several countries have provided recommendations to their people traveling to China (

Compared to the previous coronavirus outbreaks caused by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 human-to-human transmission was thought to be less. This assumption was based on the finding that health workers were affected less than they were in previous outbreaks of fatal coronaviruses (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Superspreading events are considered the main culprit for the extensive transmission of SARS and MERS (
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>). Almost half of the MERS-CoV cases reported in Saudi Arabia are of secondary origin that occurred through contact with infected asymptomatic or symptomatic individuals through human-to-human transmission (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>). The occurrence of superspreading events in the COVID-19 outbreak cannot be ruled out until its possibility is evaluated. Like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 can also infect the lower respiratory tract, with milder symptoms (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). The basic reproduction number of COVID-19 has been found to be in the range of 2.8 to 3.3 based on real-time reports and 3.2 to 3.9 based on predicted infected cases (
