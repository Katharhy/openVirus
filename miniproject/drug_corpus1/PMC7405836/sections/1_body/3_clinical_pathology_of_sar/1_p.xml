<p>The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is also named severe specific contagious pneumonia (SSCP), Wuhan pneumonia, and, recently, COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>). Compared to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has less severe pathogenesis but has superior transmission capability, as evidenced by the rapidly increasing number of COVID-19 cases (
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>). The incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 in familial clusters was found to be 3 to 6 days (
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>). The mean incubation period of COVID-19 was found to be 6.4 days, ranging from 2.1 to 11.1 days (
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>). Among an early affected group of 425 patients, 59 years was the median age, of which more males were affected (
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>). Similar to SARS and MERS, the severity of this nCoV is high in age groups above 50 years (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>). Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, myalgia or fatigue, and, less commonly, headache, hemoptysis, and diarrhea (
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B282" ref-type="bibr">282</xref>). Compared to the SARS-CoV-2-infected patients in Wuhan during the initial stages of the outbreak, only mild symptoms were noticed in those patients that are infected by human-to-human transmission (
