<p>COVID-19 infection was associated with pneumonia, and some developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The blood biochemistry indexes, such as albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, lymphocytes (percent), and neutrophils (percent) give an idea about the disease severity in COVID-19 infection (

 <xref rid="B244" ref-type="bibr">244</xref>), hypoalbuminemia, and an increase of lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate transaminase, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, and, especially, D-dimer (

Middle-aged and elderly patients with primary chronic diseases, especially high blood pressure and diabetes, were found to be more susceptible to respiratory failure and, therefore, had poorer prognoses. Providing respiratory support at early stages improved the disease prognosis and facilitated recovery (

In addition to the exaggerated inflammatory response seen in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, the bile duct epithelial cell-derived hepatocytes upregulate ACE2 expression in liver tissue by compensatory proliferation that might result in hepatic tissue injury (
