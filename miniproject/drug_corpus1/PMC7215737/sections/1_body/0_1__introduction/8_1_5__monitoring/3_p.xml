<p>Other DH interventions have the potential to provide unique data to help us understand the possible effects of COVID-19 on patients with comorbidities. Steinhubl et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-ijerph-17-02906" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] studied the use of a wearable, wireless “Band-Aid” sensor to monitor patients exposed to the Ebola virus. Additionally, Hexoskin repurposed biometric shirts that are capable of continuously measuring vital signs, including temperature, respiration effort, and cardiac activity, to better understand the evolution of COVID-19 and its effects on lung function [

Infectious respiratory diseases, such as COVID-19, have the potential to worsen symptoms of pre-existing lung disease, and thus exacerbate the use of emergency medications. Increased use of inhaled emergency medication can be detected using a smart inhaler [
