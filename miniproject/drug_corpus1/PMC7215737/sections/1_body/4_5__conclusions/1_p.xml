<p>Digital Health provides an opportunity to use real-time data to improve the prevention and control of the rapidly changing nature of epidemics. Recent SARS, H1N1, and Ebola outbreaks offer many lessons about the use of DH for public health emergencies. These learnings can be transferred to new effective technologies to enhance our response against the COVID-19 pandemic. DH has the potential to strengthen our preparedness for the next pandemic. We need to have these tools locked and loaded for our next war against infectious disease.</p>
