<p>It is important to note that the DH implementation process is likely to be challenging and resource-intensive. For example, the lack of homogenous interventions poses a significant challenge in applying DH interventions. The lack of homogeneity leads to variations in the nature of DH interventions and data collection methods. Such differences could limit model generalizability and limit understandings of the effectiveness of DH. Governments will need to work with all experts and stakeholders to embed secure DH interventions into practice while maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of patients. It is also important to consider that some countries may not have the technological infrastructure to support DH. Furthermore, there will be a significant proportion of the population who will not have access to technology or internet connectivity. </p>
