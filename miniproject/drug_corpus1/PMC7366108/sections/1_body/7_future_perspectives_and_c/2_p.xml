<p id="p0180">Despite enormous worldwide endeavors to restrict COVID-19 infection caused by SARS-CoV-2, the virus's spread has achieved an epidemic stage. There have been numerous warnings to glean from the worldwide response to the SARS-COV-2 threat. The nonexistence of a trustworthy, reliable, early alert and response system, failure to mount containment actions, a paucity of community commitment for self-isolation, and overdependence on quarantining measures have uncovered the clefts in the competence of health systems worldwide. The COVID-19 outbreak has clearly shown the anemic preparation against evolving and re-emerging dangerous pathogens across the world. The source of the outbreak, the intermediate host, an effective treatment regimen, tools for early diagnosis in asymptomatic patients, and tools to predict the emergence of novel pathogens all remain elusive. It is now well established that SARS-CoV-2 enters cells by attaching to specific ACE-2 receptors, which are widely expressed in the respiratory tract, brain, liver, bile duct, lower GIT, and kidney. Thus, all these organs remain on the verge of damage by COVID-19. Keeping in view the global threat to public health instigated by SARS-CoV-2, an efficient prevention system as well as medication for COVID-19 pneumonia is instantly required. Even though the development of COVIS-19 therapeutics and vaccines is in its childhood stage, but still researchers across the globe have met with some substantial progress starting from elucidating out structure, full genomic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2, pathogenesis of COVID-19 and up to the commencement of clinical trials with COVID-19 drugs and vaccines.</p>
