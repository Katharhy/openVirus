<p id="p0185">Nevertheless, the development of medication for SARS-CoV-2 is still a prime dilemma for humans, and there is currently no clinically approved drug to combat COVID-19 except remdesivir (recently approved by FDA for emergency use in and only severely ill hospitalized patients). Health care professionals are making use of the repurposed drugs (drugs with limited proof for containing COVID-19) to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, in addition to clinical trials of new drugs and testing repurposed drugs, an exceptional strategy is urgently required for the development of new vaccines for COVID-19. Knowledge gained from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreak implies that SARS-CoV-2 research in the future should emphasize mainly on the creation and development of animal models that summarize and replicate the various clinical facets of COVID-19 and act as contributing factor of development of safe and efficacious drugs/vaccines.</p>
