<p id="p0175">The development of a new vaccine to contain COVID-19 infection is conceivably the safest way to end this pandemic. At present, there is no vaccine candidate to prevent COVID-19, but many of investigators are battling to create an effective and safe one [

 <bold>
  <italic>Developing Safe and efficient vaccine:</italic>
 </bold> Numerous vaccines have been developed during SARS and MERS outbreak and tested for their efficacy in animals. Nearly all of them enhanced the animals' survival but unsuccessful in combating infection, whereas some of them caused complications, such as lung damage. Therefore, COVID-19 has to be thoroughly tested to ensure its safety for humans, (ii) 
 <bold>
  <italic>Deliver enduring defense:</italic>
 </bold> A safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine should be able to provide a long-lasting shield against CoV as it has been seen that after infection with CoVs, there may be chances of re-infection with the same virus after months or years, although this is the case with a fraction of people, (iii) 
 <bold>
  <italic>Defending elderly population:</italic>
 </bold> Older people are highly vulnerable to COVID-19 and typically do not respond to vaccination. Therefore, an exemplar COVID-19 vaccine should work well for this older age group. Keeping in view the aforementioned challenges, several universities, global health care authorities/groups, and vaccine developers are currently partnering to support each other in this crucial time to produce vaccines. A list of COVID-19 vaccines currently undergoing clinical trials has been summarized in
