<p id="p0070">One of the widely studied cell proteases in SARS-Cov-2 is proprotein convertase furin. Coutard et al. [
 <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] observed that the furin-like cleavage site (PRRAR↓SV) is absent in lineage B beta-coronaviruses except in SARS-Cov-2 [
 <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The presence of proline in this furin-like cleavage site generates a turn in the polypeptide, which facilitates the addition of O-linked glycans to the amino acid residues flanking the cleavage site, specifically to S673, T678 and S686. The role of these O-linked glycans is not known precisely; however, they could produce a ‘mucin-like domain’ to protect crucial amino acid residues or epitopes on the S-protein. The high expression of furin in the lungs suggests the high pathogenicity of this virus in the human respiratory system [

Gene expression studies have shown that ACE2 occurs primarily in alveolar epithelial type II cells of lungs, heart, kidney, adipose tissue, and nasal epithelial cells (specifically in goblet cells and ciliated cells). Studies through surface plasmon resonance have proven that the ACE2 binds to the SARS-CoV-2 ectodomain with about 10- to 20-fold higher affinity as compared to SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The crucial K residue at 31 in hACE2 identifies the Q residue at 394 in the RBD region of SARS-CoV-2. Bioinformatical analysis by Wan et al. [
 <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] has predicted that the single N501T mutation in RBD of S-protein might lead to an augmented binding affinity for ACE2. The residues at positions 442, 472, 479, 487, and 491 in S-protein are crucial as these are located at the receptor complex interface with ACE2 [
