<p id="p0065">The NTD of S1 displays a galectin (galactose-binding lectins) structural fold to get attached to the sugar on the surface of the host cell. On the other hand, binding to the ACE-2 is assisted by the CTD of S1. The CTD comprises two subdomains: a central structure made up of five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and the RBD, which governs the specificity of receptor binding [
 <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The extended insertion (between the β4 and β7 strands) of the RBD contains some of the crucial residues required for receptor binding. [
 <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] showed the formation of a hACE2 dimer in the presence of an amino acid transporter B0AT1. Two molecules of CTD are individually attached to this dimeric hACE2-B0AT1 form, with a local resolution of 3.5A° at the interface. The RBD endures hinge-like conformational movements to cover or uncover the elements of receptor binding momentarily to enhance the host-cell interactions [

 <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The S2 is made up of the fusion peptide (FP), a cleavage site (S2′), an internal fusion peptide (IFP), and two heptad-repeat domains before the transmembrane domain (TM) (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Since both FP and IFP are essential for the virus entry into the host cell [
 <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], S protein is required to be cleaved by proteases at both priming and activating cleavage sites to release out these peptides [
 <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, there are ambiguous views about the second cleavage at S2’ site. [
 <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] described that the second cleavage occurs after the first furin cleavage at the conserved site sequence (AYT↓M) in S2’. On the other hand, [
 <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] showed that the different proteases could cleave at KR↓SF to generate a downstream fusion peptide (S-F-I-E-D-L-L-F) in the S2′ site. This cleavage is followed by the conformational change induced fusion of membrane, in which newly generated peptide incorporates itself into the host cell membrane [
