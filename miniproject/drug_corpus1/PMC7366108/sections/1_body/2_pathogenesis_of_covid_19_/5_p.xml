<p id="p0075">After the fusion of viral lipid bilayer through the endosomal pathway, SARS-Cov-2 injects its RNA into the host cell cytoplasm. Once inside the cytoplasm, it is translated into two polyproteins (pp1a and 1ab) and structural proteins. The polyproteins are further processed and cleaved by different proteases to form a replicase-transcriptase complex. The newly synthesized polymerases produce various sub-genomic mRNAs by the discontinuous transcription, which gets translated into related viral proteins [

Here, nsps play an essential role by reorganizing the membranes coming from the ERGIC into the double-membrane vesicles, where viral replication and transcription occur [
