<p id="p0155">A recent study on pediatric patients with COVID-19 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2143) observed that marginally more boys (56.6%) are influenced in the COVID-19 outbreak as compared to girls (43.4%) but with non-significant gender difference. The median age is seven years, age varies from 1 day to 18 years. This is suggestive of the fact that all ages in childhood are equally susceptible to SARD-CoV-2 [

This difference may be associated with exposure time as well as host factors. ACE-2 is a cell receptor for entry of SARS-CoV-2 and is hypothesized that children are less responsive to SARS-CoV-2, because the less maturity and function of ACE 2 in children than that in adults [

However, it has been documented that the percentage of severe COVID-19 cases in children is 10.6%, 7.3%, 4.2%, 4.1%, and 3.0% in the age group of ˂1, 1–5, 6–10, 11–15 and &gt; 15 years, respectively. These findings are suggestive of the fact that infants are extra susceptible to COVID-19 infection. Consequently, the precise mechanisms for the discrepancy in clinical symptoms of children and adults remain elusive [
