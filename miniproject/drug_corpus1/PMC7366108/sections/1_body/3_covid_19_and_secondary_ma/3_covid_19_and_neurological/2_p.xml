 <xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. A recent study (
 <italic>n</italic> = 214) concluded that, in addition to systemic and respiratory symptoms, 36.4% (78/214) of total COVID-19 patients develop neurological symptoms [
 <xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Recently reports from UK and China documented that COVID-19 patients showed convulsions, delirium, altered consciousness, restlessness loss of smell (anosmia), and taste (dysgeusia) due to infection in the brain [

 <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>]. The neurological symptoms of COVID-19 can be divided into different stages based on the severity like mild (headache, dizziness, disturbances of the state of consciousness) followed by middle (ataxia, epileptic manifestations, and stroke) and severe (hypo-ageusia, hyposmia, neuralgia) [

 <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>] suggested that COVID-19 might infect respiratory center located in the medulla oblongata and pons (brainstem) that cause breathing problem in patients. Recently published reports also suggest some similarities between SARS-CoV and COVID-19 for following the pathway of infection [

It has been documented that SARS-CoV-2 has been found in CSF and can infect brain cells and subsequently cause viral encephalitis [
