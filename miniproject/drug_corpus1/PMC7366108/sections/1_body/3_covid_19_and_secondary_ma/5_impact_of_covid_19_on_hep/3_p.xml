<p id="p0125">Coming to the latest studies on COVID-19, it has been reported that 14.8% to 53% COVID-19 cases have abnormal ALT/AST levels, with mildly elevated bilirubin levels during the initial stages of the disease (

These results from various studies suggested that damage of bile duct cells may be a significant cause for liver impairment in COVID-19 patients, along with the damage of liver cells. Excessive inflammatory cytokines have been observed in endothelial cells of the bile duct and hepatocytes in severe COVID-19 patients [

However, still, there is a paucity of data concerning the role of SARS-CoV-2 in liver damage and therefore needs more investigation on these biomarkers whether they are responsible for liver damage or not. Recently, in a postmortem biopsy of COVID-19 patient, a moderate level of microvascular steatosis indicates that either SARS-CoV-2 infection or drug used during treatment was the possible cause for liver injury [
