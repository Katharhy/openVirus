<p id="p0115">The etiology or pathogenesis of kidney injury in patients with COVID-19 is not precisely clear but might be due to multiple reasons. It may be due to the direct cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 on kidney tissue, as evidenced by the detection of SARS-CoV-2 fragments in blood and urine in patients with COVID-19. Recent data on human tissue RNA-sequencing denoted that ACE-2 expression in kidneys is almost ten times greater as compared to that in the lungs [

 <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>]. Hence, we can conclude that the renal failure might be raised due to coronavirus entering in the kidney cells through an ACE2-dependent pathway. Other supposed mechanisms may be the immune responses generated by the human body against this virus i.e. specific effector mechanisms of immune system induced by this virus (specific antibody or specific T-cell lymphocyte) may cause damage to the kidneys. One possible mechanism of renal impairment may be due to hypoxia, shock, and rhabdomyolysis exerted by cytokine storm. Also, dehydration resulting from fever or decreased fluid intake has various impacts on the kidney, ranging from the reduction of glomerular filtration rate to ARI. Further, hydration can reverse the condition in case of mild to moderate fluid depletion. However, if ischemia persists, then acute tubular necrosis may occur. These pathways are expected to be responsible for renal impairment in COVID-19. However, further studies are required to investigate other pathways responsible for renal impairment in COVID-19 patients [

Renal impairment in COVID-19 (Coronavirus induced-nephropathy) has a complicated and unclear etiology; though, ARI in COVID-19 patients is strongly correlated with a high mortality rate. Therefore, to prevent mortality in such conditions, continuous monitoring of renal function in patients with COVID-19 with caution is necessary irrespective of the past disease history, so that early clinical interventions could be taken timely.
