<p id="p0055">The smallest structural protein, E protein, is made up of three domains- N terminal (hydrophilic), class IA transmembrane domain (hydrophobic), and C terminal (hydrophilic). They function as viroporins by modifying the host cell membranes and thus facilitates the release of virus from the infected cells. The M protein provides a distinct shape to the viral envelope by interacting with the nucleocapsid and by specific packaging of the viral genome into the virion. Generally, M proteins in different coronaviruses display variable amino acid contents; however, all contain the same 3-D structure with a small N-terminal, three transmembrane domains, and a long C-terminal. The N protein is multi-functional protein as it is involved in complex formation with single-stranded RNA, enabling M-N protein interactions during the packaging of virion particles, and augmenting the transcription process of the viral genome. N protein is also made up of three conserved domains- an N-terminal domain (NTD), a linker region, and a C-terminal domain (CTD). The highly variable NTD interacts electrostatically with the 3â€² end of the viral RNA. Similarly, the serine and arginine-rich LKR region also interacts with viral RNA in vitro
 <italic>.</italic> However, its main role is in signal transduction, where it acts as an antagonist to attenuate the antiviral responses of the host (for e.g. Interferon, RNAi) [
