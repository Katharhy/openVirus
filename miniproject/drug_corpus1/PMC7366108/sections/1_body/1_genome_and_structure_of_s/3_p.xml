<p id="p0050">The ~1200 aa long glycoprotein spikes are homo-trimeric type-I viral fusion proteins, which is vital to establish the host tropism via the facilitation of receptor binding and membrane fusion [
 <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Each monomer of trimeric S-protein is about 180 kDa and contains a cleavable N-terminal signal peptide, a heavy N-glycosylated ectodomain, a transmembrane region and one cytoplasmic tail with lots of S-acylated C residues. The proteases cleave N-glycosylated ectodomain into two domains: the variable S1 and the more conserved S2 domains (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> ). In general, the S1 domain is associated with receptor-binding events, whereas S2 is involved in membrane fusion [
 <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Structurally, N- and C- terminal of S1 fold as two separate domains: N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD). The CTD contains a loosely attached receptor-binding domain (RBD) to bind with the host cell receptor i.e. ACE2 promptly (refer article by [
 <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] for detailed information). Homology modeling between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV has shown that both have a similar RBD formation. The SARS-CoV-2 RBD has a twisted five-stranded antiparallel β sheet (β1, β2, β3, β4 and β7) with small connecting helices and loops forming as the core. Between the β4 and β7 strands in the core, there is an extended insertion containing short β5 and β6 strands, α4 and α5 helices and loops [
