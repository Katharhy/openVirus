<p id="p0035">CoVs belong to a large family of single-stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA) and are broadly classified into four categories, alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV [
 <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. CoVs can infect humans as well as animals and can cause varieties of infections, including respiratory, enteric, renal, and neurological diseases [
 <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. CoVs occupy a crown-like presence under an electron microscope due to the existence of spike-like glycoproteins on the viral envelope [
 <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to Î²-coronavirus category, which contains shrouded and non-segmented single-stranded RNA virus [
 <xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has shown 96.2% overall similarity with a bat CoV RaTG13 and 79.5% uniformity to SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. CoVs have been shown to penetrate the host cell via different mechanisms, which includes an endosomal and non-endosomal entry with the help of proteases [
 <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is well established now that SARS-CoV-2 makes use of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), the similar receptor used by SARS-CoV, to enter or to infect humans.
