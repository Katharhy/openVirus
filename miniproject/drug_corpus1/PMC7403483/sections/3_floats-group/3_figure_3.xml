  <p>COVID-19 pathogenesis. 1. A. SARS-CoV-2 enters the epithelial cell either via endocytosis or by membrane fusion through binding to ACE2 receptor and releasing its RNA into the cytoplasm. B. Viral RNA uses the cell's machinery to translate its viral non-structural and structural proteins and replicate its RNA. C. Viral structural proteins S, E, and M assemble in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). D. Viral structures and nucleocapsid subsequently assemble in the endoplasmic reticulum golgi intermediate (ERGIC). E. New virion packed in golgi vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane and get released via exocytosis. 2. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces inflammatory factors that lead to activation of macrophages and dendritic cells. 3. Antigen presentation of SARS-CoV-2 via major histocompatibility complexes I and II (MHC I and II) stimulates humoral and cellular immunity resulting in cytokine and antibody production. 4. In severe COVID-19 cases, the virus reaches the lower respiratory tract and infects type II pneumocytes leading to apoptosis and loss of surfactant. The influx of macrophages and neutrophils induces a cytokine storm. Leaky capillaries lead to alveolar edema. Hyaline membrane is formed. All of these pathological changes result in alveolar damage and collapse, impairing gas exchange.</p>
