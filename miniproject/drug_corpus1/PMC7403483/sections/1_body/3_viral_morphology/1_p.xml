<p>Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive single-stranded RNAs with the largest known RNA genome ranging from 26 to 32 kilobases in length (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). They are spherical virions with a core shell and a surface that resembles a solar corona based on its surface protein projections, hence their name (Latin: corona = crown) (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). There are four main subfamilies; alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta- coronaviruses.
