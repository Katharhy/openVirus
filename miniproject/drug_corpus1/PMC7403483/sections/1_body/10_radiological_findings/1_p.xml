<p>Chest CT abnormalities during the early stages of COVID-19 are usually peripheral and focal or multifocal ground-glass opacities affecting both lungs in ~50–75% of patients (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). As the disease progresses, crazy paving and consolidation become the dominant CT findings, peaking around 9–13 days followed by slow clearing at ~1 month and beyond. Up to 50% of patients with COVID-19 infection may have normal chest CT scans 0–2 days after the onset of symptoms (
