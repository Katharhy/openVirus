<p>Compared to the robust clinical literature, there are relatively few published reports on the histopathology of COVID-19, none of which are large series (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Published reports as of the time of this writing (April 25, 2020) are summarized in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The first description of COVID-19 histopathology came from China and consisted of a single case report based on post-mortem core biopsies of the lung, liver and heart (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). This was followed by another publication from China on the pathologic findings in two lobectomies for lung cancer in which the patients developed symptoms of COVID-19 after surgery (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). The authors postulated that the (rather non-specific) findings observed in the lungs possibly represented early COVID-19 pathology. On April 10, 2020, the first findings of complete autopsies in the English literature were described by Barton et al. from the United States (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>).
