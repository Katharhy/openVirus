<p>There has been intense clinical interest around the development of thrombi in a subset of patients with COVID-19. Interestingly, a widespread thrombotic process has not been documented in the majority of pathology specimens examined thus far (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Only one report has illustrated a few thrombi in skin biopsies from three patients who presented with a purpuric rash. No published pathology reports have illustrated widespread multi-organ thrombi in the setting of COVID-19. In future pathology studies, it will be interesting to determine whether the clinical suspicion of widespread “microthrombosis” is confirmed by histopathology, and if so, to determine whether this is common or occurs only in a small subset of cases.
