<p>Thus, far, the most consistently reported finding in COVID-19 has been diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) in the lungs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). This finding has been observed in virtually every published case report or series thus far [
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>–
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>)]. DAD is a pathologic manifestation of severe acute lung injury. It is characterized by the presence of hyaline membranes in the acute stage and interstitial edema and fibroblast proliferation in the organizing stage. We would like to emphasize that DAD is not specific for COVID-19 but has a large list of potential causes, including shock, sepsis, severe trauma, other infections, connective tissue disease, drug toxicity, and toxic inhalants, among others (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>–
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). A subset of cases is idiopathic (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Common secondary pathologic findings in DAD (regardless of etiology) include large, prominent and sometimes atypical type II pneumocytes, squamous metaplasia, and occasional thrombi within small pulmonary arteries. This last point is worth stressing: thrombi in the lung are well-known as a common secondary finding in DAD. They are thought to result from endothelial damage, which is central to the pathogenesis of DAD regardless of etiology. We stress this point to prevent misinterpretation of occasional thrombi in small arteries in the lung in the context of DAD as evidence of a more generalized thrombotic tendency. In fact, prominent thrombi were reported in lungs infected by H1N1, and at the time it was suggested that this finding might be unique to H1N1 (
