<p>The spectrum of illness associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection ranges from mild to severe and even fatal infection. The largest study to date was done by China CDC, which included around 44,672 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study showed that among 44,415 patients, the majority of the cases (81%) were classified as mild disease (i.e., mild pneumonia or no pneumonia) while ~14% were classified as severe disease (i.e., dyspnea with respiratory rate ≥30/min, blood oxygen saturation ≤93%, partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio &lt;300, and/or the development of diffuse lung infiltrates involving more than 50% of the lungs within 24–48 h), and 5% as critical disease (i.e., respiratory failure, shock, and/or multi-organ failure) (
