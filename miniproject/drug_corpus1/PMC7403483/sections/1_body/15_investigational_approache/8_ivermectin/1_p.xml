<p>Ivermectin is an FDA-approved medication for the treatment of various parasites and has an established safety profile in humans. Ivermectin has been shown to inhibit

 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>). This drug has recently demonstrated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> activity against SARS-CoV-2 when a single dose was able to control viral replication within 24–48 h. It is hypothesized that this is likely through the inhibition of importin α/β1 heterodimer, which mediates nuclear import of viral proteins, a process that many RNA viruses rely on during infection (
