A randomized, controlled, open-label trial that included 199 patients assessed the use of lopinavir–ritonavir treatment in patients with SARS-CoV-2 and showed no benefit with administration of the drug compared to standard care alone, which comprised of antibiotics, vasopressors, renal replacement therapy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and/or supplemental oxygen/invasive ventilation if needed.
