<p>Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are shown to inhibit the growth of SARS-CoV-2 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and decrease viral replication in a concentration-dependent manner. Hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent. It has been hypothesized that both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. They may do this by changing the pH at the surface of the cell membrane thereby inhibiting fusion in addition to inhibiting nucleic acid replication, glycosylation, and viral assembly and release (
