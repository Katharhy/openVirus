<p>Montelukast has been shown to suppress oxidative stress and have anti-inflammatory effects. Use of high dose montelukast has been effective in the treatment of acute asthma. Because much of the morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 infection is due to excessive inflammatory processes, it is thought that montelukast may play a role in limiting the progression of disease (

One of the protein complexes involved in cytokine production and inflammatory responses is NF-B (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells). Therefore, inhibition of the NF-B signalizing pathway has been investigated for potential therapeutic options in inflammatory diseases. Montelukast inhibits the signaling of NF-B and other proinflammatory mediators. Its use in COVID-19 infection is currently being studied in a large clinical trial, which is in phase 3, compared with placebo (
