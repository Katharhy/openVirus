<p>An open-label non-randomized clinical trial of 36 patients done in China showed a synergistic effect combining hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection by reducing the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in specimens from the upper respiratory tract (

Another small observational study in China showed that combining hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalized patients had no clinical benefit and no evidence of rapid viral RNA clearance (

Therefore, they should be used with caution in patients with prolonged QTc and those with certain medical conditions such as hepatic or renal disease.
