The most common symptoms reported in the literature so far include fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath, which are similar to other viral infections including the seasonal flu. One study identified 24 critically ill patients from nine Seattle-area hospitals with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection with symptoms beginning 7 Â± 4 days before admission. The most commonly reported symptoms were cough and shortness of breath and around 50% of patients had fever on admission (

Another large study in China that extracted data from 1,099 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 showed that 43.8% of the patients had a fever on admission while 88.7% of patients developed a fever during their hospital stay. The second most commonly reported symptom was cough (67.8%) while fewer patients reported gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea (5%) and diarrhea (3.8%) (
