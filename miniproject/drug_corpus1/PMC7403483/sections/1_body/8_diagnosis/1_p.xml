<p>SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detected via reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) most commonly collected from nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs. In the United States, the CDC recommends the collection of NP swabs for asymptomatic individuals. Instead, specimens from symptomatic patients should be collected from bilateral anterior nares and mid-turbinate. An oropharyngeal (OP) swab could be collected if an NP swab is not possible. The CDC also recommends collecting sputum in patients with a productive cough, however sputum induction is not recommended. Also, when clinically indicted (i.e., patients who are mechanically intubated), a lower respiratory tract sample via a bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) should be collected (
