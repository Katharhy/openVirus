<p>The accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 testing is yet to be established. It has been noted that RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 could be falsely negative either due to insufficient viral load if the specimen is collected too early or too late in the disease course, or due to technical errors like being handled or shipped improperly (

 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). There have been cases reported of patients presenting with classic computed tomography (CT) chest findings (bilateral peripheral distribution with multifocal lower lung involvement) combined with high clinical suspicion for SARS-CoV-2 infection who test negative on RT-PCR (

In a study involving 205 patients, 93% of BAL specimens (14 out of 15) were positive compared to 72% of NP swab specimens (72 out of 104) (
