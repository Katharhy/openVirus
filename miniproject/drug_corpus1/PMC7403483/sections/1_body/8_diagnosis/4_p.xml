<p>In a study conducted by Zhao et al., among 173 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the median seroconversion time for total antibodies, immunoglobulin-M (IgM), and immunoglobulin-G (IgG) against SARS-CoV-2 were day-11, day-12 and day-14, respectively. The presence of antibodies was &lt;40% among patients within 1-week since onset, and rapidly increased to 100.0% for total antibodies, 94.3% for IgM, and 79.8% for IgG on day 15 after onset. In comparison, RNA detectability decreased from 66.7% in samples collected before day 7–45.5% during days 15–39 (
