<p>Given that SARS-CoV-2 is a newly discovered virus, the antibody response in COVID-19 patients remains largely unknown. As of now, RT-PCR-based viral RNA is the current reference standard diagnostic tool for COVID-19 infections, but several studies are suggesting the incorporation of serologic antibody testing to aid in diagnosis of COVID-19 infections. These can be particularly useful in suspected patients with negative RT-PCR-based viral RNA and those with asymptomatic infections. In addition, these tests may improve the sensitivity of COVID-19 pathogenic diagnosis when combined with RTâ€“PCR-based viral RNA testing.</p>
