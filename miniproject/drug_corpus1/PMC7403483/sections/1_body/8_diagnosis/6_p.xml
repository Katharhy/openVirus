<p>Rapid point-of-care testing for SARS-CoV-2, which is also an IgG/IgM based test with a time to result of 20 min has shown a good specificity of 88.9% but low sensitivity of 36.4% making it a less effective test for screening (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). Despite their aid in diagnosis, antibody tests do impose limitations, especially as single screening tools since the sensitivity and specificity of serologic antibody tests are highly variable. Also, it might take several days from the onset of infection for the body to formulate these antibodies.
