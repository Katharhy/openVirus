<p>In terms of infectivity, the basic reproductive number (R0), which is defined as the expected average number of additional infectious cases that one infectious case can generate, was thought to range from 2.2 to 2.7 for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the early stages of the epidemic in China. This means that one person infected with SARS-CoV-2 can spread the infection to ~2.2â€“2.7 people (

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). This number is subject to change with the progression of this pandemic, especially following the introduction of better control measures (
