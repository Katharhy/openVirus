<p>According to current evidence, the WHO reports that SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs via respiratory droplets and contact routes. Droplet transmission occurs through direct contact when a person is exposed to infective respiratory droplets when they are within 1 m of someone with respiratory symptoms including coughing and sneezing. Being within this distance puts the individual at risk of having their mucous membranes, including their mouth, nose and eyes, exposed to the droplets. Transmission can also occur through indirect contact by way of fomites on surfaces in the immediate environment around the infected person. Airborne transmission may be possible when aerosol-generating procedures are performed including endotracheal intubation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, administration of nebulized treatments, and others (
