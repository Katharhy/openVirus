<p>Here, we provide a multidisciplinary review of the current literature involving the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We review the origin of the virus, the course of disease, the therapeutic investigations, and the global response. Specifically, we discuss the pathogenesis, histopathology, virology, and immune response. We also examine the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, laboratory and radiology findings, in addition to common complications. This is followed by a briefing on the existing literature regarding adjunctive therapies and ongoing trials. Finally, we discuss the global response to the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the lessons learned for future pandemics.</p>
