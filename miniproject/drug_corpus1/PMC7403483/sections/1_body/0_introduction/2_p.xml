<p>SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus to date that is known to infect humans. This has been possible by frequent cross-species infections and occasional spillover events (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Two of these previously identified coronaviruses were responsible for major epidemics in the past two decades; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) also originating from China in 2002â€“2003 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) originating from the Middle East in 2012 (

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). All three of these coronaviruses are considered zoonotic in origin and have the ability to cause severe and fatal illness in humans (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Unfortunately, given their large genetic diversity and the frequent recombination of their genomes coupled with the increase in human-animal interface activities due to modern agricultural practices, novel coronaviruses are likely to continue to develop and cause periodic seasonal spreads (
