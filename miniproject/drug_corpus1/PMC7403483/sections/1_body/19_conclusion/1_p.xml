<p>Pandemics propose an immense challenge to public health, health care systems, and global economic security. Due to modern agricultural practices that increase human-animal interface, new zoonotic coronaviruses are likely to continue to spillover from animals to humans causing future outbreaks. Gaining insight into every aspect of coronaviruses is crucial to implement proper control measures to help prevent these outbreaks or lessen their impact on humans and society if they were to still happen. Special focus should be placed on understanding their pathophysiology to help better tailor and generate effective drug therapies and vaccinations. Nevertheless, our ability to handle future outbreaks will rely on the actions we take based on the lessons we have learned from previous pandemics. We hope that the rapidly developing research on the current COVID-19 pandemic will help provide the new information needed to fill these gaps.</p>
