<p>As seen in multiple previous pandemics including the influenza pandemic of 1918, the first wave is often followed several months later by a second wave of infections that could potentially be even worse than the first. A second wave can be caused by a region being re-exposed to infection by an influx of infected people from another. The degree of the resulting new outbreak will depend on the level of immunity in the first region from the initial wave. This will be influenced by multiple factors including the potential for endogenous loss of immunity in the first population and the introduction of people who are not immune, for example, individuals moving from one state to another in the U.S. (

A study by Aleta et al. showed that removing these restrictions could lead to a second wave of COVID-19 infections that could overwhelm the health care system. However, combining this with enhanced testing and contact tracing can reduce transmission and allow for reopening of economic activities, while having a manageable impact on the health care system even in the absence of herd immunity (
