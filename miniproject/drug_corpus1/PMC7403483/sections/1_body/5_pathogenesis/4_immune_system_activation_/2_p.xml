<p>Once CD4+ T cells, also known as helper T cells, are activated, they cause the release of cytokines and chemokines (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). If exaggerated, this leads to the development of cytokine storm syndrome. The exact mechanism by which the immune system response to a viral infection can lead to cytokine storm syndrome is not completely understood. It has been shown that certain viruses are capable of altering the immune response to infection predisposing the host to develop a cytokine storm. Cytokine storm syndrome has been described in prior viruses including SARS-CoV, dengue and influenza virus. It remains a challenge to understand why some patients develop a cytokine storm while others do not. Research has shown that genetic polymorphisms, for example changes in the toll-like receptors (TLR), may play an important role in affecting host responses to certain infections, ultimately leading some to develop a cytokine storm (
