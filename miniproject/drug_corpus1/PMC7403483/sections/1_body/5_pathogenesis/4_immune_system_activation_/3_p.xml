<p>Acute lung injury, including its severe form ARDS, is a common consequence of cytokine storm syndrome. This has been shown to occur in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with the development of diffuse lung injury, inflammation, and fluid buildup, which can ultimately lead to death. ARDS is also a common immunopathological event in both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (

Critically ill patients who required intensive care unit (ICU) admission were found to have higher concentrations of cytokines in their plasma as compared to those with milder illness, suggesting that cytokine storm was connected to disease severity (
