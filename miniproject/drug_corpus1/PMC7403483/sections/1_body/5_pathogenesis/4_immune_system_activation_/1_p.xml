<p>When the virus enters the cell, its antigen is presented by the antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells and macrophages. This leads to the activation of the body's humoral and cellular immunities, which are mediated by virus-specific B and T cells (

 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Antigen presentation occurs via major histocompatibility complexes (MHC; or human leukocyte antigen (HLA) in humans) present on the surface of APCs and recognized by virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). There are two major classes of MHCs involved in antigen presentation: MHC 1 and MHC II. SARS-CoV mainly depends on MHC I molecules. Unfortunately, the evidence regarding antigen presentation in SARS-CoV-2 is lacking and most of the information is extrapolated from prior studies done on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Studies have shown that different HLA genotypes may be responsible for differences in host susceptibility to the virus and therefore, severity of disease. Patients infected with SARS-CoV with HLA-B
 <sup>*</sup>46:01 genotypes were shown to have more severe disease compared to those with different genotypes. This has not been clinically validated in studies on SARS-CoV-2 as of yet (
