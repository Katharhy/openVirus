<p>The virus can progress even further and can infect the alveolar type II pneumocyte cells, similar to SARS-CoV. It has been shown that SARS-CoV are released in large numbers from infected type II pneumocytes and cause cell apoptosis. Type II pneumocyte cells normally comprise 10â€“15% of total lung cells. They produce surfactant, which is responsible for the maintenance of surface tension in alveolar walls. These cells are also responsible for maintaining the lung epithelium after injury through epithelial regeneration (

Therefore, as replicated viral particles are released from the cell and move on to infect more type II pneumocytes, the resulting apoptosis eventually causes diffuse alveolar damage and impaired gas exchange, which is hypothesized to lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A similar mechanism is postulated for SARS-CoV-2 (
