<p>SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are involved with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) through ACE2, the enzyme that functions as a receptor for both viruses and also physiologically counters RAAS activation (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Within RAAS, angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II by ACE. Angiotensin II mediates vasoconstrictive and pro-inflammatory effects through angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT
 <sub>1</sub>R). ACE2, on the other hand, converts angiotensin II to angiotensin I-7, which binds to Mas receptor and facilitates numerous functions including vasodilation and anti-inflammatory effects. ACE2 also converts angiotensin I to angiotensin I-9, which can be further converted by ACE to angiotensin I-7. ACE2 limits the adverse vasoconstrictor and pro-inflammatory properties of angiotensin II by degrading it and by the formation of angiotensin I-7, counteracting its action. ACE inhibitors (ACE-Is) block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) inhibit the binding of angiotensin II to AT
 <sub>1</sub>R and angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT
 <sub>2</sub>R); its affinity for AT
 <sub>1</sub>R, the main pathway by which angiotensin II exerts its pro-inflammatory effects, is 1,000 times greater than AT
 <sub>2</sub>R (
