<p>It is unclear whether RAAS inhibitors increase, decrease, or have no effect on levels and expression of ACE2. It is also uncertain whether increased ACE2 would have protective or detrimental effects. It is thought that increased ACE2 would be detrimental as it would facilitate greater entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell causing higher disease virulence. Instead, some postulate that increased ACE2 may have a beneficial role in SARS-CoV-2 infection by attenuating virus-induced lung injury due to the vasodilator and anti-inflammatory role of the ACE2 pathway (
