<p>A large proportion of COVID-19 patients have preexisting hypertension. Also, patients with more severe illness are more likely to have hypertension than those with mild illness. This has sparked concerns that the RAAS inhibitors used for medical management of hypertension may somehow be contributing to poor outcomes through their effect on ACE2 (

 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). In studies involving patients with a variety of cardiac conditions, plasma ACE2 activity was not higher among patients taking ACE-Is or ARBs when compared to patients not treated with these medications. On the other hand, in a longitudinal cohort study in Japan involving patients with hypertension, those who received long-term treatment with the ARB olmesartan had higher urinary ACE2 levels than control patients. However, the same findings were not present among patients using ARBs other than olmesartan or the ACE-I enalapril (
