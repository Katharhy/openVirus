<p>The uncertainties outlined above make it difficult to offer guidance regarding the use of these medications in patients with COVID-19. The results of a retrospective Chinese study in Wuhan involving 1,178 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 showed that the frequency of severe disease, ARDS, and mortality did not differ in those using ACE-Is or ARBs compared to those not using these medications (

RAAS inhibitors have well-established benefits in protecting the myocardium, and their withdrawal causes clinical decompensation in high-risk patients as has been shown in multiple studies. For example, in the Quinapril Heart Failure Trial, withdrawal of quinapril in patients with chronic symptomatic heart failure resulted in a progressive decline in clinical status. Among patients dealing with an unstable clinical status and ongoing myocardial injury due to COVID-19, withdrawal of RAAS inhibitors may pose an even higher risk (
