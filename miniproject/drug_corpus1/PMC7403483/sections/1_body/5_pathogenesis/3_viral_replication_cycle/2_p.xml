<p>The RBD in the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 specifically recognizes its host ACE2 receptor. The viral RBD region is made of 394 glutamine residues and is recognized by 31 lysine residues of the human ACE2 receptor. Previous studies revealed that host susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection is mainly determined by the affinity between the host ACE2 receptor and the viral RBD in the early viral attachment phase. It is thought that this mechanism is likely similar in SARS-CoV-2 and that a genetic recombination event in the RBD region of SARS-CoV-2 may be the cause of its higher transmission rate as compared to SARS-CoV (
