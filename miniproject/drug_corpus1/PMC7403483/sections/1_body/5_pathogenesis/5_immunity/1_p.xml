<p>Individuals who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 produce antibodies against the virus. Most studies show that patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop antibody titers at days 10 to 15 after symptom onset. Based on preliminary evidence, these antibodies may have a protective role, however this is yet to be established (

However, another study involving 175 patients who recovered from SARS-CoV-2 showed that a proportion of them developed very low antibody titers (below the detectable level) despite recovering from the disease. Therefore, further studies are needed to establish if antibody titers determine the likelihood to recover from disease (
