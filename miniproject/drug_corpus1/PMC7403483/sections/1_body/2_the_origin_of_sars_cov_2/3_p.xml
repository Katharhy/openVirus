<p>As previously stated, SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be 96% identical at the whole genome level to the bat SARS-like coronavirus strain BatCov RaTG13, making it likely that bats served as reservoir hosts. With many theories not supportive of direct spillover from bats to humans, further investigation was conducted. Pangolins were then reported as potential intermediate hosts after samples were analyzed from Malytan pangolins, an endangered species illegally trafficked into southern China for use in old-fashioned Chinese medicine and as a food source. These were obtained from Guangdong and Guangxi, China during an anti-smuggling operation. Samples from the pangolins showed new coronavirus genomes with 85.5â€“92.4% resemblance to SARS-CoV-2. More remarkable was the 97.4% amino acid similarity in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of coronavirus genomes from pangolins compared to SARS-CoV-2. In comparison, the Bat CoV RaTG only had 89.2% amino acid similarity in the RBD with SARS-CoV-2. Up until now, bats and pangolins are the only two mammals known to be infected by SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses (
