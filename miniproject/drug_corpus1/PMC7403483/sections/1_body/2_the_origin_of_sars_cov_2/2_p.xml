<p>After the SARS epidemic in 2002, bats were first recognized to be hosts for coronaviruses and interest grew in identifying other potential mammal hosts (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The majority of early cases of SARS occurred in patients with close contact to animals including market palm civets. Soon afterwards, SARS-CoV was cultivated from caged Himalayan palm civets from live wild markets in Guangdong, China. Upon further investigation, with the discovery of many coronaviruses phylogenetically related to SARS-CoV in bats from different provinces in China and other countries, bats were believed to be the natural reservoir for SARS-CoV, and the palm civet was a possible intermediate host. It was likely that the virus acquired multiple mutations in the market palm civets before spillover to humans (
