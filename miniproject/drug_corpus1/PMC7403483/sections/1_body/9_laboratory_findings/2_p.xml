<p>One of the most common laboratory findings in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is an increased d-dimer level. In a large retrospective analysis study of 1,099 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in China, patients with more severe illness were more likely to have an elevated d- dimer level compared to patients with non-severe illness (

In another retrospective analysis study of 183 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia in Wahun, non-survivors were found to have significantly higher d-dimer and fibrin degradation product (FDP) levels, and longer prothrombin time (PT) on admission compared to survivors. Fibrinogen and antithrombin (AT) levels were also significantly lower in non-survivors. Also, 71.4% of non-survivors had overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) during their hospitalization compared to only 0.6% of survivors. The results imply that abnormal coagulation parameters during COVID-19 pneumonia were significantly associated with poor prognosis (
