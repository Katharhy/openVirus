<p>Hospitalized patients with SAR-CoV-2 infection have been found to have varying white blood cell counts. A study by Huang et al. showed leukopenia (&lt; 4 × 10
 <sup>9</sup> per L) in 25% of patients, normal leukocyte counts (4–10 × 10
 <sup>9</sup> per L) in 45% of patients, and leukocytosis (&gt; 10 × 10
 <sup>9</sup> per L) in 30% of patients. Lymphopenia (&lt; 1 × 10
 <sup>9</sup> per L) was found in 63% of patients (
