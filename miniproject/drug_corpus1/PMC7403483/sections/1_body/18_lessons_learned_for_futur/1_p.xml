<p>As this pandemic continues to develop and continues to take the lives of so many, there are innumerable lessons to be learned for future pandemics. To begin with, it is crucial to establish clear whistleblowing policies for potential global health emergencies. This will allow for transparency and help encourage clinicians to bring important information to light as soon as they are detected. Once high-risk areas have been identified, precautions including travel restrictions and quarantines should be implemented as soon as a possible health threat is identified. Also, framework should be developed to escalate a threat status earlier for fast-spreading diseases (

And finally, it is imperative for health care systems along with local, regional, and global forces to work together to ensure better preparedness for future pandemics in all aspects including staffing, supplies, the number of hospital beds, testing capacity, research and development, and policy. A high price was paid for these difficult lessons to be learned, so it is now our responsibility to dedicate the appropriate funding and efforts to prevent this level of catastrophe from repeating itself (
