<p>Top hits from anti-HIV drugs and TCM database were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation using the Amber18 package (Case et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). The antechamber was used to generate the drugs topologies.TIP3P water model was to solvate the system, and Na + counter ions were used to neutralizing the system. Two steps energy minimization of the system followed by heating and equilibration was performed. Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm was applied to calculate the long-range electrostatic interactions (Price &amp; Brooks III, 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). For Van der Waals interactions, a 1.4 nm cutoff values were set and also for short-range Columbic, respectively. A total of 100 ns MD simulation was performed with a time step of 2 fs. The behavior of the ligand-protein complex and stability were analyzed. Post-simulation analysis such as RMSD, RMSF, ROG and hydrogen bonds occupancy were performed using CPPTRAJ and PTRAJ (Roe &amp; Cheatham III,
