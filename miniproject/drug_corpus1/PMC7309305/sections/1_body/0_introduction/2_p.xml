<p>The SARS-CoV-2 is composed of Spike (S) protein, membrane (M) protein, envelope (E) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein. In anti CoVs therapies, the main focus is to boost the human immune system or to block the binding of spike protein with the receptor proteins. Therefore, the treatments based on targeting coronavirus rely on blocking of virus binding to receptors, inhibition of virus replication, prevention of the synthesis of viral RNA and inhibition of the virus self-assembly process (Bosch et al.,
