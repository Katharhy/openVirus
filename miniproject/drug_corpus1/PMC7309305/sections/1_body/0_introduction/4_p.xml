<p>Structural Bioinformatics based approaches are the fastest way for finding the potential molecules from the marketed drugs or bioactive compounds for effective treatment of SARS-COV-2. Main-protease or 3CLpro inhibition is a promising target to control the recent SARS-COV-2 infection due to its essential role in viral maturation and replication (Ul Qamar et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). 3CLpro has three important domains I-III, which correspond to positions 8–101, 102–184, and 201–303, respectively. There is a connecting loop that corresponds to position 185–200, which connects domains II and III. The structure of 3CLpro has an important catalytic dyad consist of His41 and Cys145. In this study, the protein of SARS-COV-2 (3CLpro, also named 3-chymotrypsin-like protease) was subjected to drug repurposing and virtual screening for potent drug identification followed by molecular dynamics simulation and binding free energy calculation. Our findings revealed that Saquinavir, which is an HIV protease inhibitor reported experimentally (Kim et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>) and TCM5280805, are promising hits, which need 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> validation for antiviral effects. We hope this study will provide useful information for the clinical treatment of novel coronavirus associated pneumonia.
