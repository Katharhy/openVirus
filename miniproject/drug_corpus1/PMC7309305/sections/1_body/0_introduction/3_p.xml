<p>To combat the latest CoVs threats, the researchers are following multiple approaches for novel drug development (Zumla et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) and testing the efficacy of existing drugs. In one approach, experiments were performed to test the existing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs (ribavirin, Interferons, and cyclophilin inhibitors) against SARS-COV-2 (Chan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Zumla et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The use of these antiviral drugs is approved against viral infections, and their dosages, efficacy, metabolic characteristic, and side effects are well known. However, there is a possibility that this “broad-spectrum” treatment against CoVs would not be effective. In the second approach, molecular databases were subjected to High-throughput screening for potential drug molecules to combat infection caused by a coronavirus (de Wilde et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Dyall et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). This strategy was proved successful in the discovery of lopinavir/ritonavir for the treatment of HIV. Some researchers are using the genomic and pathological information of CoVs for the development of a new specific drug from scratch. Theoretically, this is an effective approach; however, it is very time consuming and might cost several years or even more than ten years (Khan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Omrani et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).
