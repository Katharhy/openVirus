<p>The radius of Gyration (RoG) conveys the information of stable and unstable folding protein while interacting with ligands. Less compactness (more unfolded) shows higher RoG values, whereas low RoG values indicate strong compactness and higher structural stiffness (more folded). Thus, RoG was determined to assess the system’s compactness over time. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6</xref>, the simulated complexes show gyration scores between 21 and 24Å. In the case of 3CLpro-Squanavir, the gyration score for the initial (2000) frames was reported to be 22.50 Å. However, a little fluctuation between (2000–3000) frames was observed, but soon after 3500, the values become lower and uniform. In the case of 3CLpro-5280805, 3CLpro-5280445, 3CLpro-5280863, and 3CLpro-5458190 showed an average gyration of 22–22.50 Å. Similarly, 3CLpro-5280445 also showed similar fluctuation, but in the last few frames, the values fluctuated a little higher, which is assumed to be in an acceptable range. The binding and unbinding of ligands greatly affected the overall compactness of the complexes.
