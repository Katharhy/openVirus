<p>To understand the conformational and dynamics features of the selected hits against the 3CLpro of SARS-COV-2molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is an imperative method to explore the behavior of each system in real-time. Dynamics features of the six selected systems (Saquinavir, 528085, 5280863, 5280445, 5280343, and 5458190 were calculated after 100â€‰ns simulation. For stability RMSD, while to evaluate the flexibility at residue level RMSF of the complexes were calculated to comprehend the overall stability and flexibility of the system.</p>
