<p>As given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0007">Figure 7</xref>, in 3CLpro-Squanavir, 3CLpro-5280805, and 3CLpro-5280343 complexes, the hydrogen bond with His41 was reported in 87%, 65% and 39% of the trajectories. Hydrogen bond with Cys145 residue was reported in 65% trajectories only in the 3CLpro-Squanavircomplex. Furthermore, Leu141 and Glu166 were found in almost all complexes. However, another important residue Gln189 was found in 76% of the 3CLpro-Squanavir trajectories, 36% in 3CLpro-5280805, while 21% in 3CLpro-TCM5280445 trajectories. Other active site residues were not detected in a significant population of the MD trajectories.
