<p>Furthermore, the top five hits from TCM virtual screening results were also subjected to the free binding energy as reported by the virtual screening results TCM5280805 was reported with the best docking score and interaction. Herein, TCM5280805 also possesses the best total binding energy,29.486 kcal/mol, against the 3CLpro. Also, the other hits from including TCM5280445, TCM5280343, TCM5280863, and TCM5458190 possess total binding energy of −16.342 kcal/mol, −17.184 kcal/mol, −10.315 kcal/mol and −15.695 kcal/mol. While the other energy terms such as van der Waals energy, electrostatic energy, polar solvation energy, solvent‐accessible surface area are given in
