<p>MM/GBSA, a popular approach, was used to estimate the binding free energy of all the six systems. The binding free energy determines the binding affinity between ligands and 3CLpro. Each energy term, including van der Waals energy, electrostatic energy, polar solvation energy, solvent accessible surface area energy, and total binding free energy of all the systems are given in 
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. It can be seen that the 3CLpro-Saquinavir system possesses the highest total binding energy of −74.4061 kcal/mol. Thus it confirms that Saquinavir, an anti-HIV drug that has been reported to inhibit HIV protease experimentally, possesses strong inhibitory effects against the 3CLpro of SARS-COV-2. Recently published results also shortlisted Saquinavir as a potential candidate, but they only performed 20 ns simulation (Khan et al.,
