<p>Cross validation of our predicted compounds by comparing with the experimentally tested compounds showed that the Saquinavir and TCM5280805 possess a similar scaffold with Myricetrin and Scutellarin which are flavonoids and reported to have strong inhibitory effects by targeting 3CLpro. On the other hand, the four compounds (TCM5280343, TCM5280445, TCM5280863 and TCM5458190) from TCM database shares structural similarity with Scutellarein, Dihydromyricetin, Quercetagetin, Myricetin, 5,6-Dihydroxyflavone, 6,7-Dihydroxyflavone, Chrysin, Herbacetin and Baicalein which are flavonoids and testes to have strong inhibitory effects in an experimental condition by targeting 3Clpro (Chen &amp; Du,

 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Yang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Their structural analyses showed that these compounds mainly form bonds with Phe140 and Glu166 while our compounds specifically target the catalytic dyad with supplementary interactions with the other active site residues. Thus, we speculate that our compounds could also show the same potential activity against the 3CLpro in the experimental assay because our compounds are also plants derived extracts and belongs to a group of flavonoids.
