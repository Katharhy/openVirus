<p id="p0030">In this paper, keeping the characteristics of the COVID-19 explained above in mind, I exploit the SIQR model (

 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Jumpen et al., 2009</xref>) with four compartments; susceptible individuals (S), infected individuals (I call them infecteds for the sake of simplicity) at large (I), quarantined patients (Q) and recovered individuals (R), and describe the transmission process by a system of ordinary differential equations where the quarantine rate of infecteds is introduced as a key parameter. In the present SIQR model, the quarantine process is treated as a measure controlled by policy and the number of the daily confirmed new cases is focused upon as an essetial observable. I also consider the quarantined patients not only as individuals to be treated in the hospital but also as key players in combating the spread of the virus.
