<p id="p0015">Traditionally, the dynamics of infectious diseases have been understood by the deterministic compartmental models described by differential equations such as the SIR model (

 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Chowell et al., 2007</xref>) or by the stochastic model described by a renewal integral equation (
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Fraser et al., 2004</xref>). In the SEIR model, the population consists of susceptible individuals (S), exposed individuals (E), infectious individuals (I) and removed individuals (R). The SIR model does not include the compartment of exposed individuals. In these compartmental models, quarantine is considered to be an efficient way for medical treatment of patients and one of the removal processes. The average removal time is usually treated as the unit of time, and thus the quarantine rate is included only in the unit of time and in the reproduction number. The SIR-X model proposed by Maier and Brockmann (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Maier and Brockmann, 2020</xref>) includes the quarantine process in the analysis of the early state of the outbreak in China.
