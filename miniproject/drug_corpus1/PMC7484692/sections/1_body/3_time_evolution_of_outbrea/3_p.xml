 <xref rid="fd11" ref-type="disp-formula">(11)</xref> indicates that the number of infecteds at large is determined by λ and its initial condition. The parameter λ depends on measures that the government employs. Therefore, we can fit the data by piecewise exponential functions and assess the measures from the time dependence of the number of infecteds at large.
