<p id="p0200">The pandemic COVID-19 has unusual nature such as infectious asymptomatic patients and a long incubation period in comparison to known epidemics (
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">WHO coronavirus disease pandemic, situation report</xref>). In the typical epidemics, all infected individuals become infectious after a latent period and show onset of symptoms after an incubation period. Therefore the number of infecteds at large can be estimated from the number of symptomatic patients. We cannot do the same for COVID-19, however, because of the prevalence of asymptomatic patients in the general population. Short of testing the entire population in a single day, the only visible metric we have for the purpose of estimating the total number of infecteds is the number of daily confirmed new cases
