<p id="p0205">In order to determine parameters of the model, I fitted the data of the daily confirmed new cases reported in Japan. Using the time dependence of the parameters, I analyzed the characteristics of the outbreak in Japan from mid-February to mid-April. Because of the advance notice of the declaration of the national emergency expected on April 7th, the effect is seen apparently from April 5th. After April 5th, the partial lockdown appears to have resulted in 60% reduction of the social contacts, which is 20% less than the value 80% that the government requested. Has the government introduced other measures as well at the same time, the reduction of infecteds would have been much faster. In particular, the four-day waiting period required for symptomatic patients before they were allowed a PCR test has made the situation much worse. If the waiting period was halved, the quarantine rate would have been doubled. The curves (3) and (4) in
