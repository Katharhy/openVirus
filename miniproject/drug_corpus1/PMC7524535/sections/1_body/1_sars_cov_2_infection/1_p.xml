<p id="p0025">Cells infected by SARS-CoV, and most likely also by SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>), are mainly epithelial cells, alveolar epithelial cells, vascular endothelial cells, and macrophages in the lung. In this review we focus on the cellular innate immune response in these primarily infected cells from a mitochondrial perspective. Infection of a number of other cells, including specialized immune cells, has also been described for SARS-CoV (
