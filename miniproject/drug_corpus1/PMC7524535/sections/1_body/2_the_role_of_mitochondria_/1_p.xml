<p id="p0040">Innate immune responses are triggered by the activation of pattern recognition receptors, which non-specifically recognize pathogens via pathogen-associated molecular patterns or signals from damaged cells via damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). In response to tissue injury, affected cells drive the recruitment of specialized innate immune cells, which in turn activate the specific adaptive immune response and trigger the production of molecules needed for inflammation and regeneration/repair of injured tissue. It is becoming increasingly clear that mitochondria are fundamentally involved in the mammalian innate immune system (

Mitochondria are most commonly associated with energy production by oxidative phosphorylation, but they are also involved in a myriad of other functions, such as ion homeostasis, cellular signaling, differentiation, and cell death/survival.
