<p id="p0055">The mitochondrial membrane-anchored mitochondrial anti-viral signaling protein MAVS is an essential component of the cellular anti-viral defense system (
 <xref rid="bib123" ref-type="bibr">West et al., 2011</xref>). Viruses in the cytoplasm can be detected by retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), including RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) (

 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Hou et al., 2011</xref>). MAVS then recruits a number of downstream signaling effectors, including the E3 ligases tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors 3 and 6 (TRAF3 and TRAF6) leading to antiviral defense by the induction of nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cell (NF-κB) and type I interferons via interferon regulatory factors (IRFs). Formation of the MAVS complex (“MAVS signalosome”) is mediated by translocases of the outer mitochondrial membrane 70 (TOM70) and 20 (TOM20) and leads to activation of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and phosphorylation of IRF-3. IRF-3 then associates with the cytosolic chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) to robustly activate an anti-viral response. Dysfunctional MAVS or TOM70 (e.g., due to mislocalization or low protein levels) impair the antiviral host defense. On the other hand, overexpression of TOM70 (

 <xref rid="bib107" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2019</xref>), boosts the cellular antiviral defenses. MAVS is thought to be tethered to the inner mitochondrial membrane by the proteins prohibitin 1 and 2 (PHB1 and PHB2), which therefore also might play important roles in the regulation of mitochondrial anti-viral innate immunity (
