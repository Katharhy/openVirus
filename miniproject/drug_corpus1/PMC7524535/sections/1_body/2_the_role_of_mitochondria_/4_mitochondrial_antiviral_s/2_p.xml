<p id="p0060">The MAVS pathway is preferentially targeted by viruses. For example, the hepatitis C virus serine-protease NS3/4A and the 3ABC protease of the hepatitis A virus cleave MAVS to dissociate it from its outer mitochondrial membrane base, resulting in inhibition of the pathway and thus reducing the cellular capacity to induce antiviral responses (
