<p id="p0115">In conclusion, mitochondria are involved in many pathways related to innate immune responses and viruses commonly undermine these mechanisms. In the next section we will assess the existing knowledge on the role of mitochondria in the innate immune system with regard to SARS-CoVs. We are not aware of published research on the direct role of parkin in SARS-CoV infection. But the central roles of mitochondrial dysfunction and of parkin, also in relation to inflammation (
