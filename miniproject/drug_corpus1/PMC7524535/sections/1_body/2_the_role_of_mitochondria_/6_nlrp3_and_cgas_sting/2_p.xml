<p id="p0110">mtDNA released in the cytosol also gets detected by DNA-sensing enzymes, such as toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) or GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS). cGAS detection of mtDNA in turn via stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-IRF3 promotes type I interferon responses, which increases resistance to viruses (
 <xref rid="bib122" ref-type="bibr">West et al., 2015</xref>). Detection by cGAS activates cGAS-STING and interferon-based host responses. RNA viruses, including coronaviruses, have also evolved strategies to evade cGAS-STING (
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Eaglesham and Kranzusch, 2020</xref>), comparable to the described MAVS evasion strategies. Strikingly, parkin also has been implicated in STING signaling, presumably regulating STING-induced inflammation (
