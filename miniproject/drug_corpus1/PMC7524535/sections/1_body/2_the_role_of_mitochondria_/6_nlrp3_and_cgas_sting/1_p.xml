<p id="p0105">Upon mitochondrial damage, mtDNA is released in the cytosol, where it can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multi-protein complex that, mediated by caspase-1, promotes IL-1β and IL-18 secretion. NLRP3 is furthermore importantly regulated by mtROS and elevated mtROS activation of NLRP3 especially in bronchial epithelial cells may have detrimental consequences (
