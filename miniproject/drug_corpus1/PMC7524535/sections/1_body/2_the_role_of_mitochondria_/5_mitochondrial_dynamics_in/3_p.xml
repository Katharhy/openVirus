<p id="p0075">Mitochondrial fission is mediated primarily by DRP1, which is recruited from the cytosol to the fission site. There it forms ring-like oligomers around the mitochondrion and induces mitochondria division by GTP hydrolysis-mediated DRP1 constriction. The recruitment of DRP1 to mitochondria is believed to be mediated by adaptor proteins, including mitochondrial fission factor (MFF), fission 1 (FIS1), and the mitochondrial dynamics proteins of 49 and 51 kDa (MiD49 and MiD51). Their functions are not completely understood, and in particular MiD49 and MiD51 may affect both fission and fusion depending on the cellular conditions (
