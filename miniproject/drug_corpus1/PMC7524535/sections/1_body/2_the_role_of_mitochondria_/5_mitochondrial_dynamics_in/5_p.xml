<p id="p0085">Mitochondrial dynamics are highly affected and in some cases compromised by viral infections, which affects host responses. These mechanisms have been reviewed specifically from that perspective (

 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). Viral infections may result in strongly elongated mitochondria potentially enhancing antiviral signaling (

Pro-fusion protein MFN2 levels have been shown to regulate MAVS efficiency, i.e., high levels of MFN2 impair MAVS by changing its active conformation (
