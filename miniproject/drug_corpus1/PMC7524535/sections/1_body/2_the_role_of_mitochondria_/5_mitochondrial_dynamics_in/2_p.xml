 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Banoth and Cassel, 2018</xref>), induce morphological changes (“mitochondrial dynamics”) of mitochondria with functional consequences importantly affecting the innate immune response. Mitochondria transition from shorter to longer organelles (fusion) and the other way around (fission) by means of factors regulating mitochondrial dynamics, including the fusion factors mitofusins 1 and 2 (MFN1 and MFN2), optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) and the fission factor dynamin-related protein-1 (DRP1). These mechanisms and consequences are described excellently and in detail elsewhere (

Mitochondria are enclosed by two membranes, the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes (IMM and OMM, respectively). The OMM enzymes MFN1 and MFN2 are effectors for the fusion of the OMM, which is followed by OPA1-mediated IMM fusion. OPA1 itself is regulated by the metalloproteases YME1L and OMA1.
