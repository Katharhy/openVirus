<p id="p0095">Conversely, hepatitis B virus has been reported to induce mitochondrial fission by stimulating phosphorylation at Ser616. This facilitated mitophagy and enhanced viral survival by reducing virus-induced apoptosis (
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). These examples demonstrate that viruses in principle can take advantage of both inhibition and enhancement of mitochondrial fission, in the described cases, primarily based on the modification of a single amino acid residue of DRP1, Ser616. The right balance of mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy thus seems to be crucial in antiviral defense and in the regulation of inflammation (
