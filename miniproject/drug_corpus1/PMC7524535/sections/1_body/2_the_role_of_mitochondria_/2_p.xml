<p id="p0045">Beside mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) (mtROS)-based involvement in immunity, mitochondrial participation in antiviral defense is now well established (
 <xref rid="bib123" ref-type="bibr">West etÂ al., 2011</xref>). Mitochondria play integral roles in anti-viral host response signaling upon infection, and they can activate the innate immune system upon cellular damage via mitochondrial DAMPs. Importantly, SARS-CoV proteins manipulate mitochondrial mechanisms to evade the host immune response and may alter mitochondrial functions leading to enhanced ROS production, perturbed signaling, and blunted antiviral defenses of the host organism.
