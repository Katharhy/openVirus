<p id="p0235">In conclusion, coronavirus infection may cause mitochondrial dysfunctions and functional mitochondria are integral for cell and tissue protection and for initiation and maintenance of immune responses. Here the manifold ways, how RNA viruses, and specifically SARS-coronaviruses, modulate mitochondrial function to evade the innate immune response of host cells, were summarized and put into context with the current understanding of SARS-CoV-2. We argue that enhancing or preserving mitochondrial function may prevent mitochondrial manipulation and dysfunction following viral infection. Regular physical activity or targeted pharmacological interventions to boost mitochondrial capacities are likely efficient to increase mitochondrial function and may enhance innate immunity in face of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, the exploration of mitochondrial functions or mitochondrial damage markers in accessible tissues (e.g., blood) in response to SARS-CoV-2-infection may pave the way for the development of mitochondrial biomarkers for vulnerability and expected disease severity. The many knowledge gaps we currently have on SARS-CoV-2 biology and host pathophysiology give room for much future research.</p>
