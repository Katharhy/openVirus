<p id="p0240">In summary, mitochondrial involvement in the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2-infection represents a mechanism targetable by lifestyle and pharmacological strategies. Its thorough investigation is warranted for a better understanding of the pathogen-host biology and the development of adequate treatment strategies. Pre-existing mitochondrial dysfunction, for example, due to age or disease (e.g., cardiovascular disease, a prominent risk-factor of COVID-19), may represent factors contributing to differential vulnerabilities to SARS-CoV-2-infection and thus should be considered as a biomarker for the risk of infection and severity of outcome.</p>
