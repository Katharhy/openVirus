<p id="p0230">Several strategies to target mitochondria, both pharmacologically and lifestyle interventions, hold promise to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection or mitigate disease progression (see 
 <xref rid="tbox1" ref-type="boxed-text">Box 1</xref>). Up to date, any experimental evidence on their potential is lacking. As mitochondria are often compromised following different types of viral infections, boosting their function might be an approach with potential not only in COVID-19 but also to fight other viruses. Targeting shared features of a broad array of viruses may be an important approach for future epidemics, especially as long as effective antibody treatments are lacking. Better understanding of mitochondrial involvement in immune functions eventually will also contribute to our understanding of the role of infections and inflammation in chronic diseases and aging.
