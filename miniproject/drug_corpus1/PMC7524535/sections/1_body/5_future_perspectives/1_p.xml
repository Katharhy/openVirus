<p id="p0215">Despite immense scientific efforts to further our understanding of SARS-CoV-2, the SARS-CoV-2 biology and COVID-19 pathogenesis are still poorly understood. Due to this reason, many of the here-presented interactions between mitochondria and SARS-CoV-2 remain speculative, with unclear clinical relevance warranting further research. Specifically, experimental evidences regarding the effects of SARS-CoV-2-induced mitochondrial dysfunctions in infected cells and in those affected secondarily by compromised oxygen supply are important. We hope with this perspective to motivate scientific investigation in the presented topics that in our opinion have great potential to better understand the biological basis of the ongoing pandemic and thus may contribute to improved management of COVID-19.</p>
