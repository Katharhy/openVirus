<p id="p0210">In summary, enhanced mitochondrial integrity may be beneficial in lung injury following respiratory infection and improved mitochondrial function may be protective for SARS-CoV-2 infection. An overview on valuable therapeutic possibilities, aside from metformin (see above), to improve conditions for the mitochondria-mediated innate immune response or generally enhance mitochondrial functions with regard to immunity is provided in

   <italic>a. Enhancing MAVS:</italic> Given its central role in the innate immune system, the major target MAVS seems to represent for SARS-CoVs, and the efficiency of interferon therapy in SARS-CoV infection, therapeutically targeting MAVS seems reasonable. 
   <xref rid="bib107" ref-type="bibr">Song et al. (2019)</xref> demonstrated the potential of D-glucosamine to upregulate MAVS efficiency by enhancing O-GlcNacylation of MAVS. This in turn promotes increased poly-ubiquitination of MAVS and thus induces more efficient induction of type I interferons via IRF3 signaling. The authors showed that a diet rich in D-glucosamine supplement indeed protected mice from RNA viruses such as human influenza virus.

   <italic>b. Modulation of glycolysis in viral infection:</italic> Activation of the immune system induces changes in energy metabolism, mtROS production, and nutrient utilization and availability (
   <xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr">Sander and Garaude, 2018</xref>). Cells infected by RNA viruses often upregulate glycolysis and downregulate oxidative phosphorylation for energy production (
   <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Ivashkiv, 2020</xref>), which might optimize viral replication conditions. The glycolysis product lactate inhibits RLR-mediated interferon activation, whereas glycolysis downregulation may be beneficial for the RLR-dependent anti-viral host defense (
   <xref rid="bib126" ref-type="bibr">Yasukawa et al., 2020</xref>; 
   <xref rid="bib133" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Activated specialized immune cells also rely more on glycolysis (
   <xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr">Sander and Garaude, 2018</xref>). Although a potential metabolic shift upon innate immune system activation toward glycolysis in SARS-CoV-2 infection is insufficiently explored, the attenuation of glycolysis by pharmacological tools, such as the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) (
   <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Pålsson-McDermott and O'Neill, 2020</xref>), may represent a pharmacological avenue to explore.

   <title>Boosting Mitochondria to Enhance the Innate Immunity: Potential Applications for COVID-19</title>
  </caption>
  <p id="p0265">
   <italic>a. Boosting mitochondrial biogenesis and energy production:</italic> Mitochondria, most obviously and best studied in skeletal and cardiac muscles, respond rapidly to extracellular stimuli, such as exercise, by regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial respiration (
   <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Hood et al., 2019</xref>). Moderate, regular exercise by ameliorating anti-oxidative capacities (
   <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Bouzid et al., 2018</xref>) is supposedly protective by preventing mitochondrial and tissue damage by exuberant ROS and can improve mitochondrial biogenesis, ATP production (
   <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Egan and Zierath, 2013</xref>), and immunity (
   <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Nieman and Wentz, 2019</xref>). Acute intensive bouts of exercise conversely reduce immune function transiently and thus are not to be recommended in the presence of infection risk (
   <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Nieman and Wentz, 2019</xref>).
  </p>
  <p id="p0270">One prominent example to boost mitochondrial function pharmacologically is the modulation of the nicotinamide dinucleotide (NAD+) synthesis (
   <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Katsyuba et al., 2020</xref>), the disruption of which has been demonstrated to be deleterious for the immune system (
   <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Minhas et al., 2019</xref>). Recently, 
   <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Heer et al. (2020)</xref> indeed presented preliminary data that SARS-CoV-2 might dysregulate the NAD gene set, compromising immune responses.
  </p>
  <p id="p0275">
   <italic>b. Modulation of mitochondrial dynamics:</italic> SARS-coronaviruses are thought to modulate mitochondrial dynamics by degrading DRP1, thus favoring mitochondrial fusion. This may impair clearance of dysfunctional, for example, viral RNA or viral protein-containing, mitochondria and support survival of the infected cell during viral replication. Another consequence of impaired fission may be reduced cell membrane repair capacities of mitochondria for which fission is essential (
   <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Horn et al., 2020</xref>) and thereby could aggravate cell and tissue damage.
  </p>
  <p id="p0280">Inhibition of fusion to restore homeostasis of fusion and fission thus may be beneficial for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recently, a new pharmacological tool for this purpose was presented in the form of an OPA1 inhibitor. Notably, OPA1 in the study of 
   <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Herkenne et al. (2020)</xref> also was shown to promote angiogenesis by limiting NF-κB. Angiogenesis is commonly controlled by viruses to establish microenvironments favorable for their own pathogenesis (
   <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Alkharsah, 2018</xref>). OPA1 inhibition thus potentially has the capacity to also target another occasional pathological feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection, intussusceptive angiogenesis (
   <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Ackermann et al., 2020</xref>).
  </p>
  <p id="p0285">On the other hand, mitochondrial fusion is thought to be generally beneficial for mitochondrial antiviral signaling, for example, by enhancing mitochondrial interaction with the endoplasmic reticulum by bringing MAVS and STING components closer together, and thus increasing the efficiency of type I interferon induction (
   <xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">Pernas and Scorrano, 2016</xref>; 
   <xref rid="bib123" ref-type="bibr">West et al., 2011</xref>). Whether the benefits of fusion inhibition outweigh the expected negative effects on cellular anti-viral defense specifically by reduction of OPA1 (
   <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Castanier et al., 2010</xref>) and mitochondrial fusion in general remains to be investigated.
