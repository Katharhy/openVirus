<p id="p0195">An interesting aspect about COVID-19 epidemiology is the modulatory effect of genetic sex on immune response and disease progression, with men being at higher risk. 
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Kloc et al. (2020)</xref> recently summarized the potential involvement of sexually dimorphic populations of mitochondria in differential immune responses in general and in COVID-19 specifically. They argue that, beside other factors, sex hormone-dependent higher variation of female intestinal microbiomes may support the immune function in COVID-19 by providing more adequate substrates to mitochondria. Due to the maternal inheritance of mitochondria and the associated female-biased quality control, mitochondrial DNA mutations that are harmful for males but not females may furthermore persist during the mammalian egg maturation (
