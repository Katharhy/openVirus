<p id="p0200">How strongly mitochondrial integrity is involved in SARS-CoV-2 vulnerability remains to be tested experimentally. However, if compromised mitochondria are the reason for differential severity of COVID-19, this also warrants their assessment as biomarkers for disease progression as recently proposed (

Identification of patients with increased likelihood of severe COVID-19 (or future epidemics) outcome is essential to select appropriate treatments and manage potentially limited health care capacities. Coagulopathy, circulating pro-inflammatory stimuli, and low platelet counts emerge as integral aspects of COVID-19 and have been associated with the severity of the disease outcome (

 <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Merad and Martin, 2020</xref>). Oxidized phospholipids due to oxidative stress are linked to these pathologies, suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction or oxidative stress assessments to be candidates of peripherally measurable biomarkers. The recapitulation of mitochondrial dysfunction in blood samples of cardiac and skeletal muscles supports the investigation of the validity of such an approach for respiration (

 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Al Amir Dache et al., 2020</xref>), mitochondria or mtDNA in peripheral blood cells may also hold promise (
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Fetterman et al., 2016</xref>). It has recently been argued that elevated oxidative and inflammatory states due to freely circulating mitochondria and mitochondrial components may result in dysfunction and apoptosis of platelets in COVID-19 and could thus be crucially involved in severe disease progression (
