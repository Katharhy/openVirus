<p id="p0185">On the level of the lung, mitochondria not only provide energy for the regulation of airway and smooth muscles to regulate alveolar gas exchanges and to match ventilation and circulatory blood flow but also are integral for pulmonary cell and tissue protection (

 <xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">Piantadosi and Suliman, 2017</xref>), thus it is reasonable that maintaining mitochondrial integrity will improve the outcome. Indeed, in a lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injury model the observed severe mitochondrial dysfunction of pulmonary epithelia could be readily prevented by mitochondrial transfer of functional mitochondria from bone marrow-derived stromal cells, resulting in reduced leukocytosis, protein leak, and mortality in mice (
