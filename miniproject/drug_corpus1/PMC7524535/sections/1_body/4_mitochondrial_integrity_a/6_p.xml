<p id="p0205">In this review we focused on mitochondrial involvement in the innate immune system of primarily affected cells in COVID-19: epithelial cells, alveolar epithelial cells, vascular endothelial cells, which constitute an important factor of lung-specific immune response (
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Krausgruber et al., 2020</xref>), and resident macrophages in the lung. Clearly, specialized immune cell function also strongly depends on metabolic factors (immunometabolism), and mitochondria and may be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection as they are by SARS-CoV (

 <xref rid="bib117" ref-type="bibr">Vabret et al. (2020)</xref>; the knowledge on SARS-CoV-2-related immunometabolism is, however, still rudimentary. Activation of many immune cell types depends on mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation (

 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Banoth and Cassel, 2018</xref>). An excellent overview on these and related effects is provided in a recent review (
