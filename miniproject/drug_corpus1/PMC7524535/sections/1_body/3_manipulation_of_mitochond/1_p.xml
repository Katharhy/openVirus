<p id="p0120">Many pathogens, including RNA viruses like CoVs, have developed targeted strategies to hijack mitochondria, damaging them or using them for their purposes, such as survival, propagation, or evading host immunity. Some viruses use mitochondrial membranes for genome replication (

 <xref rid="bib106" ref-type="bibr">Somasundaran et al., 1994</xref>). Recent computational work suggests that SARS-CoV-2 RNA preferentially localizes to mitochondria (
 <xref rid="bib124" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Although no experimental data are yet available on whether this is really happening, SARS-CoV-2 RNA deposition in mitochondria could likewise impair mitochondrial function, potentially resulting in reduced energy and increased ROS generation (see part 5). Additional indirect support for a central role of mitochondria in SARS-CoV-2 infection comes from characteristic transcriptomic signatures of components of the oxidative phosphorylation system in peripheral mononuclear leukocytes and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with COVID-19 (
