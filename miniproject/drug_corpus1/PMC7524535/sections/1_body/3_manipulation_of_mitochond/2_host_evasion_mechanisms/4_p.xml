<p id="p0140">Although experimental studies elucidating detailed mitochondrial modulation by SARS-CoV-2 are lacking, recent proteomic studies allow a preliminary assessment of the relevance of related findings in SARS-CoV. A recent SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interaction map derived from global affinity purification mass spectrometry analysis (
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>) reveals putative interactions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins with human mitochondrial proteins, overlapping in many instances with available information on SARS-CoV. Beside a wide range of other human proteins, components of the innate immune system, including interferon signaling, were reported to possibly be regulated by viral proteins (

 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al. (2020)</xref> described potential modulation of MAVS by SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b via interaction with the mitochondrial import receptor TOM70. A very recent report also confirmed downregulation of MAVS in SARS-CoV-2-infected human colon epithelial carcinoma cells CaCo-2 (
