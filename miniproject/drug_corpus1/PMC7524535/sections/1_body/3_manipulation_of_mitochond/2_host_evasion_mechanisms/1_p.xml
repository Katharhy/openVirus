<p id="p0125">How SARS-CoV-2 evades the antiviral response is not well understood yet. But antagonistic mechanisms on cellular virus detection and interferon responses have been shown for SARS-CoV (

 <xref rid="bib100" ref-type="bibr">Shokri et al., 2019</xref>) proteins. These mechanisms impede host responses to infection, e.g., by blunting interferon induction; support viral replication; and increase pyroptotic events, and may be active as well for SARS-CoV-2 (
