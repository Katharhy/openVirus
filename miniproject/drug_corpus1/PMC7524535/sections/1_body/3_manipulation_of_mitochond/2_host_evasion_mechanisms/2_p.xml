<p id="p0130">A comprehensive overview on assumed host cell immunity evasion mechanisms of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 has recently been published (
 <xref rid="bib117" ref-type="bibr">Vabret et al., 2020</xref>). Some of these effects are afforded by the interaction of SARS-CoV proteins with cellular components affecting mitochondrial functions and thereby inhibiting immune responses. A systematically assembled list of such interactions for SARS-CoV is provided in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> . Many of these interactions result in the suppression of interferon signaling or in the modulation of apoptosis. Some of the most interesting interactions with regard to the role of mitochondria in the innate immune system are briefly discussed below and depicted in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> . All viral proteins mentioned in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, except for ORF3b, are also expressed by SARS-CoV-2.
