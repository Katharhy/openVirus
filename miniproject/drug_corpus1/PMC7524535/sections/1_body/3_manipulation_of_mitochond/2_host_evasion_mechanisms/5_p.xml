<p id="p0145">Gordon and colleagues' study (
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>) furthermore indicates the interaction of several SARS-CoV-2 proteins with mitochondrial components that have not been reported yet for SARS-CoV: SARS-CoV-2 Nsp4 may interact with the mitochondrial import machinery (TIM complexes); Nsp8, with mitochondrial ribosomes, and ORF9c, with several components of the mitochondrial electron transport system. Nsp13 and Nsp15 furthermore may also interfere with interferon activation (
