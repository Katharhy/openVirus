<p id="p0150">Manipulation of the cGAS-STING pathway by SARS-coronaviruses may also occur. SARS-CoV papain-like protease (PLpro), for example, which is also essential for CoV replication and spread, has been shown to interact with and inhibit STING (

Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 PLpro exhibited a differential substrate specificity in this study, resulting in preferential cleavage of other host proteins than by SARS-CoV PLpro, highlighting mechanistic differences that may contribute to the different pathological outcomes of SARS and COVID-19.
