<p id="p0170">SARS-CoV-2 infection may furthermore be related to reduced oxygen sensing mediated by mitochondrial dysfunction, as hypothesized by 
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Archer et al. (2020)</xref>. It recently became apparent that ARDS related to SARS-CoV-2 infection when compared with traditional ARDS exhibits distinct manifestations: relatively preserved lung compliance, large intrapulmonary shunt, sometimes an absence of dyspnea (
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Archer et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Gattinoni et al., 2020</xref>), pulmonary vessel abnormalities such as thrombosis, microangiopathy, and strongly increased angiogenesis (
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Ackermann et al., 2020</xref>). Mitochondrial oxidative stress may be directly involved in platelet dysfunction and coagulation pathways and contribute to elevated blood clotting and thrombosis (
 <xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr">Saleh et al., 2020</xref>). Based on the observations of differential pathologies when compared with ARDS, Archer and colleagues speculated that hypoxemia in SARS-CoV-2 patients is caused by deficits in organismal oxygen sensing, which normally regulates oxygen uptake and systemic oxygen delivery. The response of the pulmonary circulation to pathological airway hypoxia is pulmonary artery constriction. This leads to changes in blood flow toward better ventilated alveoli. Reduced oxygen availability in the blood in turn is sensed by the carotid bodies, which induce increased respiration. 
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Archer et al. (2020)</xref> argue that hypoxemia in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 is most likely induced due to an impaired pulmonary artery constriction mechanism and carotid body dysfunction (see 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> ) that sometimes may be combined with infection-induced ARDS. These authors propose that oxygen-sensing mechanisms for pulmonary artery constriction and in the carotid bodies, which depend on the mitochondrial complex I subunit NDUFS2 (
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Dunham-Snary et al., 2019</xref>), are impaired following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Carotid bodies furthermore express ACE2 and thus maybe directly infected by SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Li and Schultz, 2006</xref>). Indeed, Gordon and colleagues identified several complex I subunits to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 proteins Nsp7 and ORF9c (although not NDUFS2), an interaction that the US Food and Drug Administration-approved diabetes drug metformin, which inhibits complex I and associated mtROS production and exerts a plethora of related and different molecular effects (
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Kulkarni et al., 2020</xref>), according to these authors' analysis could target (
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>). Metformin's original purpose as an influenza drug (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Amin et al., 2019</xref>) and other theoretical considerations, including regulation of ACE2 (
 <xref rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2020</xref>), may suggest efficiency in COVID-19. Metformin furthermore reverses a typical inflammation phenotype of T cells, observed both in aging and diabetes, by enhancing autophagy and mitochondrial bioenergetics (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Bharath et al., 2020</xref>). Finally, the reduction of IL-6 release mediated by the inhibition of mitochondrial complex I-linked ROS production by metformin (
 <xref rid="bib105" ref-type="bibr">Soberanes et al., 2019</xref>) has recently been directly linked to COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Menendez, 2020</xref>).
