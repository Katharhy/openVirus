<p id="p0010">The variability of individual vulnerability and regional mortality rates to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which caused the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, is poorly understood. Although it is clear that age and pre-existing morbidities (
 <xref rid="bib119" ref-type="bibr">Wang etÂ al., 2020</xref>), such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, represent major risk factors, mechanistic explanations are lacking. In particular, it remains enigmatic, why sporadic severe disease progression may occur after SARS-CoV-2 infection in young individuals apparently without risk factors. Elucidating the variability in vulnerability, derivation of appropriate biomarkers, and the identification of efficient treatment strategies require thorough understanding of the pathophysiology and immune responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection.
