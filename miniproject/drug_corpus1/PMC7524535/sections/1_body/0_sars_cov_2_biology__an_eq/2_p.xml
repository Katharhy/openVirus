<p id="p0015">Here we discuss how the cellular innate immune system of an infected host organism fighting viral infection strongly relies on host mitochondria. Viruses commonly manipulate host cells by infiltrating cellular, including mitochondria-mediated, defense mechanisms, leading to an inadequate host immune response that may promote adverse disease outcomes. Given the fast development of the COVID-19 pandemic and thus the only recently launched research efforts on SARS-CoV-2, knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 biology and pathophysiology in humans is still limited. However, the SARS-CoV-2 genome shares 79% with the genome of SARS-CoV (

Building on research on other RNA viruses, in particular SARS-CoV, we integrate emerging evidence on the roles of mitochondria in the innate immune reaction to SARS-CoV-2 infection; how SARS-CoV-2 may evade host immune defense mechanisms by hijacking mitochondrial pathways, as recently suggested (
