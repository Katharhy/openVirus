  <p>Putative Mechanisms of Mitochondria-Related Immune Functions Manipulated by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2</p>
  <p>Red rectangles represent viral proteins, whose association with mitochondrial proteins of the host cells have been shown in SARS-CoV (except for Nsp4 and ORF9c, bold, for which interaction with mitochondrial components has been suggested only for SARS-CoV-2. ORF3b is not expressed in SARS-CoV-2). ETS, electron transport system.</p>
