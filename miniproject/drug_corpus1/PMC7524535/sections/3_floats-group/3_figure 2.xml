  <p>Possible Role of Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Aggravation of Hypoxemia in SARS-CoV-2</p>
  <p>Mitochondrial dysfunction due to SARS-CoV2 infection contributes to pulmonary tissue damage, deterioration of pulmonary function, and airway hypoxia. Impaired mitochondria in the carotid bodies may worsen hypoxemia due to impaired oxygen sensing and result in a compromised chemoreflex. Oxidative stress and impaired anti-viral signaling lead to an imbalanced innate immune response.</p>
