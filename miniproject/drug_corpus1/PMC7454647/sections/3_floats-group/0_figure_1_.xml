  <p>The lung-gut axis in COVID-19. Both lung and gut epithelium expresses the ACE2 receptor, recognized by SARS-CoV-2 to entry in the host cells where the virus starts to replicate (A). In the lung (B), once the virus has entered the cells, it prompts immune system activation characterized by pro-inflammatory cytokines and immune cell recruitment. If viral clearance is not sufficient, the immune response further progresses toward a cytokine storm syndrome (C). In the gut (D), the virus targets the cells and elicits the immune response in a similar fashion, although it is not yet clear whether the magnitude of the inflammatory response reaches the same level of the lung. Possibly, the immune response could lead to a dysbiosis (E) with a propagation of the pro-inflammatory state. Antigen presenting cells (APCs) are involved in the activation of the immune system in response to various exogenous triggers (F) from virus and bacteria: COVID-19 can activate inflammatory pathways that present some similarities with some immune-mediated diseases, such as IBD or rheumatoid arthritis. Abbreviations: IFN, interferon; IKK, inhibitory kappa B kinases; NF-kB: nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; PNEC, pulmonary neuroendocrine cells; RNA, ribonucleic acid; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; TNFR, tumor-necrosis factor receptor; TRADD, TNFR1-associated death domain protein; TRAF, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors; T reg, T regulatory cell; NEMO, NF-ÎºB essential modulator.</p>
