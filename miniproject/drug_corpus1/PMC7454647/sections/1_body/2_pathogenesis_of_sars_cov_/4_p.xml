<p>Various etiopathogenetic hypotheses have been advanced to explain the occurrence of diarrhea in COVID-19 patients including loss in enterocytes absorption capability,

 </sup> Endoscopy performed on a COVID-19 patient with diarrhea did not show macroscopic mucosal alterations, but microscopy examination revealed the presence of numerous lymphocytes infiltrating the lamina propria.

 </sup> Furthermore, in a recent letter, Effenberg et al reported higher levels of fecal calprotectin levels in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with diarrhea compared with patients who never reported it.

 </sup> However, although these 2 reports might suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can directly target the gastrointestinal system, no definitive conclusion can be drawn based on these results.
