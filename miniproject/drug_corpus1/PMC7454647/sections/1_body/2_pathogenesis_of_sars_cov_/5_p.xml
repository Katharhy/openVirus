<p>Finally, alterations in liver function tests during COVID-19 have been reported.

 </sup> Indeed, ACE2 was found on hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, although to a lesser extent compared with lungs and intestine. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 could theoretically target liver cells.

 </sup> Nevertheless, a causative role for SARS-CoV-2 cannot be inferred based on these findings because fluctuations of aminotransferases are often recorded in patients with systemic viral infections and actually reflect systemic inflammatory activation rather than direct viral damage (a phenomenon referred to as “bystander hepatitis”).

 </sup> A recent study conducted on 115 hospitalized COVID-19 patients did not find any significant difference in liver function tests when comparing COVID-19 with other forms of pneumonia, thus suggesting that liver impairment might not be a prominent feature in COVID-19.
