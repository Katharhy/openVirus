<p>Angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as the receptor used by the virus to enter human cells: the spike protein S binds to the receptor and mediates the fusion of the membranes. The process is regulated by the cell surfaceâ€“associated transmembrane protease serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), which operates in protein S cleavage and priming.
