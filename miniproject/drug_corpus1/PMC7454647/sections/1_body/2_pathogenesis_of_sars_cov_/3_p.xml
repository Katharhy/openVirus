<p>Viral RNA has been detected in fecal samples from up to 50% of COVID-19 patients, thus the possibility of a fecal-oral transmission for SARS-CoV-2 has been advanced.

 </sup> In the study from Xiao et al, SARS-CoV-2 RNA duration time in the stool ranged from 1 to 12 days, and about 25% of patients still had positive fecal samples after oral and nasopharyngeal swab negativization

 </sup> These studies suggest that fecal-oral route is at least possible for SARS-CoV-2 and might even last longer than “conventional” salivary droplet transmission. However, in a study conducted by Wolfel et al, although viral RNA was found in the stool samples of the patients, the presence of infectious SARS-CoV-2 was not detected, thus questioning the actual capability of the virus to be transmitted via a fecal-oral route.
