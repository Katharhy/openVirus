 </sup> Vedolizumab is a gut-selective agent that prevents lymphocytes homing; in a phase 1 clinical trial, its use in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)â€“positive patients did not increase the viral load.

 </sup> Ustekinumab targets the p40 subunit common to IL-12 and IL-23, thus blocking Th1 cells priming and Th17 cells activation. The suppression of the Th17 response might theoretically contribute to mitigate COVID-19 cytokine storm, but this approach has never been tested.
