 </sup> Tursi et al reported the case of a young man with IBD treated with adalimumab who developed COVID-19 and quickly recovered.

 </sup> In the SECURE-IBD registry, anti-TNF agents did not seem to affect the course of COVID-19, whereas combination therapy (anti-TNF and thiopurines) was associated with worse outcomes.

 </sup> Continuation of anti-TNF treatment is currently recommended

 </sup> Conversely, the use of combination therapy should probably be discouraged, at least in those patients with other risk factors for severe COVID-19.
