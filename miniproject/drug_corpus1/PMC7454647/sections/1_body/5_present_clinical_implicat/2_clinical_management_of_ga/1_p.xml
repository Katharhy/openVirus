<p>Immune-mediated diseases, patients undergoing chemotherapy, and transplant patients raise some concerns for a theoretically higher risk of infectious diseases. Given the paucity of evidences currently available, a cautious attitude in prescribing immunomodulators is generally advisable; however, a protective role for these patients has been theorized. Interleukin-6 inhibitors are currently used to treat COVID-19 complications

 </sup>; furthermore, observational studies reporting no severe cases in IBD patients living in epidemic areas might suggest that this population is actually at lower risk,

 </sup> and immunomodulators may have played a role in these observations. The preliminary data from the Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (SECURE-IBD) registry have shown that increasing age, â‰¥2 comorbidities, systemic corticosteroids, and sulfasalazine or mesalamine represent risk factors in IBD patients for severe COVID-19. The results on aminosalicylates are indeed surprising: they could depend on some unrecognized confounding factors or the biological activity of the drug, but no clear interpretation is possible to date.
