<p>Endoscopists are at high risk from inhalation of airborne droplets, mucosal contact, and potential fecal-oral transmission. The European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the European Society of Gastroenterology and Endoscopy Nurses Associated (ESGE/ESGENA) produced a detailed position statement for the COVID-19 pandemic, listing urgent (nondeferrable) and nonurgent (requiring a case-by-case evaluation) procedures. Patients risk stratification of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 is needed for scheduled GI endoscopy activities: in cases of high risk or confirmed infection, adequate PPE is required.
