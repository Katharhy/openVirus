<p>Health personnel had to face the pandemic by reorganizing shift and schedules, patient-physician relationships, and education tasks. This will induce health personnel to participate more actively in the organization of the post-COVID-19 era. Hospital and services, in fact, will not be allowed to come back to former schedules as the post-COVID-19 era maintains the risk of a second peak of the pandemic. Furthermore, “space restrictions” to avoid assembling and the consequent reduction of the total number of patients entering the outpatient clinic will outstand the organization, web-based telemedicine, and the suitability of clinical procedures.</p>
