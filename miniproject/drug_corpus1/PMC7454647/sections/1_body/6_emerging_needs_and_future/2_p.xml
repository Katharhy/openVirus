<p>In an attempt to reduce hospital visits and minimize the contagious risk, considerable numbers of visits and procedures have been postponed. Prioritizing urgent patients is undoubtedly imperative, but the compelling focus on the strategies to reduce contagions could lead to an improper neglection of “stable” patients, thus exposing them to otherwise preventable risks in the long term. Some concerns about the possible long-lasting impact of this situation on cirrhotic patients have been recently raised. Early diagnosis and close monitoring of cirrhosis complications are crucial for their management; the consequences of missed identifications of early hepatocellular carcinoma, delayed screening endoscopies, and unperformed follow-up visits are expected in the following months.

 </sup> Similar considerations could be made for IBD. Deep remission and treat-to-target strategies correlate with better long-term outcomes,

 </sup> To what extent the current shift in the management of IBD can impact the natural history of the disease is unpredictable. We can reasonably expect that diagnostic and therapeutic delays have occurred since the beginning of the pandemic, and we will have to cope with their consequences in the near future.
