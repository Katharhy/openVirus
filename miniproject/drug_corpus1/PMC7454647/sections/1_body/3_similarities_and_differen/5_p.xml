<p>The putative link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the onset of Kawasaki disease gives rise to the question about the actual extent of the mutual influences between the virus and the immune system. In this regard, the case of IBD is particularly interesting, given that the virus can exert a tropism on intestinal cells. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were found to be upregulated in inflamed intestine of IBD patients.

 </sup> These findings might hint at an augmented susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in IBD patients. On the other hand, it has been suggested that the soluble form of ACE2, whose serum concentrations are elevated in IBD,

 </sup> might exert a protective role against the infection by acting as a competitive receptor for the virus; soluble ACE2 is obtained through proteolytic cleavage, mediated by a protease (ADAM17) upregulated in active IBD.
