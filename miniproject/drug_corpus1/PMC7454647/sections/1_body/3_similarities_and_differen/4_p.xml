<p>The cytokine repertoire induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in complex COVID-19 presents significant similarities with those of some immune-mediated diseases, characterized by an aberrant activation of innate and adaptive immunity, possibly sustained by genetic or microbial predisposition

 </sup> The cause of KD remains unknown, but various studies have described an association between viral respiratory infections and KD, ranging from 9% to 42% of patients with KD testing positive for a respiratory viral infection in the 30-days leading up to diagnosis of KD.

 </sup> The immune system plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of KD,
