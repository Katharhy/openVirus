<p>COVID-19, especially in its later and more severe stages, is characterized by a significant dysregulation of immune cells.

 </sup> Neutrophilia has been associated with a higher risk for ARDS and death.

 </sup> Furthermore, studies on peripheral blood mononuclear cells have revealed some intriguing results: though all T-cell subtypes were numerically reduced, such a decrease was more prominent in memory and regulatory T cells. Interestingly, a correlation between disease severity and the levels of inflammatory biomarkers was observed, with a sharp rise in IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-13, IL-17, and TNF,
