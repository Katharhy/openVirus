<p>Despite some remarkable similarities, COVID-19 remains a very distinct entity from immune-mediated diseases (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). First of all, COVID-19 has a definite etiologic agent, whose opportune and timely clearance is associated with disease resolution. Furthermore, the cytokine overproduction is generally abrupt and restricted in duration. Finally, limited information is available regarding immune cells involvement in COVID-19, whereas the major role of these cell types has been widely described in immune-mediated disorders.
