<p>This axis has already been implicated in several diseases, with some interesting findings regarding viral respiratory infections reported in murine models, where a Th17-mediated modulation of gut microbiota composition has been observed.

 </sup> Furthermore, impairment of gut microbiota was found to be associated with more severe forms of respiratory influenza in mice, in which microbiota-derived signals were able to exert their effects on lung stromal cells and keep epithelial cells in an IFN-primed state, inducing an antiviral state in nonimmune cells.

 </sup> It could be argued that the composition of gut microbiota can have an impact on the immune response against some viral respiratory agents and, thus, on the outcome of the disease. Therefore, a putative role for the gut-lung axis in the modulation of the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the subsequent immune activation can be hypothesized (
