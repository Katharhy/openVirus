 </sup> Furthermore, it has been observed that gut-resident innate lymphoid cells, implicated in repair functions, can move to the lung under inflammatory stimulus.

 </sup> The ensemble of the relevant connections between the intestine and the lung, including gut and lung microbiota, their intercompartment crosstalk, and gut and lung immune system crosstalk with local or long-reaching interactions, has been called the “gut-lung axis.”
