<p>ACE2 on the enterocytes serves as regulator of dietary aminoacids uptake and has been implicated in gut immune and microbial homeostasis; it has been shown that its activation, under the regulation of tryptophan, leads to the production of antimicrobial peptides.

 </sup> Even though we do not know the exact implications of SARS-CoV-2 on the intestine, given that ACE2 is recognized by the virus, it is possible to hypothesize that its occupancy might inhibit its regulatory activity and produce intestinal dysbiosis; furthermore, it has been shown that ACE2 expression is downregulated by SARS-CoV-2,

 </sup> which could further contribute to limit ACE2 functions. Regardless of the exact mechanism, if SARS-CoV-2 is able to produce intestinal damage, the possibility of gut dysbiosis and augmented intestinal permeability needs to be taken into account. Such conditions might have an impact on lung diseases through 2 possible mechanisms: the translocation of bacteria and their metabolites or the migration of activated immune cells.

 </sup> Indeed, a study suggested a correlation between the composition of gut microbiota and the outcome of critically ill patients with ARDS: intestinal bacteria seemed to have an influence on the evolution of these patients, due to a gut-to-lung bacterial translocation secondary to increased gut and alveolo-capillary permeability.
