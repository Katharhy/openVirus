 </sup> Siddiqi and colleagues proposed a 3-phase model based on the observed symptoms to classify COVID-19. When the infection occurs (first stage), it typically presents with mild symptoms (malaise, low-grade fever, and dry cough). Some patients (up to 20%) develop atypical pneumonia (second stage), with high-grade fever, cough, dyspnea, and possibly hypoxia. Finally, a minority of patients progress to a third stage, characterized by a systemic hyperinflammatory state, that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, and death.
