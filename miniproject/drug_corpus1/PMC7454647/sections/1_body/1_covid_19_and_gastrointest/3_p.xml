<p>In a recent systematic review, gastrointestinal symptoms were found in a broad range of SARS-CoV-2 patients. Anorexia was the most common symptom, reported in up to 40% of the patients, followed by other, more gastrointestinal-specific symptoms, including watery diarrhea (9.6%–16%), nausea and vomiting (6.6%–15.3%), and abdominal pain (5.7%x–14.5%).

 </sup> Gastrointestinal bleeding has also been reported, but it is not clear whether it was directly caused by the infection or should be considered a secondary manifestation of systemic damage in critically ill patients.
