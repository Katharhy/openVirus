<p>A second explanation involves the inherent nature of immunity to viruses and proteins. Immune responses are complex involving repertoires of both B cells and T cells with multiple specificities and diverse immunodominance. For the virus, the most effective way to escape these responses is to make the minimal change that would affect the most specificities. One example of this process is the addition or shifting of glycosylation sites that have a broader structural impact than the single nucleotide change would normally predict (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Conversely for the host, targeting multiple viral epitopes or proteins complicates the virus' capacity to evade the response by forcing it to mutate multiple amino acids to avoid immune recognition during the limited time frame provided by acute infection. If very high concentrations of antibodies or high numbers of T cells of monoclonal specificity are pre-existing in the host at the time of infection, immune pressure could lead to selective virus evolution, even in an acute infection. However, the levels of monoclonal-specific response required for this process are highly unlikely to be present in a normal host. With each additional specificity, viral escape becomes progressively more difficult as the probability of the virus possessing multiple amino acid mutations is increasingly less likely and would require extremely high virus titers. Therefore, broadening the anti-HA specificities within an immune response should reduce the opportunity for point mutation evolution.
