<p>Finally, virus characteristics also contribute to limit the effect of immune-induced selection of specificity-selected variants. Influenza infection in the airways results in frequent superinfection of susceptible cells by multiple virus particles. This is the basis for the generation of reassortant viruses frequently detected for instance in zoonotic infection. This mechanism could also contribute to hinder the selection of mutant viruses, as unmutated antigens are still expressed and recognized by existing immune specificities during local coinfection, slowing down the kinetics of novel specificity selections. Furthermore, the segmented nature of the influenza virus genome complicates the selection of multiple mutation variants. While the generation of quasi-species virus is well known during influenza virus replication, the selection of multi-epitopic variants on different gene segments will probably proceed stepwise rather than synchronously as the mutations in different proteins will not be linked to one unique RNA strand.</p>
