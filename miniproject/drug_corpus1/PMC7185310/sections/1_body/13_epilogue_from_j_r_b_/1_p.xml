<p>It was a genuine privilege to be one of Peter's earliest graduate students. It was an extremely exciting time immediately after his Nobel winning discovery when he came to Philadelphia to work at the Wistar Institute and University of Pennsylvania. Peter's curiosity and passion to understand the biology of T cell responses were infectious and inspirational. It was a pure pleasure to work and learn side by side with him at the bench. I have immense gratitude for the training he gave me and for all the support he has provided throughout the years since. Although this journal issue is for Peter, personally I would feel remiss if I did not mention his supporting foundation at home. I thank Penny for her kindness, grace, and generosity when we were graduate students but also over the years. I recognize and deeply appreciate her contributions to Peter's success and support to allow him to share his knowledge and insight to me as a trainee but also to the rest of the world.</p>
