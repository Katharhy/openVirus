<p>First, influenza is an acute and limited infection in immunocompetent individuals. Other natural virus infections where immune-specific mutations have been observed involve chronic infection with various viruses such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), lymphocytic choriomeningitis, hepatitis, or herpes viruses (

Chronic infections provide sufficient time for mutant viruses less efficiently or not at all recognized by the immune system to outgrow the original virus and eventually to be transmitted. During acute infections, the time frame for virus evolution and transmission to the next host is compressed to a few days, making the process very unlikely in most cases. Thus, this kinetics issue provides one potential explanation why virus evolution is not typically observed for acute infections. In contrast, in immunocompromised individuals, influenza infection becomes more protracted, lasts for weeks, and is associated with frequent mutations in multiple viral genes (
