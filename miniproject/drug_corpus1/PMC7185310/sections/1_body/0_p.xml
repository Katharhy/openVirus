<p>As we considered the topic of our contribution to this special issue honoring Peter Doherty, we recalled that the central concept of Peter and Rolf Zinkernagel's Nobel award winning findings involved T cell specificity. Essentially, what do T cells recognize. The Doherty and Zinkernagel discovery in 1974 of the major histocompatibility complex restriction of T cells galvanized the field's focus on the T cell receptor and T cell antigen specificity (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) that the antitoxins (i.e., antibodies) described by von Behring and Kitasao (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) were preformed antibody receptors that specifically bound antigen. Specificity is key to all adaptive immune responses, and the basis for protective immunity induced by most vaccines typically involves specific antibodies. The specificity of B cell responses can further be critically important clinically as differences in antibody specificity can result in either protection against or enhancement of disease as illustrated in the case of dengue virus infection (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Currently, major efforts are underway to develop a universal influenza virus vaccine that would provide broadly protective immunity for all influenza A viruses (IAVs). In this brief piece, we suggest that the search for a universal influenza virus vaccination strategy must consider the inclusion of multiple universal target specificities to slow the risk of virus evolution and prevent viral escape.
