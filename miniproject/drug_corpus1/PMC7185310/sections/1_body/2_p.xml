<p>Due to the antigenic evolution of influenza viruses, influenza vaccine compositions are examined every year and adjusted as needed. Predictions of the best guess matched strains have improved over recent years thanks to the extended usage of viral sequencing data. However, it has become evident that additional factors, such as antigenic changes in the HA generated during the production of H3N2 vaccines in eggs, complicate further the attempt of matching the vaccines with circulating strains and result in decreased hemagglutination titers against these viruses (
