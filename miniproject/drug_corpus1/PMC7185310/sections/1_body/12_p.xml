<p>In a similar manner, a host response comprising multiple synergistic specificities could help minimize specificity-induced virus evolution. This requires addition of supplemental target antigens to current approaches designed to generate broadly reactive specificities using minimally focused immunogens. For influenza, this could be achieved in multiple ways. In addition to targeting the conserved HA stem region, the goal might be to continue to immunize with HA to generate an updated broader response targeting the head. Recent studies have indeed suggested that HA head immunodominance over stem epitopes can be overcome by partitioning head from stem (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Therefore, the additional specificities may have to be given in a separate immunization. Other target IAV proteins, such as the NA or the more conserved nucleoprotein or matrix, could also be considered to add breadth to the response. Any of these antigens would effectively broaden the vaccine response and reduce the opportunity for specificity-based virus evolution. To the extent possible, inducing responses associated with optimal effector function mechanisms, especially neutralization or preventing cell infection, would be ideal.
