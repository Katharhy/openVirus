<p>In more severe cases of COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) develops. To combat this condition, additional drugs are required to be administered to an affected patient for recovery. Wu et al. performed an analysis of already available therapeutic targets that can be repurposed for SARS-CoV-2 treatment via systematically analysing the proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 genes [
