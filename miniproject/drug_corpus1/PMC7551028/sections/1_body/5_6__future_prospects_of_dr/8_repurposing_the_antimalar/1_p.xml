<p>Recently, there have been discussions on repurposing the antimalarialdrug Chloroquine (CQ) or its alternatives CQ phosphate or Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 patients. Initially, CQ and HCQ were considered for their therapeutic potential due to previous reports on their strong anti-SARS-CoV activity in vitro after the 2003 coronavirus outbreak [

In this section, we describe the general mechanism of action of CQ against malaria, which was the original disease it was produced for. In addition, current research and clinical trials that have been conducted for repurposing CQ or HCQ for COVID-19 are highlighted.
