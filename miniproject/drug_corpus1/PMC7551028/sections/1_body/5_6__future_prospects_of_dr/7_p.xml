<p>Very recently, a study by Elfiky has used an up-to-date molecular docking strategy to elucidate the drugs Ribavirin, Remdisivir, Sofosbuvir, Galudesivir and Tenofovir as those that are potent against SARS-CoV-2 as they were predicted to bind to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RbRp) of the newly emerged coronavirus [
