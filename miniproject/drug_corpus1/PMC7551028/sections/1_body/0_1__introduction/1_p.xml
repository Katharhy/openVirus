<p>Drug development is a lengthy and detailed process that focuses on treating diseases by creating specific molecules that target the disease to alleviate or treat the presenting symptoms. Drug discovery is simply denoted as a process whereby an active ingredient is identified, primarily by high throughput screening, resulting in a biomolecule that targets a particular cellular pathway to treat a particular disease [

The process is designed to ensure that a new drug is effective, safe and most importantly available for patient use in the shortest possible time. In the act of drug discovery, de novo design has always been the foundation of study to generate novel and constructive bioactive molecules from the ground up. This approach involves stimulating the 3D structure of a receptor against which the drug is designed initially with the aid of computer modelling techniques followed by extensive research on the chemistry or molecular biology/biochemical formulation. Drug design involves the uncovering of the structure of target complexes and modifications of lead compounds via computational aid. Indisputably, with the vast improvement in technology and now techniques offered such as recombinant DNA, genomics and combinatorial chemistry, drug discovery has advanced in precision and has significantly decreased the time and overall cost of new drug development [
