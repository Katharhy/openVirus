<p>Apart from the obvious, drug repositioning offers a positive outcome in orphan drug development. Orphan diseases (ODs) are those that affect only a minute population, for which no effective drug treatments are available. There are several factors that contribute to this scenario. As such, the low drug demand from the rare occurrence add up to prohibitive costs in drug development, and low subject availability for clinical trials, subsequently driving interest away from the researchers and pharmaceutical industries as the investment of time and money may not be profitable. With drug repositioning, the ever-concerning cost and time issue for an orphan drug can be resolved by exploring new uses from the existing or abandoned drug therapies. </p>
