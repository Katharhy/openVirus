<p>Most recently, a new approach called drug repositioning has been gaining popularity [

Drug repositioning (DRS), otherwise also known as drug repurposing, drug recycling, drug redirecting, drug re-tasking or drug reprofiling, is currently denoted as an alternate approach to find new uses of an original drug to treat other diseases aside from the intended ones [

The positive projection of drug repositioning lies within the effort of drug developers to fulfil demands, especially for diseases that lack drug treatment or are otherwise expensive to treat. Of course, profit is an inseparable factor here. As the Nobel laureate pharmacologist James Black once said: “The most fruitful basis for the discovery of a new drug is to start with an old drug” [

This sudden spurt of interest is evident from PubMed, where there are more than 1000 publications as of the year 2020 on “drug repositioning”. For instance, the drug Sildenafil, more commonly known as Viagra, is a potent example of a repositioned drug; it was first intended to treat heart disease and can now be used to treat erectile dysfunction. Another prime example is Duloxetine, currently the most preferred drug therapy for stress urinary incontinence (SUI), where it was initially developed for depression [
