<p>Apart from computational approaches, experimental approaches are a supplement in drug repositioning. A study conducted by Niu and colleagues has generated a favourable outcome by combining both approaches on drug repositioning for hyperuricemia [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-01058" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Hyperuricemia is a disorder where excessive uric acid levels are accumulated in the blood, as a result of abnormal purine levels or a failure of normal uric acid excretion. The key enzyme that regulates uric acid production is the xanthine oxidase (XOD) which catalyses the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine, and subsequently uric acid. A protein-ligand docking software by Idock was used in this study to screen approved drugs structures attained from the ZINC database, DSSTox database and the NCGC Pharmaceutical Collection (NPC) [
