<p>Pathway mapping has been frequently used with GWAS to identify potential drugs. In some cases, the identified potential targets found via GWAS are not druggable. Pathway mapping is a network analysis on drug or disease networks based on gene expression patterns, disease pathology and protein interaction, providing the necessary information in exploiting drug repositioning opportunities. Pathway mapping provides vital information for genes that are either upstream or downstream of the GWAS-associated target, subsequently unravelling the potential for drug repositioning [

A study on respiratory viral infections conducted by Smith et al. successfully identified 67 common biological pathways that may be associated with respiratory viral infections. Subsequently, crossing these pathways to the DrugBank database, few potential drug repositioning candidates are discovered for the treatment of respiratory viral infection. One of them is the drug Amrinone, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that was used for the treatment of congestive heart failure [

Also, multiple omics analysis mapped to significant pathways allows for the simultaneous detection of target genes and human proteins for their potential in specific diseases. For instance, drug candidates and human protein targets have been identified for several diseases such as dengue haemorrhagic fever [

Limitations include drug coverage, drug disruption data, dosage, condition-dependent and cell line limitations as animal model expression patterns may not reflect the human systems [
