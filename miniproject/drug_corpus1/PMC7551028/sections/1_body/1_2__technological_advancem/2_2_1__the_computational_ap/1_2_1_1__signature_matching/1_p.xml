<p>Signature matching is a technique that utilises transcriptomic, proteomic/metabolomic data and chemical profiles to make drug–disease and drug–drug comparisons with respect to the “signature” or unique characteristic of the drug, disease or clinical phenotype [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-01058" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The transcriptomic signature can be utilised for a drug–disease and drug–drug comparison. Firstly, the drug–disease comparison investigates the gene expression profiles before and after treatment with the potential drug. Subsequently, result comparisons are made with the disease-associated expression profile against the healthy expression profile. The hypothesis is that if a set of gene expression changes within a disease, matches with a drug with the opposite set of gene expression changes, i.e., genes upregulated in disease are downregulated by the drug, that renders potential in that drug to be used therapeutically for the disease [

 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-01058" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This approach mainly relies on the signature reversion principle (SRP), in which a drug capable of reversing the hallmark of a gene expression pattern for a particular disease phenotype is then very likely to be able to revert the given disease phenotype. A study conducted by Wei et al. (2006) showed that the drug profile of an mTOR inhibitor, Rapamycin, matched the signature of glucocorticoid sensitive profile and successfully reversed the glucocorticoid resistance in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells when screened across the drug-associated gene expression database. The screening result implied that Rapamycin might be a promising treatment for lymphoid malignancies [

 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-01058" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This approach renders a vast opportunity in drug repositioning and, of course, relies heavily on accessible gene expression databases such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-01058" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Apart from that, the chemical profiles are also extremely important for drug repositioning, in which chemical structures with respect to the biological activities of two different drugs are compared. This process is carried out to understand the chemical similarities and subsequently construct a network based on the shared chemical features to predict new targets for the established drugs [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-01058" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The aforementioned approaches have significantly benefited the selection of potential candidates for drug repositioning. Nevertheless, a notable limitation of this approach is the difficulty in determining the optimal query signature, in which the parameters can vary remarkably between different diseases and studies. Ideal query parameters such as the 
 <italic>p</italic>-value threshold and absolute fold change for signatures are yet to be established. For instance, a central nervous system injury involves 21 genes for signature, based on a 
 <italic>p</italic>-value threshold of 0.05 and an absolute fold change of ≥1.5. In contrast, glioblastoma, an aggressive cancer in the spinal cord or brain can engage up to 1000 genes with a 
 <italic>p</italic>-value threshold of 0.0001 and an absolute fold change of ≥4 [
