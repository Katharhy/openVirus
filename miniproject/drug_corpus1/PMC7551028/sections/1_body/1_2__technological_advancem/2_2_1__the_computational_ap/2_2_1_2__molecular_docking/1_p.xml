<p>As the word “docking” suggests, molecular docking involves a computational strategy in predicting the conformation on the binding site of a drug to the target receptor. Molecular docking is akin to a lock-and-key concept where the key (drug/ligand) finds the correct orientation to fit the lock (target/receptor). Molecular docking involves the prediction of the ligand conformation with reference to its position and orientation within the target sites along with the assessment of the binding affinity [

As such, a study conducted by Dakshanamurthy et al. (2012) discovered that the anti-inflammatory agent, Celecoxib, binds to cadherin-11, a crucial adhesion molecule in rheumatoid arthritis and poor prognosis malignancies, upon performing high-throughput computational docking on 3671 FDA-approved drugs across 2335 human protein crystal structures. This strategy enhances the drug repositioning opportunity, especially for diseases with no existing therapies [

More recently, with the emergence and spread of COVID-19, molecular docking has successfully determined a potential antiviral for COVID-19, a poly-ADP-ribose polymerase-1, CVL218, an inhibitor that binds to the N-terminal of the nucleocapsid (N) protein of the virus [
