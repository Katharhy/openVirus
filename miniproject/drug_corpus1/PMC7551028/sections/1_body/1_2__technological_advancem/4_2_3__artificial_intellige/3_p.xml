<p>In urgent times of need, like the current COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, AI has been a huge supplement to drug repositioning. For instance, BenevolentAI, an AI prediction method based on an extensive repository of structured medical database which includes various connections extracted by scientific literature via machine learning, has aided in the search of potential drug repositioning candidates for the treatment of COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-12-01058" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The study has shown a vital key for the SARS-CoV-2 infection, known as the ACE-2 cell receptor, found abundantly in the blood vessels, heart and lung AT2 alveolar epithelial cells, subsequently leading to COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-12-01058" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1), regulates the ACE-2 cell receptor, a crucial receptor for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry [

 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-01058" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In sum, the computational approaches accompanied by AI show great promise for drug repositioning, especially amid the COVID-19 outbreak with an urgent need for a therapeutic proposition. Also, in some cases, this approach is comparable or even better than the in vitro assays.
