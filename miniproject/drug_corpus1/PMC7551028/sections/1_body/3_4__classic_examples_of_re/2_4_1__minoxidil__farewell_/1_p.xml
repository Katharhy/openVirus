<p>The classic example of success in drug repositioning is Minoxidil, an oral drug that was intended to treat hypertension then became a treatment for hair loss prevention [

 <xref rid="B50-viruses-12-01058" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Minoxidil was first introduced in the 1970s/1980s to counteract hypertension. However, patients who had consumed Minoxidil came across a widespread side effect known as hypertrichosis, which caused hair growth on the face, arms, shoulders and legs in both men and women [

Its mechanism functioned by causing vasodilation via the opening of potassium channels, which indirectly upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in human hair follicle dermal papilla cells (HFDPC) of the human scalp [
