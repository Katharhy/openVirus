<p>To speed things up, a central medical research agency, the NIH, has been developed. The success and development of NIH are a result of an increased collaboration effort between multiple parties, such as academic institutions, governments and biopharmaceutical companies. To further assist the development of rare and orphan drugs, the NIH has created the NCGC Pharmaceutical Collection (NPC), in collaboration with NIHâ€™s Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND) [

Besides that, to expedite drug repurposing for rare and orphan diseases, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also established the Rare Diseases Repurposing Database (RDRD), by matching the FDA orphan database to the FDA drug and biological product approval lists. With these efforts, there were over 281 orphan drugs approved in 2014 [
