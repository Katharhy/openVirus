<p>The development of a drug for highly mutated diseases such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has been an expensive and time-consuming process. To date, there are more than 30 drugs approved for HIV treatment. Each drug has a different approach, classified under six different classes, namely the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), nonâ€“nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs), integrase inhibitors (INs), entry/fusion inhibitors and CCR5 receptor antagonists [

To make matters worse, drug resistance to HIV occurs more than one drug at a time as the resistance is based on the same mode of inhibition within the same drug classes, rendering the therapeutic potential ineffective [

For instance, an anticancer drug, zidovudine/azidothymidine (AZT) was developed in the 1960s specifically targeting the Friend Leukaemia Virus (FV) that causes leukaemia has been successfully repositioned to be an antiretroviral drug for HIV treatment today [
