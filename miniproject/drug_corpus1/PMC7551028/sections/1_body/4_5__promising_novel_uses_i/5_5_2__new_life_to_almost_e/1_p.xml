<p>Drug repositioning is also important to eradicate multitudinous highly resistant diseases such as metronidazole-resistant Giardia Lamblia, which accommodated up to 20% of the treatment failure cases [

Auranofin, an antirheumatic drug approved by the FDA in 1985 had declined in popularity in recent years mainly due to an improved formulation of newer antirheumatic drugs such as Methotrexate, Minocycline and so on. Also, the significant adverse effects over the long-term usage of Auranofin such as diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal cramps and symptoms of hypersensitivity moved interest away from that particular drug. However, in a recent study, Auranofin exhibited antigiardial activity, especially on a metronidazole-resistant strain by blocking the giardia thioredoxin oxidoreductase, a crucial enzyme to counter oxidative damage in Giardia Lamblia [
