<p>The current costly and time-consuming paradigm of drug discovery has restricted the larger outcome of drug development. With the substantial costs, high risk and slow pace in drug discovery, an alternative approach is much needed to revive drug development to fulfil market needs [

This condition further exacerbates as the number of new drugs approved per billion USD deteriorate significantly to below 1 after the year of 2000, according to Eroomâ€™s Law, indicating higher spending on research and development with significant less new molecular entities approval per year [
