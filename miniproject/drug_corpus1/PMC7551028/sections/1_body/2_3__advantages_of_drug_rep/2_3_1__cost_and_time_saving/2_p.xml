<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01058-f002">Figure 2</xref>, drug repositioning shortens the time and cost needed at many stages as compared to the traditional de novo approach. This remarkable outcome is a result of the repositioned candidates that have gone through rigorous safety and pharmacokinetic profile studies for clinical development and have been well established but never made it through due to unfortunate failures at the endpoint on the intended target [
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-12-01058" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This new development course of repositioning can circumvent the unexpected derailment due to unforeseen failures during primary preclinical studies [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-12-01058" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. With the established formulations, ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity) data and the omission of preclinical/phase I of drug development, drug repositioning significantly reduces the time needed and subsequently saves drug discovery costs up to 40% from molecule to market via a shorter and faster pathway [
