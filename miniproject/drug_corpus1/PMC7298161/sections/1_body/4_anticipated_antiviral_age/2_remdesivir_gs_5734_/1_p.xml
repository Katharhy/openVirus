<p id="Par23">Remdesivir was first used to treat Ebola virus, and it has completed phase 2 clinical trials [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. As a nucleoside analog, it can interact with RdRp [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], and the triphosphate form of remdesivir will compete with adenosine triphosphate, leading to delayed chain termination and inhibiting viral replication and transcription [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. A number of in vitro studies have shown that remdesivir has inhibitory effects on a variety of human and animal coronaviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. An in vivo study of remdesivir against SARS-CoV showed that remdesivir can reduce virus levels in the lungs of mice infected with SARS-CoV and reduce lung function damage caused by the virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Moreover, some studies have found that the antiviral effect of remdesivir against MERS-CoV is better than that of lopinavir/ritonavir combined with IFN-β [
