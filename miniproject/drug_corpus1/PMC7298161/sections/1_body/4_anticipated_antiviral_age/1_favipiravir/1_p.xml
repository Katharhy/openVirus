 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] with an ability to inhibit RNA-dependent polymerase [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and was approved for marketing in Japan in 2014. It is used for antiviral treatment of influenza A and B [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and can effectively inhibit Ebola virus, yellow fever virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], etc. In vitro experiments have shown that favipiravir is effective for COVID-19 and that its EC
 <sub>50</sub> is 61.88 μM [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. To date, some clinical trials of favipiravir in the treatment of COVID-19 have been carried out in China. Recent clinical studies have found that compared with the antiviral drug arbidol, the clinical effect of favipiravir is more significant. Nucleic acid positive-to-negative time, mean antipyretic time and cough remission time were all better than those of the arbidol group [
