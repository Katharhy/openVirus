<p id="Par4">By genome sequencing, it was found that SARS-CoV-2 has 82% sequence similarity with SARS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and through phylogenetic tree analysis, it has 96% homology with bat coronaviruses at the genome level, for which reason bats were inferred to be the host for SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].Â The genome structure of SARS-CoV-2 is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.
