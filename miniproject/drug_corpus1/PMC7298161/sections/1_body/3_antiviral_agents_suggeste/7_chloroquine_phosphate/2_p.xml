<p id="Par20">Some studies have found that the spike glycoprotein on the virus envelope binds to the ACE2 receptor to mediate SARS-CoV-2 infection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Chloroquine phosphate has been reported to interfere with the glycosylation of the ACE2 receptor, thereby inhibiting the binding of SARS-CoV to cells and achieving therapeutic goals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Therefore, chloroquine phosphate is used to treat COVID-19, and in vitro experiments show that chloroquine phosphate does inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and that its EC
 <sub>50</sub> is 1.13 μM [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Apart from the above antiviral mechanism, chloroquine phosphate can continue to exert antiviral effects after SARS-CoV-2 invades cells, and it also has immunomodulatory activity to strengthen the antiviral effect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Therefore, chloroquine phosphate has been included in the “Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia” and is undergoing clinical trials. Chloroquine phosphate is used for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults aged 18–65 years. Those who weigh more than 50 kg will receive 500 mg twice daily for 7 days, while those who weigh less than 50 kg will receive 500 mg twice daily on days 1 and 2 and 500 mg once daily on days 3–7 [
