<p id="Par36">A recent study showed that in addition to the use of the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 to enter the cell, SARS-CoV-2 has two other proteins, cathepsin B and L(CatB/L) and TMPRSS2, that activate the S protein, help SARS-CoV enter the cell, and play a key role in the process of invasion of normal cells by SARS-CoV-2 [
