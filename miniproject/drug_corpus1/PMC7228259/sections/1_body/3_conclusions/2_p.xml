<p>The use of DD methodology in conjunction with Glide allowed rapid estimation of docking scores for 1.3 billion chemical structures into an active site of novel SARS‐CoV‐2 Mpro. The candidate inhibitors in the top‐1,000 hit list are chemically diverse, exhibit superior docking scores compared to known protease inhibitors, and can be readily sourced from established vendors. The structures of the identified compounds are made publicly available and should facilitate international efforts in rapid development of suitable drug candidates against COVID‐19.</p>
