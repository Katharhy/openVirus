<p>To assess the performance of fast Glide SP protocol
 <xref rid="minf202000028-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref> to virtually screen against the Mpro target, we collected 81 known SARS Mpro small molecule inhibitors that are reported by Pillaiyar et al.,
 <xref rid="minf202000028-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref> and Turlington et al..
 <xref rid="minf202000028-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref> Then, we generated 50 molecular decoys for each active molecules using the methodology implemented in the Database of Useful Decoys: Enhanced (DUD−E).
 <xref rid="minf202000028-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">39</xref> All compounds were prepared for docking with the OpenEye package. Most probable tautomer and ionization states at pH 7.4 were calculated with OpenEye QUACPAC package
 <xref rid="minf202000028-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref> and starting 3D conformations were generated using Omega 
 <italic>pose</italic> routine.
 <xref rid="minf202000028-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">41</xref> The structure of SARS Mpro bound to a noncovalent inhibitor (PDB 4MDS, 1.6 Å resolution) was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB),
 <xref rid="minf202000028-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">42</xref> and prepared using Protein Preparation Wizard.
 <xref rid="minf202000028-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">43</xref> Docking was performed using Glide SP module.
 <xref rid="minf202000028-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref> Receiver operating curve areas under the curve (ROC AUC) were then calculated.
