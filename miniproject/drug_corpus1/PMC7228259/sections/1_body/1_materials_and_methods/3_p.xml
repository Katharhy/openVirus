<p>We used DD to virtually screen all ZINC15 (1.36 billion compounds)
 <xref rid="minf202000028-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">44</xref> against the SARS‐CoV‐2 Mpro. The model was initialized by randomly sampling 3 million molecules and dividing them evenly into training, validation and test set. The structure PDB 6LU7 (resolution 2.16 Å)
 <xref rid="minf202000028-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">45</xref> of the SARS‐CoV‐2 Mpro bound to the N3 covalent inhibitor was obtained from the PDB, and prepared as before. Molecule preparation and docking were performed similarly as before, and computed scores were used for DNN initialization. We then ran 4 iterations, adding each time 1 million of docked molecules sampled from previous predictions to the training set and setting the recall of top scoring compounds to 0.75. At the end of the 4
 <sup>th</sup> iteration, the top 3 million molecules predicted to have favorable scores were then docked to the protease site. The set of protease inhibitors (7,800 compounds) from the BindingDB repository was also docked to the same site.
 <xref rid="minf202000028-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">46</xref> Our computational setup consisted of 13 Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6130 CPUs @ 2.10GHz (a total of 390 cores) for docking, and 40 Nvidia Tesla V100 GPUs with 32GB memory for deep learning.
