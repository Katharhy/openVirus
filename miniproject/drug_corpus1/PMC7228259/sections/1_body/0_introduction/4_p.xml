<p>Earlier efforts to target SARS‐CoV resulted in identification of several covalent Mpro inhibitors targeting the catalytic dyad of the protein defined by His41 and Cys145

Still, the majority of approved drugs administered as anti‐SARS were designed for other viral strains (Table S1 in supplementary material). Notably, no CoV‐protease specific inhibitor has yet successfully completed a clinical development program to date.
