<p>DD relies on a deep neural network trained with docking scores of small random samples of molecules extracted from a large database to predict the scores of remaining molecules and, therefore, discard low scoring molecules without investing time and resources to dock them. The combination of an iterative process to improve model training and the use of simple 2D QSAR descriptors such as Morgan fingerprints makes DD particularly suited for fast virtual screening of emerging giga‚Äêsized chemical libraries using standard computational resources. We have recently showed the wide range of applicability of DD by using the method to dock all ZINC15 compounds to 12 targets representing major protein families of therapeutic interest.
