<p>Our benchmarking study revealed good ability of Glide SP to dock known inhibitors. First, the co‐crystallized ligand (SID 24808289 from Turlington et al.
 <xref rid="minf202000028-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref>) was accurately redocked to its binding site (root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.86 Å between Glide and x‐ray pose, Figure 
 <xref rid="minf202000028-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Second, ROC AUC value for Glide SP used to dock 81 Mpro inhibitors and ∼4,000 decoys was 0.72, similarly to the more computationally expensive Glide XP protocol (Figure 
 <xref rid="minf202000028-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b), and 0.74 when active molecules were diluted in 1 million random compounds extracted from ZINC15 (Figure S1 in supplementary material). Thus, in light of recent studies advocating for extending virtual screening to large chemical libraries when docking works well at smaller scales,
 <xref rid="minf202000028-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref> we decided to use Glide SP as DD docking program to screen ZINC15 against SARS‐CoV‐2 Mpro.
