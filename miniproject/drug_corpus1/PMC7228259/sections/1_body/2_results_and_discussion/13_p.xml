<p>Our DD screening identified 585 new scaffolds for SARS‐CoV‐2 that are not shared with known protease inhibitors, although they can establish all the critical interactions with the protease active site, thus providing a completely new set of chemicals for testing and optimization. Collectively, our results strongly support the use of docking the largest available compound library for identifying novel potent scaffolds or chemicals, as concluded by Lyu et al..
