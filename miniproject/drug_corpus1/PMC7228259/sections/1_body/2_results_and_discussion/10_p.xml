<p>The number 1 series of compounds identified from our virtual screening is presented in Table 
 <xref rid="minf202000028-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>. They are predicted to have consistent binding pose, similar to the noncovalent compound SID 24808289, as shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="minf202000028-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a. The predicted interaction between ZINC000541677852 and SARS‐CoV‐2 Mpro is shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="minf202000028-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b. This series of compounds occupied the same volume as the P1, P2 and P3 groups with the common favored hydrophobic interactions of the phenyl ring (P2), and two hydrogen bonds to Cys145 and Leu141 respectively (P1).
