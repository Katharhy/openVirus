<p>The SARS Mpro cleaves the replicase polyproteins, pp1a and pp1b, at 11 specific positions, using core sequences in the polyprotein substrate to determine cleavage sites.
 <xref rid="minf202000028-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">53</xref> The positions of the residues on the polyproteins are named depending on their relative position to the cleavage site. Position P1 corresponds to the residue just before the cleavage site, followed by P2, P3, P4, P5, and up until the N‐terminal of the cleavage site. Position P1′ corresponds to the residue immediately following the cleavage site, followed by P2′, P3′, P4′, P5′ and up until the C‐terminal of the cleavage site.
 <xref rid="minf202000028-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">54</xref> The protease recognizes specific residues at each position of the polyproteins to determine a cleavage site and initiate the replication‐transcription complex necessary for viral replication.
