<p>We also evaluated the chemical diversity of the newly identified set of inhibitors compared to the protease library. Calculation of Murcko frameworks
 <xref rid="minf202000028-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">58</xref> for hits from such library and DD hits revealed a similar number of frameworks present in the two sets (603 and 587 scaffolds, respectively). Encouragingly, we observed just two common frameworks, clearly indicating that screening 1.36 billion enables identification of new chemical classes that can potentially inhibit SARS‐COV‐2 Mpro. Thus, DD allowed us to rapidly narrow down ZINC15 to a smaller dataset enriched with high scoring compounds, which consists of novel molecules with highly favourable docking scores as well as significantly different structures than known protease inhibitors.
