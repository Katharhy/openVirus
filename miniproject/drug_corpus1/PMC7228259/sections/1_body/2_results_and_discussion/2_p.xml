<p>Although drug repurposing and high‐throughput screening have identified potential hit compounds with strong antiviral activity against COVID‐19,
 <xref rid="minf202000028-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">47</xref> no noncovalent inhibitors for SARS‐CoV‐2 Mpro have been reported to date. Glide protocols were recently deployed to identify potential hit compounds as protease inhibitors, notably against FP‐2 and FP‐3 (

 <xref rid="minf202000028-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">49</xref> and more recently against SARS‐CoV‐2 MPro.
