<p>Based on the consensus recognition sequence of the polyproteins, a substrate‐analogue inhibitor, CMK, was designed to mimic positions P1 to P6 of the substrate in the SARS Mpro substrate‐binding sites. The compound is characterised by its chloromethyl ketone warhead and its core sequence of Val(P6)‐Asn(P5)‐Ser(P4)‐Thr(P3)‐Leu(P2)‐Gln(P1) to occupy the same volume as the residues of the recognition sequence.

 <xref rid="minf202000028-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">57</xref>). Therefore, the pocket of the Mpro can be partitioned into different sections, depending on the volume occupied by polyprotein residues at each positions.
