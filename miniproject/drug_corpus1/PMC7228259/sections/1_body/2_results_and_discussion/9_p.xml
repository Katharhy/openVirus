<p>Using insight gained from the crystal structure, Turlington et al. first developed a moderate noncovalent inhibitor, SID 24808289, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 6.2 μM,
 <xref rid="minf202000028-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref> and demonstrated that additional positions could be explored for efficient inhibition of SARS Mpro. The binding pose of the compound is shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="minf202000028-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, and the compound occupies the same volume as positions P1 to P4, and P1′. The compound still maintained key interactions with catalytic dyad of Gln189 and Met49 through hydrophobic contacts (P2), and through hydrogen bonds to Cys145, His163, and Glu166 (P1).
