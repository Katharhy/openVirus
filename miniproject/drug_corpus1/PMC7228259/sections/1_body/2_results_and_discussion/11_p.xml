<p>We have also analyzed the origin of top 1,000 ZINC hits (selected by LE), and observed that 99 % of them are not present in the ZINC15 in‐stock library (∼11 millions of molecules), commonly used in routine docking campaigns, demonstrating that the DD methodology can access complete and diverse chemical space beyond classical docking. The Glide SP scores of the top 1,000 candidates we selected were significantly better than top 1,000 molecules from a 1 million random sample of ZINC15 entries, and even better than top candidates from BindingDB protease inhibitor library, which were docked to the same site (Figure
