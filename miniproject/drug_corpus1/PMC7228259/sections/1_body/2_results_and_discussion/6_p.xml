<p>The use of DD platform enabled us to dock 1.3 billion compounds from ZINC15 database
 <xref rid="minf202000028-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">44</xref> into SARS‐CoV‐2 Mpro active site using standard Glide SP protocols in a week. In our benchmark study on SARS Mpro, AUC ROC for Glide SP improved from 0.72 to 0.78, when a ligand efficiency (LE) cutoff of −0.20 kcal/mol was introduced prior to ranking molecules by their docking scores (Figure S2 in supplementary material). Thus, the top 1,000 hits selected from the DD run were picked following the same strategy.
