<p id="p0035">By contrast, prospective meta-analyses, as a newly developed methodology, predefine eligible studies for inclusion before the results of those studies became known, to objectively address the planned research questions [
 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This process restricts its application to only high priority research questions for which little or no previous evidence exists, but where new studies are rapidly emerging. This perfectly fits the context of ongoing and upcoming COVID-19 clinical trials. There are a large number of ongoing studies in parallel evaluating, for example, antiviral drugs, such as remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, or interferon alpha, and the antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine [
 <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Given that many studies have small patient sizes or have difficulties in recruiting the targeted number, these individual studies will be underpowered to address the main clinical questions, especially when the effects are moderate. We propose that when several trials are investigating the same treatment or intervention for patients with COVID-19 with compatible study designs and outcome measures, these studies should be pooled to form a collaboration or consortium of prospective meta-analysis (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> ). For example, there are five randomized trials comparing remdesivir with standard treatment (Clinical Trial Number: NCT04292899, NCT04292730, and NCT04315948; Eudra CT Number
 <xref rid="p0065" ref-type="p">iv</xref>: 2020-000841-15 and 2020-000842-32) [
 <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These studies can be considered to form a prospective meta-analysis consortium. Similarly, this approach can also be applicable to the trials comparing hydroxychloroquine with standard treatment (Clinical Trial Number: NCT04315948, NCT04261517, and NCT04316377 and Chinese Clinical Trail Registry
 <xref rid="p0070" ref-type="p">v</xref>: ChiCTR2000030054, ChiCTR2000029868, and ChiCTR2000029740) [
