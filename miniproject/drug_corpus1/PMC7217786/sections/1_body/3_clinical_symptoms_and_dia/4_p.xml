<p id="p0170">To detect the causative viruses, similar measures were applied for CoVs and IAVs. The specimen can be swabs, blood, or trachea extracts. Then the viral RNAs can be directly identified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based methods, and the virus specific antibodies can be detected with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or related serological methods. More detailed information has been summarized in the previous publication [
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In order to deal with the simultaneous transmission of IAVs and CoVs, especially the new coronavirus, it is necessary to develop rapid and simple differential diagnosis technologies and methods for identification of IAVs and CoVs.
