<p id="p0135">Similar to CoV, IAV is also an enveloped virus, with genome of a single strand but negative-sense RNA, which is divided into eight segments, encoding 12 proteins, including PB2, PB1, PB1–F2, PB1 N40, PA, NP, HA, NA, M1, M2, NS, and NEP/NE2, respectively [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C, haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are distributed on the surface of virus particles, which are the basis for subtype classification of IAVs and also play important roles during the process of virus invasion and mature virus releasing [

 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Like S protein of CoVs, HA and NA are very important targets of antiviral drugs and vaccines [

 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The majority subtype of seasonal IAVs is H3N2 [

 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C displays the three clusters of HA genes. They show a distinct difference from each other, with the HA gene of H5N1 virus generating more mutations during its transmission as reported [
