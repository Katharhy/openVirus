<p id="p0140">Compared to CoV, there are two major differences in the life cycle of IAV. First, the IAV needs to replicate its genome in the nucleus. Secondly, the virions are released by assembly and budding from cellular membrane. As illustrated in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>D, IAV binds to receptor α-2,3-linked sialic acid (H7N9 and H5N1) or α2,6-linked sialic acid (H1N1 and H3N2) to form endosome and enters into cell, and the viral RNA was released into the cytoplasm by viral-endosome membrane fusion. Then the viral RNA is imported into the nucleus, and once there starts both virus RNA transcription and replication. After mRNAs and progeny negative-sense RNAs are exported to cytoplasm, the proteins are translated and trafficked to the cell membrane into packaged RNAs. The mature virus then buds from the cells [
