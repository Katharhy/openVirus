<p id="p0205">Until now, the neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) are still the most ideal reagents for clinical treatment [
 <xref rid="bib120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. NAIs can prevent the hydrolytic activity of neuraminidase when the mature virus leaves the cell after budding, therefore stopping the virus from infecting healthy cells [

 <xref rid="bib123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>], raising the alert that whether we can deal with influenza viruses once they break through the last line of defense? It has been found that probenecid can prevent the renal secretion of the parent compound of oseltamivir and significantly increase the blood concentration of oseltamivir [
