<p id="p0150">Some subtypes of IAVs also resulted in pandemic and caused large number of death tolls. Besides the well documented Spanish flu in 1918, H1N1pdm09 virus spread to 214 countries one year after it appeared in USA in 2009 [

 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Some scientists deduced that the senior people may carry the immune memories from those induced by 1918H1N1-like flu viruses in their early years, which cross protected them from the H1N1pdm09 virus attack [

 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. H7N9 and H5N1 viruses were limited in transmission due to the similar reason mentioned above with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. However, the mortality of H7N9 is as high as 37%, and H5N1 is 53% [

 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Nevertheless, the high pathogenicity and high mortality make them easier to be identified and controlled at the beginning of the break. Although H7N9 and H5N1 viruses transmitted in humans ineffectively, their geographic expansion and genetic recombination still suggested the potential of forming the next pandemic [
