<p id="p0225">For development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, an intense global effort is currently underway [
 <xref rid="bib147" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. So far several vaccines candidates have moved into clinical trials in China. One of them moved into phase II trail on April 12, which was produced by the Institute of Bioengineering, Academy of Military Medicine (NCT04341389) [
 <xref rid="bib148" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. The research team led by Professor Chen took the modified replication defective adenovirus as the vector, carried the S gene of the new CoV, to stimulate immune memory of S protein in humans. Their phase I trial was finished on March 27. In total 108 volunteers have completed the centralized medical observation without showing side effects (NCT04313127). In addition, LV-SMENP-DC, a dendritic cells vaccine, transduced with a lentivirus vector expression of several minigenes of SARS-CoV-2 and immunomodulatory genes, was developed by Shenzhen Geno-Immune Medical Institute (SGIMI) in China and used for injection of people along with activated virus antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells (NCT04276896). SGIMI also developed a second one using artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPCs) modified with lentivirus vector carrying similar genes with LV-SMENP-DC (NCT04299724). Two inactivated vaccines were approved for clinical trial as well, developed by the China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) and Sinovac Research and Development Co., Ltd (NCT04352608) [
