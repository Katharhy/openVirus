<p>RWHAP clients were classified based on their patterns of rural and non-rural service utilization, which may or may not reflect a clientâ€™s residence in a rural or non-rural area.

Rural areas of the United States may lack extensive public transit systems, which could create barriers to healthcare for individuals who may not have access to or may not be able to afford a private vehicle. Nearly 40% of RWHAP providers in rural areas were funded for medical transportation services, which specifically address this issue. Additionally, societal barriers such as stigma and risks to confidentiality in smaller communities could lead PLWH residing in rural areas to seek care outside of their immediate rural community [
