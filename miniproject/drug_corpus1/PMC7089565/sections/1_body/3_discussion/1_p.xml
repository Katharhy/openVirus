<p>Of the more than 2,000 provider organizations funded by the RWHAP in 2017, approximately 6% of them were located in rural areas of the United States. Rural providers were funded to deliver more RWHAP service categories than non-rural providers, especially medical and support services such as oral health care and case management, and 87.9% were dually funded by Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act. This suggests that the RWHAP in rural areas not only acts as a critical component of the HIV healthcare delivery system, but also has the potential to leverage resources and expertise of the federal Health Center Program.</p>
