<p>Although previous studies have shown that rural PLWH experience a multitude of barriers to accessing and remaining engaged in HIV care, only some studies found an association between rurality and HIV clinical outcomes [

That is, rates of retention in HIV care and viral suppression among RWHAP clients visiting rural providers were comparable to the 97% of clients who visited only non-rural providers. While this may be indicative of the strength of the RWHAP comprehensive system of care, it may also be due to the role of confounding by demographic characteristics such as age. For example, RWHAP clients who visited only rural providers were older than clients who visited only non-rural providers, and older PLWH are more likely to reach viral suppression than younger PLWH [
