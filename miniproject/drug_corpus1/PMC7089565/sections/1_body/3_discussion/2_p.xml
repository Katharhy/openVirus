<p>Although 5.9% of diagnosed PLWH live in rural areas of the United States, fewer than 4% of RWHAP clients visited rural providers: 2.3% visited only rural providers and 0.8% visited both rural and non-rural providers [
 <xref rid="pone.0230121.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. PLWH living in rural areas who do not access services from rural providers may not be engaged in care, or may access services from non-rural providers. The demographic characteristics of RWHAP clients who visited only rural RWHAP providers were similar to the overall demographic profile of Americans living in rural areas of the United Statesâ€”compared with RWHAP clients who visited only non-rural providers, they were older, less likely to be a member of a racial or ethnic minority, and more likely to be living below the federal poverty level. The identification of these sociodemographic differences may inform initiatives designed for certain key populations, such as initiatives to meet the needs of older PLWH who access care in rural areas.
