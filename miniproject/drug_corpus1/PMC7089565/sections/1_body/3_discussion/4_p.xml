<p>Although RWHAP clients who accessed care in rural areas experienced comparable retention in care and viral suppression to RWHAP clients who accessed care in non-rural areas, this analysis does not address the barriers that rural PLWH may face before they successfully and routinely engage in the healthcare system. Rural PLWH are more likely to delay HIV testing and receive an HIV diagnosis at later disease stages than their non-rural counterparts [

 <xref rid="pone.0230121.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. PLWH who are unaware of their infection account for 38% of all HIV transmissions; those aware of their infection but not in care account for another 42% of all HIV transmissions [

Therefore, while this analysis demonstrated that nearly all PLWH accessing care from rural RWHAP are retained in care and reached viral suppression, lack of access to HIV testing services or linkage to HIV care services for newly diagnosed PLWH in rural areas could contribute to continued HIV transmission within rural areas.
