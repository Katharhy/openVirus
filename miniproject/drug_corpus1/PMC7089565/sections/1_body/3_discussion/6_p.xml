<p>Provider organizations may have multiple locations where they deliver services, some of which may be located in rural areas. However, in this analysis, they would be classified as rural only if their primary address was located in an HRSA-defined rural area. Although the RSR does collect information on where provider organizations deliver services, provider characteristics and patterns of client service use are only collected based on the main provider address. Additionally, organizations not funded by the RWHAP also deliver medical care and support services to PLWH. Therefore, while not captured in this analysis, the RWHAP and broader HIV system of care likely has a larger presence in rural areas than estimated in this analysis.</p>
