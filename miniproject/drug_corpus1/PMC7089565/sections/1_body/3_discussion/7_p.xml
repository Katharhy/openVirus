<p>With the rise of opioid use and associated HIV and HCV outbreaks, identifying the presence of the RWHAPâ€™s comprehensive system of care is crucial to preparing and responding to the intersecting epidemics of opioids and infectious diseases. Within the RWHAP, substance abuse services, case management, and mental health services are especially key to addressing the opioid crisis among PLWH. RWHAP grant recipients select the service categories that they will fund based on local needs and epidemiologic trends, including outbreak response, local infrastructure, and other health care payors. Over one-third of rural RWHAP providers were funded to deliver mental health services, over 10% were funded to deliver substance abuse services, and the majority were funded to deliver case management services. With its presence in rural areas, the RWHAP is well positioned to respond to the needs of these emerging, opioid-impacted communities.</p>
