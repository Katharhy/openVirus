<p>Given that healthcare options for PLWH in rural areas may be limited, the Health Resources and Services Administrationâ€™s (HRSA) Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) may be a key component in addressing the healthcare and support services needs of PLWH in rural communities. The RWHAP provides a comprehensive system of HIV primary medical care, medication, and essential support services to more than half a million low-income PLWH each year [

RWHAP funds are primarily distributed to grant recipients based on the geographic distribution of PLWH; because the majority of PLWH live in non-rural areas, the majority of RWHAP funding is distributed to grant recipients and subrecipients in non-rural areas. However, the RWHAP is still an important source of HIV medical care and support services in rural areas, particularly through funding to states (RWHAP Part B grants) and local community based organizations (Part C grants).
