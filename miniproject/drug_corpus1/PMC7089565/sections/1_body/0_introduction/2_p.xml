<p>Of the approximately one million people living with diagnosed HIV (PLWH) in the United States in 2017, more than 54,500 (5.9%) reside in rural areas, the majority of whom live in the South (65.2%) [

Similar to the demographic profile of all rural residents, PLWH in rural areas are older and more likely to be White that PLWH in non-rural areas. PLWH living in rural areas experience substantial barriers to HIV care, including transportation and long distances to care, provider discrimination and stigma, concerns about confidentiality, lack of health care coverage, and limited healthcare options [

These barriers may contribute to delays in HIV testing among rural PLWH and some evidence suggests that rural PLWH are less likely to be retained in care, adhere to antiretroviral medication, and reach viral suppression than PLWH living in non-rural areas [
