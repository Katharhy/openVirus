<p>HRSA’s Federal Office of Rural Health Policy (FORHP) classifies all non-Metro counties, as defined by the Office of Management and Budget, as rural [
 <xref rid="pone.0230121.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In addition, HRSA FORHP uses Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes to identify other rural areas; any census tract within metropolitan counties having RUCA codes 4–10 and 132 large area census tracts having RUCA codes 2 or 3 are defined as “rural” [
 <xref rid="pone.0230121.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The subset of “rural” areas that comprise 132 large census tracts with RUCA codes 2 or 3 are further defined as “metro-rural.” To identify areas with a combination of low population size and high geographic remoteness, we used the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) frontier and remote (FAR) area codes, which are defined in relation to the time it takes to travel by car to the edges of nearby urban areas [
 <xref rid="pone.0230121.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. While FAR areas do not correlate directly with HRSA-defined rural areas, they can be considered a subset of HRSA-defined rural areas.
