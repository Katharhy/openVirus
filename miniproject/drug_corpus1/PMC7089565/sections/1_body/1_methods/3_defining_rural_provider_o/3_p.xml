<p>This rural definition does not account for provider organizations that may have a service location in other zip codes, some of which may be rural. Therefore, this rural definition likely underestimates the reach of the RWHAP in rural areas. To assess geographic location using zip code information, this analysis used a HRSA FORHP-created crosswalk of zip codes that identifies the set of non-metropolitan counties and rural census tracts that comprise rural areas as defined by HRSA.</p>
