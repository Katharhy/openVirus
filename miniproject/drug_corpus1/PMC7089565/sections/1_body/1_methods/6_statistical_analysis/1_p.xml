<p>For provider-level analyses, we assessed the number and percent of RWHAP who met the HRSA definition of rural, overall and stratified by HHS region [
 <xref rid="pone.0230121.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. To demonstrate the reach of the RWHAP, we conducted a sub-analysis identifying metro-rural providers and providers in frontier and remote areas. This descriptive analysis of the RWHAPâ€™s reach in rural areas was replicated specifically among RWHAP providers funded for outpatient ambulatory health services (i.e. HIV medical care). Additionally, we descriptively compared the characteristics and funded service categories for rural and non-rural providers.
