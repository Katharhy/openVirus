<p>Characteristics and funded service categories were compared between HRSA-designated rural providers and non-rural providers. Provider characteristics were self-reported by the provider organizations and included provider type (e.g., hospital or university-based clinic, publicly funded community health center, health department), ownership type (e.g., public, private), faith-based organization (yes or no), number of full-time staff, and status of Public Health Service Act Section 330 funding, in addition to RWHAP funding. Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act supports the development and operation of community health centers that provide preventive and primary healthcare services, supplemental health and support services, and environmental health services to medically underserved areas and populations. Many Public Health Service Act Section 330 organizations are Health Centers funded by the HRSA Bureau of Primary Health Care; however, Health Center “Look-Alikes” and Rural Health Clinics do not receive Section 330 funding. Based on data submitted to the RSR, we calculated the number of clients served by the provider (categorized for analysis as 1–99, 100–199, 200–299, 300–399, 400–499, and ≥500 clients).</p>
