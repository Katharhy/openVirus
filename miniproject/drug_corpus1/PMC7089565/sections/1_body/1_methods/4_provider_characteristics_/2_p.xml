<p>RWHAP providers can be funded to provide any of the 13 core medical services (e.g., outpatient ambulatory health services, medical case management, oral health care, substance abuse, outpatient care) or 17 support services (e.g., medical transportation, residential substance abuse services, short-term housing) as described in the RWHAP statute [
 <xref rid="pone.0230121.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. At least 75% of all program funds must be spent on any of the 13 core medical services, while up to the remaining 25% of program funds can be used for any of the 17 support service categories; RWHAP recipients can apply for a waiver to this requirement. Core medical services are consistent with clinical and professional standards, including the Health and Human Servicesâ€™ Clinical Guidelines for the Treatment of HIV. Support services are intended to support and improve the medical outcomes of PLWH. Services delivered by RWHAP recipients and subrecipients are grounded in evidence-based interventions, evidence-informed interventions, or emerging strategies. For this analysis, we examined the number of service categories for which providers were funded, whether they were funded for core medical services, support services, or both core medical and support services, and the specific service categories for which they were funded.
