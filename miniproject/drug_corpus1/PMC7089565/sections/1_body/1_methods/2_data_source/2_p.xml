<p>The RWHAP defines “provider” as an organization that is funded to deliver services under specific, statutorily-defined service categories. Therefore, a provider is not a specific individual who delivers services, but, rather, the broader organization funded by the RWHAP to deliver services. This analysis includes all RWHAP provider organizations, regardless of the service categories for which they are funded (i.e., this analysis includes organizations funded to deliver core medical services and support services).</p>
