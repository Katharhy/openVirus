<p>Data for this analysis were abstracted from the 2017 RWHAP Services Report (RSR). The RSR data set is HRSA HABâ€™s primary source of annual, client-level RWHAP data used to assess the numbers and demographics of clients receiving services, as well as their HIV-related outcomes. Each year, RWHAP Parts A-D grant recipients and subrecipients receive funds to provide core medical or support services and are required to submit data to HRSA; RWHAP Part F data are collected through other mechanisms and are not included within this analysis.
