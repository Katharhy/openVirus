<p>This analysis used two sections of the RSR: the provider report, and the client-level data report for all funded providers and clients served by the RWHAP Parts A, B, C, and D during the 2017 calendar year. The provider report includes basic information about RWHAP providers and the services delivered by the provider under RWHAP contracts. The client-level data report includes information on client demographics, service utilization, and HIV-related clinical outcomes. Data collection through RSR and other RWHAP data sources is a routine program activity and the data are used for program monitoring, improvement, evaluation, and policy purposes only. Therefore it is not human subject research and does not require IRB review and approval.</p>
