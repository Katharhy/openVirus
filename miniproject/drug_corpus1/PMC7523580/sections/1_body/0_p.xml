 </sup> Most countries are focusing on testing persons with symptoms to identify patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Ideally, this should be coupled with random/representative population testing to follow the epidemic in the population.

 </sup> However, there is much that can be learnt about the causes of COVID-19, even if only symptomatic people are tested. Still more may be learnt by conducting formal test-negative design studies, with additional population controls, thus yielding three linked caseâ€“control studies. In this article, we describe how these combined study designs can enhance understanding of risk factors for symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in the COVID-19 pandemic.
