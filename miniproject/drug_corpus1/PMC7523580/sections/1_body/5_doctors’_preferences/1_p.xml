<p>Even in settings with relatively standardized care, there might be variation in testing strategies for a new disease like COVID-19 between (primary care) practices. The existence of physician preference has been studied in different countries.

 </sup> Physician’s preference can be based on a different interpretation of the literature on topics where there is not yet consensus, or on implicit biases (regarding age, sex, and ethnicity). If this is suspected to have been the case, it might be better to select population controls from the GP practices of the individuals who underwent testing—and to approach this in the analysis as a form of matching. Matching by GP practice would, however, limit the ability to compare between catchment areas and lead to loss of information about regional differences. Once again, restricting the analysis to patients with severe disease (whether test-positive or test-negative) may suffer less from self-selection and testing preference by doctors. An analysis according to severity can also be added as a sensitivity analysis.
