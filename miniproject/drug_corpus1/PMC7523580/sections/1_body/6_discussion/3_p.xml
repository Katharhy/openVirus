 </sup> for inferences about local as well as general factors that drive the pandemic. Follow-up of test-positives or test-negatives and other additional strategies will lead to better understanding of the course of the disease. In particular, follow-up starting from a test-negative design of acute disease may be a good starting point to provide information on the degree and duration of protection from (re)infection conferred by having had a SARS-CoV-2 infection previously and/or specific antibody titers, because such studies might need exact matching on date and place of testing.

 </sup> Finally, having an infrastructure for a test-negative design already established in different settings may be a valuable base to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions such vaccines when they become available, or other measures to limit transmission.
