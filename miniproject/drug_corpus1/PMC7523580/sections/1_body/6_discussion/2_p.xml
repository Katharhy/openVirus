<p>The situation with COVID-19 remains urgent in many parts of the world, and it is important that the best possible use is made of information collected in the process of widespread testing of symptomatic persons. Therefore, there are research and public health benefits in employing a test-negative case–control design, combined with case–control studies with population controls added to it. Still, such collection of information has to be as unburdensome as possible, in order not to disturb the primary medical aim: to test people for their own benefit and for controlling the epidemic. The proposed data collection can be done with a minimal extra effort, it would roll along with the epidemic, and it can potentially yield important information at much less cost, and with greater ease, than doing genuinely random population repeated sampling and testing. In situations where extensive databases exist, data will have been collected as the epidemic unfolded, and then kept frozen in time in the databases. This allows investigators to return to the data and evaluate the course of the epidemic with new hypotheses. At the time of this writing, several efforts are underway to set up collections of types of questions and data of interest to study the COVID-19 pandemic.
