<p>Test-negative caseâ€“control designs (TNDs) involve comparing the odds of a given intervention (e.g., vaccine receipt) or a given risk factor (e.g., oral contraceptives) among symptomatic persons who test positive compared to those who test negative. Given assumptions described in the literature,
