<p>Test-negative designs allow us to obtain quick answers to important questions. Additionally, by design, they protect against some forms of bias which are otherwise difficult to control. People who are tested for a disease will not be a representative of all those who have the disease (unless everyone in the population is tested)—usually, they are more likely to have severe symptoms, and more likely to seek medical help. This help-seeking behavior is affected by many factors such as age, gender, socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, proximity to testing facilities, severity of symptoms, personality, and insurance coverage. In a test-negative design, the same selective forces that lead individuals to be tested will operate on both those who test positive and those who test negative. There is a substantial literature on this study design,

 </sup> and it is generally agreed that it can produce valid effect estimates under the assumption of similar selection pressures for the test-positives and the test-negatives.
