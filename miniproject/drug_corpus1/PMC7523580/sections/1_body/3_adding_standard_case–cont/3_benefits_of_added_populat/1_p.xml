<p>The importance of having population controls can be seen from Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, which, respectively, refer to the situation with accompanying persons as controls, and to the more general situation of population controls. A comparison of the findings from the TND with a case–control comparison of the test-positives and their population controls (CC-POS comparison), and a separate comparison of test-negatives with the population (CC-NEG comparison), will enable us to assess which risk factors are specific to COVID-19 and which are risk factors for all respiratory infections (including SARS-CoV-2) in general. If these studies were all perfect, one would be able to calculate the results of any one contrast from the two others, for example, the results of comparison CC-POS should logically follow from combining the results of the TND comparison and comparison CC-NEG (if the odds ratio for male sex is 1.0 in the TND, but is 2.0 in comparison CC-NEG, then it also should be 2.0 in comparison CC-POS). In reality, there might be differences due to sampling and/or unknown selection biases. Thus, although it would be sufficient in theory to only conduct the TND and comparison CC-POS, it remains valuable to conduct also comparison CC-NEG. This enables “triangulation”
