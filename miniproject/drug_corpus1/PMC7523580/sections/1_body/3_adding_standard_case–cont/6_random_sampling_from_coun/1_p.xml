<p>In regions or countries where all healthcare activities are registered (prescriptions, hospitalizations, test results, etc.) in digital databases, it may be possible to use a different type of control group, constituting a control population randomly sampled from the region or country as a whole. While analyses based on existing databases may lack the immediacy and flexibility of point-of-care data collection of persons who are tested, the advantage is that data are recorded 
 <italic>prospectively in past time</italic>, and the epidemic can be analyzed, and reanalyzed, in its several stages (e.g., in relation to the implementation of social distancing and lockdowns).
