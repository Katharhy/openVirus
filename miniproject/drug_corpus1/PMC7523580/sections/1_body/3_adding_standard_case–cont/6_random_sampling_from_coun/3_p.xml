<p>A single control group can be used for both CC-POS and CC-NEG (see Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This allows one to randomly sample several times as many controls as there are test-positives and test-negatives combined. For efficiency purposes, the cases and controls, as well as the random population control might be limited to an age bracket, say age 15â€“74, as there will be few symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 cases below age 15, and persons above age 75 may not be tested nor hospitalized. Age and sex matching are undesirable in the context of COVID-19 as these may be determinants of infection and disease course. It is always possible to stratify on age and sex, as the numbers will be sufficiently large. Matching on being alive at the index date of the cases (i.e., the date of testing) might be considered; however, this might be replaced by a control group that is composed of persons being alive in the middle of the month in which persons were tested.
