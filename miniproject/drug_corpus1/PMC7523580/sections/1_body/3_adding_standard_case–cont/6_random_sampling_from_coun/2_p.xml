<p>The analysis of the COVID-19 epidemic would start with recorded data of test-positives and test-negatives for SARS-CoV-2 in the total administrative population of a country or region. While this limits information to healthcare data that are registered at a particular point in time, an advantage is that healthcare data that have been registered before (e.g., pre-existing diseases and prescriptions, prior hospitalizations etc.), can be added, as well as other data such as data on crowding, income, level of education, etc., from other databases.</p>
