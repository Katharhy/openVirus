<p>It might be objected that we use two different control groups for one case group, which is often frowned upon, because if the findings with the different control groups are different, the investigator has to make a judgment call about the most appropriate control group (see pp. 121–122 in Ref 
 <sup>

 </sup>) However, in interpreting, the combination of the TND with population control groups neither is really the correct one, as both point to a different contrast. This can be learned from a test-negative case–control study on urinary tract infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in contrast to infections with sensitive bacteria, with added population controls to both groups.

 </sup> In this study, male gender proved a strong risk factor for antibiotic resistance in the test-negative design, while female gender was a strong risk factor for urinary tract infections in comparisons with the population. This seems like a reversing of usual risk factors, but is logical because men generally only acquire urinary tract infections at older ages, subsequent to prostate or other pathology which also puts them at risk of acquiring resistant bacteria.
