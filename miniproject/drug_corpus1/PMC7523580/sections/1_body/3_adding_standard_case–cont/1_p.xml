<p>As noted, a TND can potentially identify risk factors for COVID-19 that differ from those for other respiratory infections, either in kind or in magnitude, but will not identify risk factors that the test-positives and test-negatives have in common. On the other hand, comparing test-positives with general population controls will tell us about risk factors for COVID-19, but does not tell us which factor is specific for SARS-CoV-2 infections rather than respiratory infections in general. Thus, the ideal situation is to also have a comparison of the test-negatives with the general population. This strategy has already been applied as an extension of TNDs of antibiotic resistance.
