<p>A second issue is that the accompanying persons of the test-positives in the CC-POS comparison may be as yet asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2. A common reflex might be to want to know this and to remove these persons from the analysis. However, apart from involving logistically difficult additional testing of the accompanying persons, it is not necessary. This is explained in detail in eAppendix C;

 </sup> Because the accompanying persons came with their index person for testing, it is reasonable to assume that they would also have come for testing at the same facility if they had developed symptoms.
