<p>The use of friend controls leaves the choice of the control to the case and not to the investigator (see pp. 119–120 in Ref

 </sup>). Friend controls may be quite similar to the cases, which is an intended benefit of matching. However, they may have some possible inherent biases (pp. 119–120 in Ref 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
 </sup>), for example, popular persons and extroverts are more often mentioned as friends. We should stress that the problem is not that the cases and controls are made similar—this problem applies to all matched case–control studies and is addressed by taking the matching into account in the analyses.

 </sup> Rather, the problem is that they may be made similar in ways that the investigator cannot control, and certain types of persons might be more valued to be named as friends.
