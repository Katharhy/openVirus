<p>This strategy leads to the caseâ€“control comparisons represented in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>: test-positives with their accompanying persons (CC-POS comparison), and test-negatives with their accompanying persons (CC-NEG comparison). Comparison CC-POS enables us to study directly the differences in risk factors between a person with COVID-19 and a control person without respiratory symptoms. Thus, in this analysis, all risk factors that increase the risk of COVID-19 (some of which will also be risk factors for other respiratory diseases) will be seen to differ between cases and controls. Comparison CC-NEG enables us to directly assess risk factors for the mixture of other respiratory pathogens (e.g., influenza virus and rhinovirus) that could be causing symptoms similar to those of COVID-19.
