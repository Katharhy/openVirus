<p>Symptomatic persons who go for SARS-CoV-2 testing may be accompanied by other persons, for example, household members, relatives, or friends. Thus, it may be expedient to ask an accompanying person to volunteer the same information (e.g., completing a questionnaire) at the time of testing the person with symptomsâ€”this may be done before the test result is known. These persons are members of the source population which generated the cases and should not have COVID-19 symptoms. Note that for this design, it is not necessary to carry out the test on the accompanying person.</p>
