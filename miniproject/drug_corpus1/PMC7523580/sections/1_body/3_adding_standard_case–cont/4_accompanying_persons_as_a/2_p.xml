<p>For both the test-positives (COVID-19 cases) and the test-negatives (controls with other respiratory infections), the accompanying person can be seen as a matched population control. Such approaches have been widely used in epidemiology, and the strengths and weaknesses have been extensively discussed.

 </sup> Briefly, using friends, siblings, or spouses as matched population controls has the advantage of logistic convenience, and may indirectly match for various risk factors (e.g., socioeconomic status, availability of healthcare, health seeking behavior). As with any other pair-matched case–control study, this necessitates a pair-matched analysis. Essentially, the matched analysis focuses on the subgroup of case–control pairs where the case and control differ with respect to the exposure under study: a pair-matched analysis is an analysis of the differences that remain between cases and their controls despite them being made in effect more equal by the matching.
