  <p>– If patients are presenting in a special setup organized by groups of general practitioners (GPs) (e.g., coronavirus testing sites managed by several GP practices where patients are referred for testing), control persons may be a sample from these general practices; this sample could be matched to the practice of the referring GPs, or weighted according to the size of the referring GP practices. This might facilitate the collection of specific new information relevant to local situations in individual practices (e.g., the use of local sports facilities).</p>

  <p>– If patients present to outpatient clinics or hospital departments, a control group of non-respiratory out- or inpatients might be constructed to represent the catchment population of the hospital; such patient controls used to be common in pharmacoepidemiology.
