<p>Problems only arise if there are other factors which affect presentation for testing, given a particular level of symptoms. For example, consider private healthcare facilities that are only accessible to individuals who can afford them (these facilities exist in many guises, from standard private health care coming as an employee benefit to facilities only available to the very rich). A comparison of the test-positives and test-negatives from such facilities with a general population control group may not be warranted, because of inherent differences in socioeconomic status, medical care, and lifestyle. Among persons tested in private facilities, both test-positives and test-negatives are, for example, unlikely to live in very overcrowded conditions. Thus, a better control group, representing their own source population, might consist of other persons (or patients) who make use of the same healthcare facilities. This means that one may not be able to study all of the causes of the disease (e.g., if poverty is an underlying cause, but no one who accesses these healthcare facilities is low income). Also, if we suspect that there are differences in access to testing for persons with very mild symptoms or without symptoms (depending on type or health insurance or wealth), but few such differences for severe disease, then one might restrict the analysis to the subgroup of tested individuals with more severe symptomatic disease.</p>
