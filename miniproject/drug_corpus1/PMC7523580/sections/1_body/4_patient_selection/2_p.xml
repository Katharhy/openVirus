<p>The type of person that is tested may differ between countries, however. During the initial wave of COVID-19 in Februaryâ€“March in Europe, testing for persons with minor symptoms was available in Germany; in The Netherlands, only persons with symptoms that were sufficiently severe to require hospitalization were tested. Because these were country-wide measures, in both countries, the general population may be seen as the source population. In this context, it should be noted that if (self) selection is based only on severity of disease, this will not create a bias in itself within one country.</p>
