<p>Not all diseases present equally to healthcare facilities. In countries with universal access to healthcare and relatively standardized care, it is likely that, for example, almost all solid cancers (colon, lung, etc.) with onset before age 70 will ultimately be diagnosed and recorded. That is not the case for self-limiting diseases such as influenza-like illnesses or headache, with which many persons will just stay home. Only persons who worry or have more severe symptoms will present themselves to a primary care service. Still, in a country with universal access to relatively standardized care, the types of person who present themselves at several points of care will be roughly similar, and if testing is done for SARS-CoV-2, test-positives and test-negatives can be seen as drawn from the same underlying general population.</p>
