<p>Direct comparisons of test-positives to test-negatives (comparison of TND in Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) can yield insight into specific risk factors for becoming infected and symptomatic with SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., having COVID-19); these may include age, sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic factors (e.g., income, education), occupational exposures (e.g.. healthcare workers performing aerosol-generating procedures, delivery drivers, teachers), contact patterns (e.g.. household exposure to confirmed case, crowding, travel histories, childcare responsibilities), geographic residence (e.g.. urban vs. rural), behavioral factors (e.g., shopping locations and smoking), medical risk factors (e.g., immunodeficiency), and genetic factors (from the swabs or blood sample taken for viral diagnosis, which will also contain human cells).
