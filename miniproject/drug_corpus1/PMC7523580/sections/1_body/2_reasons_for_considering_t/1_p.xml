<p>Insights into risk factors for COVID-19 can be gained by collecting the same information on symptomatic individuals who test positive and those who test negative, that is, by performing a test-negative caseâ€“control study. Because the test-negatives belong to the same population (i.e., people who would come for testing if they had symptoms of COVID-19) as the test-positives, this may give timely and locally relevant insight into the causes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in different communities (urban and rural), in communities with many cases, or communities with few cases.</p>
