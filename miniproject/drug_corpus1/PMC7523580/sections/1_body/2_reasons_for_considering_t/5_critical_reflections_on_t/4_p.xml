<p>In the earliest phases of the COVID-19 epidemic, testing for acute infection may not have been done. The above-mentioned variant of a TND on seroprevalence of antibodies may be a solution. For example, in a hospital-based setting, serologic testing of healthcare workers for antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 may yield insights into exposure risks that could have been missed due to the initial lack of testing for acute infection. Of course, this will miss persons who did not survive.</p>
