<p>The TND involves a comparison between persons who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 and persons who test negative but who have similar signs and symptoms. The test-negatives will have another reason for their similar signs and symptoms; most likely they will have another viral respiratory infection. Some exposures (e.g., overcrowding) will increase the risks of both COVID-19 and other respiratory infections. Thus, the TND can only identify those risk factors that are either totally distinct or clearly different in magnitude from the risk factors of illnesses that manifest with similar symptoms. For example, if living in crowded conditions equally increases the risks of both COVID-19 and other respiratory infections, then the proportions living in crowded conditions would be similar in the test-positives and the test-negatives. On the other hand, if male sex was a risk factor for COVID-19, but not for other respiratory infections, then more of the test-positives than the test-negatives would be male.</p>
