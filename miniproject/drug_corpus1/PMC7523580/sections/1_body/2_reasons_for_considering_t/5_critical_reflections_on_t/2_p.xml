<p>A second concern is about the sensitivity and specificity of the test. Although reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing has a high specificity for SARS-CoV-2, the sensitivity can vary in relation to timing of symptom onset,

 </sup> There will be misclassification of cases and controls. This can be expected to be “nondifferential” (whether the test works correctly on a particular person is unrelated to exposures such as crowding). Such nondifferential misclassification of exposure or disease is a known problem in case–control studies, and it usually results in bias of the effect estimate towards the null (an underestimation of effects). However, there is a major difference between the usual case–control study and the TND. In the standard population-based case–control study, the false-negatives remain part of the source population, and only a (small) fraction of them will be sampled and end up in the control group. In contrast, in the TND, it is certain that at a particular test site, all false-negatives will be included in the control group (the test negatives); similarly, all false-positives will be included in the case group—since all persons tested at the test site will be in the study. This may lead to stronger misclassification which has most consequences in situations wherein the proportion of COVID-19 relative to other respiratory disease among the persons tested is either very high or very low. There is an extensive literature on sensitivity analysis for standard case–control studies,

 </sup> which essentially involves making assumptions about how large this misclassification would be, and these methods can be adapted to the TND situation. See eAppendix B;
