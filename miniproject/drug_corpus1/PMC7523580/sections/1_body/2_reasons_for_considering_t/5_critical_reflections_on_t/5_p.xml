<p>As the epidemic progresses, risk factors for having had the infection might become negative risk factors for new infections. For example, bus drivers may have been frequently infected early on; if these infections conferred sufficiently strong immunity, bus drivers may turn up later in the epidemic mainly as seemingly test-negatives for acute SARS-CoV-2 infection when having signs and symptoms of respiratory disease (from another virus). In addition, measures might have been taken to shield bus drivers (passengers only entering via rear doors; obligatory unoccupied seats). While this muddles the estimates of risk factors, the immunity conferred by earlier infection as well as the preventive measures taken earlier are worthwhile goals of a TND study. This paradox ideally requires investigating the evolution of the magnitude of the risk factor associations over the course of the epidemic, with additional background knowledge beyond the data; as a minimum we need to look separately at the upward and downward phases of the epidemic curve. To verify a potential role of immunity in an epidemic, subsamples of test-positives and test-negatives for acute infection might be tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.</p>
