<p id="Par23">Host-based antiviral therapies include enhancement of interferon responses, targeting host factors, and host signaling pathways facilitating virus replication. These approaches are significant to reduce inflammation severity and also keep immune reactions balanced to act against pathogens effectively. Both adaptive or innate immune responses can be targeted by these approaches [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. After the complete structural and molecular composition is fully explored, several pre-existing or newly identified immune-modulatory agents with the combination of an effective antiviral may be a potential therapeutic option against COVID-19. Here we have summarized some of the important compounds related to host immune-based antiviral therapy which could be indicated helpful if used with or without modification against COVID-19 after investigation. Mesalazine and celecoxib are COX inhibitors having wide-ranging clinical applications for having analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic characteristics, but many studies have found the application of these inhibitors (celecoxib, and mesalazine) in combination with zalamivir are more effective in reducing cytokines/chemokines levels and mortality in mice but due limited existing knowledge in present, these are not recommended in severe respiratory viral infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. On the hand Corticosteroids are steroid hormones bind with cytoplasmic corticosteroid receptor which is involved in regulating anti-inflammatory genes transcription mechanism, therefore, could be used in anti-inflammatory treatment as experienced in H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009 resulting in treatment of 40% infected individuals having acute respiratory distress syndrome in France while 62.2% H7N9 avian influenza-infected patients were treated with corticosteroid in china during 2013 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. In case of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 infections, cytokines are highly induced causing lung injury due to inflammation, in such patients corticosteroids were used frequently for viral clearance but have found to be not significantly effective in controlling mortality, therefore, more investigation is needed to confirm the harm or benefit of systematic corticosteroid based COVID-19 treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) also have a role in viral replication and inflammatory responses thus antioxidants having anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities could be also tested to treat cytokine storm. Antioxidants monotherapy has limited effects on cytokine storm so the combination with antiviral is still needed to be studied [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. Increased oxidative stress because of rapid free radicals release, use of antioxidants like vitamin C can play a role in COVID-19 management [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. A high level of Angiotensin II in SARS-CoV-2 patients is related with lung injury and viral pathogenesis, so several angiotensin receptor blockers could have potential again SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>] Statin is an angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) is proposed to be an immune modulator agent for reducing inflammatory responses and is also an inhibitor for 3 hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, exerting immune effector cells by ROS inhibition, and can inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in some viruses. Statin in combination with caffeine is more effective in viral replication inhibition and alleviation of lung injury and has a similar activity like ribavirin and oseltamivir [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. Since we have no report found that shows the role of OX40 (CD134) against SARS-CoV-2. OX40 (CD134) can play a major role in T-cell-mediated immunotherapy against viral infection in the lungs through up-regulating anti-apoptotic gene expression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. Along with anti-pathogenic actions some antiviral and antibiotics also possess immune-modulatory properties and anti-inflammatory activities e.g. Macrolides reduced viral replication and reduced inflammatory cell number [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Arbidol is also an antiviral agent which might also be effective in the treatment of severe viral infection and reducing inflammation by modulating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and is approved in Russia and China for their inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. Interestingly in TCM, plant extracts from Jiawei-Yupingfeng-Tang can also have a big contribution against viral infection by modulating immune effects and can alleviate viral-induced lung lesions with both antiviral and immune-modulatory activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> injection (PA-MSHA) is a kind of biological agents for immunotherapy, which exhibits a broad immune-modulatory effect and is used for adjuvant treatment of malignant tumors in clinical. Studies have demonstrated that PA-MSHA promotes DCs maturation and enhances T-cell activation. PA-MSHA, also as an adjuvant, activates natural immunity by the Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway and improves HIV-1 DNA vaccine immune response [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. SARS-COV-2 infection in severe and critical stage can cause viral sepsis. In addition, PA-MSHA effectively inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory factors, reduces inflammatory response and tissue injury, and lowers the rate of infection complications in sepsis. PA-MSHA also can reverse the drug resistance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. Therefore, PA-MSHA may play a role in regulating immune response and inflammation in COVID-19.
