<p id="Par12">Emerging and a sudden pathogen outbreak has always been a challenge in public health and the economic sectors worldwide. Coronaviruses belong to 
 <italic>coronoviridae</italic> family and order nidovirales, which has none segmented positive-sense RNA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and are widely found in birds, humans, and other mammals. Six species are most common in human, in which NL63, HKU1, OC43, and 229E causes common cold symptoms while two other strain including Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) reported in the Middle East in 2012 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) observed in 2003 in Guangdong Province, China, are zoonotic and are highly pathogenic resulting in fatal diseases in humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In December 2019, China faced another destructing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak leading to major health issues. The first cases with unknown etiology were reported at the end of December 2019 from Wuhan Hubei, China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The causative agent was announced by Chinese authority in the first week of January 2020 as a novel coronavirus 2019. A first viral genome sequence was issued on 10 January 2020 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], followed by submission of the other four genomic sequences confirmed the indicating association of the virus with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In the light of available evidence, SARS-CoV-2 is considered to be transmitted from wild animals with the most possible from bats directly or maybe via other intermediate animals, confirmation of clear source (s) will help to identify the pattern of transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. 
 <italic>Rhinolophus</italic> bat is mostly suspected which is found in south china and also in other Asian countries in abundance. This evidence is supported by studies found 500 CoVs identification in bats in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Bats are exceptional food available in a few Chinese restaurants and local markets. After the primary transmission, the rapid rate of infection spread due to direct transmission from humans to humans in families, health care centers and public contact areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Signs and symptoms of COVID-19 patients include dry cough, fatigue, fever, dyspnea runny nose, and in some cases nasal congestion but fever is still considered to be a typical symptom [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In such sudden outbreaks, diagnostic challenges always remain a problem before proceeding to treatment. Initially, biochemical tests from respiratory biological samples (bronchial aspirates, sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, nasal and pharyngeal swabs) are helpful to differentiate and specifically identify particular viruses including influenza, parainfluenza virus, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, adenovirus, avian influenza [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Molecular techniques in comparison with Biochemical tests are found the most accurate and successful ways in pathogen identification. To confirm SARS-CoV-2 through real-time RT-PCR is importantly recommend and used. Several other advanced technologies like metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is also implemented to rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These approaches not only help medical experts to study the entire infectome i.e. Bacteria, RNA virus, or DNA virus within the infected organism but are also important routes toward disease prevention and treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. At the time of writing this review article, no effective vaccine or drugs are available for the treatment of COVID-19, worldwide scientific communities are working die-hard to contribute in outbreak control, some of them under trail dugs and immune modulators are previously published shown in TableÂ
