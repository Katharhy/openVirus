<p id="Par17">The increased release of many cytokines is directly involved in the initiation and progress of inflammation caused by exogenous pathogens, including IFN-γ, IL-6, and TNF-α, etc. The excessive secretion and release of cytokines in a hyper-inflammatory state may result in a dangerous condition known as “cytokine storm”, that is associated with disease severity [

Clinical studies show that the levels of IL-2, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IP-10, MCP-1and other pro-inflammatory cytokines are significantly increased in severe or critical patients with COVID-19, while SARS-CoV-2 infection also increases secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL4 and IL10) [

Therefore, some therapeutic interventions against these pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines may contribute to alleviating adverse inflammatory reactions. Concerning COVID-19 an “inappropriate and weak immune response” appears more frequently in patients with comorbidities. Thus, this could favor virus replication and enhance complications related to severe cases of the disease [

In patients having COVID-19, the levels of chemokines and cytokines are noted abnormal which includes vascular epithelial growth factor (VEGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), TNF-α, MIP 1-α, MCP-1, IP-10, IFN-γ, GM-CSF, G-CSF, M-CSF, IL-17, IL-13, IL-12, IL-10, IL-7, IL-6, IL-1, IL-2 and IL-4 [
