<p>Adaptive clinical trials design may be apt for the conduct of therapeutic clinical trials in SSA as this would facilitate access to experimental therapeutics, prompt decision making about effective therapies, and also allow for early enrolment of children and young adolescents into clinical trials thereby identifying appropriate drug doses early enough for their effective use of COVID‐19 therapies.

 </fn> In COVID‐19 pandemic, compassionate access to pharmaceutical interventions for COVID‐19 is also being discussed, although consensus for the adoption of compassionate treatments with experimental drugs such as remdesivir; lopinavir/ritonavir; lopinavir/ritonavir with interferon beta‐1a was reached early and more readily.
