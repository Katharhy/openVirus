 </fn> COVID‐19‐related clinical trials to be conducted in SSA should consider the social context of communities in determining appropriate study design. Like in the recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vaccine trial, the ring vaccination design found appropriate for the West Africa context may be a priority design for COVID‐19 vaccine trials in SSA. ‘Ring vaccination’ is an infection control approach wherein a cluster of individuals at high risk for infection are vaccinated on the basis of their social or geographic connection to a known case including families, neighbours and friends. This creates a protective “ring” or cluster of immune individuals around newly diagnosed cases, thereby preventing further spread of infection.

 </fn> The recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vaccine trial was found morally appropriate for West Africa because the cluster‐based randomization reduced unequal treatment of individuals in communities, avoiding placebos and blinding, and keeping the delayed vaccination to the minimum period required to measure an effect.
