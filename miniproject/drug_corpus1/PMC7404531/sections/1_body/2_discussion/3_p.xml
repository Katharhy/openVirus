The dearth of COVID‐19 related clinical trials on the continent and the poor preparedness for storage of biological specimens and data is problematic for generating regional specific evidence‐informed responses for COVID‐19 now and in the future with implications for its positive contribution to global health security. The COVID‐19 related experiences in China, the United States of America, Italy and Spain indicate that a lot more than an efficient health system delivering quality care is needed to control the pandemic.
