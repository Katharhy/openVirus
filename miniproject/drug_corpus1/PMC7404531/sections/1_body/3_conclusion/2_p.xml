<p>The COVID‐19 pandemic and EVD epidemics in sub‐Sahara Africa have commonalities. Within the four years interval between the West Africa EVD epidemic and the COVID‐19 pandemic, the region has improved its ability to handle emergencies, even though this improvement may seem marginal. Key lessons from the EVD epidemics must be translated to actions that enable countries respond promptly and adequately to the COVID‐19 pandemic. The continent needs to strengthen its coordination of responses to an epidemic, while it supports systems for handling research protocols, data sharing and sample transfer. Community systems need to be strengthened to support prompt organization and efficient responses during epidemics, not only for health education and promotion but in anticipation of care facilities being overwhelmed and unable to serve patients in need.</p>
