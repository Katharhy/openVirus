 <xref rid="B26-biomolecules-10-01148" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] was employed to perform molecular docking. AutoDock Vina incorporates limited flexibility in the receptor, and it combines an empirical free-energy force field with a Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm, providing fast prediction of bound conformations with predicted free energies of association. The volume was set as 40 × 40 × 40 Å. The region of interest used for AutoDock Vina docking was fixed as X = 0.041, Y = 0.010 and Z = 3.855 for HIV-1 Gag and X = −27.585, Y = 2.501 and Z = 28.139 for SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup>, X = 114,416, Y = 122.286 and Z = 139.457 for SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, X = −0.496, Y = 0.00 and Z = 0.00 for SARS-CoV-2 E protein and X = 177,973, Y = 198.333, Z = 227.722 Å for SARS-CoV-2 S protein, X = 42.156, Y = −15.872 and Z = 28.523 for pyruvate kinase, X = 69.590, Y = 67.860 and Z = 68.790 for aconitase, X = 46.737, Y = 23.218 and Z = 5.557 for cytochrome c, X = −29.871, Y = −33.177, Z = 51.502 for carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1, X = −2.844, Y = −22.675 and Z = −43.271 for hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and X = −17.201, Y = 20.346, Z = 22.393 Å for glutamate dehydrogenase. After calculations, only the 9 highest-scored poses were returned as a docking result for ligand–cavity configuration. All the obtained results were ranked according to their score values and presented in kcal/mol. Molecular docking details were visualized using the BIOVIA Discovery Studio virtual environment [
