<p>The 3D structures of studied compounds were generated in their low-energy conformation using the Gaussian 16 (revision A.03) computer code [
 <xref rid="B23-biomolecules-10-01148" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] with the density functional theory (DFT, B3LYP) and 63–11 + G(d,p) basis sets. Target macromolecules for molecular docking studies were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (
 <uri xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.rcsb.org/</uri>; Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics, USA). We used crystal structure of the CA-CTD-SP1 fragment of HIV-1 Gag, SARS-CoV-2 main protein, SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain (PDB IDs: 5I4T, 5R7Z, 6M71, and 6VYB respectively). Incomplete or missing side chains of CA-CTD-SP1 protein were restored with the SWISS-MODEL Workspace (

 <xref rid="B24-biomolecules-10-01148" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Geometry optimization of the model was achieved by the optimization protocol in YASARA Energy Minimization Server (

 <sup>pro</sup>) structure was obtained from PDB (PDB ID: 5R7Z). The native ligand for 5R7Z is

  <italic>H</italic>-indol-3-yl)ethyl]ethanamide (PDB ID: HWH)
 </bold>. The region of interest used for Vina docking was defined as all M
 <sup>pro</sup> residues within 40 × 40 × 40 Å of the reference ligand. The homology model of the SARS-CoV-2 E protein catalytic domain was also generated in the SWISS-MODEL workspace [
 <xref rid="B24-biomolecules-10-01148" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Based on maximum sequence identity (95%), structure with PDB ID 5X29 is detected as the best homologous structure of human SARS-CoV-2 E protein. Geometry optimization of model was done by the optimization protocol in YASARA. For toxic/side effect study we used crystal structure of the pyruvate kinase (PDB ID: 6NU1), aconitase (PDB ID: 1C96), cytochrome c (PDB ID: 1HRC), carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (PDB ID: 5DOU), hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (PDB ID: 6AR9), glutamate dehydrogenase (PDB ID: 1BVG).
