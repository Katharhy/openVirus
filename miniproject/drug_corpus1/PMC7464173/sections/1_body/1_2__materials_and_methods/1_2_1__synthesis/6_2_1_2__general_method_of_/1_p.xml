The reaction vessel was placed in a microwave reactor and the reaction was carried out for 1.5 h at a temperature of 130 °C at a maximum wave power (300 W). After cooling, the mixture was diluted with 25 mL of ethyl acetate, and then washed with a 20% hydrochloric acid solution and with water. The organic layer was dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate (VI) and concentrated until dry in a vacuum evaporator. The crude product was purified by column chromatography (SiO
