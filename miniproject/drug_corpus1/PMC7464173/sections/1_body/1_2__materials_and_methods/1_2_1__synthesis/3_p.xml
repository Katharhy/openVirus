<p>Melting points of obtained compounds were measured in open capillary tubes on an Electrothermal melting point apparatus without correction. 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR (600 MHz), 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR (150 MHz) and 
 <sup>31</sup>P NMR (243 MHz) spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE III HD 600 spectrometer (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA) in deuterated CDCl
 <sub>3</sub>, using the residual solvent signal as an internal standard. Chemical shifts values were reported in parts per million (ppm). Multiplicity was designated as singlet (s), doublet (d), doublet of doublets (dd) and multiplet (m). Infrared spectra (pellets, KBr, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were obtained using an IRAffnity-1 FTIR spectrometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The measurement was recorded in the range of 4000–1000 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> at 295K. High-resolution mass spectra have been measured with Bruker Impact II (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA). Calculation of the theoretical molecular mass for compounds was performed using “The Exact Mass Calculator, Single Isotope Version” (
