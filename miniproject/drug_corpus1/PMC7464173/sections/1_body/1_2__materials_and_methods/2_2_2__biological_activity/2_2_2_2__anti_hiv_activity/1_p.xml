<p>CEM-T4 cells were preincubated (culture plates with 96 flat bottom wells) for 24 h under standard conditions (37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>) and in a standard medium (RPMI, FCS 10%) enriched with tested compounds in the concentration range from 0.02 to 10 μM. In each well, 20,000 cells were suspended in the solution of a tested compound (200 μL). For each concentration, cultures were run in triplicate. A wild-type HIV-1 was isolated from the HIV-positive patient in the Laboratory of Virology of the National Medicines Institute (Warsaw, Poland) and was used as a reference. A culture of CEM-T4 lines in a standard neat medium (RPMU, FCS 10%) was used to produce viruses. After 24 h of incubation in a medium enriched with a tested compound, cells were inoculated with a known amount of HIV, and after 7 days, HIV replication was evaluated through the measurement of secreted viral protein p24 carried out with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique [
