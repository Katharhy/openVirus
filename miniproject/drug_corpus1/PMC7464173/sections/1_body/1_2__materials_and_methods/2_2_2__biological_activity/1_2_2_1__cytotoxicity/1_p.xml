<p>For the determination of compounds’ cytotoxicity, CEM-T4 cells were obtained from the NIH AIDS Reagent Program (NIH, US) and were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS (Biochrom) and antibiotics at 37 °C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> on 96-well culture plates. The experiments were carried out in media containing tested compounds in concentrations of the appropriate range. Cultures in a neat medium (RPMI, 10% FCS) were used as a control. Viability of cells was determined after 7 days using the MTT assay [
 <xref rid="B21-biomolecules-10-01148" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] in which 10 μL of MTT solution (5 mg/mL) was added to each culture plate well, and cultures were incubated for 3 h at a temperature of 37 °C. After the centrifugation, the supernatant was removed, and DMSO was added for lysis of the cells and to dissolve crystals of formazan. Color intensity was measured with a plate reader at 560 nm.
