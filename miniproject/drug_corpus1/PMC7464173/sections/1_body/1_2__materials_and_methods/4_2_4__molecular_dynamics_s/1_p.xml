 <xref rid="B32-biomolecules-10-01148" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. All protein and protein–ligand systems have been solvated with TIP3P cubic water box at 15 Å thickness. To neutralize the system, 0.15 mol/L of NaCl salt was added. Simulation protocol consists of 2000 steps of minimization, 144,000 steps of annealing, 500,000 steps of equilibration and 5,000,000 steps (10ns) of production MD simulation. The system was heated to 300 K at rate of one Kelvin degree per 1 ps. Langevin dynamics were used to control the temperature. Minimization, annealing and equilibration were restrained to backbone atoms of the protein, while the production run was unrestrained. Timestep was set to 2 fs, all runs were performed in NPT ensemble. VMD was used to analyze the results.
