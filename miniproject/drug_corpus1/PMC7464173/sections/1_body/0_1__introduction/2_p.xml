<p>Chemical modification of natural substances is an important method used to obtain promising new therapeutic agents. Pentacyclic triterpenes and their semi-synthetic derivatives are a large group of compounds known to demonstrate biological activity, including antitumor, antiviral, antimalarial, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and hepatoprotective effects [

Antiviral activity of compounds with pentacyclic triterpene structure has been reported in relation to viruses such as HIV, hepatitis virus C (HCV), various types of influenza viruses, SARS, hepatitis B virus (HBV), herpes viruses (HSV), human enterovirus 71 (EV71), and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) [

 <italic>O</italic>-(3′,3′-dimethylsuccinyl)betulinic acid, known as bevirimat (BVM). Further studies on this compound were suspended due to resistance emerging among infected patients [
