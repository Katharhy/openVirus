<p>The results obtained for phosphate derivatives of 3-carboxyacylbetulin 
 <bold>3</bold>–
 <bold>5</bold> indicate that the most active compound is derivative 
 <bold>3</bold> with R = HOC(O)C(CH
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>CH
 <sub>2</sub>C(O), which shows activity comparable to that of 
 <bold>BVM</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.02 and 0.03 µM, respectively). A chart of changes in HIV-1 inhibition of 3-carboxyacylbetulin phosphate and 
 <bold>BVM</bold> in the tested concentration range is attached to the 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-biomolecules-10-01148">Supplementary Materials (Figure S1</xref>). However, compound 
 <bold>3</bold> has a higher selectivity for action (therapeutic index (TI) = 1250 and 967, respectively). Among the tested phosphate derivatives, compound 
 <bold>3</bold> showed the lowest cytotoxicity, but it was at a level comparable to BVM. Other phosphate derivatives were more toxic and also less active against HIV. As results from the data presented in the 
 <xref rid="biomolecules-10-01148-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, compounds with a longer carbon chain in the carboxyacylic substituent are more cytotoxic. Dimethylglutaric derivatives have an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 19.68 µM and 15.11 µM for 
 <bold>4</bold> and 
 <bold>5</bold>, respectively. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value determined for the dimethylsuccinic derivative 
 <bold>3</bold> is 25.36 µM and for 
 <bold>BVM</bold> is 29.02 µM. The position of the methyl groups on the substituent chain at C3 does not affect the cytotoxicity of the compound. A chart of changes in cytotoxicity of new phosphate derivatives 
 <bold>2</bold>–
 <bold>5</bold> in the tested concentration range is attached to the
