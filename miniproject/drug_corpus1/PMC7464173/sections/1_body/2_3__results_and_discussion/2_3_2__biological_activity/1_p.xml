<p>Newly synthesized compounds 
 <bold>2</bold>â€“
 <bold>5</bold> were evaluated for their activity against HIV-1 in a CEM-T4 cell line. First, a cytotoxicity assessment of the synthesized derivatives was performed using the MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide]. The results were expressed as CC
 <sub>50</sub> (concentration of compound causing 50% cell death). Anti-HIV activity was expressed as IC
 <sub>50</sub> (concentration of compound causing 50% inhibition of replication) and consisted of measurements of p24 antigen made using the Genscreen ULTRA HIV Ag-Ab Kit. Betulin 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>BVM</bold> were used as reference compounds. The bioassay results are presented in
