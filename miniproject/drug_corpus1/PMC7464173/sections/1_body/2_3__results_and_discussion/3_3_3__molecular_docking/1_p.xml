<p>The tested compounds can exist as two chemical species, carboxylic acids or carboxylate salts, depending on the pH of the aqueous solution. Calculations performed with ACD/Percepta software [

 <bold>BVM</bold> and compounds 
 <bold>3</bold>â€“
 <bold>5</bold> show that in all cases the content of the carboxylate states at physiological pH is 100%. Therefore, the carboxylate states of betulin derivatives were used in docking calculations. The three-dimensional (3D) structures of ligands required for docking studies were generated in their low-energy conformation using Gaussian 16 computer code [
