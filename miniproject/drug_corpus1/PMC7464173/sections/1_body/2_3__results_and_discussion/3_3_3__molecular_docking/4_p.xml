<p>The betulin derivatives ranked by AutoDock Vina are shown in 
 <xref rid="biomolecules-10-01148-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The lowest scores for binding energy (kcal/mol) of protein−ligand complexes correspond to a strong binding affinity, and the most probable ligand−protein system in vivo.
