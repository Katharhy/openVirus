<p>Analysis of the compound 
 <bold>3</bold> complex, the most potent compound in vitro (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01148-f003">Figure 3</xref>), determined salt hydrogen bonding between the carboxylate group of the ligand and Lys158 residue of chain I, and hydrogen bonding with Lys158 in chain L and the phosphate group. In addition, numerous hydrophobic interactions, including carbonâˆ’hydrogen bonding, are also visible.
