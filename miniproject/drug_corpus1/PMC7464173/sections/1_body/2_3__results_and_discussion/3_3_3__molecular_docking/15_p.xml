<p>The results of docking experiments between 
 <bold>BVM</bold>, compounds 
 <bold>3</bold>â€“
 <bold>5</bold> and selected cellular proteins are shown in 
 <xref rid="biomolecules-10-01148-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. According to the results of docking for the target proteins, all tested compounds showed a lower degree of fit to tested proteins compared to 
 <bold>BVM</bold>. These results may indicate that modification of the bevirimat molecule by substitution of the carboxyl group by a phosphate substituent probably does not increase toxicity of phosphate derivatives compared to 
 <bold>BVM</bold>.
