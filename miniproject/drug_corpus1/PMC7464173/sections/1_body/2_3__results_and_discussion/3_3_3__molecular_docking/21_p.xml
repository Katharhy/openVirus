<p>Accordingly, we used remdesivir as a reference ligand. Moreover, based on our previous study, we decided to dock to SARS-CoV-2 proteins betulinic acid and 30-diethoxyphosphoryl-3-

 <bold>6</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01148-f007">Figure 7</xref>). Compound 
 <bold>6</bold> demonstrated in vitro anti-HIV-1 activity with an IC

 <bold>BVM</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.02 µM and 0.03 µM for 
 <bold>6</bold> and 
 <bold>BVM</bold>, respectively), and with a lower cytotoxicity (CC
 <sub>50</sub> = 68 µM and 29 µM for 
 <bold>6</bold> and 
 <bold>BVM</bold>, respectively) [
