<p>We would like to point out that we used AutoDock ver.4.2.6 in our previous research on the antiviral activity of betulinic acid derivatives [
 <xref rid="B12-biomolecules-10-01148" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the present study, we decided to use the program AutoDock Vina (referred to as Vina) for in silico research. Vina uses a sophisticated gradient optimization method in its local optimization procedure. The calculation of the gradient effectively gives the optimization algorithm a “sense of direction” from a single evaluation. Evaluation of the speed and accuracy of Vina during flexible docking showed an improvement in speed of approximately two orders of magnitude, and a significantly higher accuracy of the binding mode prediction compared to AutoDock [

 <bold>BVM</bold> molecule to HIV-1 CA-CTD-SP1 with the use of Vina software.
