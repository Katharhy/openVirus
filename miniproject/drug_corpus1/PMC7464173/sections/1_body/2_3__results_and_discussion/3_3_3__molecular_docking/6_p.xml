<p>Analysis of the 
 <bold>BVM</bold> complex (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01148-f002">Figure 2</xref>) included calculations, distance measurements, and pose geometries that determined salt bridge interaction of the ligand pose with Lys227 residue of chain G and hydrogen bonding with Lys158 in chain L. In addition, numerous hydrophobic interactions influence the increased stability of the complex.
