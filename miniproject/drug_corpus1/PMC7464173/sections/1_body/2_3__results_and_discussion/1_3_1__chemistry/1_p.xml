<p>The above-mentioned literature data and results of the anti-HIV activity test obtained for phosphate and phosphonate derivatives of betulinic acid [
 <xref rid="B12-biomolecules-10-01148" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] have become the starting point for the synthesis of betulin phosphate derivatives. The obtained compounds have a carboxyacyl group in position C3, whose presence is important for action against HIV-1, and a diethyl phosphate group in position C28 (
