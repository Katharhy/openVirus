<p>The new betulin phosphate derivatives 
 <bold>2</bold>−
 <bold>5</bold> reported in this paper were obtained from easily available material, botulin 
 <bold>1</bold>, via a brief two-step synthesis. Compounds 
 <bold>3</bold>−
 <bold>5</bold>, with different carboxyacylic substituents at the C3 position, exhibited in vitro anti-HIV activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values in the range of 0.02−0.22 μM. Derivative 
 <bold>3</bold>, which has a 3’,3’-dimethylsuccinyl moiety at the C3 position, exhibits the highest anti-HIV-1 activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.02 μM). For BVM, a known maturation inhibitor, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value determined in this study was comparable and equal to 0.03 μM. Derivative 
 <bold>3</bold> was characterized by slightly higher selectivity (TI values of 1250 and 967 for 
 <bold>3</bold> and BVM, respectively). Considering the literature reports on various potential mechanisms of anti-HIV activity of triterpenes, molecular modeling with CA-CTD-SP1 has been carried out. The optimal fit was demonstrated by compound 
 <bold>3</bold>. This effect suggests a potential molecular target that determines anti-HIV activity of the studied compounds.
