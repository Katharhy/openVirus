<p>Two coronaviruses, namely SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV, are widely known infectious agents of respiratory diseases in humans (De Wit, Van Doremalen, Falzarano, &amp; Munster, 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). SARS coronavirus is known to damage multiple organs including human testes (Xu et al., 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). SARS‐infected patients display leukocyte infiltration, impaired spermatogenesis and testicular damage with wide‐spread germ cell destruction with a few or completely absent spermatozoa in the seminiferous tubules (Xu et al., 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). SARS can cause orchitis in humans (Xu et al., 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). In a study of COVID‐19, 38 participants provided semen specimens, of which 23 participants (60.5%) had achieved clinical recovery and 15 participants (39.5%) were at the acute stage of infection. The results of semen testing found that six patients (15.8%) had results positive for SARS‐CoV‐2, including four of 15 patients (26.7%) who were at the acute stage of infection and two of 23 patients (8.7%) who were recovering, which is particularly noteworthy (Li, Jin, Bao, Zhao, &amp; Zhang, 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Nevertheless, in another similar study from China, the virus was not detected in the semen samples of 34 COVID‐19 patients after a median of 31 days. In this study, 6 out of 34 (19%) patients reported scrotal discomfort, which was taken to be suggestive of viral orchitis, but a comprehensive genitourinary examination was not performed (Pan et al., 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>).
