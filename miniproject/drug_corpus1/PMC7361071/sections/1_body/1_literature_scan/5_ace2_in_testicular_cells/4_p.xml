<p>Recently, the analysis of ACE2 expression in adult human testis by single‐cell transcriptome sequencing revealed that ACE2 expression is chiefly limited to the Leydig and Sertoli cells in the human testis (Wang &amp; Xu, 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Furthermore, using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) they showed that ACE2‐positive spermatogonia display a higher number of genes related to viral reproduction and transmission, and a comparatively lower number of genes associated with spermatogenesis compared to ACE2‐negative spermatogonia. Likewise, ACE2‐positive Leydig and Sertoli cells showed a higher number of genes related to cell‐cell junction and immunity, and a lower number of genes associated with mitochondria and reproduction (Wang &amp; Xu, 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). With this study, the authors concluded that testis is a high‐risk organ vulnerable to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection that may lead to spermatogenic failure (Wang &amp; Xu,
