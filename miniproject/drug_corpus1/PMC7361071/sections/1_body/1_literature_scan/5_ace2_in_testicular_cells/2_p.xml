<p>ACE2 is the first known human homologue of angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE). While ACE expression is mostly ubiquitous, ACE2 transcripts are found only in heart, kidney and testis (Donoghue et al., 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). Later on, it was shown that the catalytic activity of ACE2 was confined to the membrane preparations of whole testes and Leydig cells from adult rats. The immunohistochemical localisation showed the presence of ACE2 in the Leydig cells of rat testis. However, in human testis, it was localised to both, the Sertoli and Leydig cells (Douglas et al., 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). They also showed that the expression of ACE2 in the testis is developmentally regulated as its expression increased progressively between day 7 and 19 postpartum, which was coincident with the maturation of progenitor cells into steroidogenic Leydig cells (Douglas et al., 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). Furthermore, the ablation of the Leydig cells by a specific toxin, ethane dimethane sulphonate (EDS), eliminated ACE2 immunoreactivity from the interstitium, indicating the Leydig cells to be the main testicular source of this protein in rats. The ACE2‐positive cells increased constitutively with increasing number of Leydig cells during recovery after EDS treatment (Douglas et al., 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). Interestingly, the inhibition of LH and testosterone levels by the use of testosterone implants did not significantly alter the expression of ACE2 activity in the testis, suggesting that this enzyme is not regulated hormonally (Douglas et al., 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). Overall, this study demonstrated that ACE2 is a constitutive product of adult‐type Leydig cells and may regulate testicular function by yet unknown mechanism (Douglas et al., 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>).
