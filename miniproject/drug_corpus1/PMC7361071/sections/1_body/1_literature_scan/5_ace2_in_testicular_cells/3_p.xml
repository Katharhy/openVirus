<p>As the newly identified coronavirus (SARS‐CoV‐2) shares the same receptor as SARS, it raises the possibility of testis being a potential target for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. In our recent transcriptome sequencing studies, we found ACE2 expression in spermatocytes and round spermatids (our unpublished data). We also found the presence of ACE2 transcript in our recent transcriptome sequencing of human spermatozoa, further validating its expression in germ cells (our unpublished data). We also retrieved the published transcriptome studies to figure out ACE2 expression in testicular cells. Transcriptomic analyses of human testicular germ cell subtypes obtained from pools of 500 individually laser‐capture microdissected cells by RNA‐Seq revealed the presence of ACE2 transcripts in human spermatogonia, spermatocyte and spermatids (Jan et al.,
