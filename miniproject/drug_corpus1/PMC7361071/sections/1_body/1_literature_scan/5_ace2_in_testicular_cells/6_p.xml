<p>As the incidence and severity of SARS‐CoV‐2 are reported to be higher in males than females, Shastri et al. performed a study to determine the time to viral clearance after infection in a total of 68 individuals (48 males and 20 females) with median age of 37 years (Shastri et al., 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). They observed that females were able to achieve viral clearance significantly earlier than males. Furthermore, a serial follow‐up evaluation of three families with both male and female patients demonstrated that female members of the same household cleared the SARS‐CoV‐2 infection earlier in each family (Shastri et al., 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). In order to determine the reason for delayed clearance in males, they also checked the expression of ACE2 in tissue‐specific repositories. It was found that testicular tissues were one of the tissues showing ACE2 expression in 3 independent RNA expression databases (Human Protein Atlas, FAMTOM5 and GETx). Interestingly, the ovarian tissue showed very low expression of ACE2 (Shastri et al.,
