<p>While no study till date has analysed the influence of SARS‐CoV‐2 on testis or semen parameters, data from previous coronavirus outbreak provide critical information regarding its possible impact of male fertility. A lone study on testicular samples showed a significant impact of SARS coronavirus on the reproductive system (Xu et al., 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). In this study, the authors inspected the pathological variations in the testis of six patients who deceased of SARS and compared it with controls. They found that SARS caused orchitis and testes showed widespread damage of germ cells with very few or no spermatozoa in the seminiferous tubules. The seminiferous tubules had thickened basement membrane and showed significant leukocyte infiltration and macrophage staining, suggesting the impact of immune response on the testis. However, SARS genome sequences were not spotted in the affected testis, further suggesting that the impact on testis was due to immune response. This study clearly suggested that SARS coronaviruses cause orchitis and may lead to infertility (Xu et al.,
