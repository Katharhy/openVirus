<p>The central nervous system plays a vital role in the onset and endocrine control of spermatogenesis. The hypothalamic‐pituitary‐gonadal axis exerts a critical role in the pubertal growth and reproduction. Neurons releasing gonadotropin hormone (GnRH) secrete GnRH, the pulsatile release of which is critical to gonadotropin synthesis and release, the dysregulation of which results in infertility (Singh, Agrawal, Verma, &amp; Singh, 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). A controlled and pulsatile release of GnRH from the hypothalamus activates the release of the follicle‐stimulating hormone (FSH) and the pituitary gland luteinising hormone (LH). Low level of GnRH causes decrease in FSH and LH secretions, resulting in impaired development and functioning of the Sertoli and Leydig cell, which may result in infertility. Altered operation of the GnRH pulse may also disturb the levels of estradiol and prolactin, which are known to relate to infertility. Therefore, apart from its direct impact on testes, SARS‐CoV‐2 may affect pubertal development and fertility indirectly by its impact on the central nervous system.
