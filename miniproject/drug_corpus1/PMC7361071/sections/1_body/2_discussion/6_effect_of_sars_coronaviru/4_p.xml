<p>The very first case of SARS‐CoV‐2‐associated meningitis/encephalitis observed upon brain MRI of a 24‐year‐old man (Moriguchi et al., 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) revealed hyperintensity along the right lateral ventricle wall and hyperintense signal shifts in the right mesial temporal lobe and hippocampus, indicating the possibility of SARS‐CoV‐2 meningitis. An analysis of 214 patients showed that 78 out of 214 patients had severe neurological symptoms (Mao et al., 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). These patients displayed symptoms of the central and the peripheral nervous systems. Other reports, such as fatigue, nausea and diarrhoea could be digestive or neurological symptoms (Li, Bai, Bai, &amp; Hashikawa, 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Mao et al., 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). After conducting the CT scan and MRI, a patient diagnosed with SARS‐CoV‐2 reported an unusual type of encephalopathy that has yet to be shown as caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (Poyiadji et al., 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). SARS‐CoV‐2's micro‐invasive ability may play a role in COVID‐19 patients' respiratory failure due to the linking of the synapse‐connected route from the mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors in the lung and lower airways to the medullary cardiorespiratory core (Li, Bai, et al., 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Expanding proof shows that the coronaviruses are not just constrained to the primary organs of entry, for example, the respiratory system, but can likewise enter the central sensory system and the reproductive tract. The central nervous system may have a major role in COVID‐19 morbidity and mortality.
