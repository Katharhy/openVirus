<p>Most viruses enter human body through the nasal and oral routes and travel through the brain by increasing and dispersing through olfactory bulbs; the lingual nerve near the jawline and through the tongue; or the vagus nerve that goes through the neck and thorax (van den Pol, 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). Viral particles may break the blood‐brain barrier (BBB) legitimately or by endothelial cell entrance while communicating with the sensory system, or by contaminating monocytes that blow the barrier before duplicating and overflowing white blood cells once inside the brain. Conversely, certain viruses do not cross the BBB, but induce an immune reaction that can activate breaching of the divide by cytokines or chemokines (Chai, He, Zhou, Lu, &amp; Fu, 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Numerous viruses have been detected in the brain, including influenza, poliovirus, measles, mumps, rubella, HIV, SARS‐CoV and SARS‐CoV‐2 (Cai et al.,

Inflammation may occur in various anatomical locations within the CNS, such as meninges, brain and spinal cord, or at the same time in multiple regions that could result in meningitis, encephalitis and myelitis or even more severe conditions like meningoencephalitis and encephalomyelitis.
