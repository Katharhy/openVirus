<p>The male reproductive tract turned out to be a subject of great interest in virology following the upsurge of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections in the 80's (Stekler et al., 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). HIV is one of history's deadliest and most detailed studied viruses. HIV has infected 75 million people and caused about 32 million deaths. Globally, 37.9 million people were living with HIV at the end of 2018 (‘WHO | Number of Deaths Due to HIV/AIDS’, 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Since numerous HIV‐infected persons worldwide are of reproductive age, pregnancy and desire for reproduction have arisen as clinically relevant problems in this population (Khawcharoenporn &amp; Sha, 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Many HIV/AIDS‐related disorders comprise orchitis, acute epididymitis and other pelvic inflammatory disorder induced by opportunistic bacteria and sexually transmitted infection (STI) acquired by a near‐HIV transmission route (Brookings, Goldmeier, &amp; Sadeghi‐Nejad, 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). At the same time, certain antiretroviral medications are noxious to mitochondria of the cells and can distress spermatozoa (White, Mital, Taylor, &amp; John, 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). Impairments in sperm development and sperm generation, including reduced ejaculatory volume, number of spermatozoa and progressive motility, have been found in HIV‐infected people (Bujan et al., 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Nicopoullos, Almeida, Vourliotis, &amp; Gilling‐Smith, 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; White et al., 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). Among other cases, the people diagnosed with HIV were found to be oligozoospermic with viscous semen and few round cells (Kushnir &amp; Lewis, 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Furthermore, a study on testicular autopsy reported the gradual destruction of germ cells in extended AIDS survival (Shevchuk, Pigato, Khalife, Armenakas, &amp; Fracchia, 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>). Males who used more advanced immunosuppressants had reduced levels of total serum testosterone, caused by secondary hypogonadism (Gomes, Aragüés, Guerra, Fernandes, &amp; Mascarenhas, 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), and the latter is one of the significant endocrine disorders causing infertility in men with AIDS (Wong, Levy, &amp; Stephenson, 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>).
