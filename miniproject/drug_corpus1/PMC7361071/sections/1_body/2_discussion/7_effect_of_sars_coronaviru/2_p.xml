<p>The prostate gland is a male genital organ whose primary function is to secrete prostate fluid, one of the main seminal components (Verze, Cai, &amp; Lorenzetti, 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). The prostate gland muscles also help in pushing this seminal fluid through the urethra during ejaculation (Aaron, Franco, &amp; Hayward, 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Verze et al., 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Prostate‐excreted fluid accounts for around one‐third of overall semen volume and includes numerous proteins, calcium and citric acid (Lu et al., 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Ricardo, 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). The prostate is known to express ACE2 in normal and healthy prostate hyperplasia, so it is more likely to get SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, which may affect its secretions. Notwithstanding the respiratory tract fluid, the researchers effectively recognised SARS‐CoV‐2 in the patient's urine, saliva and conjunctiva (Guan et al., 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Xia, Tong, Liu, Shen, &amp; Guo, 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). It suggested that the virus may have different courses of transmission. The entirety of the above information suggests that the respiratory system, digestive system and urogenital system are all SARS‐CoV‐2 target organs. Hence, COVID‐19 patients' testis and prostate are also vulnerable to SARS‐CoV‐2. A recent study reported that 18 cases of COVID‐19 patients did not have SARS‐CoV‐2 in mediated prostatic secretion (Quan et al., 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). So far, no other study is available to validate whether or not the prostate is actually affected.
