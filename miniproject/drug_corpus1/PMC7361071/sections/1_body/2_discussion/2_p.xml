<p>Viruses are much more penetrative than we understand, and they are known to affect male fertility since long. A classical example of virus‐induced infertility comes from the mumps virus. There were several large epidemics of mumps during 1914–18 and 1939–45. In one of the credible classic reports on the effect of mumps on fertility, Ballew and Masters (
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">1952</xref>) evaluated 79 individuals with family case histories of prior mumps infection, finding a total of 19 (23%) cases of mumps orchitis (Ballew, 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">1954</xref>). Of the 19 males with mumps orchitis history, 12 (63%) had the involvement of bilateral testes and 11 (58%) were found to be azoospermic on repeated examinations. An article by Benard in 1927 stated that Sterility following adult mumps is a myth (Benard, 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">1927</xref>). This myth was cleared by yet another study on mumps induced infertility. Scott (
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">1960</xref>) found that 21.4% of infertile husbands attending his infertility clinic had a history of mumps in childhood, and 1.8% had mumps after puberty. From an extensive review of 25,000 cases, Scott reported that about 20% of mumps cases have orchitis, and about 15% have bilateral involvement (Scott,
