<p>While no study to date has analysed the influence of SARS‐CoV‐2 on testis, data from previous coronavirus outbreak provide critical information about the possible impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 on male fertility. A lone study on testicular samples had shown a significant impact of the SARS coronaviruses on the reproductive system (Xu et al., 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). In this study, the authors inspected the pathological variations in the testis of six patients who deceased of SARS and compared it with controls. They found that SARS caused orchitis, and the testis showed widespread damage of germ cells with very few or no spermatozoa in the seminiferous tubules. The seminiferous tubules had thickened basement membrane and showed significant leucocyte infiltration and macrophage staining, suggesting the impact of immune response on the testis. However, SARS genome sequences were not spotted in the affected testis, further suggesting that the impact on the testis was due to the immune response. This study clearly suggested that SARS coronaviruses cause orchitis and may lead to infertility even if they do not enter the seminiferous tubules or are not detected in semen samples (Xu et al.,
