<p>SARS‐CoV‐2 is known to use angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor for gaining entry into the host cells (Hoffmann et al., 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). The virus enters the human body through the respiratory organs, but once inside the body, it could gain entry into various cells expressing ACE2, which may explain its multi‐organ impact. Single‐cell transcriptome studies have revealed that Sertoli cells, spermatogonia and Leydig cells express ACE2 enzyme abundantly and are therefore highly vulnerable to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (Fan, Li, Ding, Lu, &amp; Wang, 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Wang &amp; Xu, 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) suggested that categories of gene ontology associated with viral replication and transmission are distinctly enriched in ACE2‐positive spermatogonia, whereas related terms for male gamete generation are down‐regulated (Wang &amp; Xu, 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Taken together, we can infer that SARS‐CoV‐2 can also pose a high risk of injury to the testicular cells.
