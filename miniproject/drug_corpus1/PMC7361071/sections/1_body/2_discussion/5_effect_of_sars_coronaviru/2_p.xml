<p>As discussed above, only two studies have analyzed SARS‐CoV‐2 presence in semen samples. In one of these, 38 participants provided a semen specimen, of which 23 participants (60.5%) had achieved clinical recovery and 15 participants (39.5%) were at the acute stage of infection. The results of semen testing found that 6 patients (15.8%) had results positive for SARS‐CoV‐2, including 4 of 15 patients (26.7%) who were in the acute stage of infection and 2 of 23 patients (8.7%) who were recovering, which is particularly noteworthy (Li, Jin, et al., 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Nevertheless, in another similar study from China, the virus was not detected in the semen samples of 34 COVID‐19 patients after a median of 31 days (Pan et al., 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Only two studies have looked for the presence of SARS‐CoV‐2 in semen samples and present contrasting findings. Therefore, further studies are required before the virus presence in semen samples and hence chances of sexual transmission can be ascertained. However, none of these studies mentioned whether the virus was analyzed in washed spermatozoa, seminal plasma or in neat semen samples. Assuming that it was done in neat semen samples, its analysis in washed sperm remains an attractive proposal, as the latter can guide the use of semen samples in assisted reproduction.
