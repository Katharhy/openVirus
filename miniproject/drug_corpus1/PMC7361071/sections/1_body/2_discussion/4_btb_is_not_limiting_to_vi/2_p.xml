<p>The blood‐testis barrier (BTB) is not impermeable to viruses, particularly with the onset of systemic or local inflammation or viraemia. Eventually, some viruses could be found in semen (Li, Wang, &amp; Han, 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Salam &amp; Horby, 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). In mammals, viruses such as parainfluenza virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, foot and mouth disease virus and Paravaccinia virus were detected in semen long ago (Kahrs, Gibbs, &amp; Larsen, 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">1980</xref>). More than 27 viruses have been found in semen to date (Salam &amp; Horby, 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). The scientists have found evidence after analysing more than 3,800 research papers that at least 11 viruses live in the testis, including those causing pneumonia, dengue and extreme acute respiratory syndrome (Salam &amp; Horby, 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Regardless of the way they enter, viruses have been recognised in the human ejaculate, though the degree to which infection and reproduction occur inside the spermatozoa or germ cells stay indistinct (Mansuy et al., 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). In addition, some viruses, such as HIV/AIDS, Zika and hepatitis virus, can be transmitted via semen (Atkinson et al., 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Zika virus can be found inside spermatozoa and might be transferred to the oocyte at the time of fertilisation. It is suggested that sexual transmission of ZIKA virus will prompt an ascent in the number of infected people in the endemic territories (da Silva,
