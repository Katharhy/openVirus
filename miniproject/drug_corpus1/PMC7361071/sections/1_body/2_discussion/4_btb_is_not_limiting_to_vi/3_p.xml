<p>The deleterious effects of viruses include overt damage to testis, spermatozoa, irregular sex‐hormone expression and inflammatory cytokine dysregulation (Puggioni et al.,

 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>); however, a study exposed that the bluetongue virus could reproduce inside the testis in the endothelial cells of the peritubular regions, eliciting increased type‐I interferon reaction, diminished Leydig cell testosterone formation and even destruction of the Sertoli cells (Ma, Zhang, &amp; Zheng, 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Puggioni et al., 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). The testes are made primarily of seminiferous tubules and intratubular tissue. The seminiferous tubule is the place where spermatozoa are produced, composed of sperm‐producing cells (spermatogonia) and the supporting Sertoli cells (Puggioni et al., 
 <xref rid="and13712-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Under LH regulation, the interstitial Leydig cells are accountable for the production of testosterone. Since Leydig and Sertoli cells are bathed by blood, the effect of virus on these cells is enough to cause infertility, even if the BTB were impermeable to viruses.
