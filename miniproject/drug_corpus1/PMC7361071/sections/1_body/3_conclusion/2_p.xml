<p>From the evidence cited above, it is plausible that SARS‐CoV‐2 can affect multiple reproductive organs, raising the possibility of its effect on fertility. Particularly in the case of young children who are undergoing puberty, SARS‐CoV‐2 infection could significantly affect the sexual development and fertility due to its impact on testicular and prostate development apart from its impact on the neuroendocrine axis that regulates the pubertal development and the onset of spermatogenesis. Among the adult male population, the viral infection may cause significant damage to the testicular tissue, particularly the Sertoli cells, which can impair spermatogenesis. Out of two studies on semen samples, one reported virus presence and one denied it, raising doubts about its very presence in semen. If the virus is present in semen, it would be interesting to investigate its source. Since prostatic secretions have been found virus negative, the virus may be secreted in semen from other organs, including testis. Since co‐morbidities have a significant impact on the overall outcome of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, individuals with significant oxidative stress and other infertility predisposing factors are even more vulnerable to SARS‐CoV‐2–induced infertility. While under such life‐threatening infections, lifesaving is a major concern, the impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 on fertility could be studied in the recovered patients. Since the impact of this viral disease is long‐lasting, and spermatogenesis takes 70–75 days to completion, SARS‐CoV‐2 recovered patients are ideal subjects for studying its impact on spermatogenesis and fertility. We suggest that SARS‐CoV‐2 should be given a high priority to study its correlation with orchitis and infertility. Inclusion of a clause of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection history in infertility workup in future would help in consolidating these speculations.</p>
