<p id="Par24">Mosquito-borne epidemics are critically aggravating the pre-existing burden that the primary healthcare systems face. Work force will be affected and the societies may be threatened by the epidemic wave if they are not prepared well. Improved investigation and actions against response are required to alleviate the substantial burden on health systems and control promoting it worldwide. At present there is no vaccine available for ZIKV infection. Vaccines against flaviviral infections available for use of human are yellow fever vaccine, Japanese encephalitis vaccine, tick-borne encephalitis vaccines and dengue vaccine, so the rules for the vector borne infections must be followed in order to prevent ZIKV infection, as well as avoiding mosquito bite and control of vector is the only available options. Animal models of the ZIKV disease are immediately required not only for exhibiting the materno-fetal transmission and confirmation of its neurologic manifestations but also to report the influence of virus on hostâ€™s immunity and reproductive health throughout the life. ZIKV infection is increasing dramatically, so it is the need of hour to take some necessary steps to eliminate this lethal infection and to constrain its future entrance as well. ZIKV specific rapid molecular diagnosis should be done urgently in order to detect the infection in less time before it aggravates. Modern techniques of molecular biology should be utilized to make vaccine specific to ZIKV. Research gaps should be addressed promptly and systematically. This can be accomplished by understanding the occurrence of broad spectrum clinical consequences that are resulting from fetal ZIKV infection and the environmental influences that effect their emergence. This also require the advancement of flaviviruses selective investigative tools, models of animals to detect developing effects of fetus resulting from viral septicity [
