<p id="Par12">Antibodies against ZIKV were detected by Serosurvey studies in goats, rodents (
 <italic>Meriones hurrianae</italic> and 
 <italic>Tatera indica</italic>), sheep and bats. These studies suggest that there is no clear association between ZIKV and a specific species of animal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In humans, it spreads through the bite of infected 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes that are usually found in tropical and sub-tropical regions in domestic water-holding containers near dwellings [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Consequently, when a mosquito bites a person already infected with ZIKV, the virus infected blood goes into the midgut and prevailed into the circulatory system. Another similar mosquito, 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> can also transmit ZIKV. Among humans, transmission of this viral infection may also refer to sexual contact [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. High ZIKV RNA load has detected in breast milk, so transmission is possible by breast feeding and ZIKV can also be transmitted by blood transfusions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] as reported on December 2015 in Brazil, the first case of ZIKV blood transfusion transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. ZIKV is adopted to transmit by enzootic and sub Urban cycle (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>); in enzootic setting this involves mosquitoes of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species and non-human primates, however transmission in Urban setting involves human and mosquitoes of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species demonstrate vector and non-vector borne transmission of ZIKV.
