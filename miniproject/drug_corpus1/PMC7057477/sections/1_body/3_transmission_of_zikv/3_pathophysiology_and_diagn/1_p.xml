<p id="Par13">In the beginning, ZIKV infection was misdiagnosed with dengue infection. Virus isolation and serological methods are carried out for laboratory diagnosis examination for ZIKV (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Virus isolation needs several days (i.e. 1–2 weeks) while convalescent and acute sampling and cross-reactions among flaviviruses are the limitations for serological methods [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Cell culture may be utilized to isolate ZIKV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] but specialized laboratories are required to practice it [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) is used for confirmation of ZIKV infections whereas IgM against ZIKV can be detected by ELISA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. RT-PCR is time saving, specific and sensitive in order to detect ZIKV in serum or cell culture [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Molecular detection of ZIKV was increased when saliva was used at the acute phase of disease particularly in children and neonates as blood is difficult to collect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. ZIKV fever diagnosis from PAHO is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. RT-PCR for ZIKV is done on blood or saliva sample. Sequencing is performed if the results of RT-PCR are positive. ZIKV IgM serology comprises detection by immunofluorescence or ELISA, with confirmation by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) if results are equivocal or positive [
