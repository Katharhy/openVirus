<p id="Par2">Among the family of viruses, Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging evolving virus on the western hemisphere, though it was initially reported from Uganda in 1940s [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Transmission of ZIKV is related to the two other imperative arbo-viruses including dengue virus (DENV) and chikungunya virus (CHIVKV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In a quest to solve the dilemma of yellow fever, a study conducted in 1947 isolated the first novel virus from the blood of a sentinel rhesus macaque placed in the Zika Forest of Uganda [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. ZIKV stayed relatively silent for almost 70 years and all of a sudden emerged all over the America after Pacific Islands to Brazil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Recently it was identified that the ZIKV strain found in the Americas had escalated to Angola and was linked with a cluster of microcephaly [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Hill et al. also reported similar results based on full virus genome analysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. All the above mentioned studies endorse overview of mosquito-borne transmission of the ZIKV strain from the Americas into continental Africa. World Health Organization (WHO) declared it as emergency of public health with international concern as a result of global alarm created by ZIKV by becoming first foremost infectious disease coupled with defects of human birth revealed in more than a half of century [
