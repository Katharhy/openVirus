<p id="Par3">ZIKV is a member of family Flaviviridae and spread through 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> genus. Other members of this family include arboviruses, dengue virus and Japanese encephalitis viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. ZIKV antibodies were also detected in animal species, especially non-human primates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. ZIKV was also isolated from several mosquito species in Africa and Asia including arboreal mosquitoes as 
 <italic>Aedes africanus</italic> or mosquitoes with a large tropical and subtropical distribution as 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Studies reported that ZIKV has three main lineages, two from Africa and one from Asia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The African lineage split in East and West African clusters [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Asian lineage presents expanded geographical distribution [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], since it emerged in the Pacific Ocean [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and South America [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The 2015–16 epidemic occurred in the America was due to strain of the Asian lineage generally known as the American strain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, some consider the American outbreak strain as its own lineage. Epidemiology studies revealed distribution of ZIKV in half of the north African continent, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, India, Thailand and Pakistan (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The first human case was detected in Uganda in 1952 during a study indicating the presence of neutralizing antibodies to ZIKV in sera [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Only few cases of infection in human were reported before 2007 when outbreak of ZIKV infection in humans occurred in Yap, Federated States of Micronesia, in the Pacific region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In French Polynesia the largest epidemic of ZIKV occurred during 2013 to 2014 and extended to New Caledonia, Cook Islands, Vanuatu, Easter Island, Solomon Islands and other Pacific Islands [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. ZIKV transmission is known in 55 countries and territories. However, only in 2015 to 2016, indigenous transmission have been reported for 41 of them, with indirect confirmation regarding circulation of virus in six countries, terminated outbreaks reported in five countries while three countries were affected with local infection [
