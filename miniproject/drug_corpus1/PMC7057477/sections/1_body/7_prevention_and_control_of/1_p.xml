<p id="Par22">Most precarious threats for ZIKV infection are mosquitoes including their reproducing localities. Their encounter with humans must be reduced in order to control and prevent their outspread. This can be employed by using mosquito repellents, mosquito nettings and closing the entrances and openings. Insect killing sprays recommended by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme should be used as larvicides [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Insect repellents should not be used for babies under two months, mosquito nets should be used to protect babies from insect bite. Centre of disease control recommends mosquito repellents with active ingredients picaridin, DEET, eucalyptus oil, IR3535, oil of lemon and para-menthane-diol. These are safe for pregnant and lactating mothers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Repellants containing eucalyptus oil, lemon oil and para-menthane-diol should be avoided for children below 3 years of age. Mosquitoes should be killed using indoor mosquito killing sprays which contain active ingredient Imidacloprid and β-Cyfluthrin available in market [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Flying insect fogger can also be used against the mosquitoes containing active ingredients Tetramethrin and Cypermethrin [

Pregnancy must be avoided in the high risk ZIKV infection prone areas before complete eradication or extra care must be exercised as microcephaly is associated with ZIKV infection [
