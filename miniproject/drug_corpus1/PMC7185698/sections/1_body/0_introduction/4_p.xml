<p>Multiple mathematical modeling analyses related to Ebola hemorrhagic fever have been undertaken to forecast peak incidence and size of outbreaks [
 <xref rid="pone.0230406.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. They have evaluated shifts in disease transmission dynamics during epidemics [
 <xref rid="pone.0230406.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], identified factors contributing to the recurrence and persistence of outbreaks [
 <xref rid="pone.0230406.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], assessed the population-level impact of quarantine on disease transmission dynamics [
 <xref rid="pone.0230406.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], estimated size and duration of outbreaks with and without vaccine use [
 <xref rid="pone.0230406.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], assessed the role of sexual transmission in spread of infection during outbreaks [
 <xref rid="pone.0230406.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], captured real-time disease dynamics in the midst of outbreaks [
 <xref rid="pone.0230406.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], projected the short- and long-term course of outbreaks [
 <xref rid="pone.0230406.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], evaluated the effectiveness of control measures (e.g., isolation of cases, safe burials, and social distancing) implemented to stop outbreaks [
 <xref rid="pone.0230406.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], quantified the impact of vaccination on the spatiotemporal dynamics of disease transmission [
 <xref rid="pone.0230406.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], evaluated vaccination of HCW [
 <xref rid="pone.0230406.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and evaluated the impact of vaccination on the course of Ebola epidemics [
