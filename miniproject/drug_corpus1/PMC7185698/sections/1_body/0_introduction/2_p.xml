<p>Multiple Ebola vaccine candidates are currently in development [
 <xref rid="pone.0230406.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. While prophylactic Ebola vaccination is not part of the standard Ebola virus disease prevention strategy yet, recent regulatory actions are being considered to be major steps towards greater availability of Ebola vaccines in near future in high-risk countries [
 <xref rid="pone.0230406.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These actions include the European Commissionâ€™s decision to grant a conditional marketing authorization to a vaccine candidate in November 2019 (which was followed by WHO prequalification), its subsequent independent approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration, and submission of a prophylactic vaccine candidate for accelerated assessment by Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency. Given these recent developments, multiple relevant international public health institutions and governments of affected countries are considering stockpiling of vaccines both for emergency use in the event of an outbreak or epidemic and/or for preventive vaccination of selective at-risk populations (including HCW in endemic areas who carry a significantly higher risk of infection) and residents of densely-populated urban areas [
 <xref rid="pone.0230406.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Henao-Restrepo and colleagues have postulated that effective ring vaccination can help control Ebola outbreaks [

 <xref rid="pone.0230406.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, widespread vaccination in the midst of an outbreak or epidemic can pose challenges including estimation and allocation of resources to ensure timely vaccine availability, acceptance by the population, and speedy deployment over large geographical areas [

 <xref rid="pone.0230406.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], has put large cities and neighboring countries at risk and reinforces the urgent need to formulate and implement effective prophylactic vaccination strategies [
