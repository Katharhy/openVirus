<p>The parameters fitted to the weekly (general population)/monthly (HCW) cases reported for the 2014 epidemic in Sierra Leone separately for the three periods of the epidemic can be seen in 
 <xref rid="pone.0230406.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Comparison of the output of the stochastic simulation of the fitted model with published data [
 <xref rid="pone.0230406.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] confirmed a good fit (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230406.g003">Fig 3Aâ€“3F</xref>). The model simulated 8,706 cases and 3,575 deaths, compared to 8,704 cases and 3,587 deaths reported by WHO. Of the total number of Ebola cases in the model, 284 cases were estimated to have occurred among the HCW, which was similar to the number (296) reported by Fang and colleagues [
