<p id="Par26">The frequency of the K65R mutation in patient 301635 was insufficient to select clones of the K65R/S68G double mutation; hence, this patient was not included in subsequent analyses. Therefore, clones of the K65R/S68G double mutation and K65R mutation from the other three patients were used for analyses of phenotypic drug resistance. The viruses harboring the K65R/S68G double mutation in patients 301770, 301844, and 302335 exhibited a FC to AZT of 0.562 ± 0.067, 1.483 ± 0.529, and 1.359 ± 0.137, respectively. These values were not significantly different from those of the K65R mutation (FC: 0.925 ± 0.214, 1.262 ± 0.618, and 0.793 ± 0.09, respectively;
