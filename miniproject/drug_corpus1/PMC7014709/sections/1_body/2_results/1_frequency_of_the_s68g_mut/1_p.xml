<p id="Par24">A total of 172,639 RTI-naive and RTI-treated individuals infected with HIV-1 in the HIV Drug Resistance Database of Stanford University were analyzed in this study: subtype A (
 <italic>n</italic> = 12,415), subtype B (
 <italic>n</italic> = 83,006), subtype C (
 <italic>n</italic> = 36,436), subtype D (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3705), subtype F (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2418), subtype G (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4638), CRF01_AE (
 <italic>n</italic> = 20,507), and CRF02_AG (
 <italic>n</italic> = 9514). Prior to ART, the lowest and highest prevalence of the S68G mutation were reported in subtype G (1.3%, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 1564) and CRF01_AE (7.3%, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 14,336), respectively. Among RTI-treated patients, the prevalence of the S68G mutation increased significantly in almost all subtypes (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), except subtype F that exhibited a slight decrease. CRF01_AE viruses demonstrated a 9.7% increase in S68G mutation between RTI-treated and RTI-naive individuals, the greatest increase observed among all subtypes (Additional file

The prevalence of the K65R/S68G double mutation among RTI-treated patients of various subtypes ranged from 21.1% (4/19) in subtype F to 61.7% (142/230) in CRF01_AE (Additional file
