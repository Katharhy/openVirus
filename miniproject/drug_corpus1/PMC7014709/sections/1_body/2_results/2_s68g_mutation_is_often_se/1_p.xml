<p id="Par25">An average of 260,000 high quality reads (&gt; Q30) were obtained from each of the four cases, which comprehensively reflected the sequence characteristics of the mutant. Among the three patients infected with CRF01_AE not carrying the natural polymorphism S68G prior to ART, The K65R mutation was detected in patient-302335 as the dominant mutant quasispecies 3 months post-ART, accounting for 92.99%, which remained at a high level (94.63%) when tested 6-months post-ART; at that time, the S68G mutation was detected among 51.14% quasispecies. The other two patients (301770 and 301844) had the predominant quasispecies carrying the K65R mutation at 3–6 months post ART (accounting for 95.38 and 92.51%, respectively). The S68G mutation occurred at 77.52 and 59.19% respectively. In further follow-up time points (at 7–12 months post ART), almost all quasispecies carried the K65R/S68G double mutation in these two patients. Unlike the above three patients, patient 301635 carried the S68G mutation as the predominant natural polymorphism, appearing in &gt; 90% of the quasispecies prior to ART. However, the K65R mutation was not detected until 7 months post ART, when only 11.28% of the quasispecies were found to have the K65R mutation (Fig.
