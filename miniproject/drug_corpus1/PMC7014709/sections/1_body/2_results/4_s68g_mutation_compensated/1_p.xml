<p id="Par27">Virus stocks of the K65R and K65R/S68G mutations were mixed with different input ratios and cultured for 13 days. At the end of culture, the K65R/S68G double mutation strains outgrew those of the K65R mutation irrespective of the input ratio. In the 4:6 input group, the composition of K65R/S68G mutants increased from 60 to 88%. In the 1:1 input group, the composition of K65R/S68G mutants increased from 50 to 84%. In the 9:1 input group, the composition of K65R/S68G mutants increased from 10 to 62% (Fig.
