The treatment regimens were tenofovir (TDF), lamivudine (3TC), and efavirenz. Genotypic testing for drug resistance and the viral load of plasma was performed at baseline, and at 6, 7, 10, and 12 months after treatment. Thereafter, all four patients changed treatment regimens. Among the four patients, 301635 and 302335 were followed up four times within 6–7 months post ART, while 301770 and 301844 were followed up five times within 10–12 months post ART. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University. Written informed consent was provided by all patients.
