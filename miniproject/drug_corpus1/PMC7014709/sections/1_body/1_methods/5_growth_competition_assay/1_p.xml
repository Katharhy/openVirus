<p id="Par22">PR genes and RT genes of the pNL4–3-wildtype plasmid were replaced by patient-derived genes containing K65R/S68G double mutations through an ApaI/AgeI double-enzyme digestion and T4 ligation strategy to produce the pNL4–3-wildtype K65R/S68G mutant infectious clone. Subsequently, the S68G mutation was reverted to wild type through in vitro site-directed mutagenesis to produce the pNL4–3-wildtype K65R mutant infectious clone. The K65R mutant and K65R/S68G mutant viral stocks were produced via transfection of 293 T cells, and cultured at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 48 h. The supernatant was collected for viral titration. The K65R/S68G mutants and K65R mutants viral stocks were diluted and mixed at a 4:6, 1:1, and 9:1 ratio, respectively. Peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (3 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>) obtained from healthy donors were infected with the same virus titers (multiplicity of infection = 0.05) from each of the competing viruses. All experiments were conducted in triplicate. Viral fitness was determined through full pairwise competitions between all combinations of viruses. On days 3, 5, 7, 10, and 13, half of the culture supernatant was harvested, and viral RNA was extracted. The viral pol gene was amplified and sequenced for Sanger sequencing. The ChromatQuan Internet tool was used to calculate the viral ratio at each time point [
