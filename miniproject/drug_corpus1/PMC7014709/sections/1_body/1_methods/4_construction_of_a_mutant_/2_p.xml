<p id="Par21">The susceptibility of the virus to AZT, 3TC, and TDF was calculated as the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50). All experiments were conducted in triplicate. The IC50 of the mutant virus was compared with that of the fully susceptible virus (wild-type pseudovirus NL4–3-ΔE-Luc). The degree of resistance of the mutant pseudoviruses was determined by calculating the fold change (FC) in IC50 compared with that of the wild-type pseudoviruses.</p>
