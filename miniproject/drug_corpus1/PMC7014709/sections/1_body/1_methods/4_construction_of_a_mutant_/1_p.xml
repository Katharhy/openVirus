<p id="Par20">Protease (PR) genes (codons 1–99) and reverse transcriptase (RT) genes (codons 1–240) were amplified from viral RNA obtained from patients infected with CRF01_AE using nested PCR using primers Round2-F (5′-ATAGCCAAAAATTGCAGGGCCCCTAGRAAAAAG-3′) and Round2-R (5′-GTCCTTCCTTTCCACATTTCCA-3′). Patient-derived PCR products containing the K65R/S68G double mutations were cloned into a pNL4–3-ΔE-Luc plasmid through a ApaI/AgeI double-enzyme digestion and T4 ligation strategy to produce the pNL4–3-ΔE-Luc K65R/S68G clone. Subsequently, the S68G mutation was reversed to wild-type through in vitro site-directed mutagenesis using primers G68S-F (5′-AAGAGAAAGGACAGTACCAAATGGAGAAAG-3′) and G68S-R(5′-TCTCCATTTGGTACTGTCCTTTCTCTTTAT-3′) to produce the pNL4–3-ΔE-Luc K65R clone. Pseudoviruses were packaged in 293 T cells with plasmid VSVG and co-transfection of the K65R/S68G clone or K65R/S68G clone [
