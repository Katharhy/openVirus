<p id="Par19">The FASTQC (version 0.11.5) software was used to evaluate the sequencing quality of the paired-end FASTQ sequence files. MiSeq data analysis was performed using HyDRA Web, an open web portal that offers an automated pipeline for the analysis of next-generation sequencing-derived data related to HIV drug resistance. Advanced options for data quality assurance, filtering, variant calling, and reporting thresholds were modified to customize the analysis. Reads were filtered using a minimum quality score of Q30 and 50 bp in length, an error rate of 0.0021 for the MiSeq platform, a minimum variant quality of Q30, a minimum read depth of 100×, and a minimum allele count of five. HIV-DRMs detected with a frequency &gt; 1% were reported based on the default HyDRA Web Mutation Database. This database is a combination of the Stanford 2015 list of HIV-1 DRMs with added annotations from the World Health Organization 2009 list of mutations for the surveillance of transmitted HIV drug resistance [
