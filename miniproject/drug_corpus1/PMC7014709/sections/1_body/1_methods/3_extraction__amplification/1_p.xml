<p id="Par18">Viral RNA was extracted from plasma using a QIAamp® RNA Blood Mini kit (Qiagen, Stanford, VA, USA). The partial pol gene (145 bp) was amplified using primers 503b-F (5′-CAAAAATTGGGCCTGAAAATCCATA-3′) and 52r-R (5′-TGTGGTATTCCTAATTGAACTTCCCA-3′) through nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR products were purified with an Agencourt AMPure™ kit (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA) and quantified using a Qubit® dsDNA BR Assay kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Subsequently, the PCR products were evaluated with a Bioanalyzer (2100; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) to control the size of the amplified fragments, and a library was constructed based on an input of 130–150 ng. A TruSeq™ Nano DNA HT Sample Preparation kit was employed for the construction of a DNA library (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The quality of library construction was monitored using a DNA 7500 kit (Agilent Technologies). The standardized libraries were incorporated into 50% quality-controlled PHIX Libraries (Miseq phix control v3; Illumina). Sequencing was performed after the qualification of all operations.</p>
