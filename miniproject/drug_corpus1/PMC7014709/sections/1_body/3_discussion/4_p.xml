<p id="Par31">We subsequently examined the phenotype of S68G. Svarovskaia evaluated the role of the S68G in combination with K65R in subtype B. The analysis revealed that S68G mutations partially restored the replication defect associated with the K65R mutation; however, it did not cause significant change in resistance of HIV-1 to NRTIs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In this study, we focused on the phenotype of S68G in the CRF01_AE virus. CRF01_AE virus had an obvious genetic difference on the pol gene compared with that of the subtype B virus. In addition, it occurred markedly more often in both treatment-naive patients and those who failed treatment than that of the subtype B virus. We used patient-derived pol gene fragment replacement for the construction of the mutant plasmid instead of site-directed mutagenesis on the basis of the subtype B standard plasmid to maintain the genetic background of the pol gene of CRF01_AE. We disclosed the minor role of the K65R mutation with and without S68G in susceptibility to NRTI. However, the S68G mutation helps to compensate the loss of replicative fitness, which is similar to that of subtype B.
