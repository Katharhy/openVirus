<p id="Par30">Moreover, previous studies showed that patients infected with subtype B and non-B subtype HIV-1, who failed ART and developed the K65R mutation, also acquired the S68G mutation [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, the unexpected high frequency of the S68G mutation in combination with the K65R mutation in the CRF01_AE strain has not been previously reported. Several studies have examined the evolution of the K65R and S68G mutations using standard testing for HIV drug resistance or molecular clones. However, the conclusions drawn from these investigations have been controversial. Ross et al. reported that mutations at position 68 followed the initial selection for K65R and M184 V mutations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Roge et al. found that five patients with the wild-type virus at baseline developed K65R at the time of failure, and four of those patients also acquired the S68G mutation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, Wirden et al. found that the S68G mutant was the dominant quasispecies, whereas K65R/S68G double mutant was the minor quasispecies. This finding suggested that the S68G mutation may not be linked to the K65R mutation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In the aforementioned studies, variants with a frequency &lt; 20% of the viral population could hardly be detected due to the limitation of Sanger sequencing, molecular clones, and PCR bias [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In this study, we performed next-generation sequencing to explore the evolutionary relationship between K65R and S68G mutations using longitudinal samples. This approach can detect viral quasispecies with frequencies as low as 1%, and generate more data than Sanger sequencing (1000s–10000s magnitude) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Therefore, we disclosed the temporal association between these two mutations among patients infected with CRF01_AE who failed treatment. Our results demonstrated that the frequency of the K65R/S68G double mutation was lower than that of the K65R mutation in vivo. Moreover, a time lag was detected between the occurrence of the S68G and K65R mutations. Hence, the K65R mutation may be induced first as the major mutation under the pressure of ART, while S68G may be an accessory mutation of K65R that is subsequently caused on the basis of the K65R mutation. We sought to investigate whether the preexistence of the S68G natural polymorphism prior to treatment could assist the development of the K65R mutation. We noticed that, in one patient with &gt; 90% quasispecies carrying the S68G mutation prior to treatment, the K65R mutation was not detected until 7 months post ART. This timing was later than that observed for the remaining three patients not carrying the S68G polymorphism prior to treatment, suggesting that the S68G mutation may not accelerate the development of the K65R mutation.
