<p id="Par28">In this study, we found that the S68G mutation was a common natural polymorphism in various subtypes of HIV-1, predominantly among CRF01_AE strains. The S68G mutation often occurred following the K65R mutation in patients infected with CRF01_AE who failed treatment. However, the pre-existence of the S68G natural polymorphism may not accelerate the occurrence of the K65R mutation. Although S68G did not directly alter the drug susceptibility of the virus, it compensated for the loss of replication fitness associated with the K65R mutation in CRF01_AE HIV-1.</p>
