<p id="Par32">The K65 residue is located on the key position of the deoxynucleoside triphosphate binding pocket and associated with the development of resistance to nucleoside analogs and polymerase fidelity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This residue confers resistance to numerous NRTIs by reducing the efficiency of NRTI incorporation. It has also been speculated that the K65R substitution improves the fidelity of the polymerase, thereby reducing the occurrence of several types of RT errors, including substitution and frameshift mutations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. It has been reported that the increase in polymerase fidelity may render the viral population less able to adapt to drug treatment and immune surveillance, and reduce replication fitness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Given the importance of K65 residues in the RT function of HIV-1, and the observed reduced fitness of the K65R mutant, the virus must evolve compensatory mutations against the impairment. With regard to patients who developed the K65R/S68G double mutation, restoration of the replication fitness of the virus through a compensatory mutation can help the virus survive under drug pressure, potentially leading to disease progression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Moreover, this adaptive evolution may shape HIV-1 at the population level, when these viruses contribute to epidemics through transmission. The resultant, potentially more virulent virus, could eventually modulate disease progression in newly infected hosts [
