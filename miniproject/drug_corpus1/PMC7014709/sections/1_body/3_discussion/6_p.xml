<p id="Par33">A limitation of this study is its small sample size. Owing to the high success rate of antiviral therapy in our cohort, only four patients with K65R/S68G double mutations were analyzed. Studies investigating a greater number of cases are warranted to elucidate the functional role of the S68G mutation. Nevertheless, this study provides evidence to aid the interpretation of DRMs in CRF01_AE strains.</p>
