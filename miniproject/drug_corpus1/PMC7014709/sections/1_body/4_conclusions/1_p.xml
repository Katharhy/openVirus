<p id="Par34">We deciphered the role of the S68G mutation in the HIV RT of CRF01_AE strains. Our study provides new evidence for the interpretation of DRMs in the CRF01_AE strain and non-B subtypes of HIV-1. The present study also suggests the presence of additional potential DRMs in the non-B subtypes of HIV-1. Further studies are required to evaluate the involvement of the HIV phenotypes in the development of drug resistance.</p>
