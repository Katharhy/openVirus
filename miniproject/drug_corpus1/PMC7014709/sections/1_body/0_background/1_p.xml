<p id="Par13">Interpretation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) drug resistance mutations (DRMs) is mainly based on phenotypic and genotypic studies of subtype-B, which accounts for ~â€‰12.1% of HIV infection cases worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Numerous patients infected with non-B subtype HIV-1 in developing countries receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) require more precise interpretation of DRMs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The high genetic diversity of HIV-1 poses great challenges to the interpretation of the genotyping of drug resistance.
