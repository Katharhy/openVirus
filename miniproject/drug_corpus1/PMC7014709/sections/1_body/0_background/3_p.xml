<p id="Par15">CRF01_AE is the first circulating recombinant form of HIV-1 identified worldwide. It originated from Central Africa, and accounts for 4.6% of the total number of HIV-1 infections worldwide [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. CRF01_AE may have distinctive characteristics on pathways related to natural polymorphisms and the development of DRM [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A preliminary study on CRF01_AE-infected patients, conducted in China by our research team, found that the frequency of the S68G mutation showed a 5.5% increase in patients who failed treatment. Moreover, the S68G mutation demonstrated a close link with the K65R mutation (unpublished data). The role of the S68G mutation in drug resistance and its relationship with the K65R mutation has yet to be elucidated. Thus, we conducted this study to: 1) explore the frequency of S68G mutation and K65R/S68G double mutation occurrence among various subtypes of HIV-1 worldwide; 2) ascertain the temporal association of S68G and K65R mutations among patients infected with CRF01_AE who failed treatment; and 3) understand the role of the S68G mutation in susceptibility to NRTI and viral replication when combined with the K65R mutation.
