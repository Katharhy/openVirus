<p id="Par14">Several studies have suggested that DRMs may not be fully consistent among different subtypes of HIV-1. For instance, HIV-1 strains of different subtypes can develop various “signature” DRMs under the same ART regimen [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Some studies have suggested that natural polymorphisms of the non-B subtypes of HIV-1 change their susceptibility to ART independently or in combination with other mutations [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Additional studies are warranted to elucidate the role of natural polymorphisms and certain treatment-associated mutations in the non-B subtypes of HIV-1.
