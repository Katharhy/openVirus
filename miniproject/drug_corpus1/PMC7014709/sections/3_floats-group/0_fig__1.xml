  <p>Temporal association of S68G and K65R mutations in individuals infected with CRF01_AE during antiretroviral treatment. 302335, 301844, 301770, and 301635 were four patients infected with CRF01_AE, in whom both the S68G and K65R mutations were detected after treatment failure. The pol sequences were studied in longitudinal plasma samples using next-generation sequencing. The black circle and triangle represent the percentages of K65R and S68G quasispecies, respectively</p>
