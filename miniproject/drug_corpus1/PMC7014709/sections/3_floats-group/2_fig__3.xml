  <p>Growth competition assay for the K65R and K65R/S68G infectious clones. The infectious clones of K65R and K65R/S68G obtained from patients were co-cultured for 13â€‰days in PBMCs with the following input ratios for K65R vs. K65R/S68G: 4:6 (
   <bold>a</bold>), 1:1 (
   <bold>b</bold>), and 9:1 (
   <bold>c</bold>). Viral RNA from culture supernatants was used to amplify target regions of pol genes, and these regions were subsequently sequenced. ChromatQuan (

The average of three independent experiments is shown, with error bars representing the SD
