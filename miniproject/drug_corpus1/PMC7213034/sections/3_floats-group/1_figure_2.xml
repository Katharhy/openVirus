  <p>Replication cycle of SARS CoV-2 in the host cell. Entry of the virus into the host cell is mediated through its interaction with Angiotensin converting enzyme receptor 2. The illustration summarises the potential sites of action of various drugs that are used in COVID -19. (A) Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine inhibits virus entry into the cell by changing the glycosylation of ACE receptor (B) Remdesivir and Favipiravir inhibit the RNA polymerase (C) Azithromycin inhibits mRNA expression and protein production, it is also immunomodulatory and decreases inflammatory response (D) Ivermectin inhibits the interaction between the viral integrase protein (IN) and the importin (IMP) α/β1 heterodimer responsible for IN nuclear import (Not shown as a part of viral replication cycle). (E) Lopinavir, Ritonavir inhibit the protease enzyme</p>
