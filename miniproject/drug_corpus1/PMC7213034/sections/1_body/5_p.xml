<p>81% of the infected patients are mildly symptomatic, 14% are severely symptomatic and 5% are critically ill. The most common manifestations of the infection include fever (92.8%), cough (69.8%), difficulty in breathing (34.5%), myalgia (27.7%), headache (7.2%), and diarrhoea (6.1%). The severity and complications of the disease are significantly higher in the elderly population. Age-dependent changes in the functions of T- and B- lymphocytes lead to excessive production of type 2 cytokines resulting in prolonged inflammatory response and cytokine storm that might explain the severity in the elderly. Severe manifestations of the respiratory system include pneumonia, ARDS. Other manifestations include sepsis, acute kidney injury, arrhythmia, acute cardiac injury, coagulopathy, and shock.[
