<p>Coronaviruses are a group of single-stranded RNA (positive) viruses [
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>] belonging to the subfamily 
 <italic>Coronavirinae</italic> (
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family). Based on genomic sequencing the subfamily 
 <italic>Coronavirinae</italic> is further subdivided into four genera â€” 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Gammacoronavirus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Deltacoronavirus</italic>.[
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Over the last 20 years, 
 <italic>betacoronavirus</italic> genera have produced two epidemics SARS CoV (2002-03), MERS CoV (2014-16).[
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] An acute respiratory illness broke out in Wuhan, China in December 2019. A novel virus belonging to the genera 
 <italic>betacoronavirus</italic> found to be causing this disease Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID- 19)) is presently classified as severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. On February 1, 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern. On the day of writing this editorial (04/04/2020), SARS-CoV-2 has infected 1,083,211 patients worldwide and 3,108 patients were infected in India. The case fatality rate of SARS CoV is 14-15%, MERS CoV is 35% and the rate of SARS- CoV- 2 is around 2.5% suggesting that SARS- CoV- 2 is less deadly than its cousins as on date.[
