<p>With the help, many novel methods like affinity purification-mass spectrometry, 29 viral proteins of SARS- CoV- 2 making 332 high confidence human protein-protein interactions are identified. These protein-protein interactome studies along with a combination of a systematic chemoinformatic drug search with a pathway centric analysis around 70 drugs that can be utilized to treat SARS-CoV- 2 have been identified and these compounds are now being tested for their efficacy against the virus.[
