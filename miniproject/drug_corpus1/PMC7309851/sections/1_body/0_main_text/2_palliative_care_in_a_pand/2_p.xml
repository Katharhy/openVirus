<p id="p0030">Palliative care is ideally situated to help patients, families, and other clinicians through the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 is a serious and often fatal illness that can lead to significant symptoms, particularly at the end of life. Patients and families are forced to make decisions that will have profound implications for the longevity and quality of their lives. Clear, empathetic communication; medical decision making; and complex symptom management are the hallmarks of our discipline. As COVID has torn through our cities, palliative care clinicians have worked to facilitate goal-concordant treatment decisions and, when necessary, to provide compassionate, evidence-based end-of-life care.</p>
