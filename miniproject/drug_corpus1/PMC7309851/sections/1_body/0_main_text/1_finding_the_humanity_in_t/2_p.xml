<p id="p0015">Weeks into the COVID-19 stay-at-home order, I hit a milestone in my cancer journey: my first post-treatment follow-up. Unsurprisingly, it took place virtually. You might assume that as a Millennial (yes, I was one of those rare cases of breast cancer under 30), the transition to digital would have been easyâ€”but I was just as prone to technical difficulties and the anxieties of remote surveillance. I have no doubt that as telehealth becomes standard, we will develop strategies for making things run more smoothly.</p>
