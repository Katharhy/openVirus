<p id="p0020">My biggest takeaway, however? To make telehealth work for patients, we have to think beyond the short amount of time spent on screen together. In-person appointments have rituals built into them: the drive to the office, sitting in the waiting room, a meal afterward. Now, an individual could easily log in and out only to find themselves left, in silence, to sit with their own thoughts. I’ve recommended to fellow patients that they schedule around their virtual visit, making plans to go for a walk or to have Zoom dinner with a caretaker. I believe that telehealth can, and will, change things for the better, but only if we keep in mind the full—and fundamentally human—arc of the patient experience, regardless of whether we’re in an office or on a screen.</p>
