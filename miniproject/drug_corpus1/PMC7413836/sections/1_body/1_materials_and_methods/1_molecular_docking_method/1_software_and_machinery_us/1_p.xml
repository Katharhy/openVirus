<p id="Par4"> All docking studies were performed and characterized by the MOE "Molecular Operating Environment" program. Drug preparation was compiled through ChemDraw, 3D structures were constructed using Chem 3D ultra 12.0 software (Molecular Modeling and Analysis; Cambridge Soft Corporation), then they were energetically minimized using MOPAC and saved as MDL MolFile (*.mol). All calculations were carried out on an Intel(R) Core(TM)i7, 3.8Â GHz-based machine running MS Windows 10 as the operating system(Mubarak et al.
