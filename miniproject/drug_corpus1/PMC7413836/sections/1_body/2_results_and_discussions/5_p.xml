<p id="Par11"> In conclusion, molecular modeling tools were used to screen for potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic agents. After a virtual screening against SARS-CoV-2 protease and ACE2 receptor, a set of antivirals, antimalarials, and antimicrobials drugs showed a potent binding interaction, wherein biocidofovir was the top hit. Therefore, repurposing of biocidofovir against COVID-19 disease is suggested for clinical trials.</p>
