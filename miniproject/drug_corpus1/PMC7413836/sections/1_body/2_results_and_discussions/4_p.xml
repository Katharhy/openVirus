<p id="Par10">Lastly, while we were working in this research, an Australian study showed that 
 <italic>ivermectin</italic>, an antiparasitic drug, was effective against COVID-19 disease, although further clinical trials are underway to confirm this effectiveness (Caly et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>). We decided to do some investigations using molecular docking to check the binding interaction between ivermectin and the SARS-CoV-2 protease and receptor. We got comparable data to the antiviral 
 <italic>Brincidofovir</italic> where the docking scores were -10.31 and -8.84 with the SARS-CoV-2 protease and ACE2 receptor (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>), respectively. But overall, brincidofovir is better recommended because for its high lipophilicity “5.54”, whereas for ivermectin it is “2.01”.
