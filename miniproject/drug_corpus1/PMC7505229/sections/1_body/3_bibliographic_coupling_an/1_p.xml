<p id="Par23">Bibliographic coupling of the studies on SARS, MERS and Covid-19 were analysed at the level of their sources/journals. FiguresÂ 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref> show the maps of journal bibliographic coupling associated with SARS, MERS and Covid-19 literatures respectively. The node sizes are proportional to the number of documents published by the corresponding sources and the thickness of the links are proportional to the degree of bibliographic couplings between the pairs of sources connected by each link. The minimum number of documents associated with each node/journal to appear on the map has been set to 10. The number has been set on the basis of maximising clarity of the resultant clusters on the maps. No minimum strength was set for links to be visualised on the map.
