<p id="Par26">A prominent source that seem to have consistently published a substantial portion of studies on SARS and MERS is 
 <italic>Journal of Virology</italic>. This journal, however, has not published a considerable number of studies on Covid-19, and with only 8 publications on this topic at the time of writing this article, it does not have a strong representation on the map of Covid-19. 
 <italic>The Lancet</italic> and 
 <italic>Science</italic>, however, are two major outlets notably identifiable on all three maps. For Covid-19 studies in particular, journals such as 
 <italic>Journal of Medical Virology</italic>, 
 <italic>The BMJ</italic>, 
 <italic>The Lancet</italic>, 
 <italic>Journal of Infection</italic>, 
 <italic>Science</italic>, 
 <italic>Nature</italic>, 
 <italic>Science of the Total Environment</italic> and 
 <italic>Medical Hypotheses</italic> have been most notable outlets of publications so far. Some of these outlasts, such as 
 <italic>Science of the Total Environment</italic> and 
 <italic>Medical Hypotheses</italic>, do not have a strong representation on the maps associated with the SARS or MERS.
