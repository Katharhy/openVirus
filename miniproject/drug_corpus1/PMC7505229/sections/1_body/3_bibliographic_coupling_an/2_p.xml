<p id="Par24">A first-glance comparison shows that while the maps associated with SARS and MERS are well connected, connections across the Covid-19 map are rather sparse. Both the SARS and MERS maps include three distinct and well-defined clusters of bibliographically coupled journals in addition to one minor and smaller cluster. These clusters show relatively strong degrees of inter-connectivity and coherence, whereas, this feature is not shared by the Covid-19 map. The observation is understandable considering the fact that the SARS and MERS literatures are relatively well established and have stabilised given that they have both been under development over a period of several years, whereas the Covid-19 literature is an emerging and evolving field. Newly published Covid-19 studies do not seem to be sharing many references as of yet, which explains why their coupling connections are relatively weak. The comparison also suggests that the Covid-19 studies are generally scattered across a broader variety of journals and subject areas, as opposed to the SARS and MERS publications that seem to have been concentrated across a smaller set of specialty (mostly medical) journals. This is also consistent with our observations from Figs.

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> showing explicitly that studies of Covid-19 are scattered across a broader variety of subject areas compared to the SARS and MERS literatures. Though not shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, due to the respective values being smaller than 1%, journals in the following subject areas (those that are deemed minor areas in relation to Covid-19 literature) have each published a relatively considerable number of studies on this topic (a feature that is not necessarily shared by the rest of the literature on coronaviruses): Arts and Humanities (110 items,
