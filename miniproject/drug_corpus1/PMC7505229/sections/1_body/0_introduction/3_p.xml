<p id="Par5">In the face of the flood of scholarly outputs on Covid-19, and along with the conventional review and research synthesis studies (Chang et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2020</xref>; Cortegiani et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>) and bibliometric methods (Bonilla-Aldana et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>; Hossain 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>) have also gained traction in documenting and analysing the rapid developments of this literature and discovering emerging patterns (Chahrour et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>; Dehghanbanadaki et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2020</xref>; Haghani et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2020</xref>; Le Bras et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2020</xref>). Here in this work, the literatures of these three major coronavirus diseases are disentangled from one another and analysed in a comparative way and from scientometric perspectives. The aim is to discover possible similarities and discrepancies across these three segments of the coronavirus literature, and to discover whether there are recurring patterns in terms of magnitude, temporal evolution and the structure of these three literatures that were each developed in response to a respiratory disease outbreak. The main focus of the analyses is on keyword co-occurrences, bibliographic coupling and citation relations of sources and collaborations between countries.
