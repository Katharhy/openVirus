<p id="Par19">The economic aspects of the epidemics also seem to have been addressed particularly by Covid-19 as reflected in Cluster (i) of the Covid-19 literature. These have been reflected in terms such as “

This could be explained by the greater magnitude of the societal impact of Covid-19 outbreak compared to SARS and MERS.
