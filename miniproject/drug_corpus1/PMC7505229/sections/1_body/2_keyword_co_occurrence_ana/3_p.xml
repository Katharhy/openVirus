<p id="Par18">The Cluster (i) of keywords also have distinctly and commonly (across all three datasets) represented keywords that are attributable to the studies on mental health impacts of the epidemic. These are keywords such as “
 <italic>mental health (service)</italic>”, “
 <italic>psychiatry</italic>”, “
 <italic>psychology</italic>”, “
 <italic>mental stress</italic>”, “
 <italic>anxiety</italic>”, “
 <italic>fear</italic>”, “
 <italic>mental disease</italic>”. These studies have often used methods such as “
 <italic>questionnaire(s)</italic>” and “
 <italic>survey(s)</italic>” that have commonly reflected in this cluster across the three literatures. Issues surrounding the safety of medical facilities and medical staff also appear to have been addressed mainly by studies whose keywords are attributable to this cluster. These studies have generated keywords such as “
 <italic>health care personnel</italic>”, “
 <italic>nurse(s)</italic>”, “
 <italic>medical staff</italic>”, “
 <italic>hospital</italic>”, “
 <italic>health care facility</italic>”, “
 <italic>personal protective equipment</italic>” that are distinctively observable in Cluster (i) of keywords across all three datasets.
