<p id="Par32">Comparison across the three maps of co-authorships shows a pattern of author involvement from the regions where each viral outbreak originated. Studies authored by researchers affiliated with Chinese institutes are well represented in all three cases, but clearly more so with respect to the SARS and Covid-19 literature, diseases whose first cases were recorded in China. The involvement of Chinese authors is relatively less pronounced with respect to the MERS studies whose origin was in the Middle East. Instead, with respect to the MERS literature, it appears that authors affiliated with institutes in Saudi Arabia have been exceptionally overrepresented in the publications. This is also, to a lesser extent, the case with Egypt being markedly presented on the MERS map of the country co-authorships.</p>
