<p id="Par35">The Covid-19 map presents a considerably higher number of country names compared to maps of the SARS and MERS literatures. It clearly shows that authors from a larger number of countries have become involved in studies of Covid-19, compared to the research on SARS and MERS that have apparently engaged a lesser number of countries and institutes. China, on the topic of Covid-19, has a very well spread and rather more evenly distributed network of collaborations with countries across the world, when compared with its network of collaboration on SARS and MERS. While its strongest collaboration has been with the United States, the names of many other countries appear on its network with no particular country standing out distinctly. Italy, as a country that was highly affected by the Covid-19 outbreak, has been exceptionally well represented on this map with a very strong link of collaboration with the United States, followed by United Kingdom at a smaller scale. This pattern of exceptional representation of highly affected countries on the maps has to a lesser extent extended to Iran, Spain, France and Brazil as countries severely affected by the Covid-19 outbreak at early stages of the global spread.</p>
