<p id="Par36">According to the colour coding of the maps, SARS studies in which authors affiliated with the institutes in the Netherlands were involved have, on average, received the highest number of citations. This is followed by studies of authors from Germany. These are two countries whose authors have published considerable number of documents on SARS and received high number of citations at the same time. This pattern was, to some extent, repeated in relation to the MERS literature, with studies from the Netherlands, Germany and United Kingdom having received, on average, the highest number of citations. For studies published on Covid-19, publications from China have so far stood out in terms of both the magnitude of research activities and the average number of citations.</p>
