<p id="Par14">Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b shows the temporal distribution of the studies on the general topic of coronaviruses. The graph clearly shows spikes of publication coinciding with the years when SARS, MERS and Covid-19 outbreaks took place. The first spike is related to the SARS outbreak in 2002 which is reflected in an immediate and substantial increase in the number of publications on coronaviruses from 2002 to 2003. The increase continued, though at a slower pace, to 2004 and was then followed by a gradual decline till 2012. The 2012 MERS outbreak triggered another spike in the number of publications on coronaviruses, though not as large as that of SARS. The intensification of attention to this topic, this time, lasted for about three years till 2015 before another decline began. The spike of coronavirus studies prompted by the Covid-19 outbreak, however, seem to have been occurring at a completely different scale which can be deemed unprecedented in the history of coronavirus studies, and perhaps arguably in the history of science. The number of studies emerged in the first five months of 2020 nears an equivalent of the 70% of the total size of the coronavirus literature accumulated during more than 50 years (1968–2019). In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c, the temporal distribution of the SARS, MERS and Covid-19 studies have been shown separately according to the three datasets explained earlier. Note that, the quantities associated with SARS and MERS are represented by the left vertical axis whereas that of Covid-19 is represented by the right vertical axis, while its scale is ten times bigger than the scale of the left axis.
