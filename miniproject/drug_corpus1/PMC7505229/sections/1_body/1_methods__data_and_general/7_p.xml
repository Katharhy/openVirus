<p id="Par12">Full records of the three datasets on SARS, MERS and Covid-19 were retrieved in 
 <italic>CSV Excel</italic> format from Scopus, all on the same day. This included the citation information, bibliographic information, abstract and keywords, funding details and the references. The Scopus restriction of maximum 2000 document per export posed challenges for the retrieval of the SARS and Covid-19 datasets whose size were bigger than 2000 documents. For the SARS dataset, the challenge was circumvented by further limiting the search to specific years, in separate bundles, in a way that the size of each bundle was less than 2000 items, therefore allowing us to export the items of each bundle separately. The extraction of the Covid-19 dataset, however, posed a further layer of complication. Given that nearly all studies of Covid-19 have been published in one year, i.e. 2020, the year of publication could no longer be used as a criterion to form a set of mutually exclusive exportable bundles. To decompose the search outcome to non-overlapping bundles of 2000 documents or less, the following strategy was devised. The 
 <italic>Document Type</italic> was used to initially limit the search to mutually exclusive (non-overlapping) categories. First, the search was limited to “
 <italic>Review</italic> or 
 <italic>Short Survey</italic> or 
 <italic>Erratum</italic> or 
 <italic>Conference Paper</italic> or 
 <italic>Data paper</italic>”. This formed a set of 1267 documents which was extracted in one single export (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a for details of the number of items within each 
 <italic>Document Type</italic> category). Subsequently, the search was set back to the original and was limited to 
 <italic>Notes</italic> (1067 items) and then to 
 <italic>Editorial</italic> (1270 items). Each of these two subsets, being smaller than 2000 items, were exported separately. There were also 2564 documents of 
 <italic>Letter</italic> type. This set was further decomposed to two mutually exclusive subsets based on the 
 <italic>Publication Stage</italic> criterion (1539 
 <italic>Article in Press</italic>, and 1025 
 <italic>Final</italic>) and was retrieved in two separate exports. For the remaining 5691 
 <italic>Article</italic> documents, the following strategy was adopted. Of the 5691 items, 2944 were 
 <italic>Article in Press</italic> and 2747 were 
 <italic>Final</italic>. First, the 2944 
 <italic>Article in Press</italic> items were considered. The list of those studies was sorted as 
 <italic>First Author (A-Z)</italic> and the first 2000 items were extracted in one export. Then the list was sorted as 
 <italic>First Author (Z-A)</italic>, i.e. the order was reversed, and the first 944 items were exported. A similar strategy was utilised to extract the remaining 2747 
 <italic>Final</italic> documents.
