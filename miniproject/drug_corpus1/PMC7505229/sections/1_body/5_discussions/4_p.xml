<p id="Par40">By retrieving and disentangling the literatures linked to these three respiratory diseases, we sought to discover similarities and discrepancies of their research landscape from scientometric perspectives. The most interesting pattern was the recurrence of three distinct clusters of studies in each literature as suggested by keyword co-occurrence analyses. It appeared that, following each outbreak, an early cluster of studies first emerged, addressing issues attributable to the public emergency management aspects of a pandemic, such as prediction of disease propagation, measures of outbreak control, public policy making, and concerns related to the protection of medical professionals and mental health. Accordingly, as a result of these three outbreaks, three significant cohort of studies related to health emergency management have already emerged, which, if synthesised effectively, could constitute a valuable and evidence-based guide to help government and communities better prepare for and react to possible future disease outbreaks, at least of those of the respiratory nature.</p>
