<p id="Par43">The questions of where the Covid-19 literature is headed, how big it will grow in the next coming months/years, at what point in time the rate of publications on this topic is going to slow down and how widely this literature is going to spread across journals and subject categories are just a few examples of questions that will only be determined by time. These scholarly patterns may also be influenced by future success or failure of countries in controlling the extent of the surge and re-surge of outbreaks and by possible medical discoveries in relation to vaccine and treatment. But given the pace at which scholarly outputs are currently emerging, the number of under-review preprints, the extent of studies and clinical trials that have already been conceived around the world; and also considering the seemingly long-lasting and far-reaching consequences of this global emergency that have impacted on aspects of life, it will probably not be so soon before we observe a decline in Covid-19 research interest.</p>
