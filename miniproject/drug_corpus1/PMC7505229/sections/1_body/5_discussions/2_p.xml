<p id="Par38">An analysis of the timeline of the development of publications on coronaviruses made clear that the SARS outbreak constitutes the first major milestone in the history of this research, an event that brought a then-unprecedented amount of attention to this topic. While Scopus has indexed a total of nearly 4400 studies on coronaviruses from 1968 to 2002, the three immediate years post SARS outbreak (i.e. November 2002) have each recorded nearly 1000 coronavirus publications. This means that following the SARS outbreak, the then 36Â years old literature of coronaviruses almost expanded by 70% within only three years. This trend, however, did not persist and did not extend to the years succeeding 2005, as from 2005 onwards, a gradual decline in the rate of publications on coronaviruses began. This continued until the 2012 MERS outbreak, another event that reinvigorated the coronavirus research, though not as substantially as that of the SARS epidemic. The pattern of a few years of increase in research activities on coronaviruses followed by a gradual decline, which had occurred in relation to SARS, also repeated itself in a similar fashion after the MERS outbreak.</p>
