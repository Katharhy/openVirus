<p id="Par41">Citation and bibliographic coupling analysis at the level of journals demonstrated that firstly, Covid-19 studies are scattered across a broader variety of sources and subject categories, and secondly, its network of journal relations is still not as cohesive as those of the SARS and MERS literatures. As the literature on Covid-19 further develops, more cohesive patterns of bibliographic coupling or journal citations may form. While 
 <italic>Journal of Virology</italic> and 
 <italic>Emerging Infectious Diseases</italic> seem to have been two major outlets commonly prominent across both SARS and MERS literatures, their presence in the literature of Covid-19 seem to not be distinctly notable. Instead, a great portion of Covid-19 studies have concentrated across three journals: 
 <italic>The Lancet</italic>, 
 <italic>The BMJ</italic>, and 
 <italic>Journal of Medical Virology</italic>. While major multidisciplinary journals, particularly 
 <italic>Science</italic>, 
 <italic>Nature</italic>, 
 <italic>PNAS</italic> and 
 <italic>PLOS ONE</italic>, have, to varying degrees, been active in publishing studies on all three topics, their influence is most notable in relation to the SARS literature where they have published a substantial portion of studies. Those studies happen to have been recipients of relatively high number of citations.
