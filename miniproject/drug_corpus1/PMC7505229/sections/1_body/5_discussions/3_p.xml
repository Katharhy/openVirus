<p id="Par39">The outbreak of 2019 Novel Coronavirus, however, marks a unique milestone in this timeline. The magnitude of scholarly outputs prompted by this novel virus was to the extent that, in less than five months, 12,000 publications was already indexed by Scopus, a number that nearly equals 70% of the total amount of literature generated on coronaviruses during the 50 years of this research prior to 2020. In fact, since April 2020, we have made five consistent recordings of the number of Scopus-listed publications linked to Covid-19 at five cross-sections of time, the last of which representing our Scopus search on 21 July 2020 as the revision of this article was being drafted. This set of records may give an approximation for the current rate of accumulation of studies on this topic. According to Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">17</xref> that visualises these records, the trend seems to be rather linear, although the rate seems to have increased since May 2020. Our very latest Scopus search on 21 July 2020 showed that the number has reached 30,400 items. If the current trend continues, then by the end of 2020, approximately another 50,000 articles could be expected on this topic, making the total size of this literature exceed 80,000 items. A conservative projection could be obtained using the rate of accumulation associated with the time period between April and May 2020, the earlier stage of the emergence of studies on this topic. This would yield an estimate of approximately 70,000 publications by the end of 2020.
