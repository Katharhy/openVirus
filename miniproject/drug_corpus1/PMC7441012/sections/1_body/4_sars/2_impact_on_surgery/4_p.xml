 </xref> As SARS-CoV became better understood and diagnostic tests became available, elective procedures in patients without SARS-CoV were progressively restarted, with logistical adjustments. Disposable equipment was used whenever possible and dedicated routes and elevators were used for patient transport. Patients with probable or unknown contact with SARS-CoV underwent surgery in designated SARS-CoV operating rooms, which underwent structural modifications to minimize contaminated air outflow.

 </xref> ORs were decontaminated after every operation, and 1-hour intervals between procedures were mandated to dilute airborne contaminants. All contact episodes between OR staff and patients were recorded to facilitate contact tracing, and a dedicated nurse oversaw strict adherence to all infectious control measures. Guidance on enhanced PPE and OR logistics developed during the SARS outbreak later informed response to the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2012.

 </xref> The SARS outbreak demonstrated how systemic responses to highly infectious diseases must be flexible. The cancellation of elective operation and implementation of enhanced PPE highlighted the importance of adaptive infection control measures.
