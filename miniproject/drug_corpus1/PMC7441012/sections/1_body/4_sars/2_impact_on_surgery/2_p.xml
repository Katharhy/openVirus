<p id="p0085">Hospitals in Toronto and Singapore exemplified adaptive infectious control practices. In Toronto, an investigation identified several opportunities for infection: bilevel positive airway pressure and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation emitting respiratory droplets; a lack of adequate sedation that resulted in patient agitation and coughing; and a repeated requirement to clean copious secretions from obstructed ventilator tubing.

 </xref> The Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care responded by mandating additional protections for high-risk airway management situations, including a covered helmet with a respirator and a full-length gown worn over standard personal protective equipment (PPE).

 </xref> For example, in a small case series of 3 patients with SARS- CoV, providers attempted to prevent aerosolizing viral particles during tracheostomy by minimizing diathermy, ensuring full paralysis, and stopping mechanical ventilation once the airway was entered.
