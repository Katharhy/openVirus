 </xref> In 1988, the AMA issued a "zero-risk" policy, stating that if risk of transmission of an infectious disease from physician to patient exists, disclosure of the risk to patients is inadequate. Patients should expect that their physicians will not increase their risk of contracting an infectious disease, even minimally.

 </xref> Present-day policies regarding physicians with HIV/AIDS became established after a decade of evidence showing that provider-to-patient transmission of HIV is exceedingly rare. Today, surgeons with HIV/AIDS may continue to practice and perform invasive procedures unless there is clear evidence of an inability to meet basic infection control procedures, or the surgeon is functionally unable to care for patients.

 </xref> The HIV/AIDS epidemic raised ethical debates regarding the surgeons' duty to treat patients at the risk of their own health. The principles of accepting a reasonable level of risk and not discriminating based on seropositivity have prevailed.
