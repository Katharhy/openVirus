<p id="Par8">It is unclear why Asia has never reported endemic YFV transmission, despite similar flaviviruses (such as DENV and Zika virus) circulating in this region. However, Asia is home to over 4 billion individuals, contains widespread prevalence of the YF mosquito vector (
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>), and has no heard immunity against YFV (due to lack of natural circulation and vaccination) [

Despite mandatory YF immunization requirements at least 10 days prior to travel to YFV-endemic regions outlined by the International health regulations (IHR), 5/11 of the Chinese workers had no YF vaccination record, while 4/11 had been vaccinated &lt; 14 days of acquiring symptoms [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. As links between Asia and Africa and/or South America increase, the threat of YFV spreading to Asia becomes real. Therefore, there is an urgent need to invest in research for new YFV rapid diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. Furthermore, as part of YFV epidemic preparedness, it is essential that Asian countries also strengthen YFV surveillance, implement mosquito elimination programs, and put in place measures to rapidly manufacture and deploy vaccines.
