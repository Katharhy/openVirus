 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Subsequently, widespread mass vaccination campaigns and mosquito control efforts significantly reduced YF outbreaks. Past public health successes led to a lax in maintaining local YF vaccination coverage leading to waning herd immunity and an eventual re-emergence of large outbreaks in West Africa in the 2000s [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This promoted a collaborative effort by the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), and 47 YFV endemic countries to create the Yellow Fever Initiative (YFI) in 2006 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], an initiative that was primarily focused on mass YF vaccination campaigns and introduction of the vaccine into childhood immunization programs in high-risk regions. In an emergency preparedness effort, the new initiative also set up a global stockpile of YF vaccines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. While the implementation of YFI eliminated YF outbreaks, this was short-lived as the emergence of major YF outbreaks in 2016 in regions not previously characterized as high-risk for YF cast doubts on the YFI strategy [
