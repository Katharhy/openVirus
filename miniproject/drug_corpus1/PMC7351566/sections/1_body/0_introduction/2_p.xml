<p id="Par3">The complex transmission pattern of YFV between humans, non-human primates, and its mosquito vector has shaped the epidemiology of YF. Genotypes and transmission patterns of YFV are highly divergent between Africa and South America [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In South America, YFV strains circulate in two different cycles (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>), i.e., (1) a sylvatic cycle between non-human primates (NHP) and rainforest-dwelling mosquitoes of the 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species, and (2) an urban cycle where rare opportunistic forest mosquito-feeding events lead to YFV infection of humans and spread through the urban human population via the urbanized mosquito, 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. Africa observes an additional YFV transmission cycle known as the intermediate cycle (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>), where anthropophilic mosquitoes in the savannah regions feed on both NHPs and humans leading to constant transmission of YFV between mosquito, NHPs, and humans [
