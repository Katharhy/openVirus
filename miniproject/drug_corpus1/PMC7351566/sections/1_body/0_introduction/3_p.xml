<p id="Par4">YFV exists as seven genotypes (or major lineages), with 5 circulating in Africa and 2 in South America. Phylogenetic studies show that the African lineages have a common ancestor that then spread to discrete geographical locations and further evolved to establish the five genotypes: (1) West African I, (2) West African II, (3) East and Central African, (4) East African, and (5) Angola [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The South American genotypes I and II are thought to have evolved from the West African strains during the time of the slave trade when YFV spread to the Americas [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Due to slow evolutionary rates and constant spillover, the phylogeny of YFV isolates from NHP are genetically similar to isolates from human outbreaks [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Consequently, in South America, regular surveillance of YFV outbreaks in NHP populations can be used as an epidemic preparedness strategy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In addition to active surveillance, elimination of future YF outbreaks requires a comprehensive understanding of the current epidemiology and the influence of control and prevention methods, such as vaccination.
