<p id="Par2">Yellow fever (YF) is a re-emerging acute viral disease that less than a century ago was considered the most dangerous infectious disease in the world [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. YF is caused by the etiological agent, yellow fever virus (YFV), which belongs to the 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic> genus of arboviruses. YFV exists in circulation between humans, non-human primates (NHPs), and several species of mosquito vectors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The presence of epizootic transmission means that YFV cannot be eradicated from the world. However, preventative vaccination campaigns with live-attenuated YFV vaccines along with widespread mosquito elimination programs have proven to be efficient at substantially reducing YF cases and outbreaks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Individuals infected with YFV can present with a wide spectrum of symptoms, ranging from asymptomatic infections to death, with severe cases displaying high fever, dysfunction of multiple organs (including the liver, kidneys, and heart), or hemorrhage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The ratio of subclinical (i.e., asymptomatic to mild symptoms) to severe cases is estimated to be 1–70, indicating that severe cases represent only “the tip of the iceberg” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Mathematical models have also predicted over 200,000 annual cases of YF in high-risk areas, with case fatalities ranging from 20 to 80% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, due to the sporadic nature of YF outbreaks, the lack of rapid diagnostics, and the high serological cross-reactivity among co-circulating flaviviruses has meant that confirmed diagnosis is limited to reference laboratories where viral RNA can be detected using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>•, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Therefore, quantifying the true global burden of YF disease and infections has been challenging.
