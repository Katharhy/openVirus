  <title>tertiary structure and catalytic site of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) PL
   <sup>pro</sup> (PDB 6W9C, 2.7 Å). (A) The monomer is represented with transparent VdW surface and opaque ribbons, coloured by domains: finger (cyan), palm (pink) and thumb (green). The Ubl domain is represented in dark gray ribbon. (B) Amino acid residues of the catalytic triad (Cys145, His272 and Asp286) are represented in sticks coloured by CPK (carbons in yellow). The Cys145 is located in the thumb domain (green) while His272 and Asp286 are located in the palm domain (pink).
