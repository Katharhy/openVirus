  <title>tertiary structure of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) Nsp14 (PDB 5C8S, 3.3 Å) in complex with its Nsp10 cofactor (yellow VdW surface). Nsp14 is represented as ribbons coloured according to its domains: Methyltransferase (MTD, light green) and exoribonuclease (ExoN, blue). Zn2+ and Mg2+ ions are shown as gray and magenta spheres, respectively. The Nsp10 cofactor interacts with the Nsp14 ExoN domain.
