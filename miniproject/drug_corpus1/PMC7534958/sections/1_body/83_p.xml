Nowadays, (39) has been investigated as a drug that could be used in the treatment of COVID 19 patients, since its anti-inflammatory activity could minimise inflammatory complications in COVID 19 patients. According to the platform ClinicalTrials.gov, there are 14 ongoing clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Baricitinib (39) in the treatment of COVID 19.
