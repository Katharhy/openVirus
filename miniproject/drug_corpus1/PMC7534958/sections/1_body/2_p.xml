 </xref> The results showed that the viral RNA level in ventilated patient wards was low because of segregation and high air exchange rate. Conversely, in toilets, which were not ventilated, and medical staff areas had elevated concentrations of airborne viral RNA. After rigorous sanitisation procedures these levels were reduced. Therefore the authors showed that room ventilation, disinfection and sanitisation are important measures to be implemented in hospitals.
