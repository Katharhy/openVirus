 <italic>Synthetic scalability and cost-effectiveness</italic> - The synthetic pathways described above show how much improvement has been done concerning the preparation of these drugs in a more cost-effective way. Furthermore, when comparing the drugs discussed above, it is worth pointing out which one could be the easiest one to produce when analysing the factors that influence the final cost of a synthetic pathway, such as chiral centres, cost of starting materials, number of steps and overall yield. Regarding chiral centres, ritonavir (2) and lopinavir (1) have four chiral centres each, and they are not sold as racemate mixtures. Moreover, to synthesise those compounds the chiral centres do not come from natural molecules, but have to be synthetically installed, which makes the chiral starting materials more expensive and enantiomeric excess has to be accessed more carefully at the end of the synthetic pathway. As a consequence, it can take longer and more expensive to obtain the final product. On the other hand, baricitinib (39) does not have any chiral centres, making the synthetic pathway easier and cheaper to perform. Concerning the number of steps and overall yield, baricitinib (39) has the highest number of steps and lower overall yield when compared to ritonavir (2) and lopinavir (1). However, one of the steps in the synthesis of baricitinib (39) can be performed under flow conditions, which is very interesting from the industrial point of view. Therefore, when taking into account the most recent synthetic pathways proposed for these drugs, the synthesis of baricitinib (39) is the most cost-effective of the three of them.
