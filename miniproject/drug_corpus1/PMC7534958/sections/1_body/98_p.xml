<p>Remdesivir (8), CQ (20)/HCQ (26) (alone or in association with other drugs) and the association lopinavir (1)/ritonavir (2) have been the focus of most clinical studies. So far, results have been mostly disappointing with these trials, stressing the importance of carefully performed studies in patients to attest that biological activities observed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> actually be translated into clinical efficacy and safety. At the moment, even with limited information about safety and effectiveness, remdesivir is the only drug approved by the FDA for emergency use on severe COVID-19. As discussed here, a major concern with drugs for effectively fighting the pandemic is the drug’s industrial production cost and its impact on final treatment cost. Gilead, remdesivir’s owner company, has recently signed non-exclusive voluntary licensing agreements with five generic pharmaceutical manufacturers to produce remdesivir for distribution in 127 countries, nearly all low-income and lower-middle income countries. Hopefully, based on the constantly growing scientific knowledge summarised in this review, other treatment options will be revealed soon enough to help stop the havoc caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
