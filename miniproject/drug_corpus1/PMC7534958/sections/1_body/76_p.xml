<p>Ritonavir (2)/lopinavir (1) plus interferon-beta, a cytokine involved in inflammatory modulation, is the last bet of the SOLIDARITY megatrial. Sheahan et al. demonstrated that this combination improves pulmonary function but does not reduce virus replication or severe lung pathology in mice model of MERS-CoV.

 </xref> The study (NCT04276688) administered ritonavir (2)/lopinavir (1) 400 mg + 100 mg/ml twice daily for 14 days and Interferon beta-1b 0.25 mg subcutaneous, every alternate day for 14 days. Another study (NCT04343768) will perform a randomised trial to verify the effects of interferon beta 1a, compared to interferon beta 1b and the base therapeutic treatment in Moderate to Severe COVID-19.
