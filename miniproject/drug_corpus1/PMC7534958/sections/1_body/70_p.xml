<p>Remdesivir (8), a nucleoside analogue that acts by inhibiting RNA synthesis, is already in clinical studies for treatment of COVID-19.

 </xref> This prodrug was already investigated in clinical trial testing for Ebola virus with no effect but showed efficiency against different types of coronaviruses in cell culture and animal models.

 </xref> From the drugs in the SOLIDARITY trial, remdesivir (8) has the best potential to be used in clinics, having a low toxicity profile to humans.

 </xref> This molecule was used compassionately in the first COVID-19 patient diagnosed in the United States by intravenous treatment and improved patient clinical condition.

 </xref> Grein et al. reported a study in a cohort of patients hospitalised for severe COVID-19 who were treated with compassionate-use remdesivir (8), clinical improvement was observed in 68% of the patients (36 of 53).

 </xref> There are two clinical trials at phase III, being designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of parenteral remdesivir (8) in mild/moderate (NCT04252664) and severe (NCT04257656) hospitalised adults with COVID-19.
 <xref rid="B224" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref> These trials are evaluating intravenous remdesivir (8) at a dose of 200 mg on the first day plus 100 mg once daily, for an additional 9 consecutive days. The randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trials were recently suspended (NCT04252664) or terminated (NCT04257656) because no eligible patients for enrollment were found, due pandemic control in China.

 </xref> The study NCT04257656 showed that remdesivir (8) was not associated with statistically significant clinical benefits in severe forms of COVID-19. However, the authors observed a numerical reduction in time to clinical improvement in those treated earlier, but still requires confirmation. Another study, performed by Beigel et al. (with the same dosage and treatment period than the previous works cited above) enrolled 1063 patients with lower respiratory tract infection, demonstrated that individuals that were treated with remdesivir (8) had a shorter time to recovery than placebo group (11 days compared with 15 days).

 </xref> Even with a small scientific ballast, due to limited information about safety and effectiveness of using remdesivir (8), U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its emergency use on severe COVID-19.
 <xref rid="B225" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>225</sup>
 </xref> The approval was based on review of the topline data on two studies that are recruiting patients, (NCT04280705) and (NCT04292899). Other clinical studies are being conducted to address the effect of remdesivir (8) on COVID-19 treatment (Available from: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=COVID-19&amp;term=remdesivir&amp;cntry=&amp;state=&amp;city=&amp;dist=).
