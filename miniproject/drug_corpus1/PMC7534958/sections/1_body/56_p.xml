<p>The final knowledge-graph was then mined to gather an initial list of drugs, which was further refined by extracting previous evidence of antiviral activity from PubMed using a deep learning method called Biomedical Entity Relation Extraction (BERE) and manual inspection.

 </xref> In a subsequent step, the authors elaborated a final list of drug candidates using transcriptome analysis of ten SARS-CoV patients. The poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitor, mefuparib hydrochloride (CVL218) (37), currently in Phase I clinical trials, was identified as a potential drug for repurposing.

 </xref> The authors also found that CVL218 significantly inhibited the production of IL-6 induced by the CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 1826 (CPG-ODN1826) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBC) indicating it might be an alternative to treat the inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, CVL218 showed favorable pharmacokinetics and toxicity profiles in rats and monkey models.
