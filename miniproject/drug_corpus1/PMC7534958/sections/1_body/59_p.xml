<p>Researchers at the UK-based company BenevolentAI (https://www.benevolent.com/) analysed medical data from different sources to create a knowledge graph of biomedical information, showing possible drug-target interactions on its nodes and edges (similar to the previously mentioned approach adopted by Ge et al.) to explore new strategies for SARS-CoV-2.

 </xref> Among the drugs identified by mining the hidden information within the graph, there were 378 inhibitors of the P2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1), a regulator of viral endocytosis in AT2 alveolar epithelial cells.

 </xref> Inhibitors of AAK1 could then potentially block viral entry into alveolar cells. However, the authors argued that only one of these drugs, baricitinib (39), a janus kinase inhibitor, has an acceptable safety profile. In addition, the low therapeutic dosing of baricitinib (39) (2mg or 4mg daily) makes it a promising drug for repurposing.
