 </xref> Nowadays the seven coronaviruses that can infect humans (HCoVs) are classified in alpha coronavirus (229E, NL63) or beta coronavirus [OC43, HKU1, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and more recently the SARS-CoV-2]. 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 can cause upper and lower respiratory tract infection in adults and children. After the 2000s, two epidemic CoVs have arisen in humans: the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV which were reported in 2003 and 2012, respectively.
