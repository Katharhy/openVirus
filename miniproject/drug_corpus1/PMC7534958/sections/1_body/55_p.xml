<p>Ge and coworkers constructed a virus-related knowledge graph (or network) by combining seven networks with information about target-drug and protein-protein interactions, molecule similarity and sequence similarity of human and viral sources to predict drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2.

 </xref> The final knowledge graph was assembled by merging the nodes and edges of the seven networks, where each node represent drugs or targets, while the edges between them are the identified relations, such as similarity (i.e., molecular and sequence similarities) and drug-target or target-target interactions.

 </xref>⁠ A graph convolutional network (GCN) was used to learn and extract the hidden information on the nodes and edges of the knowledge-graph, allowing the authors to access novel drug-target and target-target interactions and find molecules that could be repurposed to SARS-CoV-2.

 </xref> GCN’s are powerful neural networks that can access the rich information within the nodes of a graph and return insights about possible relations (e.g., potential drugs and targets interactions), representing a valuable tool in the modern drug discovery scenario, where massive biological data are available in databases such as DrugBank and ChEMBL.
