<p>Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DDP4), also known as adenosine deaminase complexing protein 2 or T-cell activation antigen CD26, is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein of 766 aa largely expressed in many tissues (e.g. lungs and immune cells).

 </xref> DDP4 belongs to serine protease group (family: S9, clan: SC) and catalyses the hydrolysis of N-terminal dipeptide, Xaa-Yaa-|-Zaa-, (preferentially when Yaa is a proline, as long as Zaa is neither proline or hydroxyproline), from a variety of peptide substrates (EC 3.4.14.5), such as chemokines, neuropeptides, vasoactive peptides and growth factors.

 </xref> In addition, DPP4 acts as the functional cell receptor of MERS-CoV S protein, helping virus entry into the cell. Theoretically, this role may also be played in SARS-CoV-2 infection, as predicted by computational analysis.

 </xref> Recently, there has been a discussion about the use of DDP4 inhibitors, such as sitagliptin (29) (anti-diabetic drug), in the treatment of COVID-19.

 </xref> In principle, these inhibitors could be beneficial for type 2 diabetes patients (or even without diabetes) with COVID-19 since it could potentially block virus cell entry/replication, as well suppress inflammatory response.
