<p>Therefore, the task consisted of training the model to understand the chemical structure of small compounds and protein targets. The authors found that atazanavir (12), remdesivir (8) and efavirenz (38) are potential inhibitors of M
 <sup>pro</sup>, while atazanavir (12) also yielded nanomolar predicted binding affinity for RdRP, helicase, endoRNAse, 3’-to-5’- exonuclease and 2’-O-ribose methyltransferase.
