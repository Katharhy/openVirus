<p>RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, Nsp12) is an essential protein responsible for RNA synthesis during viral RNA transcription and replication cycles.

 </xref> As described for SARS-CoV, the RNA polymerase activity of SAR-CoV-2 RdRp (804 aa) also seems to require the binding of Nsp7 and Nsp8 cofactors to enhance RdRp binding and processivity.

 </xref> The overall RdRp structure has a “right hand” RdRp domain, composed by three subdomains (palm, fingers and thumb), and a nidovirus-unique N-terminal extension domain that forms a nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) structure. These domains are connected by an interface domain. Additionally, this protein also has a N-terminal β-hairpin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>A). The active site of RdRp contains conserved polymerase motifs located in the palm subdomain and its configuration is similar to other RNA polymerases.

 </xref> RdRp substrates, RNA template/primer and nucleotide triphosphate (NTPs), access the catalytic centre through the template and NTP entry paths, respectively, while the product-template hybrid is released through the RNA exit path.

 </xref> Moreover, the accessory proteins also have a high degree of amino acid sequence identity between these viruses: 98.1 % for Nsp7 and 97.5 % for Nsp8 - sequences obtained from PDB 7BV2 (2.5 Å) and PDB 6NUR (3.1 Å) entries.

 </xref> Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that SARS-CoV RdRp inhibitors may also bind to the homologous enzyme from SARS-CoV-2, as demonstrated for remdesivir (8) (
