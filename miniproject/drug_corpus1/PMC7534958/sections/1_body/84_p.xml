<p>In the patent from 2009, baricitinib (39) is obtained by a convergent synthesis. The synthetic pathway starts with the protection in position 7 of 4-chloro-7H- pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine (50) using 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl chloride (51), affording intermediate (52). Next step is a Suzuki-Miyaura reaction, coupling the fused ring system to a 4-pyrazoleboronic acid pinacol ester (53), giving key intermediate (54). Parallelly, a couple of steps starting from 2-(chloromethyl)oxirane (55) lead to 1-Boc-3-azetidinone (58) that reacts with diethyl cyanomethylphosphonate (59), affording key intermediate (60). Next, the key intermediates (54) and (60) react in the presence of DBU, giving (61). Then, steps involving hydrolysis of the Boc, sulfonation and pyrrolopyrimidine deprotection afford (39) with an overall yield of 21 % (
