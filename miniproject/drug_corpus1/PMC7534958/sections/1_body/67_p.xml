 </xref> A robust preclinical drug discovery pipeline comprising 
 <italic>in vitro,</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> models of SARS-CoV-2 infection is particularly important to identify new antivirals for human COVID-19 treatment. This pipeline can munition clinical studies with molecules that have a higher chance to become a drug, decreasing attrition rates.
