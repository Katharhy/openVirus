<p>CoVs S proteins require proteolytic priming or cleavage to become fusion competent.
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>59</sup>
 </xref> This is achieved by host proteases (e.g., TMPRSS2, cathepsin L, furins) which cleave the S2 subunit of S protein at two main positions: S1/S2 interface and S2â€™. The latter is located immediately upstream of the fusion peptide (FP), the fusion functional element of S2. Contrary to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 S2 subunit also has an additional cleavage site for furin proteases in the S1/S2 region, something that also occurs in MERS-CoV.

 </xref> It is still unclear its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection, but it is speculated that the ubiquitous expression of furins may increase cell and tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV, as well altering its transmissibility and pathogenicity.

 </xref> Taken together, host proteases represent potential targets for anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs, and thus some of them will be discussed in the following topics.
