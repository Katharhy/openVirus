<p>Mehra et al. performed a registry analysis of 96,032 hospitalised patients regarding the use of CQ (20) or HCQ (26, combined or not with a macrolide) for treatment of COVID-19.

 </xref> The observational study verified that with COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation a regimen containing CQ (20) or HCQ (26) had no evidence of benefit, but instead was associated with an increase in the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and a greater hazard for in-hospital death with COVID-19. These findings suggest that these drug regimens should not be used outside of clinical trials and urgent confirmation from randomised clinical trials is needed. After the publication, the paper was retracted, which influenced WHO to return the studies on CQ (20) and HCQ (26).

 </xref> Recently, on 17 June 2020, WHO stopped the HCQ (26) arm of the Solidarity trials again based on the RECOVERY trials (Available from: https://www.recoverytrial.net/). In this study 1542 patients were randomised to HCQ (26) and compared with 3132 patients randomised to usual care alone. There was no significant difference in any of the parameters evaluated: the primary endpoint of 28-day mortality, hazard ratio and hospital stay duration or other issues. Other study reported that HCQ (26) did not prevent COVID-19 when used as postexposure prophylaxis within 4 days after moderate or high-risk exposure.

 </xref> Robust data from well-designed control randomised clinical trials with large number of patients is still expected for concluding on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (26).
