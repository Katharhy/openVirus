 </xref> The patent is described as technical, with the aim of improving the synthesis of (1) presented in the patent from 1996, by Abbott Laboratories. The patent describes the synthesis of lopinavir (1) by a one-pot procedure starting with the formation of an acid chloride from (2S)-(1-tetrahydropyramid-2-one)-3-methylbutanoic acid (77) followed by addition of a weak base and the reactant (78) to the reaction system. The amine function of (78) allows a nucleophilic addition-elimination reaction to occur, affording (1) after treatment with NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub> (
