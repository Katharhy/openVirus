<p>The synthetic pathway described in the patent from 2016 has only six steps in a linear approach, as a consequence, the product is obtained in a higher overall yield when compared to the synthetic pathway discussed above. Intermediate (67) is obtained from azetidine-3-ol (64) in a couple of steps, including a sulfonation, an oxidation and the installment of the cyanomethylene moiety (

Then, intermediate (67) is reacted with ester (53), affording (68). A Suzuki-Miyaura reaction involving 7-Boc-4-chloro-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine (69) is applied, allowing the formation of the bound between the azetidinylpyrazole group and the pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine system. Last step is a hydrolysis of the Boc, affording Baricitinib (39) with an overall yield of 50 % (
