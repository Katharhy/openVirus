<p>Once in the cytoplasm, gRNA is readily translated into viral polyproteins (pp1a/pp1ab), which are cleaved into the individual Nsps that compose the RTCs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). These complexes recognise transcriptional regulator sequences in gRNA and begin to transcribe a series of subgenomic RNAs that encode structural and accessory proteins, otherwise the whole gRNA is replicated.

 </xref> Upon translation, S, E and M structural proteins are driven to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) where S proteins go through post-translational modifications (e. g., proteolysis, N-glycosylation). In parallel, a copy of the gRNA and N proteins bind in the cytoplasm to form the nucleocapsid and move into the ERGIC. In this compartment, nucleocapsid and the other viral proteins are assembled into a virion which travels through the cytoplasm inside a vesicle and leaves the cell by exocytosis.
