<p>Chloroquine (CQ; 20) and its less toxic derivative, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ; 26), are used to treat malaria and lupus/rheumatoid arthritis, respectively. Both drugs have already been described as possible antivirals.

 </xref> CQ (20) and derivatives probably act by decreasing acidity in endosomes and lysosomes, intervening on glycosylation of cellular virus receptors and modulating host immunological activity.

 </xref> Studies in cultures of Vero E6 cells have suggested that HCQ (26) can affect the virus SARS-CoV-2 in both entry and post entry stages at host cells.

 </xref> Comparing dose-response curves of the two compounds against an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> model of SARS-CoV-2 infection on Vero E6 cells, demonstrated that CQ (20) is slightly more potent than HCQ (26) at four different multiplicities of infection (0.01, 0.02, 0.2 and 0.8): EC
 <sub>50</sub> 2.71, 3.81, 7.14 and 7.36 μM for CQ versus 4.51, 4.06, 17.31, and 12.96 μM for HCQ, respectively. RNA copy numbers in the cell supernatant at 48 h post infection were measured. The authors also measured the cytotoxicity of both compounds at the same 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> model and demonstrated that the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) values of CQ (20) and its derivative were remarkably similar ~ 250 μM. In another study Yao et al. demonstrated that HCQ (26) was more potent than CQ (20) to inhibit 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> SARS-CoV-2 infection (EC
 <sub>50</sub> 0.72 vs 5.47 μM).

 </xref> The authors also performed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> physiologically based pharmacokinetic models for both drugs, separately. Interestingly, when comparing toxicity in five animal models, McChesney et al. demonstrated that HCQ (26) is two to three times less toxic than CQ (20) itself.

 <italic>in vitro</italic> activity against many different viruses, but no significant beneficial effect on animal models.
