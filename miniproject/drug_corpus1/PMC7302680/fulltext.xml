Forty-two patients received telbivudine orally 600&#x0200a;mg per day and treatment initiated from 12 weeks after gestation until the 12th postpartum week. Forty-five patients were untreated according to principle of informed consent. All infants received injection of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG; 200 IU) and were vaccinated with recombinant HBV vaccine. Wechsler preschool intelligence scale was used to assess mental and neuropsychological developments of these children till they were 6 years old. Data including serum HBV DNA viral load, Apgar score, and scores of Wechsler preschool intelligence scale were analyzed and compared.</p><p>Levels of both serum HBV DNA and ALT in patients who received telbivudine were significantly decreased at the 12th week after delivery, compared with baseline levels (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;.01). No significant changes were observed in patients not receiving telbivudine (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003e;&#x0200a;.05). Serum HBV DNA and ALT levels at the 12th week after delivery in the telbivudine group were significantly lower than those of patients without telbivudine (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;.01).

No statistical differences were observed between the 2 groups regarding maternal cesarean section rate, adverse pregnancy rate, postpartum bleeding rate, neonatal body mass, Apgar score, neonatal malformation incidence, or intelligence development of newborn.</p><p>Telbivudine is effective to reduce the viral load in CHB mothers with high viral load and could lower the perinatal transmission rate.

Thus, perinatal application of nucleos(t)ide analogues was recommended in CHB mothers with high HBV DNA concentrations to reduce the transmission rate, besides HBIg and HBV vaccination.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup></p><p>The previous study showed that telbivudine (LdT) was effective to reduce serum HBV DNA in highly viremic pregnant women.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> Initiation of LdT during the third trimester of pregnancy to block mother-to-infant transmission of HBV was recommended according to previous trials.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> However, the safety profile of long-term LdT duration in pregnant women with high viral load and potential effects on mental and physical development of newborns remains to be explored. The aim of our study was mainly to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of telbivudine in pregnant women with high HBV load and the long-term effects on both mental and physical development of their newborns.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Study population and study design</title><p>HBV-infected pregnant women between 20 and 35 years old were enrolled from January 2009 to February 2012 at the Chengyang People's Hospital of Qingdao.

Coinfection with hepatitis C virus, hepatitis D virus, hepatitis A virus, hepatitis E virus, human immunodeficiency virus, concurrently being confirmed with other liver diseases (drug-induced hepatitis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, ntrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, etc.) or having signs of fetal dysplasia were excluded. Informed consents were received from all the patients before enrollment.</p><p>The decision of patients to receive LdT or not was dependent on their willingness after discussion with their physicians. LdT was administered as 600&#x0200a;mg per day orally. All infants received standard HBV vaccinations (within 12&#x0200a;h of birth, at Week 4, and at Week 24) and HBIg injection. Serum HBV DNA, HBeAg, HBsAg, HBsAb, ALT, aspartate aminotransferase were tested at the time of delivery, 1st and 7th postpartum months.

Follow-up of infants&#x02019; intelligence till they were 6 years old with Wechsler preschool intelligence scale indicated that perinatal LdT exposure did not affect their intelligent development, compared with infants from control group. As far as we know, this was the first study to evaluate impact of perinatal LdT exposure on intelligency of children.</p><p>Mother to child transmission (MTCT) remains an important way of HBV transmission. Prophylactic use of HBIg and HBV vaccination was recommended to reduce the risk of perinatal transmission. However, recent studies found that 8% to 30% vertical transmission occurs even with prophylactic measures, particularly in mothers with serum HBeAg positive.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> Sustained high serum HBV DNA in pregnant women before delivery was associated with higher perinatal transmission incidence and failure of HBV immunization.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> It was reported that the immunization failure ratio could reach 30% in pregnant patients whose HBV DNA was higher than 10<sup>8</sup>&#x0200a;copies/mL.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> Recent studies had shown that maternal serum viral load in the third trimester of gestation was correlated with HBV infection of their infants and MTCT could not be prevented completely by vaccination and HBIg. Perinatal nucleos(t)ide analogues were recommended by consensus and guidelines to improve MTCT prevention.</p><p>Previous advances showed that telbivudine had no effects on human nucleotides stability or DNA synthesis.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> Recently 1 meta-analysis including 26 studies, involving 3622 pregnant CHB women, showed that LdT, LAM, or tenofovir was effective to reduce MTCT rate with no significant increased adverse maternal or fetal events.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> Consistently, our study indicated that telbivudine treatment during pregnancy in women with high viral load could effectively block MTCT.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> Moreover, our study showed that perinatal LdT exposure did not affect the intelligent development of infants.</p><p>This study had limitations. First, the sample size was relatively small and it was a single-center study. Further studies with larger sample need to confirm the potential effect on intelligent development and extended follow-up to observe the intelligent development of infants after 6 years old or comparison to infants whose mother were healthy would be included in our next study. In our study, the 2 groups are comparable in only a few variables. As most patients did not know the exact time of infection, neither their family history, disease duration was not included in our study.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>Perinatal LdT treatment showed efficacy to reduce MTCT in pregnant women of high HBV DNA and did not affect infants&#x02019; intelligent development.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p><bold>Conceptualization:</bold> weihui sun, lei ma, fengzhu li.</p><p><bold>Data curation:</bold> weihui sun, lei ma.</p><p><bold>Formal analysis:</bold> weihui sun, lei ma, anhua hao.</p><p><bold>Investigation:</bold> weihui sun, lei ma.</p><p><bold>Methodology:</bold> weihui sun, lei ma, zhi dong, fengzhu li.</p><p><bold>Project administration:</bold> weihui sun, lei ma.</p><p><bold>Resources:</bold> weihui sun, lei ma.</p><p><bold>Software:</bold> weihui sun, lei ma, zhi dong, anhua hao.</p><p><bold>Supervision:</bold> weihui sun, lei ma, anhua hao, fengzhu li.</p><p><bold>Validation:</bold> weihui sun, lei ma.</p><p><bold>Visualization:</bold> weihui sun, lei ma, zhi dong.</p><p><bold>Writing &#x02013; original draft:</bold> weihui sun, lei ma, anhua hao, lin zhou.</p><p><bold>Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing:</bold> weihui sun, lei ma, anhua hao, lin zhou.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: ADV = adefovir, CHB = chronic hepatitis B, CI = confidence interval, ETV = entecavir, HBsAg = hepatitis B surface antigen, HBV DNA = hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid, LAM = lamivudine, PCR = polymerase chain reaction, SD = standard deviation, TDF = tenofovir disoproxil.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>How to cite this article: Ren C, Wang L, Sun W, Ma L, Dong Z, Hao A, Zhou L, Li F, Ma W.
