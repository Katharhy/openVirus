<p>This study had limitations. First, the sample size was relatively small and it was a single-center study. Further studies with larger sample need to confirm the potential effect on intelligent development and extended follow-up to observe the intelligent development of infants after 6 years old or comparison to infants whose mother were healthy would be included in our next study. In our study, the 2 groups are comparable in only a few variables. As most patients did not know the exact time of infection, neither their family history, disease duration was not included in our study.</p>
