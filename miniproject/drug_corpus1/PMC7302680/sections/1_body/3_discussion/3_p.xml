<p>Mother to child transmission (MTCT) remains an important way of HBV transmission. Prophylactic use of HBIg and HBV vaccination was recommended to reduce the risk of perinatal transmission. However, recent studies found that 8% to 30% vertical transmission occurs even with prophylactic measures, particularly in mothers with serum HBeAg positive.

 </sup> Sustained high serum HBV DNA in pregnant women before delivery was associated with higher perinatal transmission incidence and failure of HBV immunization.

 </sup> It was reported that the immunization failure ratio could reach 30% in pregnant patients whose HBV DNA was higher than 10

 </sup> Recent studies had shown that maternal serum viral load in the third trimester of gestation was correlated with HBV infection of their infants and MTCT could not be prevented completely by vaccination and HBIg. Perinatal nucleos(t)ide analogues were recommended by consensus and guidelines to improve MTCT prevention.
