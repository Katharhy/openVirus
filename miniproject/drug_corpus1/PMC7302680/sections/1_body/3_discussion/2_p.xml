<p>Consistent with previous reports, our study showed that perinatal LdT application in pregnant women with high viral load was effective and safe to reduce the transmission rate. Comparison of safety profiles between infants from the 2 groups indicated LdT had no impact on the newborns. Follow-up of infantsâ€™ intelligence till they were 6 years old with Wechsler preschool intelligence scale indicated that perinatal LdT exposure did not affect their intelligent development, compared with infants from control group. As far as we know, this was the first study to evaluate impact of perinatal LdT exposure on intelligency of children.</p>
