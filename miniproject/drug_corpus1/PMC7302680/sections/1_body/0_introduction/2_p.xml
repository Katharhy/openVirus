 </sup> Vertical transmission of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) from mothers to their infants at birth or during prenatal period is a major contributor to HBV epidemics.

 </sup> The combination of both hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg) and HBV vaccine in newborn was the conventional prevention for HBV perinatal transmission.

 </sup> However, prevention rate still needs improvement, especially in CHB mothers with high viral load (such as serum HBV DNA &gt; 10
 <sup>6–7</sup> IU/mL). Thus, perinatal application of nucleos(t)ide analogues was recommended in CHB mothers with high HBV DNA concentrations to reduce the transmission rate, besides HBIg and HBV vaccination.
