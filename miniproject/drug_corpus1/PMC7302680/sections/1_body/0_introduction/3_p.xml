<p>The previous study showed that telbivudine (LdT) was effective to reduce serum HBV DNA in highly viremic pregnant women.

 </sup> Initiation of LdT during the third trimester of pregnancy to block mother-to-infant transmission of HBV was recommended according to previous trials.

 </sup> However, the safety profile of long-term LdT duration in pregnant women with high viral load and potential effects on mental and physical development of newborns remains to be explored. The aim of our study was mainly to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of telbivudine in pregnant women with high HBV load and the long-term effects on both mental and physical development of their newborns.
