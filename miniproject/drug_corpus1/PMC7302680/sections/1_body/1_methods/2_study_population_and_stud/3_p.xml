All infants received standard HBV vaccinations (within 12 h of birth, at Week 4, and at Week 24) and HBIg injection. Serum HBV DNA, HBeAg, HBsAg, HBsAb, ALT, aspartate aminotransferase were tested at the time of delivery, 1st and 7th postpartum months. The infants’ respiratory rate, weight, length, breast feeding status, and intelligence quotient were evaluated at each visit during follow-up period.
