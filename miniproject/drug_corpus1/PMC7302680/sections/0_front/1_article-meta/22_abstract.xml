 <p>To observe the efficacy of telbivudine in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) women with high viral load during pregnancy and the long-term effects on intelligence, growth, and development of the newborns.</p>
 <p>A total of 87 patients were included. Forty-two patients received telbivudine orally 600 mg per day and treatment initiated from 12 weeks after gestation until the 12th postpartum week. Forty-five patients were untreated according to principle of informed consent. All infants received injection of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG; 200 IU) and were vaccinated with recombinant HBV vaccine. Wechsler preschool intelligence scale was used to assess mental and neuropsychological developments of these children till they were 6 years old. Data including serum HBV DNA viral load, Apgar score, and scores of Wechsler preschool intelligence scale were analyzed and compared.</p>
 <p>Levels of both serum HBV DNA and ALT in patients who received telbivudine were significantly decreased at the 12th week after delivery, compared with baseline levels (
  <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). No significant changes were observed in patients not receiving telbivudine (
  <italic>P</italic> &gt; .05). Serum HBV DNA and ALT levels at the 12th week after delivery in the telbivudine group were significantly lower than those of patients without telbivudine (
  <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). The serum HBsAg-positive rate in neonates 7 months of age was 0%, which was significantly lower than that in control group (11.11%) (
  <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). No statistical differences were observed between the 2 groups regarding maternal cesarean section rate, adverse pregnancy rate, postpartum bleeding rate, neonatal body mass, Apgar score, neonatal malformation incidence, or intelligence development of newborn.
 </p>
 <p>Telbivudine is effective to reduce the viral load in CHB mothers with high viral load and could lower the perinatal transmission rate. Both mental and physical development in neonates with exposure to telbivudine during perinatal period were similar to those without telbivudine exposure.</p>
