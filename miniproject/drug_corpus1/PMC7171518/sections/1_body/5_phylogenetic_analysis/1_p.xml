<p id="p0050">The COVID-19 has been classified as β CoV of group 2B by the World Health Organization [
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The COVID-19 genome sequencing from nine patients showed 99.98% sequence identity [
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Another study in five patients showed 99.8–99.9% nucleotide identity and sequencing studies revealed the presence of a new beta-CoV strain [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The COVID19 genetic sequence showed more than 50 % identity to MERS-CoV and 80% to SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV originate in bats [
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. COVID-19 is the seventh member of the coronavirus family that infects humans and has been categorized under the subfamily orthocoronavirinae. It was a clade within the subgenus sarbecovirus [
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. On the basis phylogenetic reports and genetic sequence studies COVID-19 varies significantly from SARS-CoV and can thus be regarded as a new betacoronavirus that infects humans. The COVID-19 most likely developed from bat origin coronaviruses. The another evidence which supports that COVID-19 is of bat origin is the high of homology ACE2 receptor from a diversity of animal species there by implicating these animal species are possible intermediate hosts or animal models for COVID-19 infections [
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Additionally these viruses have single intact open reading frame on gene 8 which is another sign of bat-origin CoVs. Nevertheless, the amino acid sequence of receptor-binding domain resembles with that of SARS-CoV indicating that these viruses might use the same receptor [
