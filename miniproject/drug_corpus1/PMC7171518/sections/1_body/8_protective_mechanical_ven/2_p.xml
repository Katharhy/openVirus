<p id="p0075">In case of mechanical ventilation lower inspiratory pressures, reaching a plateau pressure (Pplat) &lt; 28 to 30 cm H
 <sub>2</sub>O and lower tidal volumes (4 to 6 ml/kg predicted body weight, PBW) should be kept. The positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) should be kept as high as possible so as to maintain driving pressure (Pplat-PEEP) as low as possible (&lt;14 cm H
 <sub>2</sub>O). Furthermore to prevent atelectasis and loss of PEEP disconnections from the ventilator must be avoided. The paralytics is not recommended until PaO
 <sub>2</sub>/FiO
 <sub>2</sub> &lt; 150 mm Hg. The use of conservative fluid management strategy and prone ventilation for &gt;12 hours per day for patients suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome is strongly recommended.
