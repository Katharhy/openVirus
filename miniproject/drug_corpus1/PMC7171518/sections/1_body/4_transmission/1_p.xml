<p id="p0045">It is anticipated that there is probable zoonotic origin of COVID19, based on the large number of infected people who were exposed to the wet animal market in Wuhan City where live animals are routinely sold. Efforts were made to look for a host reservoir or intermediate carriers from which the infection could spread to humans [
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The two snake species were identified which were thought the possible COVID-19 reservoirs. However, there is no clear cut evidence for the reservoirs of coronavirus other than mammals and birds till date. The COVID-19 genomic sequence analysis showed its 88 % identity with two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses suggesting that bats are the most likely link between COVID-19 and humans [

A study was conducted on COVID-19 infected women having third trimester and no evidence was analyze which can confirm that transmission can occur from mother to child. Nevertheless pregnant mothers underwent cesarean sections, so it remains uncertain if transmission can occur during vaginal delivery. This study is important as pregnant women's are comparatively more vulnerable to respiratory infections and extreme pneumonia [

The lung epithelial cells are the primary target of the virus. It has been stated that human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV occurs through binding between cellular receptor known as the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and receptor-binding domain of virus spikes [
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It is important to mention here that receptor binding domain sequence of COVID-19 is similar to that of SARS-CoV. These results indicate that the most likely entry into the host cells is through the ACE2 receptor [
