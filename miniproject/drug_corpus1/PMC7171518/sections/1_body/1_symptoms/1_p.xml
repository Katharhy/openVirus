<p id="p0015">The COVID-19 infection symptoms starts to appear after an incubation period of 5-6 days [
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Wang etÂ al. [
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] reported that time period between onset of COVID-19 symptoms to death ranges between 6-41 days with a 14-day median. This time period depends on patient's immune system and age of the patient. It is found shorter among patients of more than 70 years of age relative to those below 70 years patients [
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The common symptoms at the onset of infection are fatigue, cough and fever while as other symptoms include lymphopenia, haemoptysis, headache, sputum production and diarrhea [
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The chest CT scan reveals pneumonia nevertheless there are some other clinical features like acute cardiac injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, RNAaemia and incidence of grand-glass opacities that leads to death [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In certain cases, several peripheral ground-glass opacities have been identified in subpleural regions of both lungs which likely induce both localized and systemic immune response leading to increased inflammation [
