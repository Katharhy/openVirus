<p id="p0020">It is pertinent to mention here that symptoms between earlier betacoronavirus infections and COVID-19 such as bilateral ground-glass opacity on CT scans, dry cough, dyspnea and fever are similar [

 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Additionally, on the basis of chest radiographs results some cases were found to possess infiltrate in the upper lobe of the lung associated with increasing dyspnea with hypoxemia [
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Although COVID-19-infected patients reported gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms like diarrhoea, a small percentage of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV patients experienced similar GI distress. Hence, analyzing faecal and urine samples is necessary to eliminate a possible alternative route of transmission, specifically by health care staff, patients, etc. [
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, development of methods for identifying the different modes of transmission such as feacal and urine samples is urgently needed to establish strategies for inhibiting and/or reducing transmission and developing therapeutics to manage the disease.
