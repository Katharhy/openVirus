Currently, COVID-19 has caused global health concern. It is assumed that COVID-19 has zoonotic origin based on the large number of infected people who were exposed to the wet market in Wuhan City, China. The phylogenetic analysis has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has significant sequence similarity with severe acute respiratory syndrome-like (SARS-like) bat viruses, thus bats could be primary possible reservoir. The intermediate host and there subsequent transfer is not known yet, although human to human transfer is widely confirmed. The transmission of COVID-19 infection from one person to another resulted in the isolation of patients who were subsequently given a variety of treatments. To monitor the current outbreak, robust steps have been taken around the globe to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 infection particularly banning international and domestic flights, inducting lockdowns in vulnerable areas, social distancing etc. No clinically approved antiviral drug or vaccine against COVID-19 is reported yet. However, in clinical trials, few broad-spectrum antiviral drugs were evaluated against COVID-19 infection which resulted in clinical recovery. In this article emergence and pathogenicity of COVID-19 infection along with potential therapeutic strategies are analyzed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>Pathogenesis</kwd><kwd>Phylogenetic analysis</kwd><kwd>Therapeutic strategies</kwd><kwd>Transmission</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Coronavirus is one of the major pathogens which targets primarily the human respiratory system. Earlier coronaviral outbreaks (CoVs) include Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV which have significantly caused great threat to human beings. In December 2019, a number of patients were admitted to hospitals with an initial diagnosis of pneumonia. These patients were found to have epidemiological links with wet animal and seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Early studies predicted the onset of a possible coronavirus outbreak. The WHO on 11th February 2020 estimated the reproduction number for COVID-19 significantly largely ranging between 2.24 to 3.58 [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In December 2019 the first cases for COVID-19 infections were reported [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. From 18th December, 2029 to 29th December 2019, 5 patients having acute respiratory distress syndrome were hospitalized among which one patient died [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Upto 2 January 2020, 41 patients were identified to possess laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection. Almost half of these patients had underlying diseases particularly cardiovascular diseases, hypertension and diabetes [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It was believed that these patients were infected in hospital possibly due to nosocomial infection. Thus it was concluded COVID-19 is not a super-hot spreading virus (spread to many others from one patient) but it most likely spread as many patients get infected by unknown mechanisms at different locations in the hospital. Furthermore only those patients were tested that were clinically sick and probably there were several more patients who were infected. As of January 22, 2020 a total of 571 COVID-19 infection cases were reported in 25 provinces of China [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Upto 22 January 2020 China National Health Commission reported the details of first 17 deaths. On 25th January 2020 a total of 1975 COVID-19 infection cases were confirmed along with 56 deaths in mainland China [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Another report of 24th January 2020, estimated 5502 COVID-19 infections in China [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The first COVID-19 infection case was reported on 10th January 2020 which was led by identification, description, clinical diagnosis and management of the case. It included initial mild symptoms of the patient which leaded to pneumonia on 9th day of illness [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover on 30 January 2020 first case of COVID-19 human-to-human transmission was reported in US (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0130" id="intref0010">https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0130</ext-link>). Until 5th April 2020, total number of COVID-19 infected cases in USA mounted to 311,635 surpassing the infected cases of Italy (124,632) and China (81,669). Out of these 288,356 cases are active and 8454 are death cases while as rest i.e. 14825 cases have recovered (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/" id="intref0015">https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/</ext-link>). A study published in Nature reported that Chinese health authorities concluded that 31,161 people had contracted the infection in China as of 7 February 2019, and that more than 630 people had died of the infection (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.natur.com/articles/d41586-020-00154" id="intref0020">http://www.natur.com/articles/d41586-020-00154</ext-link>). On 5th April 2020, total number of infected cases in Italy has reached to 124,632 out of which 20,996 have recovered and 88,274 cases are active.

Currently total number of corona virus cases in India reported so far 3374. So far there are 77 COVID-19 deaths cases reported in India. At the time of preparation of this manuscript i.e. 5th April 2020 the WHO has reported 1056159 COVID-19 confirmed cases throughout the world including 57,206 confirmed death cases. So far COVID-19 has spread to 208 countries around the globe (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019" id="intref0030">https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019</ext-link>).

Wang et&#x000a0;al. [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] reported that time period between onset of COVID-19 symptoms to death ranges between 6-41 days with a 14-day median. This time period depends on patient's immune system and age of the patient. It is found shorter among patients of more than 70 years of age relative to those below 70 years patients [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The common symptoms at the onset of infection are fatigue, cough and fever while as other symptoms include lymphopenia, haemoptysis, headache, sputum production and diarrhea [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The chest CT scan reveals pneumonia nevertheless there are some other clinical features like acute cardiac injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, RNAaemia and incidence of grand-glass opacities that leads to death [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In certain cases, several peripheral ground-glass opacities have been identified in subpleural regions of both lungs which likely induce both localized and systemic immune response leading to increased inflammation [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Unfortunately interferon inhalation therapy showed no therapeutic benefit but instead aggravated the disorder by worsening pulmonary opacity [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p id="p0020">It is pertinent to mention here that symptoms between earlier betacoronavirus infections and COVID-19 such as bilateral ground-glass opacity on CT scans, dry cough, dyspnea and fever are similar [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. More importantly, COVID-19 showed unique clinical features like targeting the lower airway as is evident by symptoms like sore throat, rhinorrhoea and sneezing [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Additionally, on the basis of chest radiographs results some cases were found to possess infiltrate in the upper lobe of the lung associated with increasing dyspnea with hypoxemia [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Although COVID-19-infected patients reported gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms like diarrhoea, a small percentage of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV patients experienced similar GI distress. Hence, analyzing faecal and urine samples is necessary to eliminate a possible alternative route of transmission, specifically by health care staff, patients, etc. [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, development of methods for identifying the different modes of transmission such as feacal and urine samples is urgently needed to establish strategies for inhibiting and/or reducing transmission and developing therapeutics to manage the disease.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Epidemiology</title><p id="p0025">The first four cases of an acute respiratory syndrome of unknown etiology were identified among people linked to a local seafood market (&#x0201c;wet market&#x0201d;) in Wuhan City China on 29 December 2019 [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

There has been rise in the frequency of infected individuals with no history of wildlife exposure or visiting Wuhan and several cases of infection have been identified among medical professionals as well [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It has become apparent that COVID-19 infection occurs upon exposure to virus and both normal and immunosuppressed population seem susceptible.

The COVID-19 most likely developed from bat origin coronaviruses. The another evidence which supports that COVID-19 is of bat origin is the high of homology ACE2 receptor from a diversity of animal species there by implicating these animal species are possible intermediate hosts or animal models for COVID-19 infections [<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Additionally these viruses have single intact open reading frame on gene 8 which is another sign of bat-origin CoVs.

As the entire genome of COVID-19 is more than 80% similar previous human SARS-like bat CoV, hence animal models previously used for SARS-CoV may be useful to study the pathogenicity of COVID-19. Novel coronaviruses and SARS both recognize human ACE<sub>2</sub> cell receptor.

The early death cases in COVID-19 outbreak occurred mainly in the elderly possibly due to a poor immune system that allows for more rapid progression of viral infection [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The decontaminating regents should be provided by public services and facilities regularly. The physical contact with contaminated things particularly urine and facecal samples should be considered in dealing with the virus as these can potentially serve as an alternative route of transmission [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Most of the countries around the world particularly US, China, India, UAE etc have implemented major control and prevention measures like implementing state wise or country wise lockdown and travel screenings so as to control virus spread. The epidemiological changes occurring in COVID-19 infection should be monitored carefully taking into account potential transmission routes and subclinical infections, as well as the adaptation, evolution, possible intermediate animals and reservoir and spread of virus among humans. A large number of issues still remain to be addressed. Some of which are who and how many were tested, what percentage of these came out positive, weather this rate remains constant or it varies. What proposition of people tested positive for COVID-19 but showed clinical symptoms.
