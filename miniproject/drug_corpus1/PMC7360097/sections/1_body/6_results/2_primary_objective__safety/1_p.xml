<p>A total of 122 AEs was reported in 84 children (48.6%) during the study (between day 1 and 29) and most AEs resolved or were resolving by study end (95.1%). The overall incidence of AEs was similar between the baloxavir group (46.1%) and the oseltamivir group (53.4%; Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The incidence of AEs considered related to study drug was low in both groups, 2.6% (3/115) for baloxavir compared with 8.6% (5/58) for oseltamivir. The most common AEs in both groups were gastrointestinal disorders (vomiting or diarrhea), experienced by 12 children (10.4%) for baloxavir and 10 (17.2%) for oseltamivir. No deaths, serious AEs or hospitalizations were reported during the study. Two children experienced AEs which led to withdrawal from treatment in the baloxavir group, including accidental overdose of oseltamivir placebo and grade 2 rash occurring on day 4 that resolved after 24 hours without treatment in a child who received an accidental under-dose of baloxavir (4 mg instead of 40 mg). No AEs led to withdrawal in the oseltamivir group.
