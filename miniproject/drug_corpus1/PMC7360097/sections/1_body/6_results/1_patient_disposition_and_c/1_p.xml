<p>This study was performed between November 20, 2018 and August 27, 2019 at 36 sites across 6 countries (USA, Poland, Spain, Costa Rica, Mexico and Russia). Of the 176 children enrolled, 117 (66.5%) and 59 (33.5%) patients were randomized into the baloxavir and oseltamivir groups, respectively. In total, 169 children (96%) completed the trial (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The predominant influenza A subtype at baseline assessed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was H3N2 for both groups, followed by H1N1pdm09. Numbers were low for influenza B in both groups (n = 5 for baloxavir and n = 2 for oseltamivir). In the safety population, 49.1% of children were vaccinated against flu, with similar proportions vaccinated in each treatment group.
