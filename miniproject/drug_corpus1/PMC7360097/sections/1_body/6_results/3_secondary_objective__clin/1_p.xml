<p>The TTASS based on the CARIFS questionnaire was similar between treatment groups, with a median of 138.1 [95% confidence interval (CI): 116.6–163.2] hours for baloxavir and 150.0 (95% CI: 115.0–165.7) hours for oseltamivir (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). For children infected with H3N2, median TTASS was similar between the baloxavir and oseltamivir groups, while for those infected with H1N1pdm09, TTASS was numerically lower for baloxavir than oseltamivir; Table 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The number of children with influenza B was too low to allow meaningful interpretation of the data.
