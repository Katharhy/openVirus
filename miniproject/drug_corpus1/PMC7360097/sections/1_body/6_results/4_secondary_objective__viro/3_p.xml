<p>In an exploratory genotyping analysis of the polymerase acidic (PA) gene using Sanger sequencing in the 81 influenza-positive children (ITTi) treated with baloxavir, none of the children had preexisting PA/I38X mutations in baseline samples; PA/I38X mutations have previously been shown to be the most common determinant of reduced susceptibility to baloxavir.

 </sup> In 57 of the 81 children, sequencing was possible for both baseline and post-treatment samples, whereas 24 children had no detectable virus after treatment, or such low levels that sequencing was not possible. Treatment-emergent PA/I38X substitutions were detected in 11 of 57 children (19.3%); 9 had influenza A subtype H3N2 and 2 had subtype H1N1pdm09. However, when the 24 children with no detectable virus or such low levels that sequencing was not possible (suggesting no PA/I38X substitutions) are also included in this calculation, the rate of PA/I38X substitutions is 13.5% (11/81). The prevalence of PA/I38X substitutions was higher in children 1–&lt;5 years old [5/16 (31.3%)] than in children 5–&lt;12 years old [6/41 (14.6%)].
