 </sup> baloxavir was associated with a more rapid decline in infectious viral titer compared with oseltamivir. The mean reduction from baseline in influenza virus titer on day 2 (24 hours posttreatment) was considerably greater for baloxavir than oseltamivir [−3.59 (standard deviation = 1.34) vs. −1.79 (1.54) log
 <sub>10</sub> median tissue culture infectious dose/mL, respectively]. Thereafter, the mean change from baseline was similar in the 2 treatment groups, plateauing on day 2 for baloxavir and from day 4 for oseltamivir. The median time to cessation of viral shedding by virus titer was shorter for baloxavir than oseltamivir by 51.6 hours [24.2 hours (95% CI: 23.5–24.6) vs. 75.8 hours (68.9–97.8); Table
