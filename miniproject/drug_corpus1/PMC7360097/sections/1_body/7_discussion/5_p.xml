<p>Multiple viral infections are frequent in hospitalized children with respiratory tract disease, and may be linked to greater severity in symptoms and longer lengths of hospital stays.

 </sup> In contrast, although respiratory tract infections are commonly diagnosed and treated in the community, few studies report on the frequency of coinfection in this setting. A quarter of the ITTi population had a coinfection with another respiratory viral pathogen at baseline. Given that no data are available after baseline, there is a possibility that both baseline coinfections and later-onset coinfections contributed to a longer TTASS than may have been observed in the absence of coinfections.
