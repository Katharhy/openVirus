<p>In this study, there were no bacterial coinfections at baseline, and only 3 cases of otitis media (2 requiring antibiotics) observed in the baloxavir arm following treatment; therefore, these results may potentially indicate a reduction in acute otitis media complications following baloxavir treatment, compared with the 1 in 4 children in whom this usually develops without antiviral treatment.

 </sup> This could contribute to a reduction of the overuse of antibiotics for prevention of this complication,
