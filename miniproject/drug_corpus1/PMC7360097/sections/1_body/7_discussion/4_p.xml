  <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
 </sup> the antiviral activity of baloxavir was shown to be favorable compared with oseltamivir. The rapid decline of infectious virus titer after 24 hours and reduced time to viral shedding are consistent with those seen previously in completed phase II and phase III studies, confirming the marked virologic effects achieved with a single dose of baloxavir.

 </sup> The further potential clinical value of an antiviral with such favorable virologic properties has been recently demonstrated in a postexposure prophylaxis study.
