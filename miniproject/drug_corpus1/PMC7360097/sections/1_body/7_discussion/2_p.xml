<p>Baloxavir safety was the primary objective of this study, and the overall findings were unremarkable, with no new safety signals identified, confirming that baloxavir is well tolerated in children. Rates of AEs were generally similar between groups and there were no serious AEs or deaths reported. The most common AEs in both groups were gastrointestinal related (diarrhea/vomiting). Treatment-related AEs were less frequent in the baloxavir group than the oseltamivir group. Most AEs were considered by investigators to be related to influenza infection. In both treatment groups, most AEs were either mild or moderate in severity and most resolved or were resolving by the end of the study.</p>
