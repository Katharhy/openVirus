<p>All influenza antivirals can lead to the emergence of resistant variants with reduced susceptibility;

 </sup> however, in acute infections such as influenza, these variants are usually transient. An amino acid substitution at position 38 in the RNA polymerase (PA/I38X) has been shown to be the most common determinant of reduced susceptibility to baloxavir.

 </sup> The rate of PA/I38X viral variants in this study was consistent with that observed in 2 previous completed Japanese studies in children (JapicCTI-163417

 </sup> and JapicCTI-173811) including higher prevalence rates in children &lt;5 years old, which has also been documented for oseltamivir.

 </sup> In this study, clinical benefit was observed regardless of I38X variants. However, the approach taken to calculate resistance rates is conservative, generally including patients in whom virus is detectable after a certain time (usually days 3â€“5), but excluding those who have cleared the virus before sampling. Potent antivirals would be expected to clear the virus more rapidly, leaving fewer patients with samples for resistance analysis. This can potentially lead to an overestimation of resistance rates.
