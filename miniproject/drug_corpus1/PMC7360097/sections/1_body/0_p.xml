 </sup> Influenza infects all childhood age subsets and is associated with substantial morbidity,

 </sup> Mortality in children varies across seasons and depends on viral subtype, preexisting immunity and presence of underlying disease.

 </sup> Recent estimates for children from 92 countries, the majority of whom were &lt;5 years old, are 9000–106,000 (median: 44,888) influenza-associated deaths annually.

 </sup> In addition, children play a central role in influenza dissemination in the community because of their relative susceptibility to infection, high illness attack rates, prolonged viral shedding, and high contact rates between others in the household and community.
