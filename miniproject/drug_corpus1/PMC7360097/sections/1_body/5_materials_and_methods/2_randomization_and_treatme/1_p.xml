<p>Children were enrolled in parallel to 2 cohorts: 1–&lt;5 years old (minimum of 20 children) and 5–&lt;12 years old (minimum of 40 children). Using a permuted block randomization method, children were assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive a single dose of oral baloxavir on day 1 (2 mg/kg for those weighing &lt;20 kg and a single dose of 40 mg for those weighing ≥20 kg), or oral oseltamivir twice daily according to prescribing information (30 mg for patients weighing ≤15 kg, 45 mg for &gt;15–≤23 kg, 60 mg for &gt;23–≤40 kg, and 75 mg for &gt;40 kg) on days 1–5.

 </sup> Doses of baloxavir in this study were chosen based on population pharmacokinetic analyses performed using data from a phase 3 study of children in Japan (JapicCTI-173811), and evaluated with respect to their ability to match adult drug exposure. Children in both groups received a 5-day regimen (baloxavir and a matching oseltamivir placebo or oseltamivir and matching baloxavir placebo). Following randomization, the first dose of the trial regimen was administered under direct observation, and participants were followed until day 29.
