<p>A sample size of 80 children in the baloxavir arm (120 in total) provided a probability of ≥90% that ≥1 child would experience an AE with a background incidence rate of 3%. A sample size of 120 children provided a probability of 80.1% that ≥1 child would experience an AE with an incidence rate of 2%. Because the study was not powered for a statistical comparison between treatments, results are descriptive. The safety population comprised children who received any portion of a single dose. The intent-to-treat influenza-infected (ITTi) population was used for all efficacy analyses and comprised children who had a laboratory reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction confirmation of influenza infection from any swab sample collected at baseline or during the study. The number of children in the ITTi population was continuously monitored to ensure an adequate number of influenza-infected children were recruited. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics and Kaplan–Meier plots where applicable (SAS version 9.4).</p>
