<p>This was a global, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, active controlled trial of the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of a single oral dose of baloxavir versus twice-daily (for 5 days) oral oseltamivir, in otherwise healthy children with influenza. The trial enrolled children 1–&lt;12 years of age with influenza (who were otherwise healthy) during the 2018/2019 Northern Hemisphere influenza season, including sites in the United States, South America and Europe. Enrolled children had a clinical diagnosis of influenza infection consisting of fever (tympanic temperature of ≥38°C) at screening and at least one respiratory symptom (either cough or nasal congestion). The time interval allowed between the onset of symptoms and screening was ≤48 hours. The trial excluded children with severe influenza symptoms requiring inpatient treatment and those with concurrent infections requiring systemic antiviral therapy at screening. Acetaminophen was permitted for severe symptoms. Children were considered “otherwise healthy” if they met none of the following exclusion criteria: any immunosuppressive disorder (including human immunodeficiency virus infection), uncontrolled renal, vascular, neurologic, or metabolic disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or pulmonary disease, known chronic renal failure, active cancer at any site, or a history of organ transplantation.</p>
