<p>The primary endpoint was safety, defined as the incidence, severity and timing of adverse events (AEs) during the 5-day treatment period and a 24-day follow-up period. Vital signs (blood pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate and tympanic temperature) were measured at scheduled visits [days 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 15 and 29 (if there were abnormal findings or AEs since the previous measurement)]. Blood was collected for hematology and chemistry assessment on day 1 and day 6, and nasopharyngeal swabs were performed for viral quantification (using infectious titer) on days 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, as well as days 15 and 29 if considered appropriate by the treating physician.</p>
