 </sup> Baloxavir was first approved in Japan in February 2018, followed by the United States in October 2018. In the United States, the initial indication included single-dose, oral treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza in patients ≥12 years old, who have been symptomatic for ≤48 hours, which was expanded in October 2019 to include those at high risk of developing influenza-related complications.
