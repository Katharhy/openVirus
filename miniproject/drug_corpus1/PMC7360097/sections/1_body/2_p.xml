<p>In many countries, there are currently only 2 classes of antivirals approved for the treatment of influenza in children: M2 blockers and neuraminidase inhibitors.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
 </sup> Widespread, stable and transmissible resistance has rendered M2 blockers essentially ineffective.

  <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
  <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
 </sup> Although neuraminidase inhibitors are effective in the treatment of influenza in children, there are restrictions for some of these based on age and mode of administration. A simplified dosing regimen (ie, single oral dosing), with better overall antiviral activity and favorable safety and tolerability, is considered desirable for the treatment of influenza in children.
