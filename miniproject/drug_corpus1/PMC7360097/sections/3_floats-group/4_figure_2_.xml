  <p>Kaplanâ€“Meier plot of TTASS in the ITTi population, by treatment group. Solid line, baloxavir marboxil-treated children (n = 81); dashed line, oseltamivir-treated children (n = 43). The ITTi population comprised children who had a laboratory reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction confirmation of influenza infection from any swab sample collected at baseline or during the study. Numbers of children remaining at risk shown beneath relevant timepoints. Children without alleviation of signs and symptoms were censored from the analysis (n = 7 in each group). NE indicates not evaluable.</p>
