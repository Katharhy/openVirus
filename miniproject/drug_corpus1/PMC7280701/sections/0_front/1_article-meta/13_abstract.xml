 <title>ABSTRACT</title>
 <p>The ongoing COVID 19 epidemic has brought to the fore many concerns related to use of immunosuppressive agents (ISAs) in dermatology. While it is unclear whether the patients on ISAs for skin conditions are more prone to develop COVID 19, and what impact the ISA may have on the clinical outcome if a patient 
  <italic>does</italic> get infected, rationalizations based on the specific immune effects of each drug, and existing literature on incidence of various infections with each, are possible. In this review, we provide the readers with practically useful insights into these aspects, related to the conventional ISAs, and briefly mention the clinical outcome data available on related scenarios from other patient groups so far. In the end, we have attempted to provide some clinically useful points regarding practical use of each dermatologically relevant conventional ISA in the current scenario.
