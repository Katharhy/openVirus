As human-associated activities can be associated with increased vector dissemination, it is imperative that infectious disease control includes approaches to target arthropod vectors. As

For example, the release of sterilized insects has been used for decades to promote abortive mating and thus decrease disease transmission, as in the case of combatting sleeping sickness. Today, new approaches include using hormone-like compounds to reduce vector fecundity and infection by the endosymbiont

 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, as well as other members of the insect microbiota, can also be used to enhance vector immunity and make them less susceptible to a suite of pathogens, an effect that can also be recapitulated through direct genome engineering of the vector.
