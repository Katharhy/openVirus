Combatting infectious diseases thus remains a high priority in the twenty-first century and requires multi-pronged approaches that leverage new ways to track, prevent, diagnose and ultimately treat infection. In this month’s issue, we are publishing a special ‘Focus on Infectious Diseases’ that highlights some of the exciting new avenues being pursued.
