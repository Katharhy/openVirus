<p id="Par2">Whether attributed to unbalanced energies, exposure to poisonous miasmas, or the consequence of some supernatural punishment, infectious diseases have been humanity’s constant companion since time immemorial, decimating populations through epidemics and everyday infections alike. Since the first discovery of ‘animalcules’ by Antoine van Leeuwenhoek and the subsequent demonstration by Robert Koch and contemporaries that certain microorganisms are the cause of major human diseases, we have made enormous strides in understanding how pathogens cause disease and in developing treatments to prevent and treat infection. Such revolutionary therapeutic approaches include improvements in hygiene, developing vaccines to prevent infection, creating pathogen-specific tests to diagnose disease and designing antimicrobials to then treat patients. As a result, the human burden of infectious disease has been significantly reduced, and we have been able to fully eradicate smallpox and the animal disease rinderpest, with polio set to hopefully follow.</p>
