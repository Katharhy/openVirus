<p id="Par4">A cornerstone of public health is our ability to track the spread of infectious disease, so that we can mitigate risk and prevent further transmission. Over 150 years after John Snow (the oft-cited father of modern epidemiology) used medical records and spatiotemporal surveys to identify a waterborne transmission route for cholera, new technologies are providing us with ever greater resolution to address these epidemiological questions. In our first Review Article,

Real-time, public availability of such genomic information enables earlier recognition of epidemics, better reconstruction of transmission chains, and provides us with an evolutionary view of disease that helps identify genomic changes associated with increased virulence or resistance in particularly worrisome pathogen lineages.
