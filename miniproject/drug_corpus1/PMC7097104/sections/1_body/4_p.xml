<p id="Par6">Once disease manifests, it is imperative that patients are quickly treated with effective therapeutics. This requires the ability to identify the pathogen responsible through the use of accurate and affordable diagnostics, especially at the point-of-care. For example, the HIV rapid test has revolutionized our ability to screen entire populations, expedite antiretroviral treatment, and ultimately reduce transmission, while newer technologies such as sequence-based tests have enabled simultaneous TB detection and identification of important resistance mutations. However, developing diagnostics for resource-limited settings remains difficult, and

The authors also propose new functionalities that may be incorporated into new diagnostics for resource-limited settings, which include greater connectivity with public health institutions and alternative formats compatible with more accessible human clinical samples.
