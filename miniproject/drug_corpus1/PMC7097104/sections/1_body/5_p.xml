Given the recent successes of using faecal microbiota transplantation as a highly efficacious treatment for recurrent

However, much work remains to clarify the mechanisms by which microbiota affect the host, and bridging this gap will be increasingly important as we attempt to utilize microbiome products to combat infectious disease.
