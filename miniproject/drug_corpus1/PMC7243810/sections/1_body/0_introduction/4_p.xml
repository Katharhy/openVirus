<p id="p0015">In the present study, we have screened small drug-like molecules from a dataset of phytochemicals possessing antiviral activities using drug-like filters and toxicity studies. The selected molecules were evaluated for their binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> enzyme using molecular docking. The sequences and structures of SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> were compared with SARS-CoV M
 <sup>pro</sup> and MERS-CoV M
 <sup>pro</sup>. The identified lead molecules were further examined for their broad-spectrum inhibition potential against SARS-CoV M
 <sup>pro</sup> and MERS-CoV M
 <sup>pro</sup>.
