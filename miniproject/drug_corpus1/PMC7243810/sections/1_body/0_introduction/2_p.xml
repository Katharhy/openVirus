<p id="p0005">Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-sense RNA enveloped viruses which derive their name from the crown-like spikes on their surface and they belong to Coronaviridae family. They are classified into four main subgroups- alpha, beta, gamma, and delta depending on their genomic structure [
 <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Alpha- and beta coronaviruses cause respiratory infections in humans and gastroenteritis in other mammals [
 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Until the last year, only six different coronaviruses causing infection in humans were known. Four of this (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and HKU1) cause mild common cold-type symptoms in healthy individuals and the other two which caused epidemics in the last two decades. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused a SARS epidemic in 2002â€“2003 with a 10% mortality rate. Likewise, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) caused a disastrous pandemic in 2012 leading to 37% mortality [

 <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Since its RNA genome shows about 82% identity to that of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the new virus has been termed as SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, both these viruses belong to the same clade of the genus 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> [
 <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The SARS-CoV-2 caused a disease known as COVID-19. At the initial outbreak, cases were linked to the Huanan seafood and animal market in Wuhan but active human-to-human transmission caused exponential growth in the number of reported cases. The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed the outbreak a pandemic on March 11, 2020. There have been &gt;170,000 cumulative cases worldwide accounting for approximately 3.7% case-fatality rate as of March 15, 2020 [
