<p id="p0085">The binding energies and inhibition constants of the phytochemicals with the SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> enzyme were compared with that of a set of twelve FDA approved antiviral drugs-a) Viral integrase inhibitors (Raltegravir and Dolutegravir) b) HIV-1 protease inhibitors (Nelfinavir and Lopinavir) c) HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitors (Zidovudine and Nevirapine) d) HCV NS3/NS4B protease inhibitors (Simeprevir and Boceprevir) e) Neuraminidase inhibitors (Zanamivir and Oseltamivir) and f) HSV-1 thymidine kinase inhibitors (Acyclovir and Ganciclovir) (Suppl. Table 2). The results show that the binding energies and inhibition constant values of the phytochemicals were lower as compared to the majority of the approved antiviral drugs except for Nelfinavir (−9.54 kcal/mol), Boceprevir (−9.3 kcal/mol) and Simeprevir (−11.1 kcal/mol) which indicates that these phytochemicals have higher binding affinity to the target enzyme as compared to the antiviral drugs.
