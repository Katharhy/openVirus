<p id="p0060">From a total of 38 phytochemicals, 10 compounds (four active flavonoids, two active alkaloids, two active essential oils and two other phytoconstituents) were found to be orally bioactive with respect to ROF criterion (Molecular weight (MW) ≤500, cLogP (partition coefficient between n-octanol and water) ≤5, number of hydrogen bond donors (HBD) ≤5 and number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) ≤10 [

 <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> ). These drug-like compounds were further taken for molecular docking studies. The drug-attrition rate in preclinical and clinical trials is quite high due to the poor pharmacokinetic studies [
