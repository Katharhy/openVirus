<p id="p0075">The ten selected drug-like small molecules were docked into the active site pocket of SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup>. The molecular docking results are shown in 
 <xref rid="t0025" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> . The docking scores were bench-marked using the standard inhibitor, α-ketoamide 13 b (6OK). The α-ketoamide 13 b is a broad-spectrum inhibitor with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.67 ± 0.18 μM, 0.90 ± 0.29 μM and 0.58 ± 0.22 μM respectively against purified recombinant SARS-CoV-2 M

 <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. On comparing the binding energies and inhibition constants with that of the standard inhibitor, we have shortlisted three lead molecules viz., Bonducellpin D, 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-4′-O-β-d-glucopyranoside and Caesalmin B. Bonducellpin D and Caesalmin B are terpenoids isolated from the seeds of traditional Chinese medicinal plant 
 <italic>Caesalpinia minax</italic> and exhibit in vitro inhibitory activities against Parainfluenza-3 (PI-3) virus. [
 <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] The flavonoid 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-4′-O-β-d-glucopyranoside has previously been reported to have antiviral activity against PI-3 [
 <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The molecular interactions of LigPLot results are represented in 
 <xref rid="t0030" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> . The best-ranked lead molecule i.e., Bonducellpin D interacts with the enzyme target with a binding energy of −9.28 kcal/mol and inhibition constant of 156.75 nM. Bonducellpin D establishes four hydrogen bonds with residues Glu166 and Thr190 and hydrophobic interactions via eight residues (Met49, His164, Met165, Pro168, Asp187, Arg188, Gln189 and Gln192) (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A). The second lead molecule i.e., 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-4′-O-β-d-glucopyranoside interacts with the target enzyme with a binding energy of −9.23 kcal/mol and inhibition constant of 170.31 nM. This interaction is strengthed by the establishment of five hydrogen bonds with residues Glu166, Thr190 and Gln192 and with the involvement of thirteen residues (Phe140, Leu141, Asn142, Gly143, Ser144, Cys145, His164, Met165, Leu167, Pro168, His172, Arg188 and Gln189) contributing to hydrophobic interactions (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B). The third lead molecule- Caesalmin B interacts with SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> with a binding energy of −8.82 kcal/mol and inhibition constant of 342.79 nM. The molecular interaction is facilitated through four hydrogen bonds with residues Glu166, Thr190 and Gln192 and hydrophobic interactions via ten residues (His41, Met49, Tyr54, Cys145, His164, Met165, Leu167, Asp187, Arg188 and Glu189) (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C). The standard inhibitor interacts with SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> with a binding energy of −8.24 kcal/mol and inhibition constant of 905.88 nM. The binding interaction is mediated through four hydrogen bonds with residues Asn142, Cys145 and Glu166, and hydrophobic interactions via fourteen residues (Thr26, His41, Phe140, Leu141, Gly143, Ser144, His163, His164, Met165, Pro168, Asp187, Gln189, Thr190 and Gln192) (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>D). Interestingly, the residues His41 and Cys145 which form catalytic dyad residues are also found interacting with the inhibitor. Thus all the three lead molecules have better binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> compared to the standard inhibitor.
