<p id="p0070">The molecular docking protocol and algorithm was validated through the redocking experiment. The redocking result of co-crystal compound (6OK) shows an RMSD value of 3.603 Å between the docked and native co-crystal position. This small deviation indicates that the docking protocols and parameters used in the study can reliably estimate the biological conformations of the compounds [
