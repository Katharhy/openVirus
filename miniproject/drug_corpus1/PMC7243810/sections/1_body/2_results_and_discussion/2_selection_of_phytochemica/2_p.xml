<p id="p0055">A total of 38 bioactive phytochemicals possessing antiviral activities were selected for the study. These compounds were chosen based on the previous reports of their potent antiviral effects against various pathogenic viruses such as adenovirus, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, poliovirus, varicella-zoster virus etc. (Suppl. Table 1). The compound set consists of different classes of phytochemicals including active flavonoids (
 <italic>N</italic> = 14), active organic acids (
 <italic>N</italic> = 5), active alkaloids (N = 5), active essential oils (
 <italic>N</italic> = 3), active stilbenes (
 <italic>N</italic> = 6) and other phytoconstituents (N = 5). The three-dimensional structures the compounds were modelled and optimized. A list of these phytochemicals is enumerated in 
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> . These optimized structures were used further for virtual screening and molecular docking studies.
