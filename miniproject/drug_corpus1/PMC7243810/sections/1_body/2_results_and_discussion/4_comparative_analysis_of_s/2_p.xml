<p id="p0065">The primary sequences of SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> was compared with that of SARS-CoV M
 <sup>pro</sup> and MERS-CoV M
 <sup>pro</sup> and it was found that SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> shares identity percentages of 96.08 and 50.65 with that of SARS-CoV M
 <sup>pro</sup> and MERS-CoV M
 <sup>pro</sup> respectively (
 <xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> ). The MSA results show the conservation of residues in the three domains-I (residues 1–99), II (residues 100–182) and III (residues 199–306) of the SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> enzyme which includes catalytic dyad residues His41-Cys145 located in a cleft between domains I and II along with canonical oxyanion hole residues Gly143, Ser144 and Cys145 (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> ). Domains I and II have a typical chymotrypsin-like two-β-barrel fold. Domain III possesses a globular structure consisting of five α-helices which is connected to Domain II by a loop of residues 183–198 [

 <sup>pro</sup> and SARS-CoV M
 <sup>pro</sup> yields an RMSD value of 0.517 Å while an RMSD value of 0.817 Å was obtained when SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> was superimposed on MERS-CoV M
 <sup>pro</sup> (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> ). This indicates that SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> is structurally more close to SARS-CoV M
 <sup>pro</sup> as compared to MERS-CoV M
 <sup>pro</sup>. This comparative study at the sequence and structural level can be exploited for the design of broad-spectrum inhibitors which can block viral infection in host cells.
