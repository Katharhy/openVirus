<p id="p0090">With the exponential increase in the mortality rate and lack of therapeutic interventions for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, the discovery of novel drug molecules is crucial. SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> is a well-characterized drug target and its recent structural elucidation through X-ray crystallography has opened an avenue for structure-based drug design. Herein, we have explored a small library of phytochemicals with previously reported antiviral properties for the identification of small molecular inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> using a computational approach. We identified three lead molecules- Bonducellpin D, 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-4′-O-β-d-glucopyranoside and Caesalmin B which exhibit higher binding affinities as compared to the control. These lead molecules also demonstrate broad-spectrum antiviral activities against SARS-CoV M
 <sup>pro</sup> and MERS-CoV M
 <sup>pro</sup>. The current findings need further validations through in vitro and in vivo studies for developing into drug candidate molecules.
