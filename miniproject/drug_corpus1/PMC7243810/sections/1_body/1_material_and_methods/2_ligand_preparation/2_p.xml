<p id="p0020">The information about a set of thirty-eight phytochemicals from medicinal plants with antiviral activities was retrieved through literature search [
 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The summary of the selected phytochemicals (class, plant source and antiviral activity) is provided in Suppl. Table 1. The two-dimensional structures of the phytochemicals were generated using Chemsketch and modelled into 3D using open Babel and the structure optimization was carried out with an MMFF94 force field [
 <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] using our previously defined protocol [
 <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These optimized structures were used for virtual screening. A set of twelve FDA approved antiviral drugs such as Raltegravir (CID54671008), Dolutegravir (CID54726191), Nelfinavir (CID64143), Lopinavir (CID92727), Zidovudine (CID35370), Nevirapine (CID4463), Simeprevir (24873435), Boceprevir (CID10324367), Zanamivir (CID60855), Oseltamivir (CID65028), Acyclovir (CID135398513) and Ganciclovir (CID135398740) were retrieved from PubChem database [
 <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].
