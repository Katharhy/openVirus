<p id="p0045">Molecular docking was executed using AutoDock4.2 software [
 <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm was used for performing molecular docking studies and the docking parameters were chosen from our previously defined protocol [
 <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. A total number of fifty independent docking runs were performed for each compound. The conformational clustering of the poses was performed by considering a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of &lt;2.0 Å. The most favourable binding poses of the compounds were analyzed by choosing the lowest free energy of binding (ΔG) and the lowest inhibition constant (K
 <sub>i</sub>) which is calculated using the following equation (Eq.
