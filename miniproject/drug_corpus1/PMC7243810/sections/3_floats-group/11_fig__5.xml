  <p>Molecular interaction between lead compounds and MERS-CoV M
   <sup>pro</sup>. (A) Bonducellpin D, (B) 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-4′-O-β-d-glucopyranoside, (C) Caesalmin B, (D) α-ketoamide 13b (Control). The binding poses represent the target enzyme as ribbon where helices, sheets and loops are indicated by orange-red, purple and grey respectively and the bound compounds as ball-and-stick (cornflower blue). The molecular interactions are represented by the green dashed lines for hydrogen bonds and semi-arcs with red eyelashes for hydrophobic interactions. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
