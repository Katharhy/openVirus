  <p>Binding poses and molecular interactions between lead compounds and SARS-CoV-2 M
   <sup>pro</sup>. (A) Bonducellpin D, (B) 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-4′-O-β-d-glucopyranoside, (C) Caesalmin B, (D) α-ketoamide 13b (Control). The binding poses display the target enzyme in ribbon form with structural domains-I (orange-red), II (yellow) and III (forest green) where domain II and III are connected by a loop (cornflower blue) and the bound compounds are rendered as ball-and-stick (purple). The molecular interactions show hydrogen bonds as green dashed lines and hydrophobic interactions as semi-arcs with red eyelashes. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
