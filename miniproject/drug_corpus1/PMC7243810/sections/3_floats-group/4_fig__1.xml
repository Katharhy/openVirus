  <p>Sequence and structural analysis of SARS-CoV-2 M
   <sup>pro</sup>. (A) three-dimensional structure of SARS-CoV-2 M
   <sup>pro</sup> consists of three domains-I (orange-red), II (yellow) and III (forest green) where domain II and III are connected by a loop (cornflower blue), (B) Multiple Sequence alignment (MSA) of SARS-CoV-2 M
   <sup>pro</sup>, SARS-CoV M
   <sup>pro</sup> and MERS-CoV M
   <sup>pro</sup>. The red box with white characters indicates strict identity whereas yellow box with red characters corresponds to semi-conserved residues. The secondary structure elements such as α-helices and 310-helices (η) are displayed as squiggles and β-strands and strict β-turns are rendered as arrows and TT letters respectively. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
