   <italic>Vector-Based Vaccines</italic> induce a predominant cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response, and display a high efficiency. Their response is additionally amplified through the adjuvant vector. However, the “pre-existing’’ immunity to the vector could influence the development of an immune response and represents a disadvantage (ex: Ad5-nCoV by CanSino, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 by Oxford). Recently, the researchers from Oxford Vaccine Trial Group reported the preliminary results of a phase I/II randomized controlled trial on ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. This data confirms its immunogenicity and safety as well as its ability to induce humoral and cellular immunity, paving its entry into phase II/III studies (

   <italic>Nucleic Acid Vaccine</italic> also trigger a predominant CTL response. The associated immune response is satisfactory, the manufacturing process is simple but there could be obstacles regarding vaccine delivery. Multiple transport systems have been tested such as lipid nanoparticles, plasmids or vectors. The administration of certain vaccines is performed through electroporation (ex: INO-4800 by Inovio, Mrna-1273 by Moderna).

   <italic>Inactivated Vaccines</italic> induce a protective B cell response, yet this appears to be modest and requires booster shots. These vaccines are safe but expensive, difficult to produce in large quantities and require a well controlled environment during their manufacture (ex. Coronavac by Sinovac).

   <italic>Protein-Based Subunit Vaccines</italic> trigger a humoral response by using peptide fragments of the S protein (S1 or RBD subunit). In order to obtain an adequate immune response, these peptides need to be coupled to adjuvants which in turn require an additional follow-up for potential side-effects (ex: NVX-CoV2373 by Novavax).

   <italic>Non-Specific Vaccines</italic>. BCG, the vaccine against Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the non-specific vaccine which has received most attention in the SARS-CoV-2 infection due to its ability to boost the immunity against SARS-CoV-2. BCG is currently investigated in multiple randomized trials across the globe, many of which have reached phase 3 or 4 and have begun the recruitment of volunteers. Clinical trials will evaluate the non-specific immune response elicited by BCG and its benefit on lowering the incidence of COVID-19 in the vaccinated general population (NCT04328441), in children (NCT04327206) or in health care workers exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (NCT04379336, NCT04327206, NCT04348370, NCT04327206, NCT04348370). Of the vaccines currently undergoing preclinical studies AAVCOVID-by AveXis is a distinctive gene-based vaccine candidate which deserves a separate mention. AAVCOVID is an experimental gene-vaccine which expresses SARS-nCoV-2 Spike antigens delivered through a vector already used in ophthalmology (adeno-associated viral vectors/AAV), which differs from the human adenoviral vector. The AAV technology has already been used in gene therapy and is more advantageous due to its availability, safety profile and immunogenic response without the risk of pre-existing immunity. AAV vaccines are responsible for strong antibody responses and high T cell memory responses.
