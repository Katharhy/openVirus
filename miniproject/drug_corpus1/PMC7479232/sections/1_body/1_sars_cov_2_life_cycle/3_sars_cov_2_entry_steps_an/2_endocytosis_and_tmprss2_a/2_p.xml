<p>The endocytic pathway represents a key mechanism behind viral entry. Multiple studies have currently approached the antiviral role of endosomal-tropic agents such as hydroxychloroquine sulfate or umifenovir (arbidol) (

SARS-CoV-2 virions are processed through the endo-lysosomal network, where the autophagy machinery is involved in the delivery of the viral genome to the host cell. The autophagy is initiated by a complex enzymatic system, also controlled by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). While it is still unclear how the autophagy process influences the replication of SARS-CoV-2 (
