<p>The CoV-2 S protein is a type I transmembrane protein. It contains two ectodomains: a receptor-binding subunit (RBD) S1 which ensures the viral biding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and a membrane-fusion subunit S2 (

 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">Zhou P. et al., 2020</xref>). The S1–S2 domain of the S-glycoprotein contains a “furin-like cleavage site” which is activated by furin, an omnipresent cellular protease (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Coutard et al., 2020</xref>). Furin plays an essential role in the activation of the S protein as well as afterwards, during its cell membrane fusion and intercellular spreading (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Hoffmann et al., 2020a</xref>). The activation of the S1/S2 domain enables the interaction between the S protein and ACE2 receptor followed by the downregulation of ACE2, an ubiquitous receptor preferentially expressed in epithelial or endothelial cells (

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Hoffmann et al., 2020b</xref>). ACE2 cleaves Angiotensin II (Ang II) to Angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7), a vasodilatory and anti-proliferative heptapeptide. Ang (1-7) ensures the equilibrium of the renin angiotensin system and protects the vascular endothelia of the vital tissues such as brain, heart, lungs, and kidneys (

ACE2 mRNA, has a higher expression in the respiratory epithelia, mostly in the nasal and alveolar epithelial cells but also in the epithelial cells of the salivary gland, intestinal and renal epithelia or cardiac cells (

 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">Sungnak et al., 2020</xref>). Circulating ACE2 levels are higher in diabetic, cardiac or obese patients especially those with organ dysfunctions or treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBS) (

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Fang et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Nicin et al., 2020</xref>). While the correlation between the outcome of SARS and serum or tissue concentration of ACE2 or ACEIs/ARBS administration remains elusive (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Albini et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">Reynolds et al., 2020</xref>), the prognosis of patients with cardiac or pulmonary disease, diabetes or obesity appears to be worse (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Fang et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 2020b</xref>). Hence, the protection of these key groups remains a pressing matter. Various solutions have been proposed to address the interaction between the viral proteins and ACE2, such as a recombinant soluble form of ACE2 (

 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Monteil et al., 2020</xref>) or cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies active against SARS-CoV-2 RBD specific epitopes (
