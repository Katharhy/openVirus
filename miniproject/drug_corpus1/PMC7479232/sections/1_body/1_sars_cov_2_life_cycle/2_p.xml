<p>Cell invasion includes the viral entry steps (receptor recognition, endocytosis and viral- membrane fusion) and post-entry steps (genomic RNA translation and replication, virion assembly, maturation, and exocytosis). The host immune response is initiated as soon as the type I interferon (IFN-I) response is triggered by intracellular genomic RNA. IFN-I release leads to the transcription of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and to the recruitment of CD4 + T-helper cells, further responsible for the Th1/Th2 response and humoral immunity (
