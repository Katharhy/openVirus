<p>Data on anti-inflammatory drugs has been contradictory in what concerns their immunosuppressant effect such is the case of corticosteroids or their potential to increase the ACE2 expression such is the case of ibuprofen. Nevertheless, ciclesonide, an inhalatory corticosteroid, has been experimentally shown to suppress SARS-CoV-2 growth and host inflammation in the lungs and some published cases has confirmed this aspect (

The investigators of a large clinical trial supported by the Oxford University (UK RECOVERY trial NCT04381936) have reported a positive effect of intravenous dexamethasone administration in the treatment of COVID-19. The study showed that a 10-day treatment with low doses of dexamethasone (6 mg/day) reduced the mortality in patients who required oxygen support. Still, the authors underlined that this positive effect was not recorded in patients who did not require oxygen. This observation additionally highlights the need to adapt the treatment to the dynamic nature of COVID-19 and to adopt differential strategies between the early viral invasion stage and the late stage dominated by a strong inflammatory response.
