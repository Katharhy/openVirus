<p>MSC migrate towards the affected lung tissue and induce the release of antimicrobial peptides such as LL37 (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Krasnodembskaya et al., 2010</xref>), which in turn attenuate the inflammation and promote the regeneration of damaged cell (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 2018</xref>). MSC are cells with a marked functional plasticity, which can either promote or inhibit the immune response depending on the local inflammatory status (
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">Spaeth et al., 2008</xref>). Currently, MSC have been successfully used for immune disorder therapy and graft-versus-host disease (

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Cruz and Rocco, 2019</xref>), MSC are still considered a promising candidate in the study of SARS-CoV-2 associated ARDS (

 </xref>). According to 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Leng et al. (2020)</xref> the intravenous administration of MSC in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia shifts the immune response from a Th1 to a Th2 response, controls the inflammatory cytokines and modifies the active status of dendritic cells and macrophages. In a clinical setting, this translates to an attenuation of the respiratory failure after 2â€“4 days (
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Qu et al., 2020</xref>). The administration of MSC proved safe, with no side effects even for doses exceeding 3 times the normal dose (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bellingan et al., 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Qu et al., 2020</xref>). Despite these encouraging advances, no statistically significant benefit was reported for MSC treatment, probably also due to the heterogenous selection criteria of these studies. The administration of MSC through a compassionate use program, could be beneficial for critical cases of COVID-19 and could shed more light on the role of MSC.
