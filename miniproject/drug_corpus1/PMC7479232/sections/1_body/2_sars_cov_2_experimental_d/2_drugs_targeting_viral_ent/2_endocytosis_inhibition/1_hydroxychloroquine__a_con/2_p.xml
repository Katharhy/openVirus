<p>Nevertheless, the clinical efficiency of Cq and Hq is still unclear and the risk of side effects remains high, prompting a more reserved attitude, despite the wide optimism for the molecules (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Juurlink, 2020</xref>). Thus, beginning with April 2020 numerous authors have expressed their concern regarding the side effects of Hq, especially in association with other toxic drugs or in high doses or for long-term use (

 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Lane et al., 2020</xref>). In a large observational study on 1,446 severely ill patients Geleris et al, did not find a significant increase of side effects following the standard 5-days therapeutic regimens with Hq (

 <sup>th</sup> the FDA issued a safety alert regarding the secondary arrhythmias reported in various studies and on the 18
 <sup>th</sup> of June the Hq arm of a large international study (Solidarity Trial ISRCTN83971151,WHO) was stopped and other similar trials were withdrawn (NCT04347512, France and NCT04371926, United States). Finally, on July 1st the FDA cautioned against the use of Hq and Cq in COVID-19 due to safety issues. On the other hand, the therapeutic benefit of this regimen is still debatable. The study by Geleris et al. did not find a statistically significant correlation between this regimen and either intubation or death. On a similar note, two completed studies carried in China (NCT04261517, ChiCTR2000029868) and the preliminary data from other trials (NCT04347993, US, NCT04381936 UK RECOVERY Trial) (NCT04308668 US, Canada) also failed to confirm a therapeutic or a prophylactic benefit of Hq. There are still multiple ongoing studies which could shed more light on the matter, including NCT04315948-DisCoVeRy trial France, ChiCTR2000029803-China, NCT04334148-US, and NCT04304053-Spain. Overall, the antimalarial drugs Hq and Cq recently promoted in various clinical trials and initially considered as a promising option in COVID-19 have since became more and more debated (
