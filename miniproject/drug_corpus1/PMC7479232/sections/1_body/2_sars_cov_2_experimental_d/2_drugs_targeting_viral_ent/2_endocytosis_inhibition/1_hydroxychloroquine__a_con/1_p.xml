<p>The endocytic entry of SARS-CoV-2 through a clathrin-mediated pathway as well as its fusion mechanism with the cell membrane led to the repurposing of previously known drugs such as cloroquine (Cq) and hydroxychloroquine (Hq). Chloroquine phosphate, is an antimalarial drug which acts through complex mechanisms to alter ACE2 glycosylation and endosomal pH and which ultimately prevents the cleavage of the S protein, and the attachment and viral fusion (

These therapeutic molecules showed an additional effect during both the entry and post-entry stages of SARS-CoV-2, as was also shown in Vero E6 cells, and were included in March 2020 in the Chinese guidelines for the management of COVID-19 (
