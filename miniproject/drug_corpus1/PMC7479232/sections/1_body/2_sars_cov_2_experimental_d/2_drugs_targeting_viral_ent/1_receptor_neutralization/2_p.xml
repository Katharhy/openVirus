<p>Additionally, 2 other clinical trials were launched in June 2020, namely a phase 1 trial for the study of LyCOV555 and JS016 respectively, two neutralizing IgG1 mAbs directed again the S protein (NCT04427501, NCT04441918). It is probable that a cocktail of mAB against different epitopes could significantly improve the affinity and neutralizing activity and could lower the risk of resistance mutation. Still, in this case, the use of mAb would require an early administration so as to precede viral replication, a step which would considerably limit their practical use, along with the consideration for the development for specific technologies and the high cost. Additionally, further research is needed to clarify the potential risk related to antibody-dependent enhancement, a form of immune enhancement accompanied by cytokine storm which ensues as a result of prior exposure to other viruses or coronaviruses (
