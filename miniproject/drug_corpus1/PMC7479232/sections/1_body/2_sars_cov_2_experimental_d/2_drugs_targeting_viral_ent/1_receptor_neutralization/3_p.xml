<p>Another therapeutic alternative would be to replete the pool of ACE2 receptors using human recombinant soluble ACE2 enzyme (hrACE2). HrACE2 was experimentally used by Monteil to block SARS-CoV-2 in vessel organoids and in human kidney organoids (

A pilot study on the matter has been withdrawn (NCT04287686, China) but another pilot trial using APN01, (a synonymous for rhACE2) is still ongoing (NCT04335136) and is expected to report its preliminary conclusions in September 2020. Additionally, a recombinant bacterial derived ACE2-like enzyme named B38-CAP will be evaluated in a randomized control trial regarding its ability to prevent lung injury (NCT04375046). According to previous data, the B38-CAP enzyme identified in 
 <italic>Paenibacillus</italic> sp. B38 and produced through bacterial engineering shares a structural similarity to mammalian ACE2 and preserves the cardiac protective role of the renin-angiotensin system (
