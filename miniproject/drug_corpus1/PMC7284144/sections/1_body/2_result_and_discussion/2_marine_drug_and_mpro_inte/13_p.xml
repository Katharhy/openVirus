<p>The degree of compactness and folding is plotted against time, which is commonly measured through the radius of gyration (Rg). A long range variations in proteins show their weak folding (Lobanov etÂ al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Smilgies &amp; Folta-Stogniew, 
 <xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). A stable Rg value shows compactness and stable folding maintains a steady value of Rg, required for proper function, whereas in case of misfolding, the Rg will show a long range of variation over time.
