<p>Hundreds and thousands of humans have been died in many epidemics, broken out over the centuries. Some infections have been found, more deadly, especially viral pathogens. These pathogens have resisted in majority of cases to all kinds of medical treatment. Synthesizing drugs against rapidly replicated viruses resulting in acute syndromes is a laborious and time-consuming procedure, requires a lot of financial aid. However, the natural compounds are lying around on the earth on land and water (Abdelli et al.,
