<p>In the current study, five marine compounds, designated as C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, and C-5 (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) have been docked in the crystal structure of viral M
 <sup>pro</sup>. The compounds (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>) exhibited a good interaction with viral M
 <sup>pro</sup>, forming many hydrogen bonds (

Although the molecular weight of C1 is very high but the new FDA approval seems beyond the Lipinski’s rule of five (

This may due be the increasing focus that offer potential for promising new therapeutic compounds for the treatment of diseases, particularly in the areas of virology and oncology. However, conducting drug discovery ‘beyond rule of 5’ chemical space offerings important drug design and challenges to medicinal scientist to achieve oral pharmacokinetics. In some cases, including HCV NS3/4A protease, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A inhibitors the Lipinski’s rule of five has not been considered (DeGoey et al.,
