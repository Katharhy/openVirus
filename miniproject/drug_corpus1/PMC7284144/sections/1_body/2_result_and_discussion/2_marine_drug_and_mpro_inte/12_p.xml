<p>The average distance of C1 and M
 <sup>pro</sup> is approximately in range, with little fluctuation during the simulation period. However, the final and initial distance is almost similar (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0007">Figure 7</xref>). The distant matrix signifies the C1 and M
 <sup>pro</sup> distance stability during the simulation period. This approach might be useful to infer the strong binding affinity during the simulation period (Ernst et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Khan, Ashfaq-Ur-Rehman et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The average distance is commonly affected when a variant occurs at the active site of target proteins during the course of therapy, causing drug resistance (
