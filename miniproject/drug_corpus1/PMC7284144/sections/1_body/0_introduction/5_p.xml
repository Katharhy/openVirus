<p>Although commercially synthetic sources prepared many drugs but the major hurdles, drug side effects, resistance, cell toxicity, and long-term treatment, were some factors behind the failure. The potential marine products are playing a pivotal role in the identification of novel prototypes and also developing drugs using natural products of the marine environment (Vo &amp; Kim, 
 <xref rid="CIT0067" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Wittine et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0071" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Over two-thirds of the planet has been covered by marine species, making them a major source for novel drug-like compounds (Aneiros &amp; Garateix, 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Mayer et al., 2019). Further, a possible vaccine target is viral structural proteins, the development of which is desirable and it is foreseen that the first candidates will be advanced to clinical phase I around mid-2020 (Boopathi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Keener, 
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Khan, Jha et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Letko &amp; Munster, 
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Sarma et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Wrapp et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). In the meantime, however, a great effort involves the targeting of nonstructural viral proteins which are instead essential for the viral replication and the maturation processes, representing a specific target for anti-COVID-19 drug development (Ahmed et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Anand et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Gan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Gupta et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Hasan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Khan, Zia et al.,

 <xref rid="CIT0076" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). In the current scenario, the crystallographic structure of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M
 <sup>pro</sup>) also called 3CL hydrolase or C30 endopeptidase, was made available to the scientific community, just a few weeks after the first COVID-19 outbreak (PDB ID: 6LU7 in complex, 6MO3 apo). The structural characterization of the main protease (M
 <sup>pro</sup>) shares 96.1% of its sequence with those of previous SARS-CoV, contained a highly conserved architecture of the catalytic binding site. We took advantage of the recently solved crystallographic structure of SARS-COVID-19 to perform a cutting edge
