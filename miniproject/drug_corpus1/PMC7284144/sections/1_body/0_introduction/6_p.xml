<p>Once the cell is infected with COVID-19, the existing molecular machinery of the host cell is taken over by the virus to translate its RNA into long chains of proteins, producing more copies. These long viral proteins are activated when cut into smaller pieces by proteases. Hence, viral proteases have a critical role in the propagation of the virus. Identification of specific inhibitors from natural products against the COVID-19 M
