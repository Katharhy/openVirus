<p>Five marine compounds reported earlier in the study (Felix et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) were docked using rigid receptor docking protocol in MOE. During the process of docking, the protein was fixed, while ligands were kept flexible. Residue selenomethionines were converted into methionine and side-chain polar hydrogen were refined. Molecular docking grid was specified and centered using 20 × 20 × 20 with 0.375 grid spacing. A total of 50 runs were performed to observe a wide range of conformational orientations.
