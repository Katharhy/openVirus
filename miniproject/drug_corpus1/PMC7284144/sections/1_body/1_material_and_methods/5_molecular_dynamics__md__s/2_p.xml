<p>MD simulation was carried out via Gromacs 5.1 [54] for a period of 100 ns. The system was stabilized by adding Na
 <sup>+</sup>/Cl
 <sup>−</sup> ions. Energy minimization (NVT and NPT) was performed in two-step for a duration of 50,000, continued till the maximum force reached below 1000 kJ/mol/nm. An overall pressure and temperature equal to 1 bar and 300 K were kept with a time gap of 2 fs to achieve a stable state. To maintains a constant temperature inside the box, the v-rescale, an optimized Berendsen thermostat temperature coupling technique, was used. Once the MD was completed, all the obtained trajectories were examined for conformational drifts. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) and root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) were calculated to measure the stability and flexibility of protein and compound. Cpptraj was used to calculate the average distance between marine natural compound and proteins during the simulation period (Bernardi et al.,
