<p id="Par21">In addition to PPE production, physics-based techniques play a substantial role in structural biology. The majority of biological macromolecular structures are obtained by X-ray crystallography. The development of physical technologies spurred the first forays into rational drug design, in which scientists study the structure and function of molecules in order to determine which drugs might bind to their targets, and in case of viruses like SARS-CoV-2, to prevent them from replicating [
