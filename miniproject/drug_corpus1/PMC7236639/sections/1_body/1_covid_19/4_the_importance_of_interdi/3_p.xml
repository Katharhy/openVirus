<p id="Par10">In this context, Rosenfield [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] took this topic one step further by introducing a three-tiered structure for conceptualizing the mechanism of collaboration among different disciplines: (i) in 
 <italic>multidisciplinarity</italic>, researchers work in parallel or sequentially from a disciplinary-specific base to address a common problem; (ii) in 
 <italic>Interdisciplinarity</italic>, researchers work jointly, but still from a disciplinary-specific base to address the common problem; (iii) finally, in 
 <italic>transdisciplinarity,</italic> researchers work jointly, using a shared conceptual framework drawing together disciplinary-specific theories, concepts, and approaches to address a common problem [
