We expect that the modern tools of molecular biology will provide insight beyond merely defining causative agents for newly discovered infectious diseases, but will also address the evolution ofÂ the COVID-19 pathogen, the persistence of infectious cycles in nature, the analysis of the causes of the pandemic, and the susceptibility mechanisms of specific host groups. This knowledge will contribute to the creation of DNA and RNA banking to study pathogenic factors encoding genes [
