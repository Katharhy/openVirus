<p id="Par17">Two mathematical models applicable to a pandemic like COVID-19 are stochastic and SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered). Stochastic modeling entails all mathematical models with the random variable in the function assignment. That is, stochastic modeling uses random assignment for forecasting functions, which is helpful in the early stages of virus propagation [
