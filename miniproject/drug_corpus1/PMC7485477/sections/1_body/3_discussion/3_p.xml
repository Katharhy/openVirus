<p>During the study period, five patients died because of the infection. All of them had comorbidities, such as ischemic heart disease and diabetes in agreement with a study conducted in China, where cardiovascular diseases, diabetes millets, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, hypertension, and cancers were found as the main risk factors for death.

 <xref rid="b6-mjhid-12-1-e2020061" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In agreement with this, we found a significant association between age and case fatality rate, and all the patients who died were older than 60 years old. Case fatality rates vary according to country; for example, case fatality rates of 4%, 4â€“8%, and 1.2% have been reported in China,

 <xref rid="b8-mjhid-12-1-e2020061" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and Germany,
 <xref rid="b9-mjhid-12-1-e2020061" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> respectively. In our study, the case fatality rate was 1.1%, while the recovery rate was 85%. The low case fatality rate and high cure rate in the Kurdistan Region may be partially attributable to the early diagnosis of the infection and the early initiation of treatment. The majority of cases were young or middle-aged adults. If a higher proportion of the infections had occurred among older adults, such as in Italy, the fatality rate would probably have been higher.
