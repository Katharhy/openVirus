<p id="p0065">Future prospective cohort studies with defined and longitudinal microbiological sampling must be designed with these factors in mind. In particular, they must control for patient factors such as length of mechanical ventilation, use of immunosuppression, and line days. They must consider institution factors, such as number of cases of COVID-19, staffing during the pandemic, and potential compromise in routine infection prevention measures. Controlling for these factors prospectively may provide greater insight into secondary infection in COVID-19 and facilitate assessment of whether observed rates of infection differ from normal patterns of nosocomial infection. Greater understanding of the relationship of bacterial and fungal infection with COVID-19 will support the development of targeted antimicrobial stewardship interventions and a better understanding for the potential long-term impact on AMR. In patients meeting the WHO guidelines for avoidance of antimicrobial prescribing in COVID-19,[
