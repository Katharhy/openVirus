<p id="p0040">Based on prior respiratory viral pandemics with influenza, concerns were initially raised regarding the potential for high rates of bacterial and fungal co-infection, often associated with high mortality.[

 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>] To date in COVID-19, evidence has not emerged to support concerns regarding increased rates of co-infection with SARS-CoV-2. Whilst documented hospital acquired infection in COVID-19 cases has been higher, these appear to be largely associated with critical care and to be common nosocomial infections rather than directly attributable to COVID-19. Similarly, in previous coronavirus pandemics and epidemics, such as SARS-1 and MERS, little evidence of bacterial and fungal infection has been reported.[
