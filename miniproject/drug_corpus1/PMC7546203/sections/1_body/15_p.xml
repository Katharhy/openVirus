<p id="p0085">In conclusion, evidence so far suggests that detection of bacterial and fungal infection in COVID-19 is relatively low. Risk factors for nosocomial infection appear to be associated with critical care, especially mechanical ventilation and line use. Current data contrasts that of other respiratory viral pandemics, such as influenza, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may not have a significant impact on bacterial or fungal virulence. Reports of high rates of antimicrobial prescribing in secondary care mean that antimicrobial stewardship interventions must focus on improving diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infection, reducing unnecessary antimicrobial use in low-risk areas, and support access to therapy when required. Prospective studies are urgently required to provide greater insight into the risk factors and potential outcome of bacterial and fungal infection in COVID-19 and support evidence-based recommendations. Although the true impact of COVID-19 on AMR is difficult to predict, the enhanced focus on the consequences of infectious disease on human health should be capitalised upon to support the long-term AMR agenda.</p>
