<p id="p0015">Early literature reported low rates of bacterial and fungal infection in hospitalised COVID-19 patients and high use of empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobials.[

 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>] In hospitals, the difficulty in clinically differentiating COVID-19 and its progression from bacterial and fungal infection provides a significant challenge to clinicians and antimicrobial stewardship.[
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] High quality evidence to support decision making on bacterial and fungal infection in COVID-19 is limited. Clinical uncertainty is likely to drive unnecessary antimicrobial prescribing in COVID-19 patients both on and during admission, potentially increasing the selection of drug-resistant infections.[
