<p id="p0020">In this issue of 
 <italic>Clinical Microbiology and Infection</italic>, Garcia-Vidal and colleagues report their experience of co-infection and superinfection in hospitalised patients with COVID-19.[
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Of 989 patients admitted to a hospital in Barcelona, Spain with COVID-19 31/989 (3%) presented with community-acquired co-infections. The majority of these were respiratory bacterial infections with 
 <italic>Streptococcal pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> pneumonia.[
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Hospital acquired infection was diagnosed in 43/989 (4%) patients, with 25/44 (57%) occurring in critical care. Ventilator associated pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, and bacteraemia were common infections amongst that 4%, with usual nosocomial organisms predominating. These included 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Klebsiella species</italic>, and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>.[
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Coagulase negative staphylococci were the most common organism causing documented blood stream infection (7/16; 44%). Fungal co-infection was identified in 7/989 (0.7%) patients. Three patients were diagnosed with 
 <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> tracheobronchitis and four patients with 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> infection of the blood stream (n=2), urinary tract (n=1), and intra-abdominally (n=1).[
