<p id="p0045">A significant gap in knowledge is whether bacterial and fungal infections in COVID-19 are directly attributable to SARS-CoV-2 or a consequence of factors such as managing high numbers of critically unwell patients, overstretched healthcare systems, and prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation/critical care admission. For example, lower respiratory tract infection with influenza is believed to expose a number of virulence factors that pre-dispose the host to secondary infection with bacteria such as
