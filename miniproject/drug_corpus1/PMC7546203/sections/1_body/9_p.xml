<p id="p0055">When considering ventilator associated pneumonia and invasive fungal infections, little data are available to compare expected rates of infection in local departments to expected rates in non-COVID cohorts. Similarly, for reported contaminants in blood and line culture, data is missing to describe whether these represent an expected increase in the number contaminants per line days based on the expanded critical care capacity and sickness of patient cohorts being managed during this period. Data linking the presence of increased contaminants and true infections, such as Candidaemia or true coagulase negative Staphylococcal blood stream infection, is yet to be explored in depth.</p>
