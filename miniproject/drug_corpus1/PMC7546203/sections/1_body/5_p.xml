<p id="p0035">Whilst both studies report similar rates of bacterial and fungal infection in COVID-19 patients, their limitations must be considered. There were variable and at times low rates of microbiological sampling reported. For example, Garcia-Vidal and colleagues report a limited microbiological sampling being performed after the diagnosis of COVID-19. Hughes and colleagues report a significantly greater proportion of patients having blood culture performed (77% vs. 27%). A limited number of patients in both studies (13% and 25%) underwent respiratory sampling. Furthermore, a high proportion of patients received empirical antimicrobial therapy. These factors could significantly impact the detection rate of infections in hospitalised patients with COVID-19, leading to under-reporting. Generally, the retrospective design of current literature within this field must also acknowledge the inherent biases of these study types, which may over- or under-estimate true infection rates. Many studies investigating infection fail to define the severity of COVID-19 patients included. Furthermore, they often fail to differentiate those who develop infection in critical versus non-critical care.[
