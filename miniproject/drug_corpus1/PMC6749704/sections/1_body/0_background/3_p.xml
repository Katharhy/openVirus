<p id="Par13">Many low- and middle-income countries have generalised epidemics with disease driven by iatrogenic transmission in official and unofficial health care and through other mechanisms such as tattooing and barbershop practices, or they have mixed epidemics where there is generalised transmission in addition to transmission among PWID.
