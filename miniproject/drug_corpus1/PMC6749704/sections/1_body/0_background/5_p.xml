<p id="Par15">In this study, we used a mathematical model to project hepatitis C incidence reduction following the implementation of a variety of test and treat elimination strategies in 167 countries. The strategies included different testing frequencies for PWID and the implementation of general population screening programmes. For each country, we determined which approach could achieve the WHO elimination target of an 80% reduction in hepatitis C incidence by 2030 in the most cost-effective way (as measured by cost per case averted). Where this target was not achievable, we determined the non-dominated scenario with the greatest 2030 incidence reduction. The analysis was performed with and without a theoretical prophylactic hepatitis C vaccine, to determine if additional impact and/or cost savings could be achieved if a vaccine were available, and hence the role and relative importance that a future vaccine has in achieving hepatitis C elimination.</p>
