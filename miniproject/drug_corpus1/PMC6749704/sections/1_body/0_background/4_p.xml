<p id="Par14">Vaccines for hepatitis C have been in pre-clinical development since the discovery of hepatitis C virus almost 30 years ago. Two candidates have reached phase I clinical trials, with one reaching phase II testing (see

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]) did not show efficacy, there remains optimism about the possibility of developing a vaccine for the prevention of hepatitis C within the next 5–10 years. However, vigorous research and development of hepatitis C vaccine candidates and the immunological requirements for natural protective immunity, as well as overall commercial interest in vaccine development, has been dampened by the discovery of direct acting antiviral therapies (DAAs), highly effective treatments for hepatitis C. The global spotlight is currently focussed on the major immediate gains being achieved through treatment. While this is justifiable in the short-term, reflecting on achievements and lessons learnt in other disease areas makes it hard to imagine a vaccine not playing a central role in long-term hepatitis C control strategies for the majority of the world.
