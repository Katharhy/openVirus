<p id="Par35">As the price per vaccination course decreased, the availability of a vaccine reduced the cost of the optimal strategy for an increasing number of countries. At US$200 per vaccination course, the optimal strategy with a vaccine was cheaper than the optimal strategy without a vaccine for 66 (40%) of the countries analysed, leading to an aggregate cost reduction of US$7.4 (US$6.6–8.2) billion across these countries compared to the optimal strategies without a vaccine available (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). This increased to 78 (47%) of the countries analysed and an aggregate cost reduction of US$9.8 (US$8.7–10.8) billion for a US$50 per course vaccine.
