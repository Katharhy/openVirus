<p id="Par18">People in the model were classified as susceptible (uninfected), vaccinated and immune (either through prophylactic vaccination or vaccination post-SVR12), or infected and classified as either undiagnosed, diagnosed antibody positive, diagnosed RNA/cAg positive, in treatment, or treatment failure. All cured individuals were assumed to be susceptible to reinfection and were moved to an alternate susceptible compartment to indicate that they would require future RNA/cAg testing rather than antibody testing due to known past exposure to hepatitis C. Susceptible individuals could become infected according to the current hepatitis C prevalence within their population group, whether or not they were covered by harm reduction (PWID population group only), and a population group-specific calibration constant that allows the model to be adapted to the hepatitis C prevalence in the given setting. For concentrated epidemic settings, the infection constant in the general community was set to zero. A proportion (26% [
