<p id="Par19">Since not everyone is covered by private or public healthcare, the model includes a factor for the fraction of the population in each setting adequately covered with healthcare. Only the fraction who are adequately covered are able to be tested, treated or vaccinated, meaning that some people may never be diagnosed once they are infected. Prophylactic vaccination was modelled to be possible either as part of a testing programme (including following successful treatment completion), or as an age-based programme. In the age-based implementation, people were modelled to be vaccinated as they entered the model without the requirement of testing (i.e. turned 15 years). Vaccination was not modelled to occur for people who were currently chronically infected, including those for whom treatment failed. Cross-setting model parameters and setting-specific model parameters are shown in Table
