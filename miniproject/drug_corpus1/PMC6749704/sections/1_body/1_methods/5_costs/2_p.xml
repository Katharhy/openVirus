<p id="Par27">Hepatitis C testing efficiency for PWID was based on prevalence (i.e. with 50% prevalence, it would require on average two tests to obtain one positive, assuming testing guidelines are frequency-based), while for the general community testing was assumed to be conducted twice as well as random selection (i.e. in a setting with 1% general population prevalence, this implies that 50 tests would be required to find one positive case, and therefore that testing programmes can be slightly targeted to those with possible exposure).</p>
