<p id="Par28">A vaccine was modelled with a baseline cost of US$200 per course based on realistic pricing from other vaccines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], with costs of US$0â€“500 per course tested to determine the threshold price where interventions that included a vaccine would dominate non-vaccine interventions (i.e. cost less and avert more cases). It is likely that a vaccination course will require up to three doses, meaning that this price must include commodity and delivery costs for all doses. All costs were discounted at 3% [
