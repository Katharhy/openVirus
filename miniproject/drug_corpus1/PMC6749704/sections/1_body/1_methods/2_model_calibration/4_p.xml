<p id="Par23">In order to make the model outcomes relevant to sub-populations or sub-national geographical areas that may differ from national averages, independent models were calibrated for theoretical settings that had concentrated epidemics (25%, 50% or 75% hepatitis C prevalence among PWID), generalised epidemics (1%, 2%, 3%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 25% or 30% hepatitis C prevalence among the general community) and mixed epidemics (all combinations of hepatitis C prevalence among PWID and the general community). Results for these general settings are provided in Additional fileÂ
