<p id="Par39">A vaccine also improved the feasibility of reaching the WHO incidence reduction target for many settings in the model, by reducing the testing burden. Consistent with previous work [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], settings with high prevalence among PWID required high-frequency testing programmes in order to reduce incidence. The optimal incidence reduction strategies for 86% of countries required six monthly testing of PWID (Additional file

Such a high testing frequency would be burdensome to both individuals and healthcare systems meaning that for many countries this target may not be achievable through testing and treatment alone. With a vaccine available to reduce reinfection, testing requirements among PWID were reduced to either two yearly for 47 (28%) of the 167 countries or annually for 26 (16%) of the 167 countries (Additional file
