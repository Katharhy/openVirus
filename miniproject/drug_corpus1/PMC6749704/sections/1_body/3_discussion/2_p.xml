<p id="Par38">Without a vaccine or significant additional prevention measures, fewer than 29% of countries analysed were able to reduce hepatitis C incidence by 80% by 2030 in the model (Additional file

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Appendix E—Table S7). More generally, when a vaccine was available the optimal incidence reduction strategy had approximately double the impact in generalised epidemic settings and approximately four times the impact in settings with a high prevalence among PWID (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Appendix C—Figure S11). This clearly demonstrates that while testing and treatment programmes have the potential to produce major gains towards hepatitis C elimination, they have limitations that will require additional intervention, and a hepatitis C vaccine is worth pursuing to fill this gap.
