  <p>Estimated impact of a vaccine on the feasibility and cost of hepatitis C elimination. Total cases averted 2018â€“2030 using the optimal incidence reduction strategies without a vaccine, or with a vaccine that was 50%, 75%, or 90% efficacious (top left); and the number of countries where the WHO incidence reduction target could be achieved with a non-dominated strategy (top right). For different vaccine costs, the number of countries where a vaccine was a component of the optimal strategy (bottom right); and the total reduction in the cost of elimination if it were used in these countries. Uncertainty bounds represent scenarios with 70% and 90% population coverage of testing, treatment, and vaccination compared to a base of 80%</p>
