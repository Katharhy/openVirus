<p id="Par27">In the HA phylogenetic tree, two viruses belonged to clade 6B.1A, including A/Brisbane/02/2018 and a virus similar to a 2018–2019 season-isolated A(H1N1)pdm09 in the Republic of Korea. A/Korea/S0002/2019 and A/Korea/S0003/2019 HA sequences best matched with those of A/Brisbane/02/2018 (98.6 and 98.9% amino-acid identity, respectively). The two viruses fell into different subclades according to discrepancies at residues 158, 202, 277, and 521. A/Korea/S0002/2019 belonged to subclade 6B.1A5 and A/Korea/S0003/2019 to subclade 6B.1A4 (Fig.
