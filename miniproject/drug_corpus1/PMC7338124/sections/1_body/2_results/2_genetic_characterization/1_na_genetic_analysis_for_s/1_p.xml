<p id="Par26">The sequences of the NA gene from oropharyngeal swab samples and the isolated viruses from each patient were determined and were found to have no mutations resulting from adaptation to the cell culture conditions. The H275Y NA substitution (N1 numbering), associated with strong drug resistance, was observed in (GISAID: EPI1602908 and EPI1602906) of A(H1N1)pdm09 isolates from both immunocompromised patients. Other NA drug-resistance substitutions (V116A, I117V, Q136K, D151A, Y155H, R156K, D198V, I222V, R224K, Q226H, E227D, E277Q, R293K, N294S, E425G, and I436N) were not detected. The NA sequences of A/Korea/S0002/2019 and A/Korea/S0003/2019 most closely matched with those of A/Brisbane/02/2018 (98.5 and 98.3% amino-acid identity, respectively). The viruses could be distinguished in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). A/Korea/S0002/2019 had six amino acid differences (T13I, Q51K, F74S, H275Y, D416N, and T452I) relative to A/Brisbane/02/2018 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>), while A/Korea/S0003/2019 had eight (T13I, I29M, P93S, I99V, H275Y, G298A, V321I, and V394I). Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> shows the amino acid substitutions in NA compared with A/Brisbane/02/2018 and their reported effects.
