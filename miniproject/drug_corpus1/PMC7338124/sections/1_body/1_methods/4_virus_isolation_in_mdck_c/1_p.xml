<p id="Par20">Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) cells were seeded at 10
 <sup>5</sup>/mL in T25 flasks with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) in a final volume of 5 mL and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 48 h. When the cells reached 90% confluence, the culture medium was discarded, and the cells were washed three times with warm phosphate-buffered saline. Then, 0.2 mL of clinical specimen was added into a flask to allow the inoculum to adsorb (37 °C, 60 min). Medium (5 mL) containing 2 μL/mL TPCK-trypsin was added to the flask. The culture was observed daily for cytopathic and morphological changes using an inverted light microscope. The culture supernatant was harvested when 75–100% of the infected cells showed cytopathic effect and stored at − 70 °C [
