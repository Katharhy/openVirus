<p id="Par19">RT-PCR was carried out using the Agpath ID One-step RT-PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> lists multiplex (A/B/IPC and H1/H3/IPC) primer and Taq-Man probe sets. The 20-μL reaction mixture contained 5 μL of RNA template, 590 nM primers, 140 nM probe, 10 μL of 2× reaction buffer, 0.8 μL of enzyme mixture, and RNase-free water. RT-PCR was performed on the ABI 7500Fast instrument (Applied Biosystems) with thermocycler conditions for reverse transcription (50 °C, 30 min), hot start DNA Taq polymerase activation (95 °C, 10 min), followed by 40 cycles of denaturation (95 °C, 15 s) and annealing/extension (55 °C, 30 s). Data acquisition and analysis of the real-time PCR assay were performed using SDS software Version 1.4 (Applied Biosystems).
