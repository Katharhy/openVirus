<p id="Par21">Viral RNA was extracted from oropharyngeal swab samples and their isolates using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription was performed to obtain cDNA using the U12 primer, then the HA and NA genes were amplified with specific primers [

The PCR products were purified using the QIAquick™ PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and subjected to direct sequencing using the Big Dye Terminator V.3.0 Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems) together with primers for each PCR fragment (Table

The complete HA (GISAID: EPI1602907 and EPI1602905) and NA (GISAID: EPI1602908 and EPI1602906) sequences were obtained from the 2 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses.
