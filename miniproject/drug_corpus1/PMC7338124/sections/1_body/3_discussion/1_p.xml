 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Notably, such immunocompromised patients, when infected with influenza virus, could shed virus over a prolonged period, likely causing increased transmission. Moreover, as they shed drug-resistant virus while maintaining transmissibility, these patients may constitute a source for spreading drug-resistant influenza in the community [
