<p id="Par31">Although NAI-resistant virus has been rarely observed since 2000, the KCDC, through the KINRESS, identified oseltamivir and peramivir-resistant A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses harboring the H275Y NA variation in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and relapsed lymphoma hospitalized in the same general hospital, with both exhibiting prolonged virus excretion. Although there was no history of the two patients occupying the same ward, we were concerned about potential NAI-resistant virus transmission. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the two isolated A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were genetically distinct. Moreover, there were no additional reports of similar viruses in that hospital. Furthermore, van der Vries et al. [

These results suggest that the H275Y substitution emerges rapidly in immunocompromised hosts under continuous antiviral selective pressure.
