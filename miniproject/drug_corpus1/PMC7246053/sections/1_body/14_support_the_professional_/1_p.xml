<p id="p0350">It is also important to keep our staff and referring dentists engaged and to keep them informed about any plans for reopening one's practice. We should reach out to our referring dentists and physicians to provide clinical support for emergency care. We should also keep them informed of our plans on how we intend to prioritize treatment for patients in accordance with our facility and state guidelines. The staff should be educated and trained to use the COVID-19 tools from state and federal websites regarding the new infection control policies, screening and testing for COVID-19. We should incorporate digital services and telemedicine to deliver care and create an inventory tool to estimate and calculate essential practice items (ie, PPE and drugs). Being a part of the broader solution is important, because any reentry must be in-line with others in the supply chain, including patients, community, ancillary staff, industry, and government. It would be prudent for oral-maxillofacial surgeons to take a fresh look at worst-case scenarios and develop contingency plans. Having a “living revival document” that can easily be updated or withdrawn as necessary is vital. Preparation for (or at least discussion about) the next crisis (or the next phase of the present crisis) among stakeholders in each practice at this time is highly recommended. Just as debriefings after emergency practice drills will be the most informative, we learn the most while the crisis is unfolding. The challenges, responses, and scientific evidence should be well-documented.</p>
