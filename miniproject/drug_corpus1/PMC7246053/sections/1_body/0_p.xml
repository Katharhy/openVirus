<p id="p0010">In the past 2 decades, beta coronaviruses have caused 3 major infection outbreaks, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (CoV) in 2002 to 2003, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV in 2012 and, more recently, SARS-CoV2 in 2019 and 2020. In 2005, Michael Osterholm from the Center for Infectious Research and Policy in Minneapolis, and other infectious disease experts, predicted the occurrence of an unavoidable influenza pandemic and recognized how unprepared our current healthcare systems were to manage such an event.

 </xref> Unlike the previous 2 outbreaks, which were regional epidemics, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV2, spread within a few weeks across the globe, disrupting the social, economic, and emotional well-being of our societies. This rapid spread to every continent resulted, in part, from the effects of traveling and globalization and, in part, from the greater infectivity and transmission of SARS-CoV2.

 <sub>0</sub> basic reproduction number, 2.2). SARS-CoV2 is a B lineage beta coronavirus, which is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. Similar to SARS-CoV, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor is the main entry path for SARS-CoV2. Protease activation on the S (spike) protein facilitates coronavirus entry into the cells. The higher affinity (10- to 20-fold) of the S protein of SARS-CoV2 for the human ACE2 receptor might explain the rapid human-to-human transmission compared with that of SAR-CoV.
