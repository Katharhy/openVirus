<p id="p0030">The aim of this report is to review some of the considerations in oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS) practice as we move from the current situation of strict social and physical distancing rules to phased clinical care during this evolving global pandemic. We included some pragmatic suggestions to leverage telemedicine for emergency care and nonurgent consultations, to adopt and scale machine-learning tools and chatbots to improve surgical workflow efficiency in the operating room (OR), changes in infection control policies, surgical prioritization, screening and testing for COVID-19, and considerations for effective didactic curriculum changes, research opportunities, and business considerations. The suggestions for infection control policies, optimization of personal protective equipment (PPE), diagnostic testing, and surgical prioritization should be considered in conjunction with, and be guided by one's institution, the local, state, and/or federal (ie, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [CMS]) authorities, and other joint professional organizations.</p>
