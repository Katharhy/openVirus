<p id="p0150">The potential incorporation of telemedicine OMS consultation services in the emergency room must include input from multiple entities, including emergency physicians, trauma surgeons, other sister specialties (ie, otolaryngology, plastic surgery), billing and compliance officers, and healthcare information technology teams. The designation of pathways of care for synchronous or asynchronous telemedicine consultations versus in-person consultations must be discussed and determined, with all contingents in agreement. Oral-maxillofacial surgeons might also require additional availability in their outpatient practices to provide timely consultations and procedural care for emergency room patients discharged after a telemedicine consultation. The financial effects of such remote digital healthcare services when treating patients without medical or dental insurance must also be considered. The alterations in this emergency room consultation delivery care model will initially require additional attending level expertise in training programs and increased communication with the office management staff involved in scheduling.</p>
