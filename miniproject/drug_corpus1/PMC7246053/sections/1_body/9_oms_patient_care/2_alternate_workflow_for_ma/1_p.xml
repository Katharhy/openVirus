<p id="p0145">The COVID-19 crisis has forced us to develop alternate paths to provide urgent and emergent care to our patients with limited in-person interaction, optimize the use of PPE, and minimize the risk of exposure and transmission of SARS-CoV2. This has allowed oral-maxillofacial surgeons to support our institutions in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 while we treated patients with maxillofacial injuries and head and neck infections, among many other conditions, using a hybrid model of telemedicine and in-person evaluations. The emergency room can be a potentially high-risk area for COVID-19 transmission and other infections requiring the use of significant PPE for airborne flu-droplet precautions. Thus, teleconsultation services should be considered as an alternative to our current workflow to increase efficiency and decrease the risk of exposure to infection, especially given the inconvenience of performing procedures in areas of the hospital not dedicated to oral and maxillofacial surgical care.</p>
