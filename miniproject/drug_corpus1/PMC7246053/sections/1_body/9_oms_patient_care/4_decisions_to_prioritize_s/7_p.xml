<p id="p0190">Outpatient OMS clinics, especially in hospital settings, will require a new approach to maintain patient volume. The schedules must be modified to limit crowding and maintain safe distances in designated waiting areas. One method to accomplish this would be to continue video telemedicine triage services for consultations and to schedule surgical procedures more efficiently. The schedules should accommodate a patient's needs, and definitive treatment should be rendered whenever possible to avoid multiple visits. Streamlining procedures will allow for the performance of high-risk AGPs in designated areas with provisions for germicidal UV light disinfection, in addition to chemical disinfection, or in negative pressure rooms, using appropriate PPE (ie, surgical N95 respirator, eye protection, face shield, fluid-resistant disposable gown, booties). Performing OMS procedures during the pandemic and in the near future with additional PPE and new infection control guidelines can be time consuming, demanding, and tedious. Oral-maxillofacial surgeons should be careful to plan for additional time, delegate tasks, and request help from colleagues to reduce medical errors when working in stressful situations.
