 </xref> developed a more comprehensive scoring system for medically necessary and time sensitive procedures (MeNTS) using the principles of maximizing benefit and minimizing harm and risk and considering patient, procedure, and disease factors. The MeNTS scoring system has 21 questions with a 5-point scale (score range, 21 to 105), which considers each patient's medical comorbidities, COVID-19 status and/or exposure risk, alternative nonoperative options, including no treatment and the effects of delay in treatment on the degree of difficulty of the procedure, and the outcome. The lower the score, the less risk to the patient, surgical team, and healthcare system as a whole (available at:

The developers are currently validating the MeNTS scoring system.

The American College of Surgeons has recommended using this method or a similar method applicable to each institution. Ultimately, surgeons must be fair to their patients and make the best clinical and most ethical decision for their patients. For oral-maxillofacial surgeons, among the several medically necessary conditions we treat, apart from emergencies, the most time-sensitive procedures include treatment of malignancy (eg, oral cancer, salivary gland malignancy, osteosarcoma), neurologic injuries, aggressive benign jaw tumors, congenital craniofacial anomalies (eg, cleft palate repair before speech development), and chronic pain conditions recalcitrant to medical therapy.
