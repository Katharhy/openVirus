<p id="p0255">Challenges that were considered unsurmountable can now present as opportunities. At the top of our list are those relating to the best practices for OMS as we return to a new normal for caring for our patients and educating the next generation. The effects of the changes we make to provide safe quality care will be significant and should be supported by science. The research questions can be divided into the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 (eg, affecting patient care, workflow, education). Teams of academic OMS programs in their respective geographic regions can address these questions, some of which we have included but are certainly not limited to those listed:
