<p id="p0340">From the standpoint of practice business, no good comparison is available for the situation of a global pandemic. We can extrapolate some aspects from our experiences during natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina or similar events. During these uncertain times, the observed financial risk should not tempt us to restart our clinical operations earlier than the recommendations from our local and state authorities. It is imperative to follow their guidance, to avoid the risk of exposure of our HCP and patients, and to preserve the necessary resources for our professional colleagues during this period of scarcity.</p>
