<p id="p0355">All educational institutions and academic medical centers have lost revenue as the result of suspension of their programs and the increased costs of supporting the employees of the institutions. In addition, the economic downturn will continue the losses. This could lead to layoffs, which will be disruptive to many OMS programs, which do not have extensive employee numbers. We must find ways to reduce costs to protect the core and character of our programs. Hiring freezes, travel restrictions, and elimination of cost of living increases could all be cost-saving methods. Capital budget requests will probably be put on hold, most likely for 2Â years. University and program endowments are often restricted to specific purposes set by the donors and cannot be used as a reserve fund. The decline in the investment market has resulted in a decline in the market value of the endowments. The monies spun off the principal of these endowments, which are used to support the institution's operations will also require cost reductions by individual operating units.</p>
