<p id="p0125">In a study of air sample analysis for SARS-CoV2 RNA concentrations, higher levels (18 to 42 copies/m
 <sup>3</sup>) were found in the rooms used for removal of protective clothing, with much lower levels (6 copies/m
 <sup>3</sup>) found in patient treatment areas such as ICUs and wards designated for patients with COVID-19. This likely resulted from the high air exchange rates in these negative pressure areas.

 </xref> In the hospital setting, ORs and ICUs have usually been designed to accommodate these pressure differentials; thus, the option will be more feasible in the hospital setting. For outpatient clinics, the use of HEPA filtration and upper room UVGI methods, along with appropriate PPE, might be good options to decrease infection from AGPs.
