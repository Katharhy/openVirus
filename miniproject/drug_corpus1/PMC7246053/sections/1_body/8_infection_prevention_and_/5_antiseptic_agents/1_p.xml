<p id="p0135">The antimicrobial action of povidone iodine (PVP-I) has been well established in surgery for surgical skin site preparation (7 to 10% PVP-I). The free iodine in PVP-I is able to inactivate proteins, oxidize nucleic acids, and destroy microbes. The experience during the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics has shown that PVP-I has virucidal effects in vitro, and it can potentially be used as an antiseptic rinse.

They aimed to decrease the risk to HCP and destroy the virus that had entered the upper aerodigestive tract before it had an opportunity to infect the host.
