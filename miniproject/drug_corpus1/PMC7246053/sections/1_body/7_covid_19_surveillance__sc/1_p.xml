<p id="p0045">Ongoing surveillance is crucial to containing any epidemic (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> ). Surveillance includes screening, testing, tracing, and monitoring the incidence of new cases. The CDC has recommended that all frontline HCP should be trained and prepared to screen patients for COVID-19. The results of testing should be reported to the local or state authorities and the CDC to allow for proper surveillance. Symptom questionnaires must be completed before scheduling an outpatient clinic visit and updated on arrival of the patient to capture all presymptomatic cases. COVID-19 screening should include questions regarding recent travel to hotspots, recent exposure to an infected individual, previous testing for, or a diagnosis of COVID-19, any current investigation (self or family member), close contact (≥15 minutes within 6 ft) with anyone with a diagnosis of COVID-19, and, any symptoms experienced within the previous 2 to 14 days. These symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and/or a new loss of taste or smell. The most common symptoms have been fever (83 to 99% of cases), cough (59 to 82%), fatigue (44 to 70%), and anorexia (40 to 84% of cases).
