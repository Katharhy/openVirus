 </xref> assessed the 50% tissue-culture infectious dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) of viable virus/1 mL of collection medium for SARS-CoV1 and SARS-CoV2. They found that the half-lives of both viruses, measured by exponential decay at a temperature of 21° to 23°C and 40% humidity, were lowest for copper (4 to 8 hours), stainless steel (5.6 hours), plastic (6.8 hours), and highest for cardboard (&gt;8 hours). They found that viable virus can be detected on these inanimate objects for up to 72 hours, with implications for how we use and dispose packing materials such as plastic and cardboard and which disinfectants should be used to cleanse our operatory.
