<p>The major electronic databases, that is, Embase, EconLit, Google Scholar, Medline, PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus, Springer Link and Science Direct databases, were searched using both “text words” and “thesaurus terms,” focusing on viral infections, COVID‐19 and healthcare system in Pakistan. The references of selected papers were also examined to identify relevant literature. We also screened the databases of leading organizations, such as CDC, the WHO and so forth. The commentaries, editorials, perspective articles and book chapters were also included because of the limited data published in scientific journals. As provided in the flow diagram (Figure 
 <xref rid="hpm3016-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), the initial literature search resulted in 171 potentially relevant citations. Of these, 33 duplicates were detected in Endnote and were omitted. Out of the 138 remaining articles, 73 were excluded based on abstracts being irrelevant. Subsequently, 65 studies were carefully examined, and 44 articles were excluded at this stage for failing to present pertinent information. In the final grouping, 24 articles were selected for this review.
