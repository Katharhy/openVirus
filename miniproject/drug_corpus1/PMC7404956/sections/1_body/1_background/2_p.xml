<p>The emergence and reemergence of human coronaviruses (CoVs) has always triggered a new global threat.

 </xref> In the 1960s, Tyrell and Bynoe identified the first CoV (named B814) in human tracheal organ cultures.

 </xref> Broadly distributed CoVs are enveloped single‐stranded RNA viruses with a characteristic “halo appearance” (i.e., a corona on electron microscopy). Since their first identification, CoVs have been graded into four subgroups: alpha, beta, delta and gamma.

 </xref> Among these, alpha and beta CoVs are known to infect humans. The alpha coronavirus subgroup comprises of 229E and NL63, and the beta coronavirus subgroup includes OC43, HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)‐CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)‐CoV. Four human CoVs (i.e., HCoV‐229E, HCoV‐OC43, HCoV‐NL63 and HCoV‐HKU1) are endemic in humans and are primarily related to moderate, self‐limiting respiratory diseases. In comparison, SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV are zoonotic in origin and cause severe respiratory syndromes and pose a considerable threat to humans with their high mortality rates.
