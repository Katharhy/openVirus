 </xref> In this regard, the healthcare system and financial stability of nations plays a crucial role in achieving the required standards of prevention and management strategies. Recently, the WHO has alarmed that the increase of COVID‐19 cases from the Eastern Mediterranean Region is of great concern due to a number of deficits in their healthcare systems and financial instability.
