    "The emergence of a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 during December 2019, has caused the global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is officially announced to be a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The increasing burden from this pandemic is seriously affecting everyone’s life, and threating the global public health. Understanding the transmission, survival, and evolution of the virus in the environment will assist in the prevention, control, treatment, and eradication of its infection. Herein, we aimed to elucidate the environmental impacts on the transmission and evolution of SARS-CoV-2, based on briefly introducing this respiratory virus. Future research objectives for the prevention and control of these contagious viruses and their related diseases are highlighted from the perspective of environmental science. This review should be of great help to prevent and control the epidemics caused by emerging respiratory coronaviruses (CoVs). Graphical abstract Image 1 Highlights • Several environmental factors are involved in the transmission of respiratory CoVs.• Genetic factors and human activities can affect the evolution of respiratory CoVs.• Understanding environmental impacts on transmission and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is of great importance. Summary: More knowledge on the transmission and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment is urgently needed."
