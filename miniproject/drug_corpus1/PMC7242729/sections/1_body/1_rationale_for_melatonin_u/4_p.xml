<p>Autophagy plays an important role both in the antiviral defense responses and in the promotion of the different stages of the viral life cycle. The fact that melatonin is a regulator of autophagy due to its properties as a potent antioxidant and suppressor of endoplasmic reticulum stress suggests a potential beneficial role for this molecule in the management of some viral infections (

Viruses, including Ebola, dengue, encephalomyocarditis, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, rabbit hemorrhagic disease, human papilloma, and inter alia, have demonstrated the success of melatonin in protecting against viral infections. There is no evidence that melatonin is viricidal but rather it reduces the severity of these infections (
