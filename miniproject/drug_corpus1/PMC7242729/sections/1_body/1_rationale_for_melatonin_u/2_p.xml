<p>Chen et al. (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) have recently demonstrated immunological differences between moderate vs. severe COVID-19 patients. They demonstrate that CD8+ and CD4+ T cell numbers decrease significantly in patients with severe COVID-19. In patients with moderate COVID-19 the concentrations of IL-10, IL-6, and TNFα are within normal limits, and in the most severe patients they are very high. These cytokines are produced by macrophages and are involved in the cytokine storm (

In turn, the components released from damaged cells, particularly from stressed mitochondria, including mitochondrial DNA, cardiolipin, cytochrome C and also segments of nuclear DNA are recognized as damage associated molecular patterns by intra and intercellular immune molecules including toll-like receptors 4,7, and 9. Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase triggers a further large-scale proinflammatory cytokine release known as the “secondary cytokine storm”. If this vicious cycle is not interrupted, it results in widespread apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necrosis even of non-infected cells (
