<p>COVID-19 infection may attack the melatonin synthetic pathway resulting in reduced melatonin levels at a time when melatonin is most needed (

Melatonin is a potent antioxidant and immune regulator that not only suppresses oxidative stress but also controls the innate immune response and promotes the adaptive immune response (

The melatonin synthesized in the pineal gland is &lt;5% of the total melatonin produced. The melatonin produced in the mitochondria is not discharged into the circulation, but is used by the cells that produce it (
