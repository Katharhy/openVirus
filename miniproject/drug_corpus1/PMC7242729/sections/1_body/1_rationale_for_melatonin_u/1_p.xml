<p>Little is known about the crucial factors of disease severity and immune alteration produced by COVID-19 infection in humans (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Cytokines and chemokines play important roles in immunity, demonstrating that an exaggerated immune response causes lung damage and a greater probability of death. In individuals infected with COVID-19, interleukin (IL)−10, 6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -α are increased during the disease. The more severe patients have very high levels of IL-10, IL-6, and TNFα; and fewer CD8+ and CD4+ T cells (
