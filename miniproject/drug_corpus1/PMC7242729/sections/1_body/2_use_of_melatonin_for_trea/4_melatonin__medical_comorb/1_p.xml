<p>Aging is a biological process that contributes to an increase in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In the HEIJO-KYO cohort (cohort of elderly Japanese patients), urinary excretion of melatonin was associated with reduced nocturnal systolic blood pressure, independent of other cardiovascular risk factors. More precisely, an increase in urinary melatonin excretion from 4.2 to 10.5 μg caused a 2 mmHg decrease in nocturnal systolic blood pressure. Patients who took melatonin at a dose of 2–5 mg/day for 7–90 days uniformly showed a reduction in night-time blood pressure (
