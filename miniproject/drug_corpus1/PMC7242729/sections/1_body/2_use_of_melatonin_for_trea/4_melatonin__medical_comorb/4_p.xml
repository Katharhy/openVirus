<p>Several studies have shown that 75% of COVID-19 patients have 1 or 2 medical comorbidities (

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Other authors have reported that patients with hypertension, obesity, and diabetes are more likely to develop more severe COVID-19 infection, including death (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). The occurrence of heart failure and myocardial infarction is plausible in these patients. The immune system of these patients is altered, with a reduced immune response (
