<p>In elderly patients with medical comorbidities, treatment with melatonin is beneficial, as it strengthens the immune response. We suggest a daily dose of ~3 mg to a maximum of 10 mg, 30â€“60 min before bedtime to better simulate the normal physiological circadian rhythm of melatonin (

Furthermore, it may be beneficial in people who are at high risk of contracting COVID-19 infection, local health workers, where preventive treatment with melatonin would favor maximizing the immune response, along with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. A daily dose of roughly 40 mg or higher would not seem an inappropriate amount (
