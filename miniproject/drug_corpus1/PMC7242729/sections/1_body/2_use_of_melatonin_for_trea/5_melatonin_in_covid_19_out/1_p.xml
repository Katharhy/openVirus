<p>While physiological melatonin concentrations in biological fluids oscillate between 10
 <sup>−10</sup> and 10
 <sup>−11</sup> M range, a concentration of 10
 <sup>−5</sup> M is required to elicit significant pharmacological effects (

Melatonin protects against cellular damage induced by reactive oxidative species, thus justifying the need of a more generous supplementation of exogenous melatonin in life-threatening pathologies. Oral melatonin use by humans is generally considered safe, with minor side effects including headache, drowsiness, etc. (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). To date, the best dose of melatonin in older adults has not been determined, as its endogenous levels are subject to altered pharmacokinetics. This causes intra-individual variability (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). In a meta-analysis of 50 studies, some of which were not blinded, the efficacy of oral melatonin administration (1–20 mg) was evaluated caused only a few minor adverse side effects, commonly fatigue, and drowsiness (
