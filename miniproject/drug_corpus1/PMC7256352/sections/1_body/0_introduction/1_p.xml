<p>The new coronavirus (CoV), known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2, which is currently spreading around the world, can lead to a respiratory illness that can be exacerbated (Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Novel, 
 <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Xu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0075" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The disease known as CoV diseases-19 (COVID-19) appears to induce a mortality rate of less than 2%, which is lesser that of most epidemics that have ever become global headlines (Dong et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Pan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). CoVs are very similar to influenza viruses and show almost identical symptoms (Heymann &amp; Shindo, 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Rothan &amp; Byrareddy, 
 <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Two recent outbreaks of the new CoV, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have originated from animals (Gretebeck &amp; Subbarao, 
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Song et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Yao et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0078" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The diseases caused by these viruses were extremely fatal to humans, and very few cases were reported as mild or asymptomatic. However, it has been reported that the mortality rate of COVID-19 has been more than that of SARS and MERS (Mahase, 
 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Peeri et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).
