<p>Drug re-purposing means that by examining existing drugs, they will find therapeutic effects on new diseases (Aggarwal et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Khan, Jha, et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Senathilake et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). BSAAs are small molecules that can inhibit different infections by blocking the viral replication (Pant et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Xiong et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0074" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Xu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0075" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). These drugs block the virus or host-related factors and thus prevent the virus from proliferating, then lowering the level of the virus in the body to an extent that the immune system can inhibit their infection (Cui et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Ji &amp; Li, 
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). BSAA has received special attention with the emergence of numerous new viral diseases. Re-purposing existing drugs, or even rejected drugs, for viral diseases increases the possibility of market success as well as reducing the costs and time required to launch it. The benefit of drug re-purposing is that drug details, such as the stages of chemical synthesis, mass production processes, various stages of clinical trials and many more have been identified beforehand (Aanouz et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Gupta et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).
