<p>In the case of CoV, patients were received off-label anti-viral drugs as well as immunomodulators, either solely or combined, to reduce severe disease symptoms (Zumla et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0080" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). However, due to the lack of patient, therapeutic consistency, and verified standard efficiency measurement is a complicated process. Although interferon does not result in improved clinical consequence in MERS-CoV patients (Morra et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), a fixed dose combination of lopinavir/ritonavir-interferon β is efficient to reduce MERS-CoV infections (Arabi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Muralidharan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Sheahan et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) showed that RDV stimulated superior anti-viral function against MERS-CoV both
