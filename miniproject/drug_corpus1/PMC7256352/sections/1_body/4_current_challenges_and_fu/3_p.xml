<p>Nucleoside/nucleotide analogues inhibit virus replication by blocking the activity of the polymerase enzyme in the virus (Chhikara et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Menéndez-Arias et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The usage of nucleoside/nucleotide analogues is a major step in the treatment of patients infected with CoVs due to the appropriate antiviral response (Chhikara et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). However, the application of these drugs may lead to genetic variation and subsequent mutation emergence. Hence, the safety of RDV and its broad-spectrum anti-viral activity should be considered before suggesting them as potential alternative candidates for clinical development.
