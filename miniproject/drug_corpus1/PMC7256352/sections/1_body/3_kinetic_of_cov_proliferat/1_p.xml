<p>The kinetics of SARS- or MERS-CoV proliferation in animal models is significantly different compared to that in humans. In animal, SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV proliferation in the lung tissue reaches to the maximum at 2 dpi and mortality is stimulated at 7–10 dpi (Douglas et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Sheahan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Thus, the therapeutic window to control infected animal model prior to the peak of CoV proliferation is less than 2 days. In human, MERS-CoV replication in the lung tissue reaches the maximum at 7–10 days after the onset of infections and the disease severity increases to death within ∼21 days (Choi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Oh et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Thus, the time for therapeutic handling is substantially divergent in humans and experimentally infected animal models. Although, applying RDV led to a reduction in MERS-CoV pathogenesis and pronounced decrease in viral dose, therapeutic handling did not thoroughly reduce infection. Furthermore, at high levels of CoV, RDV is unable to sustain viral viability and pulmonary cells functionality, despite of remarkable decrease in viral loads. These outcomes are the same as those reported for SARS-CoV, where therapeutic platforms were launched after the peak of virus titer and lung injury did not show any progress in resultant outcomes (Sheahan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Since SARS- and MERS-CoV infections are controlled by both CoVs and host immune system modulators, therefore early handling of antiviral therapeutics either solely or in combination with other therapeutic drugs, and based on the stage of the disorder progression, can inhibit virus proliferation and immunopathology, switch on repairing systems, or control the pulmonary homeostasis.
