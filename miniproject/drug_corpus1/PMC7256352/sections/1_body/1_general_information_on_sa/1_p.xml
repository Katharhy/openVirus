<p>CoVs are a large family of viruses ranging from the common cold virus to the cause of SARS (Cascella et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Paules et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The structure of CoV has a common RNA genome and is classified as enveloped viruses (Mackie, 
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 originating in China and the city of Wuhan is believed to be a member of the Corona family, which has infected many people to date (Lai et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Despite the emergence of the virus in China, it is spreading rapidly to other parts of the world (Lai et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Zhu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0079" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Similar cases have been reported in other countries such as Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Australia, and the United States, and even more recently in Iran (Velavan &amp; Meyer, 
 <xref rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Zhu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0079" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The disease can be spread through close contact with the infected person, handling contaminated equipment and airborne outbreaks (Velavan &amp; Meyer, 
 <xref rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Most people with hypertension, diabetes, respiratory problems, and weak immune systems are at the higher risk to infection and the likely death from it (Fang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).
