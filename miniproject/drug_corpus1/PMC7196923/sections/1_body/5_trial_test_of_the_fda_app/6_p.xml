<p>Cao et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) have conducted trial test using lopinavir-ritonavir antiviral drugs for COVID-19 patients. A total of 199 patients were enrolled for the test, 99 patients were assigned to the lopinavir-ritonavir group, remaining 100 patients to be treated in the standard care group, resulting the mortality rate was similar in both lopinavir-ritonavir group and standard care group. They found that lopinavir-ritonavir treatment failed to significantly accelerate clinical improvement, reduce mortality, diminish throat viral RNA detectability in patients with serious COVID-19. In case of the severe COVID-19 adult patients, no benefit was observed with lopinavir-ritonavir treatment in comparison to the standard care group. Such study has found that lopinavir-ritonavir does not seem to be effective for COVID-19 patients and these combinations has produced more side effects (Cao et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). In summary, the antiviral drugs, alone and in combination, have been tested in human body, all showed some evidence of effectiveness against SARS and MERS, they seem not to be effective for COVID-19 (Baden &amp; Rubin,
