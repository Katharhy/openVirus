<p>Z. Jin et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) have screened a library of âˆ¼10,000 compounds which are consisting of approval drugs, clinical trial drugs and natural products. They were used combined structural-based abinitio, drug design, and high-throughput screening to identified two drugs of these compound are Ebselen and thiadiazolidinone-8 (TDZD-8). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR demonstrated that in comparison to treatment in the absence of inhibitor, treatment of Ebselen reduced the amount of COVID-19 by 20.3-fold, and TDZD-8 and N3 (N3 inhibitor designed by Z. Jin et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) that can inhibit multiple Coronavirus M
 <sup>pro</sup> S including those from COVID-19 and MERS-CoV) showed 10.9-fold and 8.4-fold reduction in COVID-19 growth, respectively. These data suggested that Ebselen as a potential antiviral inhibitor for COVID-19 treatment.
