<p>Other most important research on plasma therapy is ongoing. Several convalescent patients are donating plasma against COVID-19 based on the positive results of another coronavirus (Koenig, 
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Mair-Jenkins et al., 2015). Surprisingly, it has preliminarily obtained favourable results in severe COVID-19 patients. On the other hand, the recombinant human monoclonal antibody is a straightforward path to neutralize viral load of COVID-19. CR3022 is a coronavirus-specific human monoclonal antibody that can bind to the receptor-binding domain of COVID-19, this has the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics of COVID-19 disease (Tian et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Other monoclonal, m396, CR3014 antibodies, neutralizing COVID-19 that may be an alternative for the treatment of more severe cases (Zhang &amp; Liu, 
 <xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).
