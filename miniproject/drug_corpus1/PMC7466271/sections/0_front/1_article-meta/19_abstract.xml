 <p>Foods, food ingredients, and their balanced consumption are recognized to have an important role in achieving or maintaining a state of wellbeing by acting as carriers of functional components and bioactive molecules. However, the potential contribution of foods to consumersâ€™ health has so far only been partially exploited. The rapidly evolving scenario of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is stimulating profound reflection on the relationships between food and the etiological agent, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, the status of knowledge regarding food as a possible defense/co-therapeutic strategy against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is considered through the discussion of two main current lines of research. One line of research relates to the role of micronutrients, food components, and diets in the strengthening of the immune system through clinical trials; formulations could be developed as immune system enhancers or as co-adjuvants in therapies. The other line of research relates to investigation of the chemical interactions that specific food compounds can have with host or virus targets so as to interfere with the viral infective cycle of SARS-CoV-2. This line requires, as a first step, an in silico evaluation to discover lead compounds, which may be further developed through drug-design studies, in vitro and in vivo tests, and, finally, clinical trials to obtain therapeutic molecules. All of these promising strategies promote the role of food in preventive/co-therapeutic strategies to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
