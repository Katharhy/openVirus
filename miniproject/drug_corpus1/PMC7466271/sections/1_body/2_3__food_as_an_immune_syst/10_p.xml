<p>The efficacy of a ketogenic diet in mitigating COVID-19 symptoms is also being tested (No. 19). In particular, in this clinical study, 15 COVID-19 patients of both sexes (18 years to 80 years) with respiratory failure requiring intubation have been recruited in order to study the efficacy of a ketogenic diet (high-fat, low-carbohydrate, adequate-protein diet) in the reduction of respiratory problems. This trial is supported by data from previous studies on the efficacy of ketone bodies in reducing artificial ventilator duration [

In trial No. 20, a supplement enriched in eicosapentaenoic acid, linolenic acid, and antioxidants is being administered to 30 patients (18 years to 65 years older, treated with standard therapy) of both sexes to preserve their nutritional status and to evaluate the improvement of their health state. The role of polysaccharide intake is also being investigated: in trial No. 21, resistant potato starch is being administrated to 1500 nonhospitalized patients of both sexes (19 years and older, treated with standard therapy) in order to evaluate the reduction of disease progression, whereas in trial No. 22, gum arabic is being administrated to 110 patients of both sexes (5 years to 90 years, treated with standard therapy) as an immunomodulator and anti-inflammatory agent.
