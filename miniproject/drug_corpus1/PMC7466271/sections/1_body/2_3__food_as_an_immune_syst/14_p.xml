<p>Notably, an important aspect to consider in trying to understand the activities and the efficacy of bioactive compounds in food and food nutrients is their bioavailability. Many factors may affect bioavailability, such as: bioaccessibility from natural sources; food matrix effects from synergistic, additive, or antagonist interactions among complex matrix components; molecular structures; physicochemical conditions; and the general health condition, genetic profile, or previous diseases of the consumers [

 <xref rid="B55-foods-09-01036" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The bioactive compounds present in a food may have greater or lesser bioavailability compared with supplements. However, it is important to underline that supplements are often administered at high concentrations to compensate for their low bioavailability, which is due to the absence of passive or active carriers that co-introduce bioactive compounds when they are present as food ingredients. In contrast, the bioaccessibility of some food supplement ingredients is very high because of the absence of interactions with food matrices that may interfere with the digestion process [
