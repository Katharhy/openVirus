<p>It is noteworthy that all of the studies are still ongoing, and that each study presents its own eligibility criteria. In particular, two studies (No. 3 and No. 8) specifically involve elderly patients (over 60 and over 70 years of age, respectively), whereas in the others, participants of different age ranges have been engaged. Three trials are focused on prevention (No. 5, 13, and 23, COVID-19-negative participants), whereas all the others have a co-therapeutic aim. In particular, in trial No. 5, the effect of a prophylactic treatment based on hydroxychloroquine, vitamin C, vitamin D, and zinc supplementations for 600 health workers of both sexes (18 years and older) at high risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 is reported.</p>
