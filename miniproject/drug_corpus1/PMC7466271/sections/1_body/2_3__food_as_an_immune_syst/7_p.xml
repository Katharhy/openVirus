<p>Five studies (No. 4, 8, 12, 13, 14) concern the administration of vitamin D. In clinical trial No. 4, 200 COVID-19 patients of both sexes with mild symptoms (from 40 years to 70 years, treated with standard therapy) are receiving vitamin D supplements in order to improve their immune system and slow down the symptoms progression. In clinical trial No. 8, the potential role of two doses of vitamin D
 <sub>3</sub> (standard and high doses) as a supportive agent for COVID-19 treatment in 260 elderly patients (70 years and older, treated with standard therapy) of both sexes is being evaluated. In trial No. 12, 64 COVID-19 patients of both sexes (17 years and older) are being treated with low or high doses of vitamin D to study their eventual regression of symptoms. Finally, in trial No. 14, 1008 COVID-19 patients of both sexes (from 18 years to 90 years, treated with standard therapy) are receiving calcifediol with the aim of decelerate the syndrome progression. In two clinical trials (No. 3 and 16), vitamin D is being administered together with other supporting agents. In particular, in trial No. 3, vitamin D and zinc gluconate are being administered to 3140 COVID-19 elderly patients of both sexes (60 years and older, treated with standard therapy) in order to evaluate the reduction of inflammatory reactions. In trial No.16, vitamin D is being administered together with aspirin to 1080 COVID-19 patients of both sexes (18 years and older, treated with standard therapy) in order to mitigate the prothrombotic state and reduce hospitalization rates. In this case, the widespread use of vitamin D in clinical trials is also supported by literature data reporting the effectiveness of this micronutrient in the reduction of respiratory infection incidence. For instance, in a study by Urashima et al., vitamin D was administered to 167 schoolchildren via daily supplementation of 1200 IU (International Units), whereas another 167 schoolchildren were treated with a placebo for four months [

 <sub>3</sub> supplementation.
