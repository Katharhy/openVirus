<p>In addition to the micronutrients, food components, and diets being used in the reported clinical trials, other micronutrients with a demonstrated modulation action on the immune system could also be useful in other immune-enhancing formulations to reduce the risks of respiratory tract infections in the case of COVID-19. For instance, the roles of vitamins A, B, and E in the reinforcement of the immune system are well ascertained. Vitamin A supplementation has been shown to reduce respiratory disease incidence only in subjects with malnutrition or, conversely, an increase in disease risks [

The effective role of vitamin E supplementation for the prevention of respiratory diseases is still debated, since it has not yet been demonstrated. However, in a clinical study, daily vitamin E supplementation improved the immune system activity of 33 elderly women and men with immune deficiencies; their immune system activity became comparable to that of the control healthy adult group [
