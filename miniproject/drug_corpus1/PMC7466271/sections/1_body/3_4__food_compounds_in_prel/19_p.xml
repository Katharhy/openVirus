<p>Garlic is a foodstuff known in many cultures for a variety of pharmaceutical properties [
 <xref rid="B103-foods-09-01036" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Since ancient times, essential oils obtained from foods or natural material have played significant roles in pharmaceutics for the presence of potential therapeutic agents [
 <xref rid="B104-foods-09-01036" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Because of the high chemical diversity of secondary metabolites, the use of natural essential oils in order to tackle the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been extensively investigated. Many studies have demonstrated that garlic extracts possess in vitro biological activities, including antiviral activity against respiratory viruses [

 <xref rid="B86-foods-09-01036" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] characterized garlic essential oils via GC–MS (Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry) analysis and docking simulation, finding 17 organosulfur compounds (representing 99.4% of the garlic’s essential oil composition) capable of simultaneously inhibiting both the ACE2 host receptor and SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> through noncovalent binding interactions. In particular, allyl disulfide, allyl trisulfide, diallyl tetrasulfide and trisulfide, and 2-propenyl propyl, which represent the major compounds of garlic essential oils, accounting for 59% of the entire composition, showed the highest affinity toward M
 <sup>pro</sup>. Surprisingly, the same four compounds showed the highest affinity values with the lowest docking score energies toward the ACE2 receptor. The multitargeted activity of these compounds is very promising, blocking the SARS-CoV-2 at two levels; at the entry stage by interacting with the ACE2 host receptor, and during the replication and transcription steps by interacting with M
