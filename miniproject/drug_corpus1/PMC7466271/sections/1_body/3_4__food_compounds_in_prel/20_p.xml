 <sup>pro</sup> of SARS-CoV-2. Teinufolin showed the highest binding affinity with M
 <sup>pro</sup> through six hydrogen interactions and hydrophobic interactions with two amino acids, and pavettanin C1 showed the highest binding affinity with the spike S protein through nine hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions with four amino acids [
