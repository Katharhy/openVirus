<p>Glycyrrhizin, a triterpene saponin, is the main compound of licorice root (

 <xref rid="B93-foods-09-01036" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Moreover, the effect of glycyrrhizin was also studied against the SARS-CoV virus. It was found that glycyrrhizin inhibits viral replication and early steps of the replication cycle (adsorption and entry), with an unclear mode of action [

 <xref rid="B71-foods-09-01036" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], although only in an in silico study, and a potential interaction of glycyrrhizin with a binding site near the hydrophobic site of the human ACE2 receptor was reported.
