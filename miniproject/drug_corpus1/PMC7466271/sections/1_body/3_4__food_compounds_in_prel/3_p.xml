<p>Once molecular targets have been identified, studies to characterize potential drug candidates can be conducted in silico [

If the selected active compounds have good absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties and respect “Lipinski’s Rule of 5” (a series of four rules that suggest if a molecule can be properly orally administrated, if more than one rule is not respected the molecule is not suitable for oral administration), then in vitro and in vivo analyses are required in order to define their efficacy, safety, and toxicological profile. Finally, clinical trials will be necessary to investigate the potential therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of the selected molecules [

An important advantage of these approaches is the rapid assessment of efficiency and toxicity in cell lines or animal studies in order to optimize the final choice. This advantage is essential, considering the rapid infection spread and the virus’ lethality.
