<p>The main recent in silico studies regarding the affinity of naturally-occurring compounds for either viral targets or host targets to counteract SARS-CoV-2 are discussed below. The selection of molecules as potential COVID-19 antagonists for in silico studies was based on their in vitro activity on other coronaviruses, as previously described. The compound affinity depends on the type and amount of bonding that occurs with the active site of the protein [
