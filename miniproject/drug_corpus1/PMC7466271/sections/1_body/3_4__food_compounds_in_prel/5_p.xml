<p>Many studies have been focused on the activity of compounds isolated from food sources, such as glycyrrhizin, glabridin, glycyrrhetinic acid, and many polyphenols, such as caffeic acid, resveratrol, kaempferol, curcumin, demetoxicurcumin, quercetin, catechin, epicatechin gallate, hesperetin, hesperidin, Î´-viniferin, and myricitrin. The results described hereinafter are also summarized in

 <sup>pro</sup> has become the main virus target studied in in silico studies, followed by the human ACE2 receptor, SARS-CoV-2 spike S protein and RNA polymerase. However, the examined molecules should also be tested against other human and/or virus targets, since some molecules, such as curcumin, hesperidin, catechin, and garlic and cinnamon compounds, have been shown to be potentially active against other targets as well. Multitarget antiviral molecules can have greater efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis than molecules targeting a single protein [

Several food compounds have been shown to be active against other coronaviruses (mainly SARS-CoV), whereas other molecules, such as demethoxycurcumin and epicatechingallate, have not been investigated against coronaviruses but are being investigated because of their chemical similarities to well-known antiviral analogs. Finally, mixtures of compounds derived from food matrices, such as garlic and cinnamon, were separated and then individually analyzed in silico.
