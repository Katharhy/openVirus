<p>To better understand the potential roles of foods and their components in the fight against SARS-CoV-2, a brief description of the potential molecular targets already identified in the infection cycle [
 <xref rid="B62-foods-09-01036" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] is needed. Considering the genomic similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and both MERS-CoV (50%) and SARS-CoV (79%) [
 <xref rid="B63-foods-09-01036" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="B64-foods-09-01036" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], some common features can be outlined in order to identify possible key factors for both drug discovery and food implications. It is well established that during the adsorption stage, the spike S-protein domain on the virus envelope is involved in binding with the human host angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) to attack respiratory cells [
 <xref rid="B65-foods-09-01036" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] in a very similar manner to that of the previous SARS-CoV. However, the much higher infectivity of this virus compared with that of the previous SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections could be explained by the recent finding of a region potentially involved in sialic-acid binding, which regulates host-cell infection [
 <xref rid="B66-foods-09-01036" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Once SARS-CoV-2 is able to enter the cell and use the host translational machinery, the replication stage starts by expressing 16 nonstructural proteins (NSPs). Although not all of these proteins are well characterized yet, some of them may represent a potential target. In particular, viral papain-like protease (PL
 <sup>pro</sup>) and main protease (M
 <sup>pro</sup> or 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>) (the COVID-19 virus M
 <sup>pro</sup> is in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with accession number 6LU7) enzymes that are responsible for the cleavage of several critical viral proteins are considered the Achille’s heels of SARS-CoV-2, showing little structural variation compared with their SARS-CoV counterparts [
 <xref rid="B67-foods-09-01036" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The NSPs assemble into the replicase–transcriptase complex (RTC) and create a suitable environment for viral RNA synthesis. This process follows the translation and assembly of viral replicase complexes. SARS-CoV-2 then releases RNA into the host cell. Genomic RNA is translated into viral replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, which are then cleaved into small products by viral proteinases. Using a discontinuous transcription process, the polymerase produces a series of subgenomic mRNAs that are finally translated into key viral proteins. Viral proteins and genomic RNA are subsequently assembled into virions in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, and then transported via vesicles and released from the cell.
