<p>Caffeic acid is a phenolic acid widely present in a variety of foods (such as fruits, vegetables, coffee, and propolis) [

The potential antagonistic activity of caffeic acid toward SARS-CoV-2 was highlighted in a recent molecular-docking study in which the binding capacities of some propolis compounds against the virus M
 <sup>pro</sup> were investigated [
 <xref rid="B74-foods-09-01036" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. This study showed that caffeic acid and its phenethyl ester have a good affinity for the active site of the enzyme, making these molecules potential virus antagonists. In the same study, two other propolis polyphenolic compounds, chrysin and galangin, were defined as potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents.
