<p>Glycyrrhetinic acid, another well-known triterpene in licorice root derived from the hydrolysis of saponin glycyrrhizic acid, showed the highest binding activity, among 2906 molecules tested, with a pocket of the SARS-CoV-2 spike S-protein that contributes to inhibiting the interaction with the ACE2 protein. This binding is based on hydrophobic and polar interactions with the steroidal scaffold of glycyrrhetinic acid and further reinforced by many ion and hydrogen interactions. The ability of the most active compounds to prevent virus entry in the case of low viral load was further confirmed in an in vitro study [
