<p>The potential contribution of food to consumersâ€™ health and wellbeing has so far been only partially exploited by food science. We expect that the pandemic health emergency and the urgent need to strengthen prevention and control strategies will contribute to the mobilization of research efforts in innovative topics including nutraceutical activities, food/drug interactions, improved bioavailability, and novel formulations of natural food components. Food-based approaches generally offer the advantage of reduced adverse side effects with respect to conventional pharmacology approaches.</p>
