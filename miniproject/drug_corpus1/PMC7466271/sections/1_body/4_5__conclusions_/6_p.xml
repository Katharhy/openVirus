<p>In conclusion, many eating habits and beliefs about the role of food in human health have been shaken like an earthquake. At the end of the two-phase emergency, all of the main institutions, governments, and international agencies involving food and health consumers and the entire food chain are expected to kick-start and modify the global approach to food and its consumption, production, or transformation. In the remote past, humans used food as unique medicine; food-processing industrialization has reduced the natural value of their components, and the excessive use of ultraprocessed food has also favored morbidity conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and so on, that make individuals more susceptible to infective diseases. Therefore, it is arguable that the COVID-19 pandemic may be the first of many other global health crises that could be further exacerbated by progressively weakened immune systems.</p>
