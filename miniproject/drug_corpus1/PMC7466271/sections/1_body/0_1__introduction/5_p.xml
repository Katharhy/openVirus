<p>In this review, the role of food and food nutrients in the prevention and intervention of pathology is thoroughly reviewed. Two ways to tackle COVID-19 with food are discussed, namely the untargeted approach through immune enhancement, which is currently being investigated in clinical trials, and the targeted approach through the interaction with host or virus proteins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01036-f001">Figure 1</xref>), which is being investigated by in silico studies. The strengthening of immune systems has been deeply investigated for previous viral infections; this approach is a part of several ongoing studies related to the current COVID-19 outbreak and is particularly interesting for elderly or immunodepressed populations [

Food and natural products are in fact excellent sources for discovering novel antiviral tools, revealing new structureâ€“activity relationships, and developing effective preventive/co-therapeutic strategies against viral infections [
