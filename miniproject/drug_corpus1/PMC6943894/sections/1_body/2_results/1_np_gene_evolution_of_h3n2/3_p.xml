<p id="Par34">Other than those residues that composed the major sequence backbone, another 15 amino acid changes were observed. Although these changes, we defined them as sporadic substitutions, did not remain conserved in major backbone they appeared in some periods during evolution. FigureÂ 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> showed the percentage of these changes from 1999 to 2018; among these, 31R, 377G, and 450S had been over 50% while each was dominant in a different year. The 31R was dominant in 2000 (53.64%) and was 15% in 2001 while showed low frequency in other years (from 0 to 5.28%) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The 377G was dominant in 2005 (49.84%) as well as 2006 (60.71%) but showed low frequency in other years (from 0 to 6.34%). The 450S showed more than 10% in 2006 (13.39%), 2009, 2010, 2011 (61, 42.63 and 15.13%, respectively) and 2017 (11.75%). Therefore, substitutions at residues 31, 377 or 450 that appeared to have had a higher frequency in NP evolution history were further investigated. We hypothesized that during the virus evolution in human, these produced genetic variations in the internal genes of influenza virus and may play an important role in modulating certain virus properties.
