<p id="Par35">A mini-genome assay was commonly used to investigate viral RNA transcription/replication step, in which viral polymerases and NP play major roles. Alanine mutation at residues 208 and 416 served as negative controls according to previous studies [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. To examine whether genetic variations at these three positions altered polymerase activity, A/Taiwan/3446/02 NP (31 K-377S-450S) was used as a backbone to generate mutations for analysis. Polymerase genes from A/Taiwan/3446/02 strain were used as backbone for this assay. By site-directed mutagenesis, single, double and triple mutations at residues 31, 377 and 450 of NP were generated. The relative polymerase activity pattern between different NPs were similar both at 33 °C and 37 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a and b). Amino acid change at residue 450 (from G to S) statistically decreased polymerase activity as shown when comparing NP
 <sub>31</sub>K-NP
 <sub>377</sub>S-NP
 <sub>450</sub>G (KSG) with NP
 <sub>31</sub>K-NP
 <sub>377</sub>S-NP
 <sub>450</sub>S (KSS) and NP
 <sub>31</sub>K-NP
 <sub>377</sub>G-NP
 <sub>450</sub>G (KGG) with NP
 <sub>31</sub>K-NP
 <sub>377</sub>G-NP
 <sub>450</sub>S (KGS). The single substitution at residue 377 (when comparing KSS with KGS, and RSG with RGG at both temperatures; KSG with KGG at 37 °C and RSS with RGS at 33 °C) did not result in a significant change of activity. Although it showed no significant difference when comparing KSS with RSS, polymerase activity between KSG and RSG as well as between KGG and RGG showed statistical differences that demonstrated the effect of substitution at residue 31 (from K to R). Thus, we concluded that residues 31 and 450 modulated the polymerase activity and NP with 450G had a higher activity while 31R downregulated polymerase activity. To further investigate the role of residues 31, 377 and 450 of NP on polymerase activity, alanine substitutions were analyzed. Both 31A and 450A, but not 377A, statistically decreased polymerase activity when compared with A/Taiwan/3446/02 NP both at 33 °C and 37 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c and d). Thus, we suggest alanine substitution at 31 and 450 of NP dramatically decreased the RdRP activity. Because either mutation in residues 31 or 450 would significantly decrease the polymerase activity, except residue 377, both residues 31 and 450 were critical in regulating the polymerase activity.
