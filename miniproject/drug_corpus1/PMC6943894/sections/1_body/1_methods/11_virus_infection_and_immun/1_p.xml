<p id="Par29">A549 cells were infected with influenza viruses and whole-cell lysates were extracted with 1X lysis buffer at indicated hours post-infection. Lysates were centrifuged (13,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C) and the supernatants were collected for immunoblot assay. NP (ab128193, Abcam) and β-actin (A5411, Sigma) proteins were examined by virus-specific primary antibodies and HRP-labeled secondary antibodies (474–1802, KPL), as indicated.</p>
