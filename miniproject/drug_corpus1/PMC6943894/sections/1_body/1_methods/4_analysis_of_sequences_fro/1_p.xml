<p id="Par21">To expand the evolutional analysis, we collected 14,220 H3N2 NP sequences obtained from the NIAID Influenza Research Database (IRD) (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fludb.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.fludb.org</ext-link>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In this database, the origin of sequence could be set before download, so we further gated by host (human) and year (from 1999 to 2018; every year in separate), and alignments were done on the IRD website. Downloaded aligned nucleotide sequences were translated to amino acid sequences. The number of every amino acid sequence type in each year was calculated and got the percentage in total sequence number; amino acid sequence types more than 5% were listed in TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Since every year was analyzed independently, we could observe the changes in amino acid sequence types through the year, and the most dominant one could be the same in different years (for example, the most dominant type was the same in 2001, 2002 and 2003).
