<p id="Par30">Adult ferrets were housed at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity Bioresources Facility. Male and female ferrets used in this study were 4–6 months old. Experiments were conducted with approval from the University of Melbourne Microbiology and Immunology Animal Ethics Committee, in accordance with the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council code of practice for the care and use of animals for scientific purposes. All ferrets were seronegative by haemagglutination inhibition assay for antibodies to currently circulating influenza viruses before use in experiments. The hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay was conducted on day 0 before infection to ensure the ferrets have not been exposed to human seasonal influenza viruses. Influenza virus strains used in HI assay were A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2), A/California/7/2009 (H1N1), B/Phuket/3073/2013-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like. Sera from all these ferrets showed no detectable HI titers against tested strains, therefore being defined as seronegative.</p>
