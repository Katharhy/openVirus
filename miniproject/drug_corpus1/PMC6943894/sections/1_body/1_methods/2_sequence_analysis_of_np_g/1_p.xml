<p id="Par19">Viral RNAs were extracted from cultured viruses by Total RNA Extraction kit (RBC Bioscience). RNAs were reverse transcribed into cDNA and amplified via PCR (KOD Plus kit, Toyobo) using NP specific primer pair AGCAAAAGCAGGGTTAATAA and ATATCGTCTCGTATTAGTAGAAACAAGGGTATTTTT. The reverse transcription was performed at 42 °C for 60 mins and then 94 °C for 5 mins. The PCR reactions were 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 mins. NP DNA were purified using Gel/PCR DNA Fragment Extraction kit and sequenced by the Applied Biosystems 3130XL Genetic Analyzer (Center for Genomic Medicine of NCKU).</p>
