<p id="Par25">For production of reverse genetics virus, 293 T cells were seeded in 6-well plates in the concentration of 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/2 mL. After 24 h of culture, cells were transfected with 7 influenza gene expression plasmids (A/Taiwan/3446/02 strain) and different NP expression plasmid by PolyJet reagent. After 24 h, culture medium was changed to serum-free DMEM and then cultured for an additional 48 h. Three days after transfection, the total cell lysates were collected for immunofluorescence stain (IF stain) and subcultured in 25 T MDCK cells (the passage 1, P1 virus). The P1 viruses were also checked by IF stain. Viruses were further amplified to P2 in MDCK cells and quantified by plaque assay for further analysis. The IF stain was done using D3 Ultra DFA Reagent Influenza A (Diagnostic Hybrids).
