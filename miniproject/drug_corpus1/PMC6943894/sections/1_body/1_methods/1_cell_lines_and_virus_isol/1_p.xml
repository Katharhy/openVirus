<p id="Par18">MDCK and A549 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2% Penicillin/Streptomycin (P/S); 293T cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2% P/S and 1X sodium pyruvate. Clinical isolates of influenza A virus H3N2 subtypes were collected from the Virology Laboratory of National Cheng Kung University Hospital (NCKUH) between 1999 and 2017. Influenza isolates were cultured in MDCK cells; the virus culture medium was DMEM supplemented with 2% (P/S) and 2.5 Î¼g/mL trypsin. MDCK cells were used in virus growth kinetics and plaque assay. A549 cells were also used to analyze virus growth kinetics. 293T cells were used in the transfection assay.</p>
