<p id="Par16">Replication and transcription of influenza viruses rely on the functional unit, ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex structure, in which viral RNA is encapsidated by viral polymerase PB2, PB1, PA and NP. In the RNP complex, NP in homo-oligomer form not only stabilizes this structure but also modulates viral RNA transcription and replication through interaction with viral polymerase PB2 and PB1. It has been reported that NP is also crucial in RNA elongation during viral RNA replication [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In regards to function, NP contains an RNA binding domain, a PB2 binding domain, a homo-oligomer binding domain and a nuclear localization signal domain (NLS) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Many studies further observed that NP interacts with many host factors to promote viral replication, escape immunity, or regulate apoptosis [
