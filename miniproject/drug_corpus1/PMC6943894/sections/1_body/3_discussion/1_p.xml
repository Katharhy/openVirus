<p id="Par39">Through the analysis of NP gene evolution in Taiwan and globally, we observed that the protein sequence backbone had a great change around 2004 and since then the NP still continuously attained new changes year by year. Moreover, we identified fifteen sporadic substitutions and those who had higher frequencies (31R, 377G and 450S) were further analyzed by in vitro and in vivo assays. The 31R and 450S were confirmed to reduce viral replication while the dominant circulating residues (31â€‰K and 450G) were beneficial to viral replication properties. In this study, we evaluated NP substitutions in evolution and demonstrated amino acid changes in 31 and 450 of NP could modulate virus replication.</p>
