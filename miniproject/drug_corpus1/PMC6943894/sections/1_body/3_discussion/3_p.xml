<p id="Par41">Specifically, we found that NP with 450G significantly enhanced viral growth in vitro, also prolonged virus shedding in vivo slightly. In our ferret study, neither the body temperature change nor the weight loss showed any comparative differences. The rgNP-31K-450G virus-infected ferrets did however show slower gain in weight post-challenge and shed virus for a day longer compared to the rgNP-31K-450S virus challenged ferrets. To investigate whether this enhancement of viral properties correlated with larger influenza outbreaks or disease severity, we looked at the human seasonal influenza (H3N2) epidemiology for Taiwan. Notably, viruses with NP-450G was the dominant circulating strain since 1968, whereas in the 2006–2007 influenza virus season, NP-450S appeared temporarily in Taiwan (Additional file

Thus, the effect of the evolutionary variations that we investigated in vitro can also reflect on the ferrets in vivo study, which can also in turn reflect on human epidemiology. Here, we tried to correlate with epidemiology reports, whereby NP-450S reduce morbidity in the 2006–2007 influenza virus season, however, there are still many concerns and/or parameters that could not exactly be filtered out, therefore, further study is required.
