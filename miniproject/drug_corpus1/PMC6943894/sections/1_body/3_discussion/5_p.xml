<p id="Par43">Increasingly more studies have focused on the viral whole genome sequence analysis and have tried to understand the complicated mechanisms of influenza virus evolution and clinical outcome. For instance, the severe H3N2 epidemic of the 2003–2004 flu season led to high mortality, especially in children [

The study observed many more amino acid substitutions not only on the HA but also in the other seven gene segments from the dominant strain of previous season. Analysis of the human H3N2 whole genome sequences from databases revealed that there are evolutions in codon usage and frequent reassortment events [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. A Previous study showed that reassortment occurred whereby A/Sydney/5/97 converted to A/Fujian/411/02 strain, and A/Fujian/411/02 converted to A/California/7/04 strain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In our phylogenetic data, clade 1, where sequences were similar to A/Sydney/5/97, there was a clade separated from the other clades 2–6. In clade 6, progressive drift from A/California/7/04 was observed, in contrast to clades 2 to 5. This demonstrates that the NP genetic variations observed in our and other studies come from not only the RNA genome mutations but may also involve the reassortment mechanism.
