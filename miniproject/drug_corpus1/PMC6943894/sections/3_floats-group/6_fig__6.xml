  <p>Weight, temperature change and viral shedding in nasal wash of ferrets. Ferrets were infected intranasally with 2.5 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> plaque-forming units (PFU) in 500 μL of viruses with NP substitutions. 
   <bold>a</bold> Temperature and (
   <bold>b</bold>) weight changes were monitored. Nasal wash specimens were collected and expressed as 50% log10 tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50). In (
   <bold>c</bold>) viral shedding curve and (
   <bold>d</bold>) viral shedding dot plot, viruses with different substitutions were separated by colors and shapes; each dot represents the viral titer in nasal wash of each ferret. Two-way ANOVA, multiple comparisons with Bonferroni post-hoc test was performed; *
