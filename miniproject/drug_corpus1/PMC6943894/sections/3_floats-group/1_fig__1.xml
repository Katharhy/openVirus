  <p>Phylogenetic analysis of NP of H3N2 viruses from 1999 to 2017. Phylogenetic analysis of influenza virus NP gene (nucleotide 16 to 1473 bases) was performed using MEGA 7. NP genes from 79 randomly selected Taiwan clinical isolates, 14 reference strains, as well as the most dominant sequences in each year (1999â€“2018), was separated into 1 to 6 clades. Bootstrap values over 85 were labeled</p>
