<p>There are two issues to consider in patients who are diagnosed with M/XDR-TB while on ART. The first is whether modification of ART is needed due to drugâ€“drug interactions or to decrease the potential of overlapping toxicities. The second issue is whether the presentation of active M/XDR-TB in a patient on ART constitutes ART failure and resistance.</p>
