<p>DR-TB in HIV-infected patients is highly lethal and a growing problem in many parts of the world. Rapid diagnosis with genotypic tests, prompt treatment with appropriate regimens, including shorter regimens fortified with newer drugs, intense monitoring, management of ADRs, sound patient support, and strong infection-control measures are all essential components in the management of DR-TB in PLHIV. TB- and HIV-control programs should curb the epidemic of HIV-associated M/XDR-TB in the near future.</p>
