<p>Patients with a very high risk of M/XDR-TB or residing in high-burden settings can be empirically started on second-line regimens based on locally prevalent drug-resistance patterns. This strategy can be applied to all patients with or without HIV. Empirical therapy should be avoided in scenarios with documented resistance to SLIDs and FQs, and individualized regimens tailored to DST patterns should be preferred.</p>
