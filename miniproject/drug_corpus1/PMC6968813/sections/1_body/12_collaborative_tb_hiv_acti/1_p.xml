<p>The WHO has endorsed certain collaborative activities to reduce the joint burden of TB and HIV coinfection.
 <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref> These activities constitute the backbone of the TB/HIV collaborative adopted under the Stop TB strategy, which along with the implementation of effective directly observed treatment–strategy programs, will strengthen and increase the success of M/XDR-TB and HIV control and treatment activities. The management of TB in PLHIV relies on three components known as the “three Is”: intensified case-finding, isoniazid preventive therapy, and infection control. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has also collaborated with the WHO to reduce the burden of TB and HIV coinfection.
 <xref rid="CIT0073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref> Three components have been added to the three Is, currently designated the six Is: initiating ART, integration of TB/HIV, and involvement of the community. The End TB strategy has been further introduced by the WHO with the objective of eliminating TB as a public health problem.
 <xref rid="CIT0074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref> UNAIDS has set a goal to end HIV as a public health threat by 2030.
 <xref rid="CIT0073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref> The principle of “hit hard, hit early” has been implemented to reduce the burden of HIV infection. The United Nations aims to end AIDS epidemics by 2020 with the adoption of the 90-90-90 strategy (90% of estimated PLHIV should know their status, 90% of which should be initiated on ART, 90% of which should demonstrate viral suppression).
 <xref rid="CIT0075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref> The following activities are based on TB/HIV activities and are adapted to be specifically applicable to M/XDR-TB.
