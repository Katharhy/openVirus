<p>National, state, or local coordinating bodies, community groups, and key stakeholders should have an integrated approach in the planning and monitoring of M/XDR-TB and HIV activities and programs. Managerial activities should be promoted on a larger scale. The burden of TB coinfection with HIV poses a great challenge in the elimination of both components by 2035 and 2030, respectively. DR-TB patients should be targeted separately, due to emergence of primary resistance, apart from management of DS-TB to break the chain of transmission. Various measures, such as rapid detection with genotypic tests, universal DST to prescribe appropriate individualized regimens, innovation of shorter or completely oral conventional regimens fortified with newer drugs to improve adherence, decentralized or patient-centric approaches, infection control, and preventive treatment for DR-TB contacts, have been emphasized to drastically reduce the burden of DR-TB.
 <xref rid="CIT0078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref> Engagement of the private sector for notification and management of DR-TB cases is also essential to reduce the burden of coinfection. Ideally, routine diagnosis should be scaled up at the programmatic level for the patientâ€™s benefit. These measures are difficult to implement in resource-limited settings, where allocating sufficient resources for funding remains a challenge. Better community or local surveillance data and promotion of genotypic analysis in the near future may help in developing an understanding of the relationship between HIV and M/XDR-TB.
