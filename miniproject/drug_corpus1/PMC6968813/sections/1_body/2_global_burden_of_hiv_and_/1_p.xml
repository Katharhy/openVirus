<p>The incidence of drug-susceptible TB (DS-TB) and HIV coinfection has increased over the past two decades, as both are strongly linked. It is estimated that PLHIV, especially with fewer than 200/cm
 <sup>3</sup> CD4 count, show a 19 (15–22)-fold increased risk of developing active TB compared with those who are HIV-negative.
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> According to the WHO, 8.6% (7.4%–10%) of 10 million (range, 9–11.1 million) incident cases with active TB were alsocoinfected with HIV in 2018. A third of 37 million PLHIV are infected with TB bacillus. Sub-Saharan Africa is the region with the highest burden of coinfection, comprising 71% of global coinfected cases. Among 30 high-burden countries with TB and HIV coinfection, HIV infection has been detected in 70% of patients with TB. South Africa (177,000) has reported the highest number of incident TB cases among PLHIV, followed by India (92,000) and Mozambique (58,000). Also, in 2018 0.25 million (16.8%) of a total 1.5 million deaths from TB showed HIV coinfection.
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Of 862,000 new TB cases among PLHIV, 477,461 (56%) were notified, of which 86% were placed on antiretroviral therapy (ART). The global cure rate for TB in PLHIV has been reported to be 75%. Although the mortality rate has reduced by 60% worldwide since 2000, there is marked regional variation. This reduction is most evident in Europe and lowest in sub-Saharan Africa.
