<p>An accurate diagnosis of DS-TB as well as DR-TB in HIV-infected people is more difficult and may be confused with other pulmonary or systemic infections. The clinical features, such as cough, fever, night sweats, and weight loss, can be observed in both forms of TB, even in HIV patients. These features can be used for active screening, with reported sensitivity of 85%–93% and specificity of 30%–40%.
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Radiological presentations, such as upper-lobe infiltrates or cavitation in either form of TB, remain similar in HIV-infected patients with CD4 count &gt;350/cm
 <sup>3</sup> and uninfected patients. The presentation is more likely to be extrapulmonary or atypical, such as middle- or lower-lobe infiltrates, pleural effusion, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, or interstitial nodular opacities, especially as immunosuppression advances (CD4 &lt;200/cm
 <sup>3</sup>).
 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> However, cavitation can be observed in advanced disease. Sputum-smear examination is usually positive in early disease and negative in advanced disease, but contrary results can be obtained. Phenotypic tests, such as conventional solid Lowenstein–Jensen medium culture and DST remain the gold standard for diagnosis, but usually take 2–6 weeks. This can result in misdiagnosis or delays in diagnosis, and in turn higher morbidity and mortality. Other phenotypic tests, such as the 
 <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> growth-indicator tube, Bactec Radiometric 960, and microscopic observation broth drug-susceptibility assay are more sensitive, have faster turnover, and show rapid results, but are expensive and more prone to contamination.
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Algorithms have been devised by the WHO with the aim of enhancing diagnostic yield in PLHIV with smear-negative pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB.
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> Clinical criteria should be initially used for establishing diagnosis, followed by additional laboratory data, such as culture and radiography. The positive predictive value of clinical criteria is 89%–96% in these cases when compared with culture as the gold standard.
 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> For patients with advanced HIV disease with extrapulmonary involvement, mycobacterial culture of other fluids (eg, blood, pleural fluid, ascitic fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, and bone-marrow aspirates) and histopathology (eg, lymph-node biopsies) may be helpful in diagnosis. It is recommended that all PLHIV with TB be screened for drug resistance with culture and DST. Programs without facilities or resources to screen all PLHIV for M/XDR-TB should put significant efforts into obtaining them, especially if M/XDR-TB rates are moderate or high. Some programs may adopt a strategy of targeted DST for patients at increased risk of M/XDR-TB, such as those in whom treatment has failed or who are contacts of M/XDR-TB cases. Programs may also choose to use targeted DST for those with lower CD4 counts (&lt;200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup>), as these patients are at very high risk of death due to unrecognized M/XDR-TB. Genotypic tests have been endorsed by the WHO, facilitating prompt diagnosis of M/XDR-TB.
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> The CBNAAT can establish diagnoses in smear-positive and even smear-negative pulmonary TB and extrapulmonary TB, decreasing the time a patient may be on an inadequate regimen and the period during which the patient may be spreading M/XDR-TB.
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Therefore, the CBNAAT, especially GeneXpert MTB/RIF, should be used as an initial diagnostic test in PLHIV and M/XDR-TB coinfection.
 <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> First-line LiPAs can detect additional H monoresistance and second-line LiPAs resistance to FQs and SLIDs in pre-XDR-TB and XDR-TB cases.
 <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> LiPAs have a better diagnostic yield in smear-positive cases and on culture isolates. It requires higher technical expertise and cautious interpretation of results in PLHIV compared to the CBNAAT. A diagnostic approach should initially include the CBNAAT followed by LiPAs to first- and second-line anti-TB drugs to facilitate early diagnosis with universal DST and initiation of appropriate treatment. Newer tests, such as GeneXpert Ultra and urine TB lipoarabinomannan, have shown promising results in HIV patients with profound mmunosuppression (CD4 count &lt;100 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup>), with better diagnostic yield.
 <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> Targeted next-generation sequencing and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) have emerged as potential diagnostic modalities and can detect organisms responsible, strain relatedness, and number of mutations conferring resistance to major anti-TB drugs, such as R, H, Z, FQs, and SLIDs, with rapid turnover of 1–2 days. Resistance can be detected by WGS for even bedaquiline (Bdq) and delamanid (Dlm) lacking validated DST. However, there are various concerns causing hindrance, such as expenditure, availability at few centers, integration into the existing diagnostic algorithm, technical or operational skills, and requirement of expert guidance in clinical interpretation of sequencing data. A study from China reported that the Beijing strain was the most frequently isolated lineage for drug resistance among patients with TB with or without HIV coinfection.
 <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> Strains from coinfected patients were scattered from those of the general community without any clusters, suggesting an inability to detect transmission among PLHIV, despite a high burden of disease.
 <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> This could be attributed to the limited genomic database of ongoing transmission of TB among PLHIV. Next-generation sequencing or WGS can be used as an initial diagnostic test in PLHIV with DR-TB coinfection, and may be preferred to the CBNAAT after overcoming existing limitations. Extensive effort is required to generate genomic databases worldwide. The utility of genotypic tests, including WGS, in programmatic conditions in resource-limited settings needs to be determined in the near future, with the major concerns of cost, requirement of operational skills, and quality control in mind.
