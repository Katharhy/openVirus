<p>“I need to get off this stuff for good, for my baby.” Ashley, who has struggled with substance use for years, had just delivered a baby girl and wanted help now more than ever. In a pre-COVID time, the plan for her would have been established: The certified peer recovery specialist (CRS) who knew her previously would have met her in the emergency department (ED) as an advocate and trusted confidant, an “X-waivered” emergency medicine (EM) provider would have written her a “bridge script” of buprenorphine-naloxone, and she would be “warmly handed-off” to a provider in the community to continue her treatment. There would be challenges along the way but there would be an identifiable path to accessing buprenorphine, a highly regulated but effective medication that treats opioid use disorder.</p>
