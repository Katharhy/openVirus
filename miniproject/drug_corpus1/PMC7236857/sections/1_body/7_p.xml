<p>Mobile treatment units may offer a solution but many have been shuttered due to the complexity of triaging COVID risk. Virtual connections to care seem the safest strategy to both initiate and continue care. Rapid changes in regulations have allowed for immediate deployment and learn-as-you-go strategies for telehealth platforms. In many cases, these platforms only require that a patient have a computer or phone and a health system account. Unfortunately, that creates a large divide between the socially vulnerable patients most at risk and the patient population that receives highly reimbursed care from the health system with ready access to their clinicians via email, phone, or telehealth appointments. Recognizing this gap, our goal is to provide a tool for communication, which will enable us to continue to care for them during this difficult time. One possibility that we are piloting at our institution is to provide phones for patients in need, which will enable a modicum of connectivity over the coming months while social distancing orders are in place. Shelters and respite homes can be equipped with iPads to offer connectivity to virtual treatment. In states with shortages of X-waivered providers, pharmacies have already served as locations for buprenorphine initiation. During this pandemic, they should be recruited as accessible sites for the dispensation of naloxone and possibly as hubs for telemedicine kiosks to access remote care without insurance barriers.</p>
