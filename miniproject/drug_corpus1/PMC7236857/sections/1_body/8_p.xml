<p>Let us return to our patient Ashley. When Ashley's peer specialist reached out to our team, we connected her postpartum providers to a hospitalist who guided Ashley's induction with buprenorphine. Ashley had her first “visit” with her addiction medicine provider via a videoconference app on the same day that she was discharged from the hospital, alleviating her biggest fear that she would use again as soon as she began to feel withdrawal. Ashley has been engaged in treatment for the last month, allowing her to move back in with her family and participate in caring for her new baby girl. Such a swift initiation of treatment was only possible due to the COVID pandemic and the reduced barriers on buprenorphine prescribing. While the initial changes in regulation to address the needs of this population are welcomed by providers and patients, many additional innovations are required to ensure that additional vulnerabilities and hurdles created by this pandemic scenario do not further fan the flames of the opioid epidemic.</p>
