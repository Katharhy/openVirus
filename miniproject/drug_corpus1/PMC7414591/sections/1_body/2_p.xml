 </sup> Observational studies have proven invaluable to the CCP initiative but they share a host of methodologic limitations. Some are constrained by small sample sizes and lack of controls. All have selected for severe COVID-19 in which most patients have received other therapies, in addition to CCP, such as steroids, antibiotics, and antivirals, blurring interpretation of the findings. Hegerova et al acknowledged this as a limitation in their study in which one-half of their control group had received remdesivir, an investigational antiviral that could well have masked the differential effect of CCP if indeed one were present. Beyond concomitant therapies, the investigators highlight 2 other elements that have not been standardized across studies: dosage and titering. Dosing of CCP has been gleaned from studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome; the pharmacokinetics of CP in the context of COVID-19 are not well understood. Most studies of COVID-19 have reported use of 1 to 2 U (âˆ¼200-500 mL) of CCP to treat COVID-19; while practical, this fails to account for differences in the volumes of distribution or acuity of disease. Furthermore, the approaches that have been used to qualify donors and/or the transfused units of CCP have varied enormously, from qualitative assessments of immunoglobulin G to formal viral neutralization assays and associated titers.
