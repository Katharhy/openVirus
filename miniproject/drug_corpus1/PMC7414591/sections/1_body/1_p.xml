<p>Hegerova et al add to a growing number of observational studies that have reported on the use of CCP to treat COVID-19. The outcomes of the collective studies span dramatic examples of recovery to the absence of demonstrable effect,

 </sup> highlighting the challenges of CP in general. Like many infectious diseases for which CP has been applied, clinical trial data are lacking. CP is typically deployed in times of emergency when the design and execution of randomized clinical trials is most complex. Beyond the administrative, regulatory, and logistical barriers of initiating trials in times of crisis, timing is critical: once epidemics wane, enrollment goals risk going unfulfilled. There is already at least 1 example of this with COVID-19: in a clinical trial in China, critically ill patients with COVID-19 were randomized to CCP with standard therapy vs standard therapy alone.

 </sup> Despite encouraging signals of benefit in earlierâ€”severe rather than life-threatening disease, the trial failed to show a significant difference in clinical improvement 28 days following randomization, its primary outcome. With only 103 of its targeted 200 subjects enrolled, the study was ultimately underpowered.
