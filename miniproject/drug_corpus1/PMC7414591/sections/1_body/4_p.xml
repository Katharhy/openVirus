<p>In conclusion, observational studies and compassionate use programs have been instrumental in the mobilization of CCP to contend with a global health emergency. Although safety has been addressed, efficacy data are critically needed to transition CCPâ€™s status from an investigational product to a standard therapy. The latter has practical ramifications, offering a formal mechanism for reimbursement and thus a durable treatment strategy. Broadly, COVID-19 presents a rare opportunity to study CP. If shown to be effective, CP would offer a scalable model that could be applied both to the current pandemic as well as to future emerging infectious diseases. It could also facilitate development of hyperimmune globulin and vaccine design. Clinical trials are already under way to address the uncertainty of use. Nonetheless, harmonization of efforts is needed along with creative approaches to overcome looming obstacles, such as pairing of trials of similar design and/or metanalysis. We must not be left wondering whether the intervention worked after the pandemic wanes.</p>
