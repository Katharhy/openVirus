<p id="Par2">I wrote this letter-to-the-Editor being one of the nearly 1,500,000 physicians involved, especially in these demanding times, in the clinical activity of Internal Medicine. It is addressed to the many people asking them professional advice in the present emergency due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemics. I decided to submit this letter to a Journal that is read, or should be read, by many Family Doctors. I believe I am entitled to do it leaving aside, for a while, the “scientific evidence” to turn to the knowledge acquired in over 65 years of clinical practice. This put me in the position of providing suggestions to those who approached me during dozens of mainly flu epidemics. I would like to make clear, however, that I am not at all intending to provide formal recommendations on what should be done in the currently raging COVID-19 spread. This is the task for experts who are trying worldwide to identify the best treatment to resolve even the most severe cases, once a correct diagnosis is made.</p>
