<p id="Par6">These were the thoughts that prompted me to write this letter, particularly after hearing, a few days ago on television, the tale of a representative of Family Doctors. She was asked to report her advice to a patient who had phoned because of hyperthermia. She had replied: paracetamol, repeating the same prescription after three and more days, without any other suggestion, until she decided to recommend the patient to reach the hospital emergency department. Just think about what could happen, for example at the heart level, to an elderly patient who, in the presence of pneumonia whatever its etiology, waits for the result of the swab instead of being treated for an impending acute respiratory failure. Moreover, in the light of pathological findings suggesting lung injury due to microembolism and/or microvascular thrombosis, why not consider low molecular weight heparin administration?Â Possibly, is not this a reason why elderly, but even young, patients carrying multi-organic dysfunctions have ultimately died?</p>
