<p>The serology testing for COVID-19 is helpful and provides the basis for diagnosis. In the case of the unavailability of molecular testing, the serological test provides a means to triage the suspected cases of COVID-19. A fast-serological test with specific performance features is highly important to avoid missing factual cases of COVID-19. A positive test for IgM or IgG antibody strongly indicates SARS-CoV-2 infection. This approach is extremely effective in individuals 5â€“10 days after the onset of symptoms [

Those with a negative serological antibody test have a swab collected for molecular testing. The experience in China has shown that the use of a serological antibody test can improve the sensitivity of COVID-19 case detection [
