<p>It needs to be emphasized that, among all tested drugs, antiviral compounds such as remdesivir inhibit RNA transcription, leading to reduced viral load. This class of drugs is potentially the most promising tool with which to treat COVID-19 patients. Thus, although there is no solid evidence available to prove their long-term clinical outcomes as of this day, drugs targeting viral RNA are the most promising tools in this battle. Further investigations are required to test a library of synthesized antiviral agents to obtain the most potent candidate to be used in clinics. The ongoing trials of the vaccine will be a hope to provide a vaccine displaying efficacy without side effects to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic to humankind.</p>
