<p>Current models give information about the three stages of the immune response. The first stage involves the early activation and persuasive interferon response for clearing the virus. The second stage exhibits the delayed response of interferon that may lead to tissue damage. The third stage leads to hyper-inflammation, followed by exaggerated macrophage activation, resulting in fibrosis dysregulation of tissue repair processes [

Some are under clinical trials to evaluate their efficacy along with safety. Initially, the virus attaches to the ACE2 receptor. TMPRSS2 is responsible for the viral protein cleavage. Protease inhibitors can be designed and developed to prevent spike protein cleavage. Blocking the viral fusion through either TMPRSS2 or receptor ACE2 can prevent the infection. For removing pro-inflammatory cytokines, several novel models have been proposed in which the blood of a COVID-19 patient is passed through customized columns that recognize and trap the pro-inflammatory cytokines, and then the purified blood is administered back to the patient [
