<p>The laboratory analysis showed a leukocyte count of 2.91 × 10
 <sup>9</sup> cells/L, of which neutrophils were 70%. Further, the C-reactive protein was 16.16 mg/L (normal range = 0–10 mg/L). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was also high with D-dimer. The primary pathogenesis of the nCoV is associated with respiratory infections, pneumonia, ground-glass opacities (GGOs), acute cardiac injury, ARDS, and RNAaemia [
