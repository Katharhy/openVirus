<p>Another parameter for understanding the severity and prognosis of infection is the case fatality ratio (CFR), which is calculated by dividing the number of expired patients by the total number of diagnosed patients, multiplied by 100. According to the WHO situation report-185 of COVID-19, the overall CFR was 5.12 as of 23 July 2020. A remarkable difference in CFR was noted in some countries presented in

CFR is useful in estimating the risk of death within a population owing to a specific disease. Data suggest increased mortality with advanced age has a well-known impact on the prognosis of the disease. The median age of any population reflects the variation in fatality rates [
