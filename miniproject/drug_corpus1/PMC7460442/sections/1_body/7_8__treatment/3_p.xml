<p>Interfering cytokine storm signaling can prevent hyper-inflammation, thereby reducing infection. Current evidence shows that the overproduction of macrophages linked to monocytes accumulates in tissue that can cause lung infiltration. For instance, it is found that CCR2 activation contributes to the accumulation of monocytes in the tissue, causing severe inflammation. So monocytes’ accumulation can be reduced by blocking the CCR2, resulting in minimizing hyper-inflammation [
