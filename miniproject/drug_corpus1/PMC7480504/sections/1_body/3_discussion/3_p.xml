<p>The distance droplets travel depends on the velocity and mechanism by which respiratory droplets are propelled from the source (coughing or sneezing), the density of respiratory secretions, environmental factors such as temperature and humidity, and the ability of the pathogen to maintain infectivity over that distance. The interaction between temperature and humidity on viral activity is challenging to assess [

 <xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The virus is stable for 3 weeks at room temperature in a wet environment, but it is easily killed by heat at 56°C for 15 min [
 <xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 may retain its infectivity up to 2 weeks at low temperatures and low humidity environment. This indicates that SARS CoV-2 may be a stable virus transmittable by indirect contact or fomites [
 <xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Thus, contaminated surfaces may play a significant role in the transmission of infection in the hospital and the community [
