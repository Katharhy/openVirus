<p>Despite recent efforts in basic and translational influenza and coronavirus research, there is still no vaccine against coronavirus for use in humans including SARS and MERS [
 <xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. COVID-19 now reached the required epidemiological standards for a pandemic [
 <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. To mitigate an emerging pandemic infectious disease like COVID-19, assessing transmissibility is crucial. The large movement of people in the Asian region and between China and globally due to the lunar new year celebrated in China likely increased the rapid geographical dispersal of infection during the initial outbreak [
 <xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Relatively low environmental temperature may have increased the spread of the virus in China. Similarly, countries with relatively low environmental temperature may be more affected than high environmental temperature countries during the recent outbreak due to better viral survival. There are few studies available on global risk factors of COVID-19 transmission and pattern of spread [

 <xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Rigorous testing and case-based interventions have so far formed key pieces of successful control efforts, e.g. in Singapore and Hong Kong [

Many other countries are adopting measures termed ‘social distancing’ or ‘physical distancing’, including closing schools and workplaces, limiting gatherings, using face masks, avoiding physical contact when greeting, and implementing cough etiquette. In the initial phase, the infection was epidemic with an estimated basic reproduction number (

 </italic>) of 2.2 and the case number doubled on average every 7.4 days [
 <xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. China was able to reduce the cases more than 90% by implementing strict containment measures. Other affected countries like Italy, Spain, and Iran have not been able to successfully replicate this containment strategy [
 <xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. To further test the hypothesis of temperature affecting the transmission rate, the present study aimed to investigate the correlation of environmental temperature to attack rate and case fatality rate of COVID-19.
