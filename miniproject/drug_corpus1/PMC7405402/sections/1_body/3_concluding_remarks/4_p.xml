<p>While full‐length S proteins of SARS‐CoV‐2 and SARS‐CoV have up to 76% similarities in amino acid sequences, the N‐terminal domain that binds to the receptor shows only 53.5% of homology reflecting its potential to bind different sugars. Therefore, emphasizing on other virus entry‐related factors like cathepsin seems valuable for SARS‐CoV‐2 drug discovery. In fact, host proteases cathepsin L and TMPRSS2 prepare the SARS‐CoV‐2 S protein for cell entry (Walls et al.,

Considering the results of repurposing strategies and clinical tests until now, remdesivir seems a promising dual‐acting drug (inhibiting viral RNA polymerases and 3C‐like main protease). Studies conducted so far suggest the drug might cause some minor side effects including nausea, liver damage and cardiopulmonary failure. Beyond the ongoing studies of remdesivir, now researchers are hoping to explore whether the remdesivir can be combined with other anti‐viral drugs for making a more effective SARS‐CoV‐2 combating cocktail. Six clinical trials are currently underway to specify testing remdesivir with other medicines, according to Informa Pharma Intelligence. Nevertheless, HIV protease inhibitors (ritonavir/lopinavir/ASC09), favipiravir and chloroquine need further investigations.
