<p>The efficiency of seven anti‐viral drugs (ribavirin, nafamostat, nitazoxanide, penciclovir, chloroquine (CQ) remdesivir and favipiravir) on only a single clinical type of SARS‐CoV‐2 is so far evaluated in the wet laboratory. These drugs have previously exhibited an acceptable anti‐viral activity on various types of RNA viruses such as SARS‐CoV, MERS‐CoV and Ebola virus (EBOV) (García‐Serradilla, Risco, &amp; Pacheco,

 <xref rid="tbed13734-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The cell culture investigations showed that the compounds chloroquine (CQ) and remdesivir (RDV) effectively inhibited the infection by SARS‐CoV‐2 with a high selectivity index at low enough micromolar concentration (Wang et al.,
