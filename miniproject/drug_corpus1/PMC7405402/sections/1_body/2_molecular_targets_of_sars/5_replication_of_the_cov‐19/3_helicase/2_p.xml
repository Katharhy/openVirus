<p>Helicase (nsp13) is a critical protein with several functions required for virus replication containing two main domains; N‐terminal metal binding domain (MBD) and a conserved helicase domain at the C‐terminus (Hel). This enzyme unfolds the firm secondary structures of the genome in positive‐sense RNA viruses to increase the yield of its translation (Adedeji, Marchand, et al.,
