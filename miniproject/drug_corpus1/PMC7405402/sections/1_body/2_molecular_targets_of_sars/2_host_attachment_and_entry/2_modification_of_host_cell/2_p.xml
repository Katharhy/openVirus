<p>Despite the possibility of surface alteration of RNA viruses, blocking the cell surface viral receptor, thereby inhibiting the virus entry, can be a proper option in designing the approach of drug discovery. Binding of the viral spike (S) glycoproteins to cellular receptor ACE2 and priming the S protein by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) are both the essential factors for cell entry of coronaviruses. TMPRSS2 mediates the entry by two distinct mechanisms. One mechanism is the cleavage and activation of the spike glycoproteins of coronaviruses (like HCoV‐229E and HCoV‐EMC) which facilitates the virus‐cell membrane entry. Conformational flexibility of S protein which is needed for fusion will be created by proteolytic cleavages (Bosch, van der Zee, de Haan, &amp; Rottier, 
 <xref rid="tbed13734-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>) catalysed by TMPRSS2 as the most relevant cellular proteases in this process. Another mechanism is the proteolytic cleavage of angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) by TMPRSS2, which might activate the coronavirus spike glycoprotein. Proteolytic cleavages of S protein happen only after ACE2 cleavage results in SARS‐CoV‐2‐cell membrane fusion and cathepsin L‐independent cell entry. SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA is then released into the cytoplasm, and viral replication is efficiently processed (Table
