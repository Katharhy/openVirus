<p>Recently, Sigrist et al suggested that SARS‐CoV‐2 may also bind to integrins on the host cells, through a conserved motif (RGD) containing Arg‐Gly‐Asp in receptor‐binding domain of S protein that is absent in other coronaviruses (Sigrist, Bridge, &amp; Le Mercier, 
 <xref rid="tbed13734-bib-0072" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). The conformational changes due to ACE2 binding expose the RGD containing region. Different viruses like Ebola virus (Schornberg et al.,

 <xref rid="tbed13734-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) and EBV (Tugizov, Berline, &amp; Palefsky, 
 <xref rid="tbed13734-bib-0082" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>) use integrins for cell attachment or entry. Treatment of multiple sclerosis/Crohn's diseases using the natalizumab antibody (α4β1/β7 integrin inhibitor) and the treatment of acute coronary syndrome with the small molecule tirofiban (αIIbβ3 blocker) are examples of approved drugs based on the integrin inhibition, highlighting the impact of integrin in treatment of various diseases (Ley, Rivera‐Nieves, Sandborn, &amp; Shattil, 
 <xref rid="tbed13734-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). These studies confirm that the inhibition of integrin may prevent the occurrence of some coronaviruses in host cells and can be considered a prolific target for anti‐viral drug discovery.
