<p>One of the coronavirus virulence factors is ORF7a that inhibits the bone marrow matrix antigen 2 (BST‐2) (Taylor et al., 
 <xref rid="tbed13734-bib-0078" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) related to its escape from the innate immune system by host mRNA degradation and interferon production inhibition. BST‐2 is constitutively expressed in plasma cells, mature B cells and type I interferon‐producing cells that can hinder the liberation of biosynthesized coronavirus from hosts. The evidence implied that ORF7a can be speculated as a potential target for anti‐viral drug discovery of SARS‐CoV‐2.
