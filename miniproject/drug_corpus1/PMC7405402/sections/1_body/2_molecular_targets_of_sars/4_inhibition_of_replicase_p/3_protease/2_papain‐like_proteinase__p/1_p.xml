<p>PLprotease or nsp3 releases proteins involved in both replication of coronavirus and infection processes. In addition to the LXGG motif found in‐between nsp1/2, nsp 2/3 and nsp 3/4, it has two other proteolytic activities, removal of ubiquitin (Ub) and ubiquitin‐like protein ISG15 (interferon induced gene 15) from cellular proteins. Some studies have highlighted the importance of inhibiting these proteases in other coronaviruses. Ratia et al introduced a compound, GRL0617, with an EC50 of 15 μM that inhibits the replication of SARS‐CoV in Vero E6 cells (Ratia et al.,
