<p>Capsid proteins have a pivotal function in the assembly of the virus, and interfering with the structure or function of these key proteins can be a solid anti‐viral strategy. Coronaviruses are distinct from other coated viruses in that they are assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) as the intracellular membranes and transported out of the cell by exocytosis (Schoeman &amp; Fielding, 
 <xref rid="tbed13734-bib-0066" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Envelope proteins (E) are clearly important in assembly of coronaviruses, but their exact mechanistic role(s) is still not yet fully described (Schoeman &amp; Fielding, 
 <xref rid="tbed13734-bib-0066" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). The major part of E protein is localized in intracellular trafficking and participates in coronavirus assembly, although it is expressed inside the infected cell in large quantities. The envelope protein (E) of coronaviruses (HCoV‐229E, Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), IBV) mediates the assembly of virus and generates some cation‐selective ion channels that their function is not clear (Wilson, Mckinlay, Gage, &amp; Ewart, 
 <xref rid="tbed13734-bib-0089" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). The involvement of E protein in pivotal stages of the viral life cycle makes SARS‐CoV‐2 lacking E protein, a promising vaccine candidate. Pharmacological blockage of its assembly with acylguanidine and cinnamoylguanidine reduced the SARS‐CoV and MHV viral titre by 76 and 88% at a concentration of 10 µM, respectively (Gage, Ewart, Wilson, Best, &amp; Premkumar,
