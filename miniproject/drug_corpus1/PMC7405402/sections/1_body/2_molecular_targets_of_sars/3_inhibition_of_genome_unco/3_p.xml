<p>The only effort on blockage of uncoating step in the SARS‐CoV‐2 life cycle as a drug discovery target is reported by Aranda Abreu et al. They proposed an in situ models of amantadine as a drug to relieve the effects of SARS‐CoV‐2 by blocking the viroporin E (a proton channel) and inhibiting the viral uncoating (Aranda Abreu, Hernández Aguilar, Herrera Covarrubias, &amp; Rojas Durán, 
 <xref rid="tbed13734-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). The S protein‐based vaccines can also induce antibodies that block the genome uncoating besides the blockage of viral receptor (Chen et al.,

Furthermore, it is still not determined whether the uncoating of SARS‐CoV‐2 can occur in both acidic and neutral conditions similar to avian coronavirus (IBV) or its uncoating can be suppressed by the neutralization of the acidic condition of endosomes and its subsequent fusion.
