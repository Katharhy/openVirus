<p>The 
 <italic>betacoronavirus</italic> genome including SARS‐CoV‐2 comprises of the 5′‐untranslated region (5′‐UTR), 3′‐untranslated region (3′‐UTR), open reading frame (ORF) 1a/b, structural proteins and additional proteins. Sixteen non‐structural proteins (nsp 1–16) are generated by a proteolytic process (mediated by 3C‐like main protease [3Cl protease] and papain‐like proteinase [PL proteases]) from the large replicase polyproteins (pp) (pp1a and pp1ab) encoded by the ORF1a/b. Nsps progress the organization of the replication–transcription complex and indirect escape from the host immune system (Chan et al.,
