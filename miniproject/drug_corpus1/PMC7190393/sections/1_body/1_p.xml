<p id="Par3">In early December 2019, the first cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were identified in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The pathogen has since been identified as a novel enveloped positive-sense, single-stranded RNA betacoronavirus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This virus, which has a phylogenetic similarity to SARS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], has been given the name severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; also, COVID-19 virus). To date, among the total number of patients with COVID-19 globally, the case-fatality rate (ratio between the dead and total number of infected) ranges from 5.1 to 5.2% and is constantly increasing. This is ten times more than from the usual seasonal flu. Also, SARS-CoV-2 is supposed to be more contagious and environmentally stable than seasonal flu viruses, since seasonal flu usually ends by April in Northern hemisphere. In addition, it seems that the virus is also more likely to affect the heart than any other similar viruses, so although pneumonia is often the main cause of death, cardiologists and infectionists, for example in Russia, are seeing infected patients whose worst symptoms are not respiratory, but cardiac and many people infected with COVID-19 are dying from heart attacks, as a possible complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection. High expression of the ACE2 receptor, via which COVID-19 virus enters cells using its spike glycoprotein, was identified in type II alveolar cells (AT2) of the lung [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells, absorptive enterocytes from the ileum and colon [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], cholangiocytes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], myocardial cells, kidney proximal tubule cells, and bladder urothelial cells. These findings indicate that those organs with high ACE2 expressing cells should be considered as a potential high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection [
