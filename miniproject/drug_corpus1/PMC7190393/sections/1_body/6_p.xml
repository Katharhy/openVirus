<p id="Par8">What about reinfection? Earlier, a pivotal role for virus-specific memory T-cells in broad and long-term protection against SARS-CoV infection was elucidated [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Indeed, the crucial protective role of T-cell immune responses in coronavirus infections has been clearly documented in several animal models, e.g., feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Moreover, reinfection did not occur in SARS-CoV-2 infected rhesus macaques with the same strain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. What about reinfection with other possible strains of people who recovered from initial infection with one strain? At present, it remains unclear whether convalescing patients are at risk for relapse or reinfection. It is also worth noting the theory that coronavirus infections might play a part in multiple sclerosis. It is known that mouse hepatitis virus, a murine coronavirus, is a close relative of common human coronavirus HCoV-OC43, which causes a multiple sclerosis-like demyelinating disease in the central nervous system of rodents [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Some studies have suggested that human coronaviruses, in particular HCoV-OC43, may be involved in gastrointestinal disease. Coronaviruses can be detected in stool samples, and antibodies directed to HCoV-OC43 have been observed more frequently in children with gastroenteritis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Thus, the future health of people who have recovered from COVID-19 may be accompanied by complications.
