<p id="Par4">Investigations suggest that the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is the result of the combination of a bat SARS-CoV with an unknown Beta-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], probably a coronavirus of pangolin origin. The S1 subunit containing the receptor-binding domain region of the spike protein of Pangolin-CoV is much more closely related to that of SARS-CoV-2 than to that of the bat coronavirus RaTG13. Moreover, while five key amino acid residues involved in the interaction with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), mainly expressed in a small subset of cells in the lung called type 2 alveolar cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], are completely consistent between Pangolin CoV and SARS-CoV-2, four amino acid mutations are present in RaTG13 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 contains a 3-D structure in the receptor-binding domain region to maintain the van der Waals forces [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The 394 glutamine residue in the receptor-binding domain region of SARS-CoV-2 is recognized by the critical lysine 31 residue on the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as a key receptor for virus penetration. It is also believed that the single N501T mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (corresponding to the S487T mutation in SARS-CoV) may have significantly enhanced its binding affinity for human ACE2 and subsequent penetration [
