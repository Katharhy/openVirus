<p>Apart from the molecular diagnostics, numerous LFIA based rapid POC tests have been developed by several companies, which enable the detection of IgM and IgG antibodies produced in suspects in response to SARS-COV-2 infection. One of the most prominent rapid tests is the COVID-19 test developed by BioMedomics, USA, which detects IgM and IgG antibodies in suspects in just 10 min [
 <xref rid="B21-diagnostics-10-00202" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It requires minimal sample volume, i.e., 20 µL of finger-pricked blood or 10 µL of serum/plasma. It does not require any instrument or trained staff and, thus, it can be employed at any place and time, especially in developing nations with limited healthcare resources and remote settings. The assay is ideal for primary healthcare workers for the rapid testing of COVID-19 suspects. Another prospective test is the SARS-CoV-2 rapid by Pharmacyt AG, Germany [
 <xref rid="B22-diagnostics-10-00202" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], which employs only two drops of finger-pricked blood sample from the suspects and can provide results in 20 min. The results obtained by the rapid test correlated well with those achieved by RT-PCR. The most exciting advance is the DPP COVID-19 IgM/IgG test launched recently by Chembio Diagnostics, USA, which has already received FDA EUA. It is a POC rapid LFIA test that provides results in just 15 min using finger-pricked blood sample. However, the distinct feature of the test is that it does not rely on the visual detection by naked eye but employs optical readout via MicroReader 1 and 2 analyzers produced by Chembio, Germany [
 <xref rid="B23-diagnostics-10-00202" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A large number of rapid IgM/IgG tests have been developed by several IVD companies, such as Beijing Lepu Medical Technology, Sona Nanotech, Jiangsu Medomics Medical Technologies, Innovita Biological Technology, Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech, Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech, Biomerica, Xiamen AmonMed Biotechnology, Sugentech, CHIL, Zhenjiang Orient Gene Biotech, Sure Bio-Tech. However, there are very few peer-reviewed publications [
 <xref rid="B24-diagnostics-10-00202" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] that show the accuracy of the COVID-19 diagnostic results obtained by the rapid tests with respect to RT-PCR tests. Rapid tests could be used as a complementary IVD assay to the existing RT-PCR assays, which could lead to much better diagnosis of COVID-19 and provide additional information about the immune status of the suspects. However, the clinical accuracy of rapid tests needs to be stringently evaluated before they are authorized for the mass screening of COVID-19. The recent reports from many European countries suggest that most of the rapid tests for COVID-19 procured from China did not show good analytical performance and did not work for over 70% of COVID-19 cases [

 <xref rid="B26-diagnostics-10-00202" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-diagnostics-10-00202" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-diagnostics-10-00202" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Furthermore, as IgM and IgG could only be detected in suspects about two weeks after the onset of infection, there is an immense need to include other biomarkers of the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection for developing improved COVID-19 rapid tests.
