<p>An exciting development is the DZ-Lite SARS-CoV-2 CLIA IgM and IgG tests developed by Diazyme, USA, that have received FDA EUA [
 <xref rid="B29-diagnostics-10-00202" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The tests are based on the principle of chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) and run on an automated Diazyme DZ-Lite 3000 Plus chemiluminescence analyzer with a throughput of 50 tests/h. Similarly, Snibe, China, has developed automated CLIA tests on MAGLUMI CLIA analyzers for the detection of IgG and IgM in the patient sample in 30 min [

The main advantages of automated CLIA analyzers based COVID-19 assays compared to rapid LFIA tests is the very high throughput of samples that can be analyzed and the ability to perform more clinical tests for other biomarkers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), which also need to be monitored in COVID-19 suspects.
