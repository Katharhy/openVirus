<p>Other prospective IVD assay formats, such as those based on reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), lab-on-a-chip, microfluidics, and multiplex detection are currently being investigated by researchers. It would also be useful to develop an automated and fully integrated POC IVD assay that can perform molecular and immunological testing on a single analytical platform. An ideal IVD assay for the POC detection of COVID-19 in the near future would be the smartphone-based POC electrochemical test for SARS-CoV-2 biomarkers, similar to the iHealth Align device developed by iHealth, USA, for smartphone-based blood glucose monitoring [

Smartphones are omnipresent, powered by internal battery, and equipped with large storage capacity, advanced processing power and a large screen display. Moreover, they have global positioning system (GPS) for spatiotemporal tagging of data, internet connectivity, and capability to store the processed results in the internal device memory as well as to a secure Cloud. Therefore, smartphone-based POC electrochemical device for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 biomarkers could be very useful for the large-scale rapid testing of COVID-19 suspects at the point-of-need.
