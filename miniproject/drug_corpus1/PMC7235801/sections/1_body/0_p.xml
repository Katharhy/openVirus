<p>SARS-CoV-2 is a large positive-sense single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus that comprises of four structural proteins, i.e., nucleocapsid protein (NP) that holds the viral RNA, spike protein (SP), envelope protein (EP), and membrane protein (MP), that create the viral envelope. It has a diameter of 50â€“200 nm and possesses spikes on its surface (up to 20 nm in length) that provide it the crown-like appearance, a characteristic of coronaviruses (CoVs). The lung disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was given the name of COVID-19 by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on Feb 11, 2020. WHO declared COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020 and a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Although China was the epicenter of the pandemic in the beginning, Europe was declared as the new epicenter on March 13, 2020 as the number of cases and deaths in Europe exceeded that of China. However, as the number of COVID-19 cases has increased significantly in the United States recently, it could become the new epicenter of COVID-19, as mentioned by the WHO on March 24, 2020.</p>
