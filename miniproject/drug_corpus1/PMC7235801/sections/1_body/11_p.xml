<p>The accurate diagnosis of people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 is essential to curb the global spread of COVID-19. However, the current RT-PCR based diagnostic assays are not robust, as they are still missing several infected cases [

 <xref rid="B8-diagnostics-10-00202" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-diagnostics-10-00202" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, they can only be performed in well-equipped central laboratories by highly skilled analysts. Therefore, they are of limited utility and cannot be deployed widely, such as in developing nations, remote locations, and regions with decentralized laboratories. The delay in diagnosing people until after they have passed the disease onto many others is contributing to the continued global spread of COVID-19. The rapid LFIA and automated CLIA tests for IgM and IgG could complement the existing COVID-19 testing by RT-PCR. However, there is a need to stringently evaluate the clinical performance of commercial tests before they are used for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The biomarker discovery could also play a key role in identifying novel biomarkers that are involved in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The recently developed Abbott ID Nowâ„¢ COVID-19 test that detects SARS-CoV-2 in 5 min is a remarkable achievement [

The ongoing efforts will further lead to reliable, robust, rapid, and easy-to-implement IVD assays and smart diagnostics for COVID-19. There are still significant knowledge gaps in health research that are crucial for an effective public health response in the case of epidemics. It signifies the need for all nations to invest in health research and make it an integral part of healthcare.
