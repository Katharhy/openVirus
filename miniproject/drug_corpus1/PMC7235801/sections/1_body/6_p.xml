 <xref rid="B20-diagnostics-10-00202" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It is a molecular POC test that utilizes the isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology for the qualitative detection of viral RNA from SARS-CoV-2. The test can be used in any location, such as hospitals, clinics, physicians’ offices, or in outbreak hotspots of COVID-19. It requires just a portable touchscreen-operated instrument, i.e., ID Now, which is lightweight (6.6 pounds) and compact (the size of a small toaster). It employs a molecular test for the RdRp gene, and can take throat, nasal, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs as samples. The kit contains 24 tests, positive and negative controls, swabs for sample collection, and pipettes. It has just received the FDA EUA and is being seen as a remarkable achievement worldwide.
