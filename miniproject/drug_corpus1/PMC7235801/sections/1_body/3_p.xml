<p>The structure of SARS-CoV-2 comprises of spikes, which are formed by the SP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="diagnostics-10-00202-f001">Figure 1</xref>). SP is a major glycoprotein (Mol. Wt. ~180 kDa) that consists of two subunits, i.e., S1 and S2 [
 <xref rid="B10-diagnostics-10-00202" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. S1 contains a receptor binding domain (RBD), which is responsible for recognizing and binding with the host cell receptor, i.e., angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) found in the lower respiratory tract [

SP is the common target for neutralizing antibodies and vaccines, while the amino-terminal S1 subunit of SP is the most variable immunogenic antigen. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 has NP (Mol. Wt. ~40 kDa), the most abundant viral phosphoprotein produced and shed during infection. The template mRNA of NP is the most abundant subgenomic RNA. NP exhibits high immunogenicity and can be detected in either serum or urine samples during the first two weeks of infection with peak viral shedding around ten days after infection [
 <xref rid="B12-diagnostics-10-00202" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Being a large protein, it can be detected via a sandwich immunoassay. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 contains MP, which is the most abundant protein on the complete virion particle. The EP is the smallest major structural protein of SARS-CoV-2, which is involved in viral assembly, release of virions, and pathogenesis.
