<p>SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted to humans via humanâ€“animal contact at the live animals market in Wuhan, China, in late December, 2019 [

 <xref rid="B4-diagnostics-10-00202" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 has about 82% sequence homology to the human SARS-CoV and about 89% with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 [

The aged population (age above 65 years), and persons having decreased immunity or chronic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and lung disease, are at a higher risk for developing severe COVID-19 if they are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, they must take special precautions to prevent the infection. The WHO has stressed the need for more intensive testing of suspected cases to identify COVID-19 infected people so that they can be quarantined in order to avoid the further spread of infection. It is also evident that the existing real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain (RT-PCR) assays are unable to detect the COVID-19 in the early stages of infection, and there are reports where it has given false negatives in subjects for up to two weeks [

 <xref rid="B7-diagnostics-10-00202" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The reason of false negative results by RT-PCR could be due to the improper extraction of nucleic acid from clinical materials and insufficient cellular material for detection. A chest computerized tomography (CT) scan act as a complementary diagnostic tool that enables physicians to effectively detect COVID-19 infection in several such RT-PCR false-negative cases [

 <xref rid="B9-diagnostics-10-00202" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, there is a need for developing better in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assays that can detect the SARS-CoV-2 infection reliably in persons even at the initial stage. The specific biomarkers involved during the early stage of COVID-19 infection should be investigated and employed for the development of diagnostics.
