<p>Before the 2002 SARS epidemics, CoVs were predominantly associated with devastating outbreaks of severe diseases in livestock, mostly gastroenteritis and bronchitis, affecting domestic animals including cattle, pigs, and chickens. Coronaviruses also infect a variety of wild animals including birds, snakes, mice, and bats.

 <xref rid="t1-rmmj-11-3-e0023" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) was first described in the 1960s and was primarily associated with mild upper respiratory diseases (the “common cold”) caused by hCoV-229E and hCoV-OC43.

 <xref rid="b20-rmmj-11-3-e0023" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Two other hCoVs were identified almost 40 years later: hCoV-HKU1, which was linked with chronic pulmonary disease,
 <xref rid="b21-rmmj-11-3-e0023" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and hCoV-NL63, which was associated with both upper and lower respiratory tract disease in children and adults.
 <xref rid="b22-rmmj-11-3-e0023" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In addition, hCoV-NL63 was associated with croup in infants and young children. Interestingly, association of hCoV-NL63 with Kawasaki disease, an inflammation of blood vessels that mostly occurs in children, has been reported,
 <xref rid="b23-rmmj-11-3-e0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> yet subsequently failed to be confirmed.

 <xref rid="b10-rmmj-11-3-e0023" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Interestingly, sequence and phylogenetic analysis of hCoV-OC43 dates its transmission from cattle into the human population to around 1890, concurrently with a pandemic which killed approximately 1 million people worldwide and was traditionally ascribed to influenza virus.
 <xref rid="b10-rmmj-11-3-e0023" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The three other hCoVs can infect the lower respiratory tract and cause a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The SARS-CoV was identified with the emergence in 2002 of an atypical pneumonia that resulted in a 10% mortality rate, and MERS-CoV subsequently emerged in 2012 and caused 30% mortality.
