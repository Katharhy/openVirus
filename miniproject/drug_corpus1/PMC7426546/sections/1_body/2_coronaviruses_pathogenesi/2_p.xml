<p>Both hCoV-229E and hCoV-NL63 are alphacoronaviruses, while all other hCoVs belong to the betacoronavirus genus. All known hCoVs originated from animals, with rodents or bats being the most likely ancestors, and passed to humans either directly or through an intermediate host.

 <xref rid="b32-rmmj-11-3-e0023" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The occurrence of pathogenic hCoV outbreaks with a zoonotic origin has led to the search for animal reservoirs and the identification of a multitude of previously unknown coronaviruses, mostly in birds and bats, that have the potential to cross species. This reinforces the need to monitor animals to gain control over the emergence of these viruses.
