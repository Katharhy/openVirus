<p>An important parameter towards understanding any newly emerging virus concerns virus particle attachment to host cells. Attachment determines virus host range and may help in understanding its pathogenesis. Attachment of CoVs to the host cell receptor is mediated by the surface transmembrane S glycoprotein, which may also induce cell-to-cell fusion. The S protein is synthesized as a single polypeptide that is cleaved by cellular proteases into two polypeptides, S1 and S2. This cleavage may take place during virion assembly and release from the infected cell or during initiation of infection. The S1 protein, composed of the S protein amino terminal domain, forms the tip of the spike, and contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of most CoVs. Of note, S was suggested to be a modular protein that can exchange domains and thus provides a low barrier for selection of new coronaviruses that were either generated by mutations or recombination. The host protein, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was found to function as a critical determinant for hCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2 cellular tropism.
 <xref rid="b33-rmmj-11-3-e0023" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Like other viral receptors ACE2 is a cellular molecule which has an important physiologic function. Decoding the molecular and structural bases for receptor usage is crucial for understanding cross-species transmission but may also suggest potential therapeutic strategies. Development of animal models for SARS-CoV-2 infection is vital in providing comprehensive understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms involved but may also serve for screening anti-viral drugs and vaccines.
