<p>Vaccines against viral diseases have been in use for hundreds of years and have proven powerful in preventing infection. The objective of the vaccines is to generate an effective and safe immune response that will then protect from natural infection. Vaccination may be mediated through passive immunization, which involves injection of components of the immune response, or through active immunization, which triggers an active host response.</p>
