<p>A race to generate a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is ongoing, involving dozens of candidates in the development pipeline. Among others, new approaches involving RNA and DNA vaccines that enable production of viral antigens upon injection are also being evaluated. A universal coronavirus vaccine designed to target conserved viral epitopes, most likely in the spike proteins, may enable protection from a wide range of related viruses, including CoV types that could emerge in the future. Realistically, vaccination is a long-term goal that could take more than a year. In addition, development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine may prove difficult or even unfeasible as is the case for HIV and HCV, which, even after many years of research and huge development budget, are yet to have an effective and safe vaccine. Furthermore, even once a safe and effective vaccine is developed, billions of doses have to be manufactured and distributed worldwide.</p>
