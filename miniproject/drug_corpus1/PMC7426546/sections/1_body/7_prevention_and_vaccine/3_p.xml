<p>Active vaccines employ attenuated live viruses, inactivated viruses, recombinant viruses, recombinant or purified viral proteins, or virion-like particles that mimic infectious virions. In all cases, the vaccine induces an immune response that should protect against future exposure to the virulent pathogen. When developing a vaccine, it is important to ensure that the vaccine is safe and does not cause major side effects or other unwanted effects that may, in some cases, even exacerbate infection. After the safety tests, vaccine efficacy, which measures how well it protects from disease, is tested. Usually the first test experiments are done in animal models and only then in humans. They involve vaccination and subsequent evaluation of neutralizing antibody production and other potential immune responses. In certain cases, they involve challenge with the virus and long-term follow-up of vaccinated individuals as compared to control groups. The response to immunization must be evaluated in various populations including the elderly who are more vulnerable to infection but unfortunately mount lower responses to vaccines. An effective vaccine is one that induces an immune response that provides protection against infection and pathogen-related disease. Ideally, a vaccine should provide life-long protection, yet short-term vaccines may also be useful, at least during an intermediate period until alternatives are available.</p>
