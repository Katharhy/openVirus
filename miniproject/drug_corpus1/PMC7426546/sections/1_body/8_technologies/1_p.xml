<p>The urgent need to control the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has brought together a large number of scientists and entrepreneurs to look for solutions that would delay and prevent infection. These solutions include active face masks embedded with anti-viral molecules or particles, fabrics containing anti-viral compounds, anti-viral coatings for surfaces, and various low-toxicity environmental disinfectants. At the same time, ventilators and supportive equipment for patients have been recently developed. Artificial intelligence, Big Data, and machine learning have also been instrumental in tracking virus spread, understanding the epidemiology of the disease, monitoring patients, and preventing the spread of the virus, as well as identifying other clues that may help understand viral pathogenesis towards mitigating and combating COVID-19. Finally, by combining large-scale knowledge, literature, transcriptome data including single-cell RNA sequencing, data learning can help finding potential drug and vaccine targets.</p>
