<p>In March 2015, Bill Gates, the cofounder of Microsoft, gave a TED presentation in which he stated that while many countries are investing in developing nuclear defense measures, they should be investing similar efforts in developing protection measures against deadly virus pandemics.
 <xref rid="b1-rmmj-11-3-e0023" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> He referred to the 2014 Ebola virus outbreak, which killed more than 11,000 people in West Africa, and warned that the USA and other countries were not ready for the future epidemic that could be even more devastating. “If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades, it’s most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war,” Gates said. Gates repeatedly urged governments to prepare for pandemics in a manner similar to their preparations for war. Five years later, in 2020, when the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)—caused by the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus—to be a pandemic, this talk was widely acknowledged to be almost prophetic. Unfortunately, society, governments, public health officials, pharmaceutical companies, and researchers were not properly prepared for this outbreak.
