<p>The success of developing a number of agents to treat or inhibit human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, as well as anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) medications to bring about complete cure, reinforces the belief that any viral disease can be effectively treated by specific, safe, and effective anti-viral drugs. However, unfortunately, at present there is no effective drug to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection or any other CoV. The emergence of COVID-19 highlights the need for novel drug discovery for the treatment CoV infections, in particular SARS-CoV-2. The use of a variety of strategies to detect potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection is expected to identify a large panel of potential anti-viral compounds. For example, the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) encoded in the genome of all coronaviruses is a promising candidate for targeting SARS-CoV-2. Given the conserved nature of RdRp among different coronaviruses, drugs that target this protein could constitute a pan-CoV anti-viral drug. However, like with any new drug, development and evaluation processes take time. Therefore, screening of previously approved drugs for anti-viral effects and repurposing them to treat the current pandemic may save time in the development process. Finally, evaluation of the effectiveness of type I interferon combinations, which is known to induce cellular anti-viral responses and to enhance host immunity, in combination with other already known and new drugs, is warranted.</p>
