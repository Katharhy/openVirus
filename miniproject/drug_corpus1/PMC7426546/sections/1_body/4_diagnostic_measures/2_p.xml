<p>Viral infections can be diagnosed through the detection of viral antigens or genomes by various methods, of which the most widely used is based on amplification of viral genomic sequences. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 testing is based on respiratory specimens, either oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal, or both, that undergo RNA extraction followed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Several assays have been optimized to have high sensitivity and minimal cross-reactivity with circulating viruses present in the community. These tests can diagnose or rule out COVID-19 in suspected patients and may also track the infection in those who were in contact with infected individuals. Scaling up these tests to expand testing capacity has been a major goal during the COVID-19 outbreak. Other nucleic acid-based diagnostics, such as nucleic acid sequencing, were established and are commercially available. Of note, inadequate sample collection may yield false negative tests. Early implementation of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics for the identification and subsequent isolation of infected individuals has been helpful in control of the outbreak. However, different implementation strategies and indications for diagnostic testing were chosen in different countries depending on public health policies, testing capacity, and the morbidity rate.
