 <p>The lessons learned from the response to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic are important to quell the opioid use disorder epidemic in the United States. This article identifies similar barriers to treatment and care that persons living with HIV experienced in the 1980s and early 1990s that are currently being experienced by persons living with opioid use disorder. In addition, this article reviews the ways in which those barriers were overcome to reduce the mortality and morbidity from HIV and highlights similar strategies that can also help persons living with opioid use disorder in this country.</p>
