<p id="p0075">Although it is not surprising, it is still heart breaking for clinicians who cared then and care now for people with HIV (PWH) to see more HIV outbreaks occurring in the United States among PWUD related to these newer opioid epidemics over the past 10 years given that it was known then that sharing contaminated IDU equipment and condomless sexual intercourse drove the HIV epidemic in this country and globally.

 </xref> What is surprising is that, unlike the early HIV epidemic, where there were very few medications to treat HIV early on, for more than 50 years there have been effective medications to treat OUD, including methadone, followed later by buprenorphine, and then extended-release naltrexone. All of these US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved medications have extensive evidence to show that they reduce opioid use, craving, overdose, and HIV and HCV transmission.

 </xref> What is clear is that persons with OUD are not receiving these medications. Further, as was identified at the height of the AIDS epidemic in the United States, harm reduction services such as clean needle syringe exchange programs markedly reduced HIV transmission in PWUD,

In February 2019, the President of the United States called for a plan to end HIV in the United States, with specific goals to reduce new HIV infections by 75% by 2025 and by 90% by 2030.
