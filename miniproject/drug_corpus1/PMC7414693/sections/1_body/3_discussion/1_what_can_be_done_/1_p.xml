<p id="p0110">The scrutiny of the parallel of the HIV and the OUD epidemics is helpful because it identifies similar barriers to treatment and how to quell the coalescing substance use and infectious disease epidemics. A recent National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) committee has released recommendations identifying these barriers after conducting interviews of programs across the country that were integrating infectious disease and OUD prevention and treatment services.

 </xref> Such parallels of the opioid epidemic to the early HIV epidemic have led agencies and experts with expertise in HIV and the OUD to call for specific known recommendations to end not only the opioid epidemic but also new illicit substance epidemics, as well as to prevent new HIV and other infectious disease epidemics from occurring in this country, as identified earlier.
