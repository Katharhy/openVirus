<p id="Par7">The major entry of SARS-CoV-2 is via the respiratory system where it readily affects differentiated cells that express more ACE2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The type II transmembrane serine proteases TMPRSS2 and ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) promote SARS-CoV entry by ACE2 cleavage, promotes viral uptake, and SARS-S cleavage, resulting in activation of the viral S protein, which in turn fuses with cell membrane [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The attachment of the viruses to cell surface ACE2 protects them from immune surveillance mechanisms and provides the virus access to the host cell system, an environment not just to sustain and proliferate, but also to mutate and modify host evasion mechanisms. The precise relationship, however, between ACE2 levels and activity, viral infectivity, and severity of infection, is incompletely understood.
