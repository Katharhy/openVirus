<p id="Par5">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 which binds and enters the host cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2. Therapy with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors (ACE inhibitors [ACEi], angiotensin [ANG] II receptor blockers [ARB], and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists [MRA]) may increase ACE2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The concern, therefore, has been raised that a potential increase in ACE2 by these agents may facilitate development and increase severity of COVID-19. In this brief review, we contend that a potential harmful effect of RAÎ‘S inhibitors cannot be excluded in the COVID-19 era and thus, caution required when prescribing these agents.
