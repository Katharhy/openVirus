<p id="Par18">In our current practice when it comes to prescribe a RAASi in the COVID-19 context, we base our decision on the following premises: (a) COVID-19 is a pandemic responsible for millions of infections and hundreds of thousands deaths worldwide; (b) COVID-19 is due to SARS-CoV-2 which binds and enters host cells through the ACE2 receptor; (c) the protective ACE2/ANG [1â€“7]/Mas axis may not be efficiently operative in the lungs; (d) RAASi may increase the tissue expression of ACE2; (e) lethal complications of COVID-19 are more common in diseases frequently treated with RAASi such as hypertension, other cardiovascular disease, and diabetes; (f) confounding cannot be corrected even after application of multiple adjustment techniques; (g) RAASi had proved lifesaving in the pre COVID-19 era; (h) RCTs testing the efficacy and safety of RAASi in the COVID-19 era are lacking; and (i) considering that RCTs are lacking we must follow the trail to the next best external evidence and work from there [
