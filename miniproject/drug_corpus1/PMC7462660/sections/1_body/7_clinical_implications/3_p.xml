<p id="Par17">Over the past four decades, results from well-done RCTs have repeatedly contradicted practices supported by clinical observation [

 <italic>n</italic> = 151,870), the results of OSs and RCTs differed for the association of hormone therapy with outcome after adjusting for confounding factors and stratifying on factors that were hypothesized to modulate the effects of hormone therapy or that empirically modulated the effects of hormone therapy [

 <italic>n</italic> = 26,211), whereas it did not decrease mortality in two RCTs (
 <italic>n</italic> = 888) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. As a result, in the guidelines, beta-blockers are not recommended for the treatment of HFpEF. These are just few examples that OSs studies proved wrong. Thus, OSs cannot replace RCTs, even after application of multiple adjustment techniques.
