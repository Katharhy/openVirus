<p id="Par8">Prior to COVID-19 pandemic, it was suggested that ACE2 dysregulation is implicated in acute inflammatory lung injury (ILI) by inducing an imbalance in the RAS. It was proposed that in acute ILI: (i) a decrease in pulmonary ACE2 and an increase in ANG II levels occur; (ii) supplementation with ACE2 or inhibition of ANG II improves outcomes; and (iii) a lack or decrease of pulmonary ACE2 aggravates viral-induced ILI [

SARS-CoV S protein and its RNA were only detected in ACE2(+) cells in the lungs and other organs, indicating that ACE2-expressing cells are the primary targets for SARS-CoV infection in vivo in humans. High levels of PICs were expressed in the SARS-CoV-infected ACE2(+) cells, but not in the uninfected cells suggesting that cells infected by SARS-CoV produce elevated levels of PICs which may cause immuno-mediated damage to the lungs resulting in ILI [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] which used gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and showed that the high expression of ACE2 is related to innate immune responses, adaptive immune responses, B cell regulation, and cytokine secretion, as well as an enhanced cytokine-induced inflammatory response. Based on these findings, it has been postulated that the immune system dysfunction involved in the high expression of ACE2 may be related to the development of the hyperinflammatory response in COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Consistent with these lung inflammatory changes, a persistent increase in inflammatory markers, such as c-reactive protein, d-dimer, ferritin, interleukin-6, is associated with major complications and increased mortality in COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Moreover, obesity, which is associated with chronic inflammation and high expression of ACE2, significantly increases the risk for severe COVID-19 even in younger age groups [
