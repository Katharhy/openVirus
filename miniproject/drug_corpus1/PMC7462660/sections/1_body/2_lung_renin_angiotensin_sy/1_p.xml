<p id="Par6">The traditional view is that some of renin-angiotensin system intermediate products may be processed in alternative ways by ACE2, establishing a second axis through ACE2/ANG [1–7]/Mas receptor which counteracts the effects of the classical axis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, recent evidence suggests that prolyloligopeptidase (POP) is the main enzyme responsible for the conversion of deleterious ANG II to protective ANG [1–7] in the circulation and lungs, whereas ACE2 contributes to ANG [1–7] formation in the kidney [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In addition, POP is an important player in neutrophilic inflammation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Regarding Mas, further studies need to clarify its relationship with ANG [1–7], which may depend on the specific cell types and their expression of other G protein-coupled receptors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Thus, it is questionable whether an efficient ACE2/ANG [1–7]/Mas axis is operative in the lungs.
