<p>There are various medications (new and established) that are currently being tested in randomized clinical trials (RCT) for the treatment of COVID‐19 disease. Chloroquine (an old antimalarial medication), and hydroxychloroquine (used in treating some rheumatologic conditions) showed good in‐vitro activity against the virus and there was great excitement about the potential of these medications in the early stages of the pandemic.

 </xref> However, the RCTs so far have not shown any benefit for chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, rather, a study had to be stopped mid‐trial due to side effects of therapy as 11 patients died in the group taking chloroquine. In an analysis of a multinational registry of 96 032 patients from 671 hospitals in six continents, Mehra and colleagues

 </xref> found no benefit of Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, when used alone or with a macrolide, on in‐hospital outcome for COVID‐19. Each of these drug regimens was associated with decreased in‐hospital survival and an increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmias when used for treatment of COVID‐19. Complications of the drug include severe cardiac electrical abnormalities electrical irregularities in the heart such as polymorphic VT (Torsade de Pointes), long QT syndrome, and increased risk of sudden death.

 </xref> Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue prodrug that inhibits viral RNA polymerases and which was initially developed to treat the Ebola virus has also shown good in‐vitro activity against the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus.

 </xref> Convalescent plasma and tocilizumab (a monoclonal antibody against interleukin‐6) are other therapies that have shown some promise in reducing severity of illness in case series but the results of RCTs on these are still awaited.
