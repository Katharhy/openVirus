 </xref> On the other hand, markedly elevated angiotensin II levels were noted in plasma samples from SARS‐CoV‐2 infected patients and were linearly associated with viral load and lung injury. Indeed, enhanced ACE activity and decreased ACE2 activity have been shown to contribute to lung injury in mouse models
