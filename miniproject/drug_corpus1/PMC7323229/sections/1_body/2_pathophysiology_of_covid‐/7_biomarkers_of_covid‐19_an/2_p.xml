<p>Laboratory results for patients with COVID 19 exhibit elevated cardiac biomarkers. Mild elevation of cardiac troponin levels (less than 2 to 3 times of upper limits of normal) have been observed and thought likely to be due to possible pre‐existing cardiac condition and/or acute injury related to COVID‐19. In patients with severe and fatal COVID‐19, higher levels of cardiac troponin (more than five times upper limits of normal) suggests severe respiratory failure, tachycardia, systemic hypoxemia, myocardial injury either from potential direct or indirect viral myocarditis, endothelial dysfunction or plaque rupture triggered by COVID‐19 infection with subsequent acute coronary syndrome, Takotsubo syndrome or progression to multiple organ failure.
