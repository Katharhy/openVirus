<p>There are only few postmortem studies, however, histopathologic changes are consistent with diffuse alveolar damage, reactive type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, hyaline membrane formation, intra‐alveolar fibrin exudates, epithelial damage, along with loose interstitial fibrosis and chronic inflammatory infiltrates.

 </xref> Intravascular coagulopathy was noted in an autopsy study with fibrin thrombosis of small arterial vessels in 87% of specimens. Microvascular thrombosis and hemorrhage linked to extensive alveolar and interstitial inflammation that shares features with the macrophage activation syndrome. This may explain the severe hypoxemia which characterizes the clinical feature of ARDS in COVID‐19 patients.
