<p>Men are at higher risk in the COVID‐19 epidemic. They are admitted to hospital at higher rates and suffer higher degrees of morbidity and mortality. United States data from the COVID‐19 net dataset (May 9, 2020) found that men represented 52.9% of the hospitalized population as compared to 47.1% being women. A report of 5700 patients from a New York hospital system found that men represented 60.3% of the admitted patients. COVID‐19 mortality in this study was higher in men than in women at every age.
