<p>Patients with pre‐existing co‐morbidities are thought to be at an increased risk of infection with SARS‐CoV2 and tend to have worse clinical outcomes. Specifically, patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and hypertension are thought to have a high complication rate with mortality rate of 10.5% reported in cardiac patients and mortality rates of 7.3% and 6.0% for diabetes and hypertension patients, respectively.

 </xref> In a review of 1590 Chinese patients, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, hepatis B infection, COPD, and chronic kidney disease were found to increase the risk of severe infections with COVID‐19 disease. In this study, when looking at a composite endpoint of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation and death, this end point was reached in 4.5% of patients with no co‐morbidities, 19.3% of patients with one co‐morbidity and 28.5% of patients with 2 or more co‐morbidities.

 </xref> This suggests increasing severity of disease as the number of co‐morbidities increase. Studies in the United States have suggested that obesity may also be a risk factor for severe COVID‐19 disease.
