<p>Non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are medications that work by inhibiting the cyclo‐oxygenase enzyme that produces prostaglandins and are commonly used for the relief of pain and fever. Initial public concern for these medications in the context of COVID‐19 was raised by the French Minister of Health in mid‐March and the basis of his concern appeared to be an anecdotal report of four patients who had appeared to worsen in the context of NSAID use. These medications have been shown to increase the expression of ACE2 on the cellular membranes and could theoretically increase viral entry into respiratory cells.

 </xref> However, aside from case reports, there is no other evidence that NSAIDs lead to poor outcomes in COVID‐19 patients and in contrast, one NSAID, Indomethacin has shown in vitro evidence of inhibition of RNA synthesis of the SARS‐CoV‐1 virus independent of its cyclooxygenase activity.

 </xref> More studies will be needed on this, but given this concern, many European countries have suggested that in patients with respiratory tract infections, acetaminophen should be used in preference to NSAIDs for control of pain and fever.
