<p>There are no clear statistics on the incidence of ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) from intracoronary plaque rupture or obstruction in the setting of COVID 19 disease and it is likely low. Acute coronary events may be triggered by plaque rupture and coronary thrombosis due to inflammation/increased shear stress in high risk patients. Tam et al, reported a significant decline in the number of patients with STEMI seeking medical care at their institute.

 </xref> They attributed this to the reluctance of patients to go to a hospital during the COVID‐19 outbreak, delays in evaluating patients with STEMI after hospital arrival due to precautions such as detailed travel and contact history, symptomatology, and chest X‐ray. Taken together, this may delay patient transfer to catheterization laboratory. Additional precautions taken in catheterization laboratory such as time needed to wear protective gear may further delay intervention.
