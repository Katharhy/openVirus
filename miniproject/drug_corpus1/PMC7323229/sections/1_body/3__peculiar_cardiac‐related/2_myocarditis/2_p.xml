<p>The actual incidence of myocarditis with COVID‐19 infection is undetermined, however it is assumed that up to 7% of the COVID‐19‐related deaths are linked to myocarditis. The spectrum of symptoms may vary from mild symptoms such as mild chest pain, dyspnea and fatigue to more severe symptoms with left and right ventricular failure, cardiogenic shock, arrythmia, and sudden cardiac death with fulminant myocarditis.

 </xref> Although there is no strong evidence supporting direct COVID‐19 viral myocarditis so far, the viral RNAs of MERS‐CoV and SARS‐CoV, which are close relatives of SARS‐CoV‐2 have been found in the heart tissues of infected animals. COVID‐19 myocarditis is likely due to a combination of direct cell injury and T‐lymphocytes‐mediated cytotoxicity which can be augmented by the cytokine storm syndrome.
