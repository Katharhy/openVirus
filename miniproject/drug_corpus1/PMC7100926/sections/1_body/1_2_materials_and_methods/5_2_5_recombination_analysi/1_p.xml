<p>Characterization of the recombinants was performed by SIMPLOT software version 3.5.1 [
 <xref rid="pone.0230878.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The following parameters were adopted for the analyses: F84 nucleotide substitution model with 1000 bootstrap support, 140 bp sliding window and 20 bp step size, and empirically determined transition/transverse ratio for each alignment. Gaps were automatically removed from the alignment. Sequences were considered recombinant when they had a bootstrap of 70% for more than one HIV-1 subtype along the nucleotide sequence.
