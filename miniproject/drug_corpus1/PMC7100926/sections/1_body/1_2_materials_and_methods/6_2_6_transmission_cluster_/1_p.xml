<p>Transmissions Clusters networks were inferred using HIV-TRACE online tool (Transmission Cluster Engine) [

Each query sequence alignment for subtypes B, F and BF recombinants were analyzed separately. Firstly, all sequences were aligned to HXB2 reference sequence. Putative network transmission between query sequences was considered if the pairwise distance computed were â‰¤0.020 substitutions/site (distance threshold) measure by TN93 substitution model, because this threshold was previously tested in HIV-1 epidemiologically related clusters [

 <xref rid="pone.0230878.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. HIV-TRACE analysis has been made with the exclusion of drug resistance-associated mutations, due to the possible effect of convergent evolution caused by antiretroviral resistance pressure that has the potential to confound evolutionary analysis [
