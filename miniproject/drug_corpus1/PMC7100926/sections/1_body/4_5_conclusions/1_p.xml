<p>The study was conducted in patients with antiretroviral virological failure from Northeast Brazil. High HIV-1 genetic diversity was observed, with a predominance of subtype B (84.7%) and BF recombinants (9.5%). A high frequency of secondary antiretroviral resistance mutations (74.1%) was also demonstrated, with a higher rate in Nucleoside and Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors than in Protease Inhibitors. Emtricitabine, lamivudine, efavirenz, and nevirapine were the antiretroviral drugs with the most resistance.</p>
