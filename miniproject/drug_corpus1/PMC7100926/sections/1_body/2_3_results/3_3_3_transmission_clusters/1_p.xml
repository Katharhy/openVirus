<p>Transmission cluster analysis identified 11 clusters containing 22 query sequences (22/633, 3.5%). All putative transmissions clusters contained only two individuals. Most clusters were composed of individuals infected with subtype B (n = 09). Subtype F and BF recombinants were identified in one cluster each. Only five women have been shown in the clusters (05/22) and the query sequences belonging to the transmissions clusters have been isolated among the sampling period 2014â€“2017 (
