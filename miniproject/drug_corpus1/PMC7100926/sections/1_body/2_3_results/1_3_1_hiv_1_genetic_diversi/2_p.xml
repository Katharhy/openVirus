<p>Despite the low frequency of subtype C, an equal proportion between C and BC recombinants has been observed. Out of 6 BC recombinants detected 4 had a CRF31-like pattern grouped into a cluster related to CRF31_BC and 2 other strains have shown distinct recombination patterns (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230878.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Those clusters have not shared recombination breakpoints with other CRFs BF (see breakpoints in the caption in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230878.g002">Fig 2</xref>). BF recombinant cluster with nine sequences (shown in green in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230878.g002">Fig 2</xref>) have breakpoints, in the analyzed genomic region, closer to CRFs 39 and 90BF, however, none evolutionary relationship among them in phylogenetic analysis has been seen. The largest BF cluster with fourteen sequences (colored in red in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230878.g002">Fig 2</xref>), has two breakpoints and the other BF cluster (nine sequences) are composed of recombinant strains with three breakpoints. The diagram in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230878.g002">Fig 2</xref> shows the parental composition and locations of breakpoints in the protease of recombinant strains identified in our study. The recombination patterns of these two clusters are shown in S2 Fig. Twenty-one query sequences showed phylogenetic relationships with CRFs 28e29_BF. Among them, two clusters were identified, one with three (aLTR: 1.00) and another one with five query sequences (aLTR: 1.00). Nevertheless, none sequence revealed a recombination pattern similar to the described CRFs (S3 Fig–
