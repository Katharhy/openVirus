<p>Among HIV-1 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences, subtype B prevails (n = 535, 84.5%; 95%CI: 81.7–87.3%), followed by a high frequency of BF recombinants (n = 60, 9.5%; 95%CI: 7.4–12%) and lower proportions of subtypes F (n = 25, 3.9%; 95%CI: 2.7–5.8%), C (n = 06, 0.9%; 95%CI: 0.4–2.1%), and BC recombinants (n = 06, 0.9%; 95%CI: 0.4–2.1%). One sequence was identified as HIV-1 subtype D (17BR_MA6262), obtained by a female patient in 2017. 57.2% of individuals were male (n = 362), while women comprised 42.8% (n = 271).
