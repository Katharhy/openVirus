<p>Antiretroviral resistance analysis was performed for PI, NRTIs and NNRTIs. Seventy-four percent (95%CI: 70.5–77.4) of the analyzed sequences displayed resistance to at least one of the tested inhibitors. It was observed that the frequency of resistance to NRTIs (65.2%, 95% CI: 61.5–68.9) was significantly higher than the one to NNRTIs (57.8%, 95%CI: 53.9–61.6) and PIs (18.6%, 95%CI: 15.8–21.9) (p &lt;0.001), and the frequency of resistance for NNRTIs was higher than for PIs (p &lt;0.001). When analyzing antiretroviral resistance in relation to different times, no significant difference in temporal variations was found (

The main resistance mutations that we identified were D30N, M46I, I54LV, V82A, N88D, and L90M for PIs; M41L, K65R, D67N, K70R, M184V, L210W, and T215FY for NRTIs; and L100I, K103N, and G190A for NNRTIs. Among PIs, Darunavir/ritonavir had very low resistance rates, only 3/633 (0.5%, 95%CI: 0.2–1.4), while atazanavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir have shown significantly higher average frequencies of 11.5% (95%CI: 9.3–14.3) and 10.7 (95%CI: 8.6–13.4), respectively (p&lt; 0.0001). Emtricitabine and Lamivudine had higher resistance rates (around 50–60%) than NRTIs (p&lt; 0.0001), while Tenofovir was the NRTI with the lowest secondary resistance level (average rate of 8%, 95%CI: 6.2–10.4, p&lt;0.0001). Among NNRTIs, higher resistances were observed against Efavirenz and Nevirapine than Etravirine and Rilpivirine (p &lt;0.0001). Rilpivirine has been the NNRTI with a lower resistance level (average rate of 5.4%, 95%CI: 3.9–7.4, p&lt; 0.0001) (
