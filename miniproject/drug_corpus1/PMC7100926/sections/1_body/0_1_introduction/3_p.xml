<p>Given the enormous HIV-1 diversity in Brazil, a better knowledge of its genetic variability is crucial for the understanding of inter-subtype recombination mechanisms, vaccine development, viral pathogenesis, transmission pathways, evaluation of antiretroviral drug resistance, and differentiation of therapeutic regimens [

Besides, there has been an increase in the number of AIDS cases among the younger male population in Brazil, which coincides with the increase in cases among men who have sex with men (from 21.2 to 32.8 per 100,000 inhabitants, from 2008 to 2018) [

This study aims to genetically characterize HIV-1 subtypes and recombinants in the state of Maranh√£o, northeast Brazil, and to determine their antiretroviral resistance profiles.
