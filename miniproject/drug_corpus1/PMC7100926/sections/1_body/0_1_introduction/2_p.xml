<p>The main HIV-1 subtypes found in Brazil are B, F, C, and BF and BC recombinants [
 <xref rid="pone.0230878.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>; 
 <xref rid="pone.0230878.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>; 
 <xref rid="pone.0230878.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>; 
 <xref rid="pone.0230878.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>; 
 <xref rid="pone.0230878.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, Brazil is a country of continental dimensions, with economic, social, and cultural differences, which may interfere with the dynamics of the epidemics. Due to the large territorial proportion, the HIV-1 genetic diversity in Brazil has regional characteristics with subtype B being the most spread in the country [
 <xref rid="pone.0230878.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, some regions have a high proportion of other subtypes and/or recombinants. Some regions of Northeast Brazil have a high proportion of subtype F (~30%) [
 <xref rid="pone.0230878.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and recombinant BF (18%) [
 <xref rid="pone.0230878.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], as well as circulation of recently identified recombinant circulating forms (CRFs) such as the CRF70 and 71BF [
 <xref rid="pone.0230878.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In the southern region, HIV-1 subtype C and its recombinant forms, mainly CRF31_BC, are predominant [
 <xref rid="pone.0230878.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In the North and Central-west region, there is a higher prevalence of subtypes B (74–90%) and F (6.7–14%) [
 <xref rid="pone.0230878.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>; 
 <xref rid="pone.0230878.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Recently, in the Midwest, 2 new CRFs were identified, CRF 90_BF [
 <xref rid="pone.0230878.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and CRF_99BF [
 <xref rid="pone.0230878.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].
