Our data showed a much lower resistance to Tenofovir than Entricitabine, which may assure the effectiveness of PrEP, but a continuous assessment of the HIV-1 infected population for antiretroviral resistance will be required in view of the adoption of this new prophylactic measure. One of the limitations of this study is the lack of assessment of resistance to Integrase Inhibitors. However, this class of antiretroviral was included in the treatment of newly diagnosed individuals for HIV-1 only in 2017, just in the final period of our research.
