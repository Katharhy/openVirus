<p>A High frequency of subtype B (84.7%) was detected, and among non-B subtypes, BF recombinants (9.5%) were highlighted. A high level of antiretroviral resistance was observed, with 74.1% (95%CI: 70.5–77.4) of the strains presenting resistance to at least one of the analyzed classes of drugs (NRTIs, NNRTIs, and PIs). However, the frequency of resistance to PIs was significantly lower than the resistance to NRTIs and NNRTIs (p &lt;0.001), with 18.6% (95%CI: 15.8–21.9), 65.2% (95%CI: 61.5–68.9) and 57.8% (95%CI: 53.9–61.6), respectively. The high proportion of HIV-1 subtype B detected in our study corroborates with previous phylogenetic data on HIV-1 genetic diversity in Maranhão state, which also showed a high rate of HIV-1 B (81.1%) [
 <xref rid="pone.0230878.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and in neighboring states, such as Piauí (HIV-1 B = 86.5%) and Pará (HIV-1 B = 90%) [
 <xref rid="pone.0230878.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, as Brazil is a country of continental dimensions, there is variation in the HIV-1 genetic diversity in the same macroregion. Thus, in the Northeast, there are states with lower proportions of HIV-1 B, as Pernambuco, where the subtype is F common (31.4%) [
 <xref rid="pone.0230878.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and Bahia with a frequency of 18.6% for BF recombinants [
 <xref rid="pone.0230878.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. BF recombinants were detected in 9.5% of all sequences in our study. This may be related to the fact that the state of Maranhão is closely located to places with a large circulation of these recombinants [
 <xref rid="pone.0230878.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], including areas where new CRFs BF were identified, such as CRF90_BF in Tocantins and Goiás and CRF99_BF in Goiás [12; 13]. It is important to highlight the cluster of recombinant like-31BC, whose presence is very common in the southern region of the country. Another interesting point is the large number of query sequences (n = 21, 35% of BF recombinants) phylogenetically related to recombinants 28 and 29BF. This can be partially explained by the high flux of tourists that came from Southeastern Brazil which is the place of origin of recombinants 28 and 29BF.
