<p>Antiretroviral resistance was evaluated in patients referred for HIV-1 genotyping due to virological failure, thus all analyzed patients have been undergoing treatment. This explains the high rate of secondary resistance (74.1%, 70.5–77.4%). PIs showed a lower proportion of resistance when compared to NRTIs and NNRTIs. Moreover, Darunavir/ritonavir resistance was very low, as only 3 strains showed resistance to it, which reveals its excellent applicability as rescue therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first study with a large number of individuals evaluating the HIV-1 antiretroviral resistance and diversity in patients who had started antiretroviral therapy in the state of Maranhão, one of the places with the lowest Human Development Index in Brazil. Another research, carried out in the same state by [

Only mutations for NRTIs and NNRTIs resistance were detected, demonstrating the low circulation of primary mutations to PIs in untreated patients. On the other hand, a study evaluating patients with therapeutic failure in large cities in Brazil, including the Northeast region, also indicated a higher level of resistance to NRTIs and NNRTIs, but with a lower frequency of mutations for PIs resistance in both naive and treated individuals [

Among NNRTIs, higher resistances were observed against Efavirenz and Nevirapine, which was largely used NNRTIs in Brazil as the recommended first-line regimen, being replaced, in 2017, by the integrase inhibitor dolutegravir. Although Tenofovir is recommended as the first-line regimen, it has been presented the lowest rate of secondary antiretroviral resistance among NRTIs, which gives it a great treatment option.
