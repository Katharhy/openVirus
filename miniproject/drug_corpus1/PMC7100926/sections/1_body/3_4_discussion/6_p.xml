<p>The present study indicates a predominance of subtype B and BF recombinants. One of the important factors in determining the HIV-1 genetic diversity is the identification of possible strains that are more likely to result in disease progression. Some studies in Brazil have linked BF recombinants with faster progression to AIDS-defining events [

 <xref rid="pone.0230878.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Thus, the high frequency of these recombinants may be related to a greater chance of disease progression. In addition, BF recombinants showed a higher frequency of PIs resistance, although with borderline statistical significance (data not shown). The presented data reveal the importance of investigating the molecular epidemiology of HIV-1, as this will enable us to monitor the spread or retraction of the epidemic and of antiretroviral resistance. In addition, molecular analyses can provide important data for constant update and optimization of therapy, implementation of preventive measures, and evaluation of transmission of the various HIV-1 subtypes and recombinants.
