  <title>Phylogenetic tree of HIV-1 pol sequences obtained from Northeastâ€”Brazil.</title>
  <p>The maximum-likelihood tree obtained with 1038 bp corresponding to the protease region and part of the reverse transcriptase. A total of 535 HIV-1 subtype B query sequences branched (aLTR = 0.97) with 22 HIV-1 B reference sequences (depicted in green). Twenty-five HIV-1 subtype F query sequences branched (aLTR = 0.98) with 17 references sequences (red color). Six HIV-1 subtype C query sequences were identified (aLTR = 0.97) (blue color). Query sequence 17BR_MA6262 clustered with HIV-1 subtype D references sequences (aLTR = 0.80) (purple color). Reference sequences of HIV-1 subtypes A1, A2, A3, A4, A6, B, C, D, F1, F2, G, H, J, and K were used to phylogenetic analysis, described in the supplementary material (black color).</p>
