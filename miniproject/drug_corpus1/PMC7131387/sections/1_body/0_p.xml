<p id="p0005">The world’s attention is focused on the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, which began in Wuhan China this past December. In the last two decades, this is the 3rd coronavirus that has crossed the species barrier to cause significant human infections. All three (SARS, MERS, COVID-19) are zoonoses, and that understanding is critical to thinking through counter-measures toward identifying, managing, and preventing future outbreaks. Throughout SE Asia, but particularly in China, so-called “wet” markets provide the perfect set of circumstances for the emergence of new viral variants with the potential for human infection. Having visited these markets myself, it is clear how and why these markets facilitate the emergence of these viruses. Domestic and international exotic animal species—including birds, reptiles, fish, and mammalian species—are held in cages sprawled across both large and small markets. The animals themselves are stressed, subjected to inhumane conditions, jammed above, beside, and below cages of other animal species to which they normally would never be exposed. The trade in such animals is unregulated and without regard to the negative impact on either animal or human health. Animals are slaughtered at the market—entrails, carcasses, and meat sit in the open air without ice or refrigeration. In fact, I never witnessed any handwashing facilities, ice, and other normal food handling precautions. In short, this is the perfect “petri dish” environment for the recombination of a variety of viruses that under normal circumstances would never encounter one another. To this is added hundreds of thousands of people, both ill and well, frequenting these markets. It is not by chance that these viruses emerge from such conditions.</p>
