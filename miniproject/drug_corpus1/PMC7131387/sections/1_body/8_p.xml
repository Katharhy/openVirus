<p id="p0095">As the world waits and watches, it is apparent that Chinese authorities in particular, and all countries, must take more seriously the threat of these emerging coronavirus human pathogens. Specific steps should include the following:

   <p id="p0100">Regulate so-called wet markets with bans on the unregulated sale and trade in exotic animals.</p>

   <p id="p0105">Improve sanitation in such markets with food protection and hygienic standards appropriate to 21st century practices.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="o0065">

   <p id="p0110">Significantly expand public health infrastructure. Among such tasks must be the regular surveillance of these markets for emerging viruses of concern.</p>

   <label>•</label>
   <p id="p0115">Transparently, quickly, and in accordance with international health regulations, share information with global health authorities. The current outbreak is highly likely to have started in November or earlier, but it was not until late December that Chinese authorities reported to the WHO what was happening.</p>

   <p id="p0120">Allow, from the very beginning, health authorities from across the globe to assist in outbreak investigation and scientific investigation. It is surprising that CDC has not yet been invited to China to assist in this global issue. It is surprising to see papers from Chinese scientists that place barriers on sharing information—such as requiring “detailed study protocols and statistical and reporting plans” submitted for approval before data is shared. This is counter to the essence of professionalism and moral imperatives to openly share science for the protection of the health of the global public.</p>
