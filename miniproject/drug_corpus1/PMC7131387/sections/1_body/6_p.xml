<p id="p0035">Of particular concern, and somewhat reminiscent of the inactivated RSV vaccine story, has been the identification of Th2-type hypersensitivity lung immunopathology after receipt of several different SARS vaccine candidates in small animal models. Such vaccines provided varying levels of protection against subsequent viral challenge but at the cost of inducing other lung pathology. Much more needs to be learned about the mechanism of such reactions.</p>
