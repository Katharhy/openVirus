<p id="p0025">Since the SARS outbreak, research has slowly preceded on both antiviral and vaccine development. Broad-spectrum antivirals (for other purposes, e.g. Ebola, HIV) have been developed and are being tested 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and in animal models for efficacy against 2019-nCoV. Multiple vaccine approaches including whole inactivated virus, live attenuated virus, mRNA and DNA approaches, recombinant viral protein and nanoparticle approaches have all been devised. Notably, none of these products have progressed past phase I studies over the last 18 years. Significantly, 18 years is just past the public, public health, media and funding agency attention span such that research funding languishes. Development of critical antivirals and vaccines and the scientists who develop them is not a spicket that can be turned on and off at will. One bright spot has been the news that CEPI awarded $11 million in awards to 3 companies with vaccine candidates. Moderna, in partnership with the NIH, likely has the most advanced mRNA candidate vaccine; however, DNA vaccines producing the S protein and viral protein vaccines are also in preclinical studies. The Gates Foundation has also pledged $100 million in funding towards novel coronavirus work.
