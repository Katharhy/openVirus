<p id="p0010">The number of cases continues to exponentially increase, with an ever-increasing death toll. To date (February 12, 2020), it appears that the case-fatality rate is on the order of 2%. A significant and critical, and as yet unclear, issue is the R
 <sub>O</sub> (i.e., reproductive number) of this virus. Current estimates are that it is in the 2.5 range, but some modelling suggests it could be as high as 2.68â€“3.5. This has critical implications in terms of the likelihood of further, large-scale, global spread, and the control measures that will become necessary to decrease the health and economic toll of this virus. This is a rapidly evolving situation that requires transparent cooperation globally, and it is clear we sit on the verge of a pandemic.
