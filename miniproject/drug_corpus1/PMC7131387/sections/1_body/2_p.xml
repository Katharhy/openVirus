<p id="p0015">So is this just SARS, repeated? Several significant differences from the 2002â€“2003 SARS outbreak exist. Chief among those are the unprecedented movement of people and animals. Air traffic out of China is estimated at 6-fold higher than during the 2002 SARS outbreak. Such movement leads to millions of people, while asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, quickly moving across the globe, which increases the rapid, global spread of the virus. Also different is the speed with which the virus was sequenced, identified, and diagnostic assays developed.</p>
