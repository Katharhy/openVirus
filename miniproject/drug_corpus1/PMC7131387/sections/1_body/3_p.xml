<p id="p0020">What isn’t appreciably different is the lack of significant and sustained progress in the development of countermeasures, including antivirals and vaccines to treat and prevent coronavirus infection, respectively. Certainly, much has been learned. Since the 1960s, seven coronaviruses have been identified as causing human infections. Four of those are best adapted for upper airway infection and are responsible for an estimated 20–30% of seasonal upper respiratory infections. SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 are the remaining three coronaviruses that have infected humans. With certainty, more will emerge to cause new human infections, and in time, more lethal viruses are likely to evolve capable of efficient human infection and transmission.</p>
