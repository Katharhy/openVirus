<p id="p0030">Another bright spot is that our knowledge of coronavirus receptors, immunology, and vaccine approaches that can be useful in devising vaccines has progressed somewhat. For example, the S protein spike appears to be critical in devising vaccine approaches that lead to the development of neutralizing antibody and blocking of S1-receptor binding. For SARS and COVID-19, the human respiratory epithelial cell receptor appears to be ACE2. Coronavirus infection downregulates ACE2 expression, and this is concerning as ACE2 expression is protective for respiratory epithelial cells. Other studies have suggested that serum neutralizing antibody alone, based on early animal studies, appears to be insufficient and does not provide a mechanism for viral clearance. For this reason, vaccines that stimulate both neutralizing antibody and T cell immune responses are likely to be the most efficaciousâ€”but much remains to be learned in this regard.</p>
