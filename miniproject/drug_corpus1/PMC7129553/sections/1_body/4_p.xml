<p id="para0005">The Zika RNA flavivirus (ZIKV) is a member of the same arbovirus family as dengue (DENV), West Nile, yellow fever, and Japanese encephalitis viruses and is transmitted by the mosquito 
 <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The Zika virus story illustrates the potential for evolving risks from other viral pathogens. Initial strains of the virus affecting non-human primates were detected in Uganda in 1947 and the first human case was reported in 1962. The Zika virus then evolved by 1966 as a strain that had spread to Asia and was transmissible by human-adapted Aedes mosquitoes, with however few human cases recognized until 2007 
 <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The epidemiology of the virus then changed, with outbreaks of infection in the Pacific in 2007 and in 2013–2014, followed by epidemic spread in 2015–2016 in the Americas, the Caribbean and Africa. Clinical effects of the Zika virus can be insidious 
 <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Acute infections may have minimal symptoms however the Zika virus has been implicated in causing auto-immune disease, including the serious neurological disorder Guillain–Barré Syndrome, and in pregnancy Zika can cause the serious birth defect microcephaly 
 <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Up to January 2018, over 3700 cases of ZIKV infection-associated congenital birth defects had been reported in the Americas 
 <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The Zika epidemic shows the ability of a virus to evolve, to spread through human travel and vector mobility, and be efficiently transmitted within new regions among susceptible populations that have not been previously exposed 
 <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. No outbreaks of Zika infection are currently flagged by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
