<p id="Par37">Our results indicate that a higher percentage of transmission via GBMSM in ABSs is associated with a higher incidence of HIV. This observation is consistent with the finding that GBMSM was the most common transmission mode in Catalonia during the study period, ranging from 53.7% of the new diagnoses of HIV infection reported among GBMSM in 2012 to 57.3% in 2016 [

In Catalonia gay neighborhoods concentrate higher proportions of GBMSM than other areas of settings. Consequently, as GBMSM is the group most affected by the HIV epidemic in Catalonia, we can expect to find higher rates of new diagnoses in these neighborhoods. The probability of acquiring the infection by having HIV-positive people among oneâ€™s own sexual contacts is higher for people living in areas with a high prevalence of HIV. On the other hand, GBMSM living in gay neighborhoods often engage in the gay fast-lane subculture (defined as a way of life that is full of excitement, activity, and often risk), where drug use is frequently perceived to be normative [
