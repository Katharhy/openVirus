<p id="Par33">Mean new HIV diagnosis rates tended to increase in all cases, with the exception of the deprivation index, where the highest HIV diagnosis rate (11.6 cases per 100,000 persons) was found in the first quartile of less deprived ABS. The Pearson correlation with the diagnosis rate was positive and significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) for all the factors considered except for the deprivation index (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>a). The mean new diagnosis rate was clearly higher for the city of Barcelona than for the rest of Catalonia (21.16 cases per 100,000 population), and type of municipality was significantly associated with HIV diagnosis rate (eta-squared = 0.289, p &lt; 0.001) (Table
