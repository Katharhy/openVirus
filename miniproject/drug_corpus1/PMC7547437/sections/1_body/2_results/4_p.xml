<p id="Par32">The circles in the map of Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> show the gay locations. A zoom of Barcelona city and its metropolitan area is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Both maps reveal a spatial association between the rate of new HIV diagnoses and the number of gay locations in the ABS. Gay locations were concentrated in downtown Barcelona city and in the village of Sitges. The ABS “Universitat” (Barcelona), which presented the highest rate, with 154.23 cases per 100,000 persons, was the ABS with most gay venues (
 <italic>N</italic> = 82) in Catalonia. The second ABS in number of gay references was Sitges (
 <italic>N</italic> = 40), with a new HIV diagnosis rate of 17.18 cases per 100,000 persons.
