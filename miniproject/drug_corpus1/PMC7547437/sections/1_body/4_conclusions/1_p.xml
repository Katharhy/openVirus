<p id="Par42">Our results confirm the epidemiological pattern of the HIV epidemic observed in Catalonia. Nevertheless, the spatial analysis we performed provided us with a very accurate picture of the heterogeneous distribution of new diagnoses in Catalonia. We also determined factors related to ABS with a higher rate of new diagnoses. Our findings have important implications for the implementation of a scientific and public health response to HIV/AIDS. We showed that socioeconomic deprivation is not related to the incidence of HIV infection, thus indicating that the high rate of newly diagnosed HIV infection in certain small areas suggests that the socioeconomic level should not be the only criterion for budgetary allocation in the ABS. Furthermore, HIV prevention programs in Catalonia should continue to focus on GBMSM, mainly in urban areas. Our study identified geographical hotspots for HIV and could help guide the locations where HIV testing should be enhanced in primary care and where to implement specific HIV prevention campaigns.</p>
