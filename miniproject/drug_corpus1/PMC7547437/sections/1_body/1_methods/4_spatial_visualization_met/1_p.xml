<p id="Par24">Multivariate ring maps based on Huang et al. and López-De-Fede et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] were constructed. A ring map is a map surrounded by a set of concentric, segmented rings. Each ring displays an additional data dimension that represents an attribute of a particular location. We built maps with a base map of Catalonia in the center showing the rates of new HIV diagnoses for each ABS surrounded by a set of histograms with the distribution of the mode of transmission of HIV, sex, and country of birth for ABSs with new HIV diagnoses rates &gt; 10 per 100,000 population. The ring maps were developed using QGIS and Inkscape, both are and free open source.
