<p id="Par21">To reflect territorial differentiation in Catalonia the ABSs were classified into five categories based on the characteristics of the municipality where each ABS is located, namely, geographical location (Barcelona and its metropolitan area and rest of the territory), population (municipalities with less than 10,000 inhabitants, 10,000â€“20,000 and more than 20,000 inhabitants) and population density (inhabitants/km
 <sup>2</sup> of the municipality or municipalities where the ABS is located). When the ABS included more than one municipality and there was a discrepancy, the municipality of superior rank was prioritized. The five categories were urban Barcelona (ABS in Barcelona city), urban metropolitan (ABS in municipalities included in the metropolitan area of Barcelona), urban county (ABS in municipalities of more than 20,000 inhabitants and outside the metropolitan area of Barcelona), semi-urban (ABS in municipalities with a population of 10,000 and 20,000 inhabitants and a density of more than 150 inhabitants/km2, and, rural (ABS in municipalities with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants or a density of less than 150 inhabitants/km
