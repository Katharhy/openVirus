<p id="Par22">The percentage of men aged 15–44 years among the assigned ABS population (year 2016) and the percentage of men from Western Europe and Latin America (year 2014) at the ABS level were calculated to account for differences in the proportion of men in the most common age range of new HIV diagnoses and the influence of the migrant population, respectively. The percentage for GBMSM as the transmission mode among new HIV diagnoses was calculated by ABS. Given the very small counts in many ABSs, the Agresti-Coull binomial proportion estimation was used to obtain less extreme values; this approach also has the advantage of imputing a value for ABS with zero incidence counts [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This index is a composite measure based on five indicators extracted from the national health registry of 2015, as follows: percentage of manual workers, percentage of people with a low educational level, rate of premature mortality, rate of avoidable hospitalization, percentage of population exempt from pharmaceutical copayment, and percentage of population with an annual income lower than €18,000. All these predictor variables were acquired from the set of basic health and health care indicators at the ABS level provided by the Agency of Health Quality and Evaluation of Catalonia (AQuAS) and the Information System for the Development of Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP).
