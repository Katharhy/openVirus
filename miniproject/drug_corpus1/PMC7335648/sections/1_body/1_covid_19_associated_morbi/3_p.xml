<p>The dynamics of age-specific mortality for COVID-19 is relatively familiar because they mirror other major causes of mortality, especially chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease (

However, many scientists and media have paid considerable attention to age as a risk factor for mortality in COVID-19. This might be due to the surge of infected patients within a short period; hence, the death pattern — high mortality in older people — became more apparent.
