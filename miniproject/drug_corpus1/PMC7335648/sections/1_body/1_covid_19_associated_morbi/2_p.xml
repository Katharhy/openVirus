<p>Influenza, the most commonly reported pandemic disease in human history, had a W-shaped mortality distribution during the pandemic (

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This atypical pattern of mortality with an elevated relative or absolute risk of death in middle-age groups is usually explained by differences in age-related susceptibility to infection, affected by pre-existing age-related immunity [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. As SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus introduced to human, this type of mortality distribution is unlikely to be expected. However, the age-related pattern of COVID-19 fatality differs from that of other respiratory viral infections, wherein the severity pattern is often described as a U-shaped curve, with morbidity and mortality concentrated at extreme age groups (younger children and the elderly). Population-based studies of seasonal influenza have typically shown this type of mortality distribution according to age (

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Several cohort studies have shown that the hospitalization rate of influenza was highest for the age group of 0 – 4 years compared to that in other age groups, which indicates that children under the age of 5 years could be more vulnerable to influenza and/or more severely affected [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. As the hospitalization fatality rate was relatively low for the age group of 0 – 4 years [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the mortality curve based on 100,000 individuals showed a much smaller peak in this age group than in the elderly age group. However, this type of mortality peak has not been observed thus far in children affected with COVID-19, which suggests that children could be less susceptible to the infection or experience less severe symptoms and have a low CFR.
