<p>One of the most critical issues dealt by clinical and public health professionals during the pandemic is the spectrum of illness severity. This affects the triage, diagnostic and therapeutic decision making, and prognostic expectations; therefore, understanding COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality according to age is important. However, the data published in each country are inconsistent because of multiple reasons such as different populations, extent of available laboratory tests, and medical systems. Hence, we reviewed COVID-19 epidemiology data published from several countries to identify any consistent trends in the relationship between age and COVID-19-associated morbidity or mortality. We also reviewed the literature for studies explaining the difference in the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection according to age.</p>
