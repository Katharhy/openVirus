<p>Some scientists have claimed that the biologically plausible pathomechanism explaining the difference in vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 infection involves the so-called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) [

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. ADE is a well-known cascade of events by which viruses may infect susceptible cells through interactions between virions complexed with antibodies and Fc receptors, where they are more extensively endocytosed and eventually replicated more efficiently [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The antibodies that bind to virions could be neutralizing or non-neutralizing antibodies, which were previously formed in response to SARS-CoV-2 or other coronaviruses with similar antigenicity to that of SARS-CoV-2. The fact that the seroprevalence of community-acquired coronaviruses among adults was very high (90 â€“ 100%) [
