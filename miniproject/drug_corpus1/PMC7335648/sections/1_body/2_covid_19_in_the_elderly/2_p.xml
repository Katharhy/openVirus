<p>In immunopathology, vulnerability to an infection in the elderly is usually explained by immunosenescence [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Immunosenescence is quite complicated. Briefly, in old age, the production of na√Øve T and B cells decreases, and the function of innate immune cells is impaired; hence, cells involved in the innate immunity do not get activated efficiently during an infection, and progression to an adaptive immune response does not occur in a coordinated manner [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These changes reduce the effectiveness of viral clearance and increase the likelihood of triggering a dysregulated immune response in which cytokines are released extensively by activated immune cells, resulting in a cytokine storm [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Another well-recognized feature of aging immunity is chronic subclinical systemic inflammation, also known as inflammaging. Inflammation is a key pathogenic mechanism in COVID-19; hence, inflammaging has been estimated to contribute to the poorer outcome in elderly patients with COVID-19 [
