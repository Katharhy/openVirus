<p>Thus far, there is no clear explanation for the children-sparing pattern of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The following hypotheses have been reported in the literature: 1) the possibility that children are less frequently exposed to infection sources due to closure of child care facilities, preschools, and schools, 2) children are less susceptible to the infection itself, and 3) children are less likely to be symptomatic or develop severe symptoms; hence, the number of cases is underestimated [

 <italic>et al</italic> reported the result of tracing 1,286 close contacts in China; children were as likely to be infected as adults (infection rate in children aged &lt;10 years: 7.4% 
 <italic>vs.</italic> population average: 6.6%) but less likely to be symptomatic or develop severe symptoms [
