<p>A milder symptom or low CFR in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection could be explained by the interaction between host immunological response and viral pathogen mechanism [

 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. As the differences in the distribution, maturation, and function of viral receptors in the host are frequently reported as a possible reason for the age-related difference in infection, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor for SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, and SARS-CoV-2, has attracted increasing attention. ACE2 plays a key role is in catalyzing the hydrolysis of angiotensin II into angiotensin (1â€“7), which has an antihypertensive and profibrotic effect [

 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Following viral entry, ACE2 expression is downregulated [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Downregulation of ACE2 expression leads to compensatory overproduction of angiotensin II by ACE. Angiotensin II, in turn, stimulates its type 1a receptor, which increases the lung vascular permeability and potentiates lung pathology [
