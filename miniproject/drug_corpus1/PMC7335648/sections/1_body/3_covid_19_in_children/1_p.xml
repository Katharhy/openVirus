<p>Based on published data, SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to affect children less frequently and less severely than adults. According to the data published from different regions, the proportion of children among COVID-19 patients was quite low (2.1 â€“ 2.4% in China, 1.3% in Italy, 2.8% in Australia, and 7.0% in Korea) [

 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In the largest pediatric study to date that analyzed 2,143 children infected with SARS-CoV-2, 5.8% children showed severe and critical illness [

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Among children, Dong 
 <italic>et al</italic>. found that infants were relatively more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the proportion of severe and critical cases was 10.7% [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, because the study also included suspected cases (not laboratory confirmed cases, 65.9% of study population), the possibility of pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2 responsible for such clinical observations remains controversial. In other studies, even though very small number of cases was reported, a severe outcome in infants was not observed [

Although these findings were not similar to the generally accepted fact that children aged &lt;5 years were more vulnerable to respiratory viral infections, there was a common aspect with the previous finding observed in SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemics, which also had a children-sparing pattern [

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Stockman 
 <italic>et al</italic>. reported that the clinical outcome of SARS was more favorable in children aged &lt;12 years of age than in other age groups [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. No deaths were reported in children with SARS-CoV infection [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In the MERS-CoV epidemic, only two pediatric deaths were reported, both of which had serious comorbidities: infantile nephrotic syndrome and cystic fibrosis [
