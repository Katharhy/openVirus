<p>Alphaviruses have a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome approximately 12 kilobases long. The genome possesses a 5′ cap structure and a poly(A) tail. The genome has two major regions: a non-structural domain encoding the non-structural proteins (nsP) on the 5′ terminal portion and a structural domain encoding structural proteins on the 3′ terminal region [

The junction between non-structural and structural domains contain a 26S subgenomic promoter for transcription of the subgenomic RNA and the start site for its translation. The non-structural portion is translated as a polyprotein, which is cleaved to produce nsP1, nsP2, nsP3, nsP4 and their other cleavage intermediates. Most alphaviruses have a ‘leaky′ stop codon after nsP3, whereas no stop codon is present in others. The structural domain is translated as a polyprotein from a subgenomic RNA and cleaves into the individual capsid, envelope 3 (E3), envelope 2 (E2), 6K peptide, and envelope 1 (E1) proteins [
