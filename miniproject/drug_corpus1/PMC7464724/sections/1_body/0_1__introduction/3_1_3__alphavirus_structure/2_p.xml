<p>The non-structural proteins, unlike the viral genome and the structural components of the virion, are not incorporated into progeny virions [
 <xref rid="B2-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These proteins are involved in the replication of the viral genome and assembly of progeny virions. Of these, nsP1 has both methyltransferase and guanylyltransferase activities, which are required for the capping of genomic and subgenomic RNA transcripts [

 <xref rid="B3-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. nsP2 is the largest of the alphaviruses nsPs and has among the most functions; the N-terminal end has nucleoside triphosphatase activity and also serves as the viral helicase, while the C-terminal end serves as the viral protease responsible for processing the nsP polyprotein [

 <xref rid="B3-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The exact functions of nsP3 are presently unclear, although it is known that it is a phosphoprotein and contains Src homology 3 (SH3) binding domains in the C-terminal region [
 <xref rid="B1-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Finally, the nsP4 protein is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase responsible for the replication of the viral genome [
