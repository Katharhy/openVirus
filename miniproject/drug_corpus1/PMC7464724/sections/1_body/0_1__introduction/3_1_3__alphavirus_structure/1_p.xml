 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> virions are enveloped spherical particles with a diameter of approximately 70 nm/700 Ã…. The particle is comprised of a nucleocapsid core surrounding RNA genome, which encompassed by a host-cell derived lipid bilayer from which envelope glycoprotein spikes are embedded [

 <xref rid="B2-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The nucleocapsid is comprised of 240 copies of the capsid protein, while the viral envelope proper is comprised of 80 trimeric glycoprotein spikes, with each spike consisting of three E1-E2 heterodimers [

 <xref rid="B3-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Both E1 and E2 have discrete functions in the virus life cycle, with E2 serving as the receptor binding domain, while E1 is associated with host membrane fusion. The E3 protein is a cleavage product from the proteolytic processing of the pre-E2 (pE2) after pE2 association with E1 to form glycoprotein spikes, allowing for spike maturation [

 <xref rid="B3-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The 6K protein similarly acts as a leader peptide for E1, and is reported to enhance viral egress from infected cells via the formation of membrane pores or channels [
