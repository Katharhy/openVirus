<p>VEEV was first isolated from the brain of an infected equine from Venezuela in 1938 [

 <xref rid="B48-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The 1943 outbreak in Trinidad resulted in recognizing VEEV as a human pathogen [

 <xref rid="B6-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. VEEV outbreaks then occurred episodically, with periods of approximately 10 years in between major outbreaks [

A large outbreak occurred in 1962 that started in Columbia and spread to Venezuela, in which there were over 25,000 cases of human infection with 176 fatalities [
 <xref rid="B16-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Cases continued in Colombia between 1967 and 1968. Closely thereafter in 1969, Ecuador would report approximately 20,000 equine deaths and 31,000 human cases of disease resulting in 310 deaths [
 <xref rid="B16-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The virus spread northward during that year to El Salvador, Guatemala and Mexico [
 <xref rid="B57-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The disease burden in these countries exceeded 50,000 human cases and 50,000 fatal equine infections [
 <xref rid="B57-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. VEEV infections continued to spread northward and by 1970â€“1971, the outbreak crossed into the United States. Texas would report more than 1500 horse deaths, 110 human cases and hundreds of VEEV isolations from field-caught mosquitoes [

 <xref rid="B58-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. A massive vaccination campaign to halt further spread and devastation was employed using TC-83 to great effect [

 <xref rid="B60-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. By 1972, the outbreak had subsided.
