<p>VEEV outbreaks have occurred episodically from enzootic progenitors over the last century. As a result, VEEV strains of the IAB and IC disappear from the human and equid populations after the epidemic subsides. Epizootics are initiated when IAB or IC VEEV infect horses, producing high titer viremia that efficiently infect feeding mosquitoes [
