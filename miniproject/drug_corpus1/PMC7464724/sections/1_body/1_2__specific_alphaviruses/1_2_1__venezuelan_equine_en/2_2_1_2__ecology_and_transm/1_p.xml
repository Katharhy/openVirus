<p>The VEE antigenic complex of viruses includes six antigenic subtypes (I to VI) each including one or more species (I. Mosso das Pedras virus and VEEV; II. Everglades virus; III. Mucambo and Tonates viruses; IV. Pixuna virus; V. Cabassou virus; VI. Rio Negro virus). Little is known about the ecology and cycle of most species in the VEE complex, with the exception of VEEV, for which there is more information available. Most species are present in South America, with the exception of Everglades virus, which is only found in Florida in the United States [

 <xref rid="B22-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Everglades virus is known to infect and circulate in rodents and mosquitoes, and serological evidence suggests it can also infect dogs and humans [
 <xref rid="B25-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Mucambo virus is also known to cause disease in humans, but to date has not been reported to cause large outbreaks.
