<p>VEEV is transmitted in enzootic and epizootic cycles. Large human outbreaks are usually associated with an extensive number of equine infected by an epizootic strain of VEEV [
 <xref rid="B22-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], which become viremic allowing 
 <italic>Ae. Ochlerotatus taeniorhynchus</italic> mosquitoes to become infected and act as vectors from horses to humans. The VEEV enzootic subtypes are ID and IE, whereas IAB and IC are epizootic [
 <xref rid="B22-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This appears to be largely determined by the equine virulence of the virus, which influences their ability to cause high level viremia, as epizootic strains are more virulent and able to cause higher levels of viremia than enzootic strains [
 <xref rid="B22-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The VEEV cycle in nature is maintained by enzootic cycles in rodents [

 <xref rid="B36-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], mosquitoes, and possibly other wild animals such as bats [
 <xref rid="B38-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Forest-dwelling mosquitoes, mainly of the 
 <italic>Culex</italic> genus [
 <xref rid="B30-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], are vectors and infect wild animals to maintain the enzootic cycle. Natural reservoirs for VEEV are proposed to be rodents of the subfamily 
 <italic>Sigmodontinae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B35-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Several other potential hosts have also been described by experimental infection in a lab, report of natural infection or serology of wild animals, including other rodents [

 <xref rid="B38-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], bats [
 <xref rid="B38-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,

 <xref rid="B41-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], wild swine [
 <xref rid="B43-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], deer [
 <xref rid="B43-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], rabbits [
 <xref rid="B44-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and opossums [
 <xref rid="B42-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. These hosts also have potential to act as reservoirs and more field studies in areas with VEEV are necessary to establish the contribution of each host to its enzootic cycle.
