<p>CHIKV originated in sub-Saharan Africa where it is maintained in two distinct enzootic transmission cycles between nonhuman primates and forest-dwelling 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes. Here, the WAf and ESCA lineages of CHIKV are vectored by 
 <italic>Ae. furcifer</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. taylori</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. luteocephalus</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. dalzeili</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. africanus</italic>, Ae. 
 <italic>neoafricanus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. cordellieri</italic> in Senegal, Ivory Coast, Uganda, Central African Republic and South Africa [

 <xref rid="B208-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">208</xref>]. Nonhuman primates have been implicated as the principal reservoir for CHIKV based upon both serology and viral isolations from several species. In Senegal, 
 <italic>Chlorocebus sabaeus</italic> (African green monkeys), 
 <italic>Galago senegalensis</italic> (bushbabys), 
 <italic>Cercopithecus aethiops</italic> (guenons), 
 <italic>Papio papio</italic> (Guinea baboons) and 
 <italic>Erythrocebus patas</italic> (patas monkeys) were CHIKV positive confirmed by viral isolation [
 <xref rid="B204-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">204</xref>]. The transmission cycle appears to peak every 3–4 years, likely coinciding with the birth of new naïve primates [
 <xref rid="B206-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>]. Humans become infected from spillover events from this sylvatic cycle. Urban transmission has not been a characteristic of CHIKV infections in Africa.
