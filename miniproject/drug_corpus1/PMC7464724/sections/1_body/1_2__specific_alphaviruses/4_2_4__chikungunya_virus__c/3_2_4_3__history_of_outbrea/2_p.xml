<p>In 2004, CHIKV spread from Kenya to Comoros and ultimately to the island of La Réunion off the coast of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean in 2015. Here, a unique mutation within the E1 protein would significantly alter urban transmission cycles. This E1 A226V mutation allows for mosquito midgut epithelial cells to be more efficiently infected, thereby increasing

 <xref rid="B214-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">214</xref>]. The result was increased vectorial capacity leading to enhanced CHIKV spread. Between 2005 and 2006, more than 244,000 cases and 203 deaths would be counted [

The La Réunion (LR) isolate, a commonly used strain for experimental infections and vaccine efficacy testing, was isolated during this epidemic. Phylogenetic analyses would place this LR strain in the IOL lineage, a subgroup of the ECSA lineage. This strain would subsequently spread to other islands in the Indian Ocean including Madagascar, India, Sri Lanka, Cameroon, Gabon and Congo. Travel-associated infections were identified in multiple European countries [
