<p>The first cases of CHIKV infection were identified in Africa and spread to Asia shortly thereafter. Between 1952â€“1953, a febrile illness with sudden onset and sharp crippling pain was described in present day Tanzania. During this time, an isolate was made from both patients and mosquito species thereby confirming CHIKV infection [

 <xref rid="B212-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">212</xref>]. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that viruses isolated during this epidemic clustered within the Asian lineage, marking the spread of a new virulent epidemic strain of CHIKV [
