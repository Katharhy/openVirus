<p>There are many documented human cases of MAYV infection, however, few large scale outbreaks in the past 66 years [
 <xref rid="B241-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">241</xref>]. MAYV circulation has been reported only in the Americas, mainly in Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia [
 <xref rid="B241-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">241</xref>]. Additionally, reports of infections are based on serological tests, which may display a high level of cross-reactivity with antibodies against other endemic alphaviruses [
 <xref rid="B229-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">229</xref>]. Although the first human case of MAYV was first isolated in the Mayaro county, southwest of Trinidad and Tobago, in 1954 [
 <xref rid="B242-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">242</xref>], the first registered outbreak occurred in Pará state, Brazil, in 1955. Six strains of MAYV were isolated from blood samples collected from febrile patients [
 <xref rid="B243-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">243</xref>]. In the same year, an outbreak of “jungle fever” occurred in Bolivia, and MAYV was identified as probable causative agent of 10–15% of 192 cases [
 <xref rid="B244-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">244</xref>]. Later, nearly 20% of the population (more than 4000 inhabitants) of a rural village in Pará state, Brazil, were infected with MAYV during an outbreak between December 1977 and June 1978 [
 <xref rid="B245-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">245</xref>]. In another rural community in Pará state, an outbreak of a dengue-like illness was reported in early 2008. One hundred and five patients were examined and 36 (34%) of them had a positive anti-MAYV IgM titer and three MAYV isolations were made [
 <xref rid="B246-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">246</xref>]. A MAYV outbreak was also registered in the Portuguesa state, west of Venezuela in 2010. Nineteen of 77 cases reported were confirmed as seropositive and six MAYV strains were isolated [
 <xref rid="B247-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">247</xref>]. Other outbreaks occurred in Brazil in 1981, 1991 and 2015 with no detailed information [
 <xref rid="B241-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">241</xref>,
 <xref rid="B248-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">248</xref>]. Finally, there are individual case reports of human infections, virus isolation from mosquitoes, and seroprevalence studies conducted in countries of the Americas that indicate MAYV is probably circulating in several regions of the continent and, therefore, cases of infection may be long underreported [
 <xref rid="B229-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">229</xref>,
 <xref rid="B241-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">241</xref>,
 <xref rid="B248-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">248</xref>].
