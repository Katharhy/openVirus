<p>Mayaro virus is the etiologic agent Mayaro fever (MAYF). After infection, MAYV causes a transient viremia which lasts 3â€“4 days and has an incubation period between 7 and 12 days until signs and symptoms become apparent [
 <xref rid="B229-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">229</xref>]. MAYF is a disease characterized by nonspecific and self-limited sign and symptoms including fever, myalgia, arthralgia and skin rash [
 <xref rid="B230-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">230</xref>] Arthralgia, headache and fever are the most common clinical manifestations and are present in the majority of symptomatic patients [
 <xref rid="B231-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">231</xref>]. Rash is observed in about two thirds of the symptomatic patients and only lasts for a few days. Other signs and symptoms include chills, headache, myalgia, eye pain, diarrhea, vomiting and lymphadenopathy. Leukopenia is also commonly observed in patients. Similar to other arthralgic alphaviral diseases, MAYF is currently believed to be a self-limiting disease lasting approximately a week. However, arthralgia can persist for several weeks to months after primary infection [

 <xref rid="B229-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">229</xref>]. The case-fatality in humans is not well-known as the small outbreaks do not allow for an accurate estimate [
 <xref rid="B230-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">230</xref>]. There are no approved vaccines to prevent MAYF, although several experimental vaccines have been tested in animal models [
 <xref rid="B233-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">233</xref>,
 <xref rid="B234-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">234</xref>,
 <xref rid="B235-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">235</xref>]. There are also no treatments for this disease. Furthermore, MAYF occurs in areas hyperendemic for other arboviral diseases with similar clinical presentations and a confirmation for MAYV infection is not always achieved, leading to possible underreporting of the disease [
