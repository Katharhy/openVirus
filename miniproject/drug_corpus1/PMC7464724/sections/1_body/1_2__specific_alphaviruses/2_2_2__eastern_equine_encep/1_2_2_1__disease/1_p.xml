<p>Eastern equine encephalitis virus is the causative agent of Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE). The EEEV antigenic complex is comprised of four phylogenetically distinct lineages, one of which is found circulating in North America and the Caribbean, with the remaining three circulating in South and Central America [

 <xref rid="B65-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Until 2013, the entire EEEV antigenic complex was referred to as EEEV, with North American lineage strains referred to as NA EEEV (Lineage I) and strains from any of the three South American lineages referred to SA EEEV. In 2013, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) approved a proposal to reassign the three South American lineages (Lineages II, III, and IV) of EEEV to the newly created
