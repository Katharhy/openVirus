<p>In contrast, the MADV enzootic transmission cycle remains less clear. This is at least in part due to difficult to reach foci deep within tropical rainforests [
 <xref rid="B64-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,
 <xref rid="B91-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. What is known is that enzootic transmission, like EEEV in southern foci in North America, is maintained near continuously year-round [
 <xref rid="B64-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,
 <xref rid="B91-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. The vast proportion of MADV isolations have been from 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. (
 <italic>Melanoconion</italic>) mosquitoes, leading to regional representatives of this subgenus being incriminated as the primary enzootic vectors of MADV [
 <xref rid="B64-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,
 <xref rid="B91-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Specific representative examples of enzootic 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. (
 <italic>Melanoconion</italic>) vectors include 
 <italic>Cx. taeniopus</italic> (Panama and Brazil), 
 <italic>Cx. dunni</italic>, and 
 <italic>Cx. panocossa</italic> (Venezuela), and

 <xref rid="B91-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Experimentally, a field population of

 <xref rid="B114-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. In addition to their roles in the enzootic transmission of MADV, these 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. (

 <xref rid="B117-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. However, it is worth noting that field evidence does indicate that 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. (
 <italic>Melanoconian</italic>) do not tend to move outside their rainforest niche [
 <xref rid="B118-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>], indicating at least some role for potential bridge vectors. Furthermore, the vertebrate reservoir is unknown. Potential sources include birds, rodents, marsupials and reptiles [

 <xref rid="B65-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,
 <xref rid="B91-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], all of which are hosts that are fed on by various species of 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. (
 <italic>Melanoconian</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B119-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. Experimental studies have demonstrated that both birds and rodents become viremic and could potentially serve as reservoirs for MADV [
 <xref rid="B120-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Strikingly, during a MADV epizootic in Panama in 2010, a small subset of both human and equine subjects were found to be co-infected with both VEEV and MADV, in part providing some support rodents serving as potential reservoirs for MADV [
