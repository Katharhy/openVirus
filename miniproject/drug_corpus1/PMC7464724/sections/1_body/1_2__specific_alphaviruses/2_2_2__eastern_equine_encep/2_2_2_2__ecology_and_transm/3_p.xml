<p>Enzootic transmission of EEEV is sustained by infection of passerine birds, specifically, by infection of hatching year chicks, likely due to both a lack of pre-existing immunity and decreased propensity to utilize anti-mosquito behaviors to avoid bites [

 <xref rid="B106-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Viremia in hatching year chicks is also of greater magnitude and duration allowing for efficient infection of

 <xref rid="B64-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. It is worth noting that anecdotal evidence indicates the virus can be transmitted from infected to uninfected gamebirds through behaviors such as pecking, preening and cannibalism, although the role this plays in EEEV ecology, if any, is unclear [

 <xref rid="B67-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The transition from enzootic circulation to an epizootic outbreak is generally thought to require the involvement of mosquitoes that are more promiscuous is their host choice, exhibiting both mammophilic and ornithophilic tendencies; these mosquitoes are commonly referred as “bridge vectors”. For EEEV transmission cycles, the types of mosquitoes that serve as bridge vectors can differ on regional species abundance and host availability although 
 <italic>Ae. vexans</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. solicitans</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. canadensis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Coquillettidia perturbans</italic> have been incriminated in this role [

 <xref rid="B78-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Bridge vectors will become infected by feeding on viremic birds, and subsequently can infect both avian hosts and mammalian dead ends. It is largely through these bridge vectors that humans and equids (which are both dead end hosts for EEEV) are infected [

 <italic>Cs. melanura</italic> also acts as the epizootic vector [
