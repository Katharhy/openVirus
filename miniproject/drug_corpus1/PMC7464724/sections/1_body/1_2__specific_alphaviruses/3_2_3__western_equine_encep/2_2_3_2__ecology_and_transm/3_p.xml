<p>There is some evidence that ponies and burrows develop sufficiently high viremias to infect mosquitoes [

 <xref rid="B169-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>], though the extent to which equids participate in the transmission of WEEV, if at all, remains unknown. Even though low proportions of mosquitoes would become infected from viremic horses, the large number of horses in North America in the early 20th century, for agricultural use, could potentially compensate for the low proportions.
