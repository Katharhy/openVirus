<p>Given the reduction in WEE disease and WEEV enzootic circulation, understanding whether it is able to emerge is inexorably linked to a proper understanding of its “submergence”. A particularly useful means of understanding the submergence of WEEV is to observe the evolution of the virus over time. [

However, studies where reductions in virulence or enzootic fitness are explained temporally by choosing representative isolates from each decade within the 20th century does not factor in the evolutionary pattern of WEEV over the 20th century [
