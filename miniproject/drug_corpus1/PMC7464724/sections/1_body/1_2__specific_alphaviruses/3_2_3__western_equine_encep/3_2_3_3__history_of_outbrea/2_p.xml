<p>After the 1930s and 1940s, the number of human and equine cases began to decline. One well-studied epidemic that occurred in 1952 in the Central Valley of California resulted in 375 cases of WEEV-induced human encephalitis, nine of which resulted in death. Other epidemics occurred in 1958, 1965, and 1975 [

 <xref rid="B178-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>]. Some of the most severe epizootic events occurred in Midwestern North America and southern Manitoba, for example, in 1941. Additionally, several epidemics occurred in Midwestern North American and southern Manitoba during the late 20th century with the 1975 epidemic causing 53 human and 420 equine cases [

WEE continued to occur sporadically throughout the 1980s and 1990s with the last reported human case in North America occurring in 1998. One fatal case of WEE arose in Uruguay during April of 2009 in an otherwise healthy 14-year-old boy [
