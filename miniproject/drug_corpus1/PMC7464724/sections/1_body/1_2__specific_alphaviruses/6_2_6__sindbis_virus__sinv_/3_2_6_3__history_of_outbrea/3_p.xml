<p>Since 1974, outbreaks in Finland occur in approximate seven-year cycles without a directly implicated cause [

 <xref rid="B294-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">294</xref>]. In 1989, a serological survey of the affected regions revealed a prevalence of 2.7−5.7% of anti-SINV antibodies, depending on the analyzed location [
 <xref rid="B295-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">295</xref>]. A more recent and larger study revealed a seroprevalence of 9−17% in regions of Finland in the early 2000s [

 <xref rid="B297-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">297</xref>] were able to isolate the causative agent of the SINV outbreak in 2002 for the first time in Finland. In addition to the major epidemics in 1995 and 2002, when 1310 and 597 laboratory-confirmed SINV cases were identified, respectively, the predicted outbreak of 2009 only manifested in 105 cases that were diagnosed that year [
 <xref rid="B298-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">298</xref>]. However, there was a peak in diagnosed cases in 2012, when almost twice the number of cases were reported than occurred in 2009 [
