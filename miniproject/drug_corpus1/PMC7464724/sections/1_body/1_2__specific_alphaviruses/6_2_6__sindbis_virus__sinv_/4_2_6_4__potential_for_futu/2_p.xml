<p>Virus circulation outside of Europe has been detected primarily based upon virus isolation and serology in native populations rather than outbreaks of Sindbis disease. SINV has been isolated from mosquitoes in Kenya [
 <xref rid="B302-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">302</xref>]. South Africa has reported infections but underreporting is highly likely as Sindbis disease may be attributed to other illnesses with similar symptoms [
 <xref rid="B259-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">259</xref>]. SINV has been circulating within Australia for at least 33 years in different locations of the country based upon phylogenetic analysis [
 <xref rid="B280-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">280</xref>]. However, there are only two reports of human cases in Australia, a child in 1969 [
 <xref rid="B290-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">290</xref>] and a man in 1980 [
 <xref rid="B303-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">303</xref>]. In Israel, the virus seems to be constantly circulating in the country recently, as SINV-I was detected in mosquito pools collected during the period of 2004–2006 and 2013–2015 [
 <xref rid="B304-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">304</xref>]. Also, a serological survey conducted from 2011 to 2014 demonstrated a prevalence of IgG anti-SINV of 1.9−3.6% [
 <xref rid="B305-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">305</xref>]. In Germany, Jöst et al. showed [
 <xref rid="B306-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">306</xref>] the presence of SINV in mosquitoes collected in the southwest region of the country in 2009. The virus was isolated from 
 <italic>Anopheles maculipennis</italic> and the enzootic vectors 
 <italic>Cx. torrentium</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic>. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the strains isolated were linked to Swedish strains and related to human cases in Sweden [
 <xref rid="B306-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">306</xref>]. In addition, IgG anti-SINV was detected in four healthy blood donors (from 3389 samples), though no specific IgG, IgM or SINV RNA was detected in patients with suspected infection from an area with high SINV infection in mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="B307-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">307</xref>]. It seems improbable that SINV outbreaks may occur in the analyzed area in Germany when these findings are considered along with the lack of evidence of the presence of the SINV bridge vectors. Still, future studies are necessary to provide information about the risk of human SINV infection, not only in Germany but also in other regions where mosquitoes infected with this virus can be found [
