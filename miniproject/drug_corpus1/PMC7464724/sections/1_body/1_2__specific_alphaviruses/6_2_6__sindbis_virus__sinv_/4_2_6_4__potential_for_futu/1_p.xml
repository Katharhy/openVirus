<p>Finland has reported more SINV cases than other areas but this may be due more to reporting than actual prevalence as required reporting was instituted in 1995 [
 <xref rid="B298-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">298</xref>]. Since this year, the number of cases in Finland increased dramatically in comparison to Sweden, for example, which did not adopt this measure. Notably, the number of cases in Finland was 33 times higher than Sweden′s from 1995 to 2012 [
 <xref rid="B260-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">260</xref>]. Since 1974, SINV outbreaks have occurred every seven years in Finland without a firm underlying reason [
 <xref rid="B264-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">264</xref>]. One hypothesis is the susceptibility of immunologically naïve amplifying hosts; the population cycles of grouse overlap with SINV outbreaks years [
 <xref rid="B264-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">264</xref>]. Therefore, these observations suggest that forecasting future outbreaks based on this seven-year cycle may not be accurate and objective markers of SINV activity. Interestingly, Lundström et al. [
 <xref rid="B260-microorganisms-08-01167" ref-type="bibr">260</xref>] showed increased detection of SINV-I in 
 <italic>Ae. cinereus</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. torrentium/pipiens</italic> mosquitoes collected during the late mosquito season of an outbreak year in comparison to pre- and post-outbreak years. These findings suggest, at least for Northern European countries, that the surveillance of SINV prevalence in bridge and enzootic vectors during late mosquito season may constitute a good marker to predict outbreaks caused by this virus [
