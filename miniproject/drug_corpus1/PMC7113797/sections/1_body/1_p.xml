<p>In Italy, and in particular in Lombardy, the number of COVID-19 cases rose to 17713 on Tuesday 18th March from 984 announced on 1st March, forcing health authorities to putting in place “draconian” measures to contain the spread of infection. It is unclear if these measures will be enforced and will succeed, but for the time being the priority is to stop virus transmission and avoid the collapse of National Health System, that is currently overwhelmed to face the urgent demand. This year all TB day events scheduled in Italy will be canceled due to the spread of COVID-19. Nevertheless, it is necessary to keep raising awareness of the global TB problem. The COVID-19 epidemic offers the opportunity to make some assessments on the sharing aspects between COVID-19 and TB as well as the challenges and lessons learned from the control efforts of each of them that could be of mutual benefit.</p>
