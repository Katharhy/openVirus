<p>A fourth similarity is the limited knowledge of individual's susceptibility to infection. Clearly, to improve prevention and control of infectious diseases, it is critical to understand why some individuals are susceptible to infectious diseases while others, acquiring the same pathogen, remain asymptomatic. In TB, genetic and non-genetic factors of both host and pathogens play an important role in the development of the disease [

Yet, little is known about these factors that, ultimately, may provide some clues for the future development of vaccines, therapies and novel drug targets. In the case of COVID-19, despite the recent found of virus entry route, it is not clear whether the differences in viral receptor-binding domain structure contribute to differences in infectivity, transmissibility and disease severity [
