<p>The dose, route of administration and duration of treatment remain to be determined, and studies in this direction are ongoing [

In animal models of acute lung injury, intratracheal and intravenous administration of fibrinolytic agents was more effective than administration by aerosol. Based on extensive experience in the use of tPA in acute conditions such as stroke or heart attack, intravenous administration may be the easiest to implement [

In the initial state of ARDS, the authors of one publication suggest administration of 25 mg tPA within 2 h, followed by an infusion of 25 mg tPA another 22 h, at a dose not exceeding 0.9 mg/kg. The same exclusion criteria currently used to treat stroke and myocardial infarction can be used, and responders receive heparin infusion for some time after stopping treatment with tPA [

 <sub>2</sub> ratio &lt;50 and pCO2 &gt;60 mmHg, despite prone positioning and optimal mechanical ventilation support, appear to be candidates for tPA treatment, especially in environments where ECMO is not widely available. In addition, in scenarios where no further mechanical ventilation is possible, this may be appropriate as rescue therapy for people with progressive deterioration of lung function [
