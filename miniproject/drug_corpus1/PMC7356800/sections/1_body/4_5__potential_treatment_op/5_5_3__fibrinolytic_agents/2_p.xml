<p>The inclusion of therapies that are widely available but not included as indications in the summary of product characteristics and traditionally considered “high-risk therapies” such as fibrinolytic agents is justified in this unprecedented public health threat associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. A more modern approach to thrombolytic therapy involves the use of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) due to the higher efficiency of clot lysis with a comparable risk of bleeding with other fibrinolytic factors. In addition, tPA treatment was found to have lower mortality, a greater increase in arterial pO2, and a greater decrease in arterial pCO2 compared to untreated controls than urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) or plasmin in a comprehensive meta-analysis of animal studies. These studies concerned acute lung injury, but none of these studies included virus-induced ARDS [
