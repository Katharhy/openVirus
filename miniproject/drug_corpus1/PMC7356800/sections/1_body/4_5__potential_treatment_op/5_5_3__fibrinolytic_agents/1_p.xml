<p>ARDS is the most common pulmonary complication of the COVID-19. There is no effective treatment other than supportive therapy [

A new discovery in the pathophysiology of ARDS is the fibrin deposition in the air spaces and lung parenchyma, together with platelet thrombotic microclots in the pulmonary vessels, which contribute to the development of progressive respiratory failure and right heart failure [
 <xref rid="B82-jcm-09-01917" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Similar pathological results were currently observed in lung samples from patients infected with COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="B83-jcm-09-01917" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. This destructive activation of the coagulation system in ARDS results from increased activation and mobilization of clot formation together with inhibition of fibrinolysis processes and is thought to mediate pulmonary endothelial dysfunction in the case of influenza A [

In the year 2001, Hardaway and colleagues showed that urokinase or streptokinase administration in patients with terminal ARDS reduced the expected mortality from 100% to 70% without any undesirable bleeding. Importantly, the majority of patients who eventually died, secondary to multiorgan failure, including renal or hepatic insufficiency rather than pulmonary insufficiency [
