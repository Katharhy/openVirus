<p>The rationale for the use of corticosteroids in viral pneumonia is to decrease the host inflammatory response in the lungs, as this may lead to the development of acute lung injury and ARDS. Direct evidence for the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19 is very limited, however previous reviews regarding outcomes in other viral pneumonia provide important clinical information [

The authors reported two important clinical observationsâ€”no influence of corticosteroids on survival improvement with concomitant steroid-related adverse events, such as avascular necrosis causing femoral head necrosis, hyperglycemia typically occurring during steroid treatment and psychosis [
