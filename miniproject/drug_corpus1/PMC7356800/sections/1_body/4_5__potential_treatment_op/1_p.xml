<p>While ARDS seems to be the main cause of pulmonary fibrosis in COVID-19, several reported have mentioned that ARDS caused by SARS-CoV-2 is different from the typical ARDS [

It seems that COVID-19 induced ARDS differs substantially from that caused by other factors as high compliance is often observed, which is inconsistent with the severity of hypoxia. Several reports suggest that the onset of COVID-19 ARDS was between 8 and 12 days, rendering the one-week onset limit inadequate [

It is, therefore, suspected that the mechanism of pulmonary fibrosis in COVID-19 is different from that of IPF and other fibrotic lung diseases, especially with pathological findings pointing to alveolar epithelial cells being the site of injury, and not the endothelial cells [

 <xref rid="B66-jcm-09-01917" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. These facts indicate that other specific therapeutic options should be considered in COVID-19.
