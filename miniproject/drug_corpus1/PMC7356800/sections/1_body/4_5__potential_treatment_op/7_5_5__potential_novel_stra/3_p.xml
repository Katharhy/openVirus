<p>The researchers consider not only the use of well-known agents like approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis therapy, like nintedanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor [

 <xref rid="B126-jcm-09-01917" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>], but also other therapeutic options. On 24 March 2020, OncoArendi Therapeutics announced that it is researching a drug that can help treat pulmonary fibrosis in patients who survive COVID-19, namely OATD-01 which inhibits chitotriosidase 1 (CHIT1). This action may exhibit anti-inflammatory activity and delay the development of pulmonary fibrosis [

 <xref rid="B128-jcm-09-01917" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. Studies are currently underway to determine if patients who died of COVID-19 had increased CHIT1 expression in their lung tissue, which could result in a positive effect of the drug on developing pulmonary fibrosis in this disease [
