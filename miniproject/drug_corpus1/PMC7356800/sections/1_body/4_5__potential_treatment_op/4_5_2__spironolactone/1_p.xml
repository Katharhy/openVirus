<p>There are several reports which state that the use of spironolactone may be of significant importance in fibrosis prevention [
 <xref rid="B74-jcm-09-01917" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,
 <xref rid="B75-jcm-09-01917" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,
 <xref rid="B76-jcm-09-01917" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is a factor contributing to the pathophysiology of many diseases. Aldosterone, which is an adrenocortical hormone and physiological MR activator, is partly responsible for the increase in extracellular matrix turnover, which is observed in pulmonary, cardiac and renal fibrosis and exerts its effect primarily on lung epithelium [
 <xref rid="B74-jcm-09-01917" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. It is known that an increased level of aldosterone can induce hypertension, alter inflammation and fibrosis, and exacerbate cardiovascular disease [
 <xref rid="B75-jcm-09-01917" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. The limitations of some of these studies are related to the fact that they were carried out on animal models such as rats or other rodents. There are also no direct studies that present the beneficial effects of the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist in postviral fibrosis, but it could serve as a potential treatment for such a serious lower respiratory tract complication.
