<p>In various animal models, spironolactone has been shown to act as an antioxidant and to protect organs from damage associated with oxidative stress by strengthening the antioxidative defense systems while inhibiting free radicals production [
 <xref rid="B77-jcm-09-01917" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Lung tissue treated with spironolactone showed a reduced number of cells such as lymphocytes, neutrophils, macrophages and eosinophils in the alveoli compared to those in which spironolactone was not used. Lieber et al. showed that spironolactone treatment alleviates acute pneumonia caused not only by bleomycin but also by lipopolysaccharides [

The results suggest that initial treatment with spironolactone reduced neutrophil infiltration, nitric oxide synthase induction, oxidative stress and histopathological damage. Similarly, Atalay et al. demonstrated the effectiveness of spironolactone in the treatment of acute lung damage [
