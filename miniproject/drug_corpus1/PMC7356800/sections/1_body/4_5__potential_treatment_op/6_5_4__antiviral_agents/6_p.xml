Following plasma transfusion, body temperature normalized within three days in four out of five patients, the SOFA score decreased, and PaO2/FiO2 increased within 12 days. Viral loads also decreased and became negative within 12 days after the transfusion [

One of the early studies related to the use of steroids not yet peer-reviewed data, suggest ciclesonide blocks SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid replication in vitro and inhibits SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic activity. This may be of great relevance to reducing the risk of developing of COVID-19 in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection or reducing the severity of the disease. The effective concentration of ciclesonide to block SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19) replication (EC90) was 6.3 Î¼M [
