<p>Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine disrupt coronavirus cell receptor glycosylation and modulate the immune system [
 <xref rid="B95-jcm-09-01917" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. The latter proved efficient in vitro against SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B96-jcm-09-01917" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Another experience comes from the treatment of multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria, the use of teicoplanin inhibits the first stages of the coronaviruses cycle in human cells [

Currently known antiviral agents like remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir might inhibit RNA replication due to high affinity to viral enzymes, reverse transcription or protein biosynthesis through premature termination or inhibition of nitrogenous bases synthesis [

 <xref rid="B102-jcm-09-01917" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Remdesivir was given to patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and oxygen saturation ≤94%. During the median follow-up of 18 days, 36 patients (68%) improved their oxygen maintenance class. Moreover, 17 out of 30 patients (57%) assisted by mechanical ventilation were extubated. A total of 25 patients (47%) were discharged and seven patients (13%) died. Mortality was 18% (6 out of 34) among patients receiving invasive ventilation and 5% (1 out of 19) among patients not receiving invasive ventilation. The risk of death was greater in patients aged 70 years or older (risk ratio compared to patients under 70 years old, 11.34; 95% CI, 1.36 to 94.17) and among patients with higher serum creatinine at baseline (risk ratio per milligrams per deciliter, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.22 to 2.99) [
