<p>A summary provided in 
 <xref rid="jcm-09-01917-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows cytokine levels in COVID-19 and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) studies. This similarity suggests that the course of SARI during COVID-19 infection is analogous to SARS or MERS, so we can suggest proceedings based on previous experiences.
