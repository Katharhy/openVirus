The range of symptoms includes fever, dry cough, myalgia, weakness and shortness of breath, but other early symptoms have been identified with time, such as gastrointestinal (i.e., watery stools, anorexia, and upper abdominal discomfort) or neurologic (i.e., delirium) [

The severe course of pneumonia in COVID-19, called SARI is characterized by shortness of breath, respiratory rate &gt;30/min, saturation &lt;93% and SpO2/FiO2 &lt; 300 and warrants admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Usually, the symptoms develop within 24 to 48 h of infection and over time can lead to life-threatening conditions [
