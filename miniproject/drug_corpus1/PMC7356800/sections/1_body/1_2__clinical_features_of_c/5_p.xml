<p>In one scientific study, Susanna et al. investigated the cytokine response associated with MERS-CoV infection compared to SARS-CoV infection, by measuring mRNA expression levels of eight cytokine genes. The research was conducted using cells of the Calu-3 line (polarized airway epithelium Calu-3) infected with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV at 4, 12, 24 and 30 h. Out of eight cytokines tested, six (IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, IFN-β and IP-10) showed significantly increased expression in MERS-CoV and/or SARS-CoV infected Calu-3 cells when compared to uninfected cells. Among these six cytokines, proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1b, IL-6 and IL-8, induced by MERS-CoV showed significantly higher expression than those induced by SARS-CoV after 30 h. However, the levels of TNF-α, IFN-β and IP-10, which are important for the innate antiviral immune response, were significantly higher in cells induced by SARS-CoV than those induced by MERS-CoV after 24 and 30 h. The other two cytokines, MCP-1 (chemokine) and TGF-β (anti-inflammatory cytokine), showed no obvious increase after MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection [
