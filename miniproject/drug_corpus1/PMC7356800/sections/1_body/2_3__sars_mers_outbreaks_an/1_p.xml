<p>Given the threat of outbreaks of severe coronavirus disease, it is important to analyze pulmonary complications associated with the previous epidemics of SARS and MERS that preceded the current COVID-19. The aforementioned outbreaks were associated with tragic results: SARS ended with 8098 cases and 774 deaths [
