<p>SARS infection spreads mainly through inhalation of respiratory droplets and rarely via fecalâ€“oral transmission [
 <xref rid="B26-jcm-09-01917" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Apart from femoral head necrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, which occurs during lung healing [
 <xref rid="B28-jcm-09-01917" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], is the most severe distant consequence of SARS [
 <xref rid="B30-jcm-09-01917" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. During SARS, different morphologic lesions were observed in the lungs. They may be subcategorized into three phases: (1) acute exudative inflammation (focal fibroplasia and reticulin fiber formation already present); (2) fibrous proliferation (similar to proliferative interstitial pneumonia; mesenchymal cells differentiate into myofibroblasts and fibroblasts) and (3) final fibrotic stage with numerous types I and IV collagen fibers [
 <xref rid="B31-jcm-09-01917" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The primitive mesenchymal cells, hyperplastic alveolar epithelial cells, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and macrophages are crucial in the pathogenesis of fibrosis during SARS [

 <xref rid="B32-jcm-09-01917" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Patients first develop atypical pneumonia, followed by acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which evolves into fibrosis [
 <xref rid="B33-jcm-09-01917" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Fibrosis occurs more often amongst the older population [

 <xref rid="B32-jcm-09-01917" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and patients with a severe course of the disease [
 <xref rid="B34-jcm-09-01917" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Fibrosis is correlated with disease duration [
 <xref rid="B35-jcm-09-01917" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]; however, it may resolve spontaneously [
 <xref rid="B36-jcm-09-01917" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
