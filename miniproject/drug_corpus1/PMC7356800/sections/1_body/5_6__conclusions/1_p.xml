<p>COVID-19 presenting with SARI is an extremely serious disease. Rapid development and a significant, constantly growing number of patients are forcing scientists to seek new treatment options. This narrative review demonstrates similarity in pulmonary symptoms and the mechanisms of their formation, with previous forms of the coronavirus (SARS, MERS). For this reason, we should rely on the knowledge acquired during the previous epidemics. One of the complications of the respiratory system infection is pulmonary fibrosis, leading to permanent disability. There are few options available for its treatment. The most important factor in limiting pulmonary fibrosis is timely antiviral treatment and elimination of the causative agent, which is currently not possible in the absence of proper treatment. Research into attempts to limit the development of fibrosis is scarce. Trials with spironolactone have been carried out on animal models with positive results. An analysis of the mechanisms of action shows that the effect of this drug on fibrosis can be positive and it is worth considering its use in high-risk patients. The second relatively promising therapy may be the use of tPA in patients without contraindications, which reduced respiratory mortality. So far, despite years of trial, no answer has been given to the question of appropriate pulmonary fibrosis therapy. The presented treatment methods are promising however, they require a closer examination in prospective randomized trials.</p>
