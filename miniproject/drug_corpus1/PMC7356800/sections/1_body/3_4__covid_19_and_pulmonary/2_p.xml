<p>Pulmonary fibrosis is a pathological consequence of acute and chronic interstitial lung diseases. It is characterized by unsuccessful reconstruction of the damaged alveolar epithelium, persistence of fibroblasts and excessive deposition of collagen and other extracellular matrix (ECM) components (e.g., ECM), as well as the destruction of normal lung architecture [

This may be due to improper removal of ROS (aging) or associated with an excessive supply of a high percentage of oxygen, e.g., shortness of breath due to COVID-19 infection. An increase in apoptosis of follicular cells associated with oxidative stress has been observed in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). TGF-β1 contributes to the development of fibrosis and the production of ROS [

Moreover, tyrosine kinases signaling mediated by fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is also crucial in pulmonary fibrosis development. The studies determining IPF pathogenesis reported that overexpression of FGF and PDGF increases the pulmonary fibroblast proliferation. Furthermore, FGF enhances the profibrotic effects of TGF-β1 [
