<p>Dysregulated release of matrix metalloproteinases, which causes epithelial and endothelial injury [
 <xref rid="B57-jcm-09-01917" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and uncontrolled fibroproliferation are amongst the most important mediators of the inflammatory phase of ARDS [
 <xref rid="B58-jcm-09-01917" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. TGF-β regulates fibrosis [
 <xref rid="B59-jcm-09-01917" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] and together with VEGF, Il-6, TNF-α and vascular dysfunction participate in progression to fibrosis [

 <xref rid="B60-jcm-09-01917" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,
 <xref rid="B61-jcm-09-01917" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. This process does not occur amongst all patients [
 <xref rid="B2-jcm-09-01917" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is possible that increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines amongst older people are responsible for a more severe course of the disease in this group of patients. The similar cytokine profiles in IPF and COVID-19 suggest analogous pathomechanisms of pulmonary fibrosis in those diseases, therefore, drugs useful in the treatment of IPF could be also beneficial for COVID-19 patients.
