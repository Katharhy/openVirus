<p>Chronic inflammation has been considered as the main cause of pulmonary fibrosis and may lead to epithelial damage and fibroblast activation. Other studies suggest that alveolar epithelial damage and the formation of active myofibroblast foci are the main causes of most lung fibrosis processes [

Especially the elderly population is prone to viral-induced fibrosis due to immunosenescence and with viral infections acting as cofactors [
