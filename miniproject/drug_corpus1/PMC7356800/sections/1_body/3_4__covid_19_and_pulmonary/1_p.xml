<p>It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-2-converting enzyme (ACE2) as a cell receptor in humans, causing interstitial lung damage at first and then parenchymal lesions [

 <xref rid="B46-jcm-09-01917" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Consistently, studies on the tissue distribution of ACE2 suggest that the virus receptor is widely expressed in human tissue including the digestive tract, kidney, testis and other organs [
