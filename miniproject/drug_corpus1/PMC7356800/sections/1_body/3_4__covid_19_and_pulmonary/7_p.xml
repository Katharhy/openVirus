<p>Type II vesicular endothelial cells are one of the main sources of these fibrogenic factors. These factors stimulate hyperproliferation of type II follicular cells, recruit fibroblasts to fibrotic loci, and induce differentiation and activation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts are responsible for excessive ECM accumulation in basement membranes and interstitial tissues, which ultimately leads to loss of alveolar function, especially the gas exchange between alveoli and capillaries [
