<p>In order to study the immune system role in demyelination induction caused by MHV infection, Wang et al. (
 <xref rid="B153" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>) treated infected animals with gamma radiation to cause immunosuppression and, subsequently, reconstituted immunity by transferring cells from other immunocompetent animals. The results showed that demyelination was prevented by radiation and was present again when the immunity was restored, indicating that immunity is directly involved in the demyelination process (
