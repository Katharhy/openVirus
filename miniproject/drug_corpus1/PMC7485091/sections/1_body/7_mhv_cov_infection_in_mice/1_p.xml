<p>Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is a βCoV that poses no risk to humans but presents a great similarity with other viruses from the same family, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. It penetrates the CNS, causing white matter lesions; it has therefore been proposed as a viral model of demyelinating disease (
 <xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B147" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>). The virus has been shown to remain in the white matter and to be able to replicate in the CNS (
 <xref rid="B148" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>); therefore, it is a good model for the study of CNS infection by coronaviruses. Neurotropic strains of MHV-CoV have been used extensively to induce acute and chronic demyelinating disease mediated by neuroinflammation (
 <xref rid="B149" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>). Depending on the inoculation route and the MHV-CoV strain, different CNS regions are affected. Inoculation with experimental neurotropic strains, especially MHV-A59, induces a biphasic disease of acute meningoencephalitis at 10–14 days after inoculation, followed by a disease causing subacute, chronic inflammatory demyelination in the brain; spinal cord involvement is more pronounced (
 <xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>). Virus translocation from the initial site of inoculation in the brain to the spinal cord is caused by the transit of virus particles in neural and glial cells, as well as mechanisms that involve the fusion of lipid membranes, probably during the virus internalization step (
 <xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>). Intranasal and intracranial inoculation of JHM-CoV induces similar symptoms in BALB/c mice to those caused by MHV-A59. After intranasal inoculation of mice, MHV-CoV accesses the CNS through the olfactory nerve and propagates from the olfactory system to limbic system structures and their connections with the brainstem (
