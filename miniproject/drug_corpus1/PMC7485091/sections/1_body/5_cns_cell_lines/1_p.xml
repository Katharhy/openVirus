<p>The information currently available is from research on SARS-CoV, which has 78% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Although CNS tropism has been described (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), no specific models of neural cell lines have been developed for the study of SARS-CoV-2; however, neural progenitor cells (NPCs), neurons and microglia derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSCs) have already been used in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, demonstrating the virus potential to infect CNS cells (
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>–
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>). Previous studies with other neurotropic human coronaviruses showed possible neural cell lines susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 that may be useful in studying the possible mechanisms by which the virus infects the CNS. Studies into neural susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection have used cell lines including HOG, a line derived from a human oligodendroglioma that expresses proteins characteristic of oligodendrocytes and is very widely used in the study of neurons (
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>) and the C6 cell line, derived from a glioma induced in Wistar Furth rats exposed to N-nitroso-N-methylurea, which is morphologically similar to glioblastoma multiforme when injected into the brains of neonate rats (
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>). Although both cell lines have been shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV infection, low levels of viral replication have been observed in comparison with such other susceptible cell lines as Vero E6 or Caco-2 (
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>). Other cell lines used to study the virulence of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 in the CNS include human H4 brain neuroglioma cells, the LA-N-5 human neuroblastoma cell line, the CHME-5 human fetal microglia cell line, and the U-373 MG and U-87 MG astrocytic lines derived from a human glioblastoma and an astrocytoma, respectively, among many others (
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>–
 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>). Cultures of human primary neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia have been used to study these viruses (
 <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>). All these neural cell lines may be useful in the near future to study SARS-CoV-2.
