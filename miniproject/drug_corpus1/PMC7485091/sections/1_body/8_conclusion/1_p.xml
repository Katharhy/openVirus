<p>Research on SARS-CoV-2 has become a necessity due to the magnitude of its spread worldwide. Such aspects as infection rate and mechanisms, the possibility of reinfection, and possible therapeutic approaches make it necessary not only to use the experimental models previously employed to study the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV coronaviruses, but also to generate new models to respond to urgent questions. The potential involvement of the CNS due to SARS-CoV-2 infection should be studied specifically, and research efforts must focus on obtaining information with cellular or animal models to expand our understanding of the virus.</p>
