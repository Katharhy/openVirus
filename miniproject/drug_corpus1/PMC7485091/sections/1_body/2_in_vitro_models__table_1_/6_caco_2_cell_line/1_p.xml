<p>This line was extracted in 1977 from human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cells; under specific culture conditions, the cells are able to differentiate into small intestine enterocytes (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). This cell line is frequently used to study transfection, invasion, and absorption (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). It has been used in studies of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and HCoV-NL63 (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>), and in the analysis of the S protein activation in studies with SARS-CoV-2, due to the fact that these cells express the TMPRSS2 protease (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).
