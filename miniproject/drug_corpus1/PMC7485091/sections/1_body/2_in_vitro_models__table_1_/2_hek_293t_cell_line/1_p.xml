<p>This cell line is a variant of the HEK 293 lineage, which was isolated from kidney epithelial cells extracted from human embryos (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Both lines are widely used in research due to their high transfectability, gene expression, and production of proteins or recombinant retrovirus (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). The HEK 293T variant expresses the T SV-40 antigen, which enables the amplification of transfected plasmids containing the SV40 origin of replication and thus considerably increases the expression levels of desired gene products (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). These cells have also previously been used in studies of other such viruses as herpes simplex virus, SARS-CoV, and even CoV pseudovirions (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Due to its high efficiency of transfection, research with this cell line is producing significant findings, such as the confirmation of ACE2 as the cell entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and the potential role of CD147 as an alternative receptor (

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).
