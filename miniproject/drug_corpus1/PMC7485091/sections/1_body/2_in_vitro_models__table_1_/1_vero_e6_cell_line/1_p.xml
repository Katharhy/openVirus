<p>This cell line was isolated from kidney epithelial cells extracted from an African green monkey (
 <italic>Chlorocebus aethiops</italic>) in 1979; the Vero E6 cell line has been shown to be very useful for viral propagation and production 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). These cells are permissive to SARS-CoV replication, as they efficiently express the ACE2 receptor (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Furthermore, they enable persistent infection 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Vero E6 cells have therefore already been used in studies with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (
