<p>Ferrets (
 <italic>Mustela putorius furo</italic>) are frequently used as animal models to study respiratory diseases caused by such viruses as influenza virus or SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>–
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>). All studies with SARS-CoV-2 in ferrets have used the intranasal route to inoculate the virus (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>–
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>). Shi et al. (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>) studied the susceptibility of ferrets to infection with 2 SARS-CoV-2 strains. In a first stage of the study, the authors detected viral RNA in samples from the nasal turbinates, palate, and tonsils, but no viral load was detected in the other organs analyzed, including the lungs and brain. This suggests that the virus can replicate in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets. In a second stage of the study, analyzing the viral replication dynamics, animals showed viral RNA in nasal washes, whereas rectal swabs showed much lower viral load. Furthermore, ferrets presented anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at days 13 and 20. Histopathological studies showed altered pneumocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. Finally, when studying replication in the lungs, the authors observed that the virus is able to replicate in the upper respiratory tract up to day 8 after infection without causing severe symptoms. Richard et al. (
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>) focused on the study of the direct and indirect transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. Ferrets inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 were placed in direct contact with a group of healthy ferrets 6 h after infection. Inoculated animals showed productive infection, and the peak of viral infection was reached on the third day. All animals in direct or indirect contact presented viral RNA at day 1–3 after exposure. Animals exposed to inoculated ferrets were expected to present a lower viral load than the inoculated animals; however, viral load was similar in all cases. Lastly, the authors observed that all animals presented antibodies at day 21 after exposure to the virus, and that their levels were similar, regardless of the form of infection. A similar design was employed by Kim et al. (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>), who observed viral load up to 8 days after infection, both in samples from inoculated animals and in samples from animals that were in direct contact with the inoculated ferrets. Animals in indirect contact with infected ferrets showed positive results for infection at day 2 after exposure, which suggests rapid transmission, even before peak viral load was reached and in the absence of clinical symptoms; this correlates with the reported transmission by asymptomatic human patients.
