<p>This model was designed using a directional vector to replace exons 10â€“13, which codify the serine protease domain of the 
 <italic>TMPRSS2</italic> gene. It was constructed by electroporation of embryonic stem cells and their subsequent injection into C57BL/6 blastocysts for at least five generations (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>). After experimental infection with SARS-CoV-2, 
 <italic>TMPRSS2</italic>-deficient mouse strains showed reduced body weight loss and viral kinetics in the lungs. Absence of 
 <italic>TMPRSS2</italic> affected the infection sites and virus spread within the respiratory tract; therefore, this is a useful model for COVID-19 research (
