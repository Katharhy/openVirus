<p>Sun et al. (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>) used 
 <italic>CRISPR/Cas9</italic> technology to create a murine hACE2 model in young and aged animals. After intranasal infection of the animals with SARS-CoV-2, the researchers observed viral replication in the lungs, trachea, and brain of both animals. However, alveolar inflammatory infiltrate and vascular lesions were more evident in aged animals; this is analogous to the pathological changes observed in older patients with COVID-19. This model also showed evidence of respiratory tract infection following intragastric inoculation.
