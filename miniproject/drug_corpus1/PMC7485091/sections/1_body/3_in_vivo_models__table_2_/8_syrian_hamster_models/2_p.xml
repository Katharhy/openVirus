<p>Chan et al. (
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>) confirmed transmission by contact, the progressive decrease in viral load between days 2 and 7 after infection in both lower and upper respiratory tracts, and the expression of viral antigens (protein N) by epithelial cells together with presence of mononuclear infiltrates. On day 7 after infection, regenerative hyperplasia occurring in bronchioles led to the appearance of multiple irregularly arranged epithelial layers. Furthermore, they detected the viral antigen in the intestinal mucosa and observed histopathological changes in the spleen and heart. The pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade in this model normalizes at approximately day 7, and antibodies are observed at 7â€“14 days. This animal model reproduces the respiratory and enteric symptoms observed in patients with COVID-19.
