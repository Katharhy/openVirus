<p>This animal model (
 <italic>M. auratus</italic>) has previously been used in the study of SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>), as the hamster presents an ACE2 receptor homologous to the human receptor. Sia et al. (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>) intranasally inoculated animals with the β–CoV/Hong Kong/VM20001061/2020 strain and corroborated the presence of viral antigen in the epithelial cells of the nasal and bronchial mucosa with progression to pneumocytes and clearance of infectious particles by day 7 after infection. Presence of mononuclear cell infiltrates was moderate in the nasal turbinates but was greater in the lungs. The viral antigen was observed in epithelial cells of the duodenum, without signs of inflammation. No infectious particles were detected in the kidney, and no histopathological changes were observed in other organs. Neutralizing antibodies were observed on day 14 after infection. Infected animals presented clear weight loss and researchers corroborated that the main route of viral transmission was through direct contact or aerosols. The authors conclude that SARS-CoV-2 infection in Syrian hamsters presents similar characteristics to those observed in humans with mild infections and that this model represents an opportunity for understanding the transmission dynamics of this novel coronavirus.
