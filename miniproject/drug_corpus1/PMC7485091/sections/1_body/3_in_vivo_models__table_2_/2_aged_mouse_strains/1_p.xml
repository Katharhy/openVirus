<p>Roberts et al. (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>) reported that aged BALB/c mouse strains were able to maintain high rates of viral replication, which was associated with clinical illness and pneumonia; the study demonstrated an age-related susceptibility to SARS disease in animals that parallels the human experience. Advanced age has been identified as an independent factor of poor prognosis in COVID-19 and is considered a predictor of mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Other strains like C57BL/6 have also been used (
