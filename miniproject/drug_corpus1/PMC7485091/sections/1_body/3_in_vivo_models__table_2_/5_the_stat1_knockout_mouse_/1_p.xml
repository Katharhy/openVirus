<p>(129S6/SvEv-STAT1tmRDS) contains a homozygous 
 <italic>STAT1</italic> mutation and completely lacks functional 
 <italic>STAT1</italic> proteins (Pgm1c and Gpi1b alleles of 129S6). The model was created by targeting the 
 <italic>STAT1</italic> gene in GS-1 ES cells and injecting target cells into blastocysts. Heterozygous models of the mutation were produced from the chimeras and were crossed over to generate homozygous models (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>). The 
 <italic>JAK-STAT</italic> signaling pathway is involved in the mediation of cytokine-induced biological responses. This is therefore a useful model for determining the role of a variety of cytokines in immune responses, the role of 
 <italic>STAT1</italic> protein in mediating interferon-dependent responses, and its relationship with viral and bacterial pathogens (
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>); the model is also interesting in the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 inflammation mechanisms.
