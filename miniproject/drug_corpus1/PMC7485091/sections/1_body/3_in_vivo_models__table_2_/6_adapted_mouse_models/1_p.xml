<p>Studies have been recently conducted with BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice (

 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>) together with modified SARS-CoV-2 strains. Modification of the virus has led to mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strains, the SARS-CoV-2 MA (
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>) and SARS-CoV-2 MASCp6 (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>) strains, which are able to infect mice with no need for modification of the animals, as these strains efficiently bind to the murine ACE2 receptor in both young and aged mice, causing a disease resembling human COVID-19. In addition to their use in the study of pathogenesis, these models have enabled researchers to trial vaccines and treatments for the disease (
