<p>Previous studies on SARS-CoV already demonstrated that the spike protein facilitates viral invasion of the target cell by interacting with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). This protein is expressed on the surface of epithelial cells of the lower respiratory tract, endothelial cells of arteries and veins, intestinal mucosa cells, kidney cells, immune cells, glial cells, and neurons (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 also uses this receptor to penetrate cells (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In fact, sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has shown that it contains residues that may increase its binding affinity to the ACE2 receptor 10- to 20-fold in comparison with SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). When spike protein interacts with the receptor, cleavage and activation by cell proteases is necessary to enable the viral membrane to fuse with the host cell and the virus to penetrate. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins are mainly processed by transmembrane protease serine 2 (
 <italic>TMPRSS2</italic>), by endosomal cathepsins B and L in the absence of 
 <italic>TMPRSS2</italic> (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), and by furin (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Once the virus is internalized, viral RNA is released into the cytoplasm, and a series of translations and replications create new RNAs and viral proteins that assemble to form new virions (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). These are released from the host cell and can infect new target cells expressing the appropriate receptor on their surfaces (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).
