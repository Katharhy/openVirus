<p>More complex biological systems are, however, needed to study the possible interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and the host. Due to these complex interactions, selecting an appropriate model should be a thoughtful and clearly defined process, in order to provide relevant and translatable scientific data enabling us to address the questions of interest and to ensure the rational use of animals. Although many animals may respond similarly to humans from physiological, pathological, and therapeutic perspectives, we must bear in mind that differences between species may lead to erroneous conclusions (
