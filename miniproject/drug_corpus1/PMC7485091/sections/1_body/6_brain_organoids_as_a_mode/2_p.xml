<p>Ramani et al. (
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>) observed that in these brain organoids, the virus mainly infects mature cortical neurons and presents a perinuclear distribution within these cells. Furthermore, neurodegenerative effects have been observed in cells infected by SARS-CoV-2, including cell death and hyperphosphorylation, as well as mislocation of Tau protein; these alterations are observed in such conditions as tauopathies or Alzheimer disease (
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>). However, no productive replication of the virus was observed in these cells, at least in the first 4 days after infection (
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>), which would support the hypothesis that the CNS may act as a long-term reservoir of the virus (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In contrast, Bullen et al. (
 <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>) observed an incremented accumulation of viral particles in neural cells of brain organoids between 6 and 72 h after SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting an active replication and productive infection of the virus in neural cells during the first days. Viral particles were detected mainly in the neuronal soma and, in some cells, also into the neurites (
 <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>). Similar to Ramani et al., Mesci et al. (
 <xref rid="B141" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>) used these brain organoids and observed that the virus was able to infect neurons, including NPCs and mature cortical neurons, and cause cell death accompanied by the impairment of excitatory synapses. Furthermore, this work tested the efficiency of Sofosbuvir, an FDA-approved brain-penetrant antiviral drug for positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses (
 <xref rid="B145" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>), as a treatment for the SARS-CoV-2 infection and observed that this drug was able to rescue the altered synaptogenesis and decrease neuronal death and viral accumulation in these brain organoids (
 <xref rid="B141" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>). Song et al. (
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>) also demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 has neuroinvasive capacity in human brain organoids, particularly of NPCs and mature cortical neurons. Infected cells showed a hypermetabolic state and viral particles were accumulated within endoplasmic reticulum-like structures, indicating the virus ability to use the neural cell machinery to replicate (
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>). In addition, a hypoxic environment and extensive neuronal cell death were observed in high density SARS-CoV-2 infected areas, suggesting that virus infection could promote death of nearby cells (
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>). Finally, this study detected IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the cerebrospinal fluid of a COVID-19 patient that were able to block SARS-CoV-2 infection in brain organoids (
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>). All these studies show that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect neural cells and trigger damaging consequences that could cause neurologic symptoms. Also, these studies expose the great potential of the human brain organoids for the study of the SARS-CoV-2 effects in the CNS.
