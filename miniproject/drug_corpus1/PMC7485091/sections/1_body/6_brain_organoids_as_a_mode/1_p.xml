<p>Organoids are miniaturized, simplified, three-dimensional versions of an organ produced 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, partially recreating the cellular structure and the functioning of that organ (
 <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>). Classic cell culture systems present certain limitations, such as the inability to study complex and dynamic responses or cell-cell interactions. The use of organoids enables us to study complex physiological or pathological processes in structures bearing much greater resemblance to 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions, including SARS-CoV-2 infection, tropisms and potential treatments (
 <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>–
 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>). To date, SARS-CoV-2 infection has been studied in human organoids of lung, liver, intestine, blood vessels, and kidney (

 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>–
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>). Human brain organoids have also been used; these present strong cellular and structural similarities to some mammalian brain regions, such as a neural epithelium containing NPCs, that align to form a ventricular zone-like layer, cortical neurons, that contribute to the formation of a cortical plate-like layer and glial cells, such as astrocytes or oligodendrocytes (
 <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>–
 <xref rid="B141" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>). These organoids are useful for the study of early stages of human neurodevelopment and network formation, key cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, synaptogenesis or myelination, CNS function such as electrophysiological activity, neurodegenerative diseases, potential treatments, and have been already used for the study of other virus such as ZIKA virus or HIV (
