<p>We had previously suggested that a higher sfRNA-to-gRNA ratio provides a “one-two punch” for DENV against host cell antiviral response—less gRNA would result in a lesser degree of RIG-I activation, while more sfRNA would inhibit any RIG-I signaling to a greater extent. However, de novo sfRNA synthesis occurs after gRNA replication. RIG-I signaling inhibition would conceptually be more effective if sfRNA were delivered to infected cells to inhibit RIG-I signaling before gRNA replication ensues. Packaging of sfRNA into infectious particles is plausible, as a recent study showed that the 3′ UTR serves as a signal for nucleocapsid assembly (
