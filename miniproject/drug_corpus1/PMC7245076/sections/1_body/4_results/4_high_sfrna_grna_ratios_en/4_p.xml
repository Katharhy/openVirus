<p>Regardless of whether sfRNA was packaged in exosomes, virions, or both, the presence of DENV E protein raises the possibility that sfRNA could be delivered to susceptible cells via infection. To explore this possibility, we infected A549 cells and measured sfRNA levels at 2 hpi, before detectable gRNA replication ensued (

 </xref>), suggesting that sfRNAs were in the inoculum and not de novo synthesized. Furthermore, consistent with our findings in the 4G2-enriched fraction of the culture supernatant, only PR2B sfRNA could be detected in infected cells (

 </xref>). Correspondingly, a higher sfRNA:gRNA ratio was observed in PR2B-infected cells (
