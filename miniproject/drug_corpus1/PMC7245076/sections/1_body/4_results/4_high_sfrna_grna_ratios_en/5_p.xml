<p>Finally, we tested whether the packaged sfRNA can indeed inhibit the type I IFN response directly on delivery to new susceptible cells. We infected A549 cells cotreated with NITD008 at a concentration of 27 Î¼M to ensure inhibition of viral replication and de novo synthesis of sfRNA. We then assessed the levels of phosphorylated IRF3 at 6 hpi. Infection at an MOI of 1 resulted in few to no infected cells at 6 hpi; however, at an MOI of 10, where most of the cells were infected (

 </xref>), indicating early inhibition of the type I IFN response. Taken together, our data hint at the tantalizing possibility that sfRNA can be packaged in DENV E protein-containing infectious particles and delivered into cells for direct inhibition of the type I IFN response but in a DENV strain-dependent manner.
