<p>Reduced gRNA levels in PR2B compared with PR1 may be fundamental for the observed elevated sfRNA:gRNA ratio that forms the previously postulated “one-two punch.” Theoretically, given a fixed level of XRN1 expression, less gRNA substrate would result in an excess enzyme-to-substrate ratio for more complete digestion of uncapped gRNA to form sfRNA. If this explanation contributed to the observed increase in the sfRNA:gRNA ratio in PR2B viruses, then we should be able to increase the sfRNA:gRNA ratio in PR1 and PR13UTR by reducing gRNA replication. To test this notion, we repeated our experiment but with the addition of the antiviral compound NITD008, to inhibit DENV NS5 polymerase activity (

 </xref>). Likewise, sfRNA levels were also decreased, but the reduction was not as great as that in gRNA levels (

  <italic>B</italic>
 </xref>). Correspondingly, the sfRNA:gRNA ratio in both PR1- and PR13UTR-infected cells increased with increasing doses of NITD008 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3
  <italic>C</italic>
 </xref>). As a control, we also treated PR2B-infected cells with NITD008. Similar to the PR1 and PR13UTR, the sfRNA:gRNA ratio was increased with increasing concentration of NITD008 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3
  <italic>C</italic>
 </xref>); however, gRNA levels dropped below the limit of detection with 3 μM of NITD008, unlike those for PR1 and PR13UTR (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3
  <italic>A</italic>
 </xref>). This finding supports our suggestion that the amino acid substitutions in NS5 reduced the efficiency of gRNA binding and replication. Taken together, our findings suggest that the PR2B NS5 substitution reduced gRNA levels for more favorable sfRNA production relative to gRNA.
