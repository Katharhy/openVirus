<p>We next determined whether each of these five amino acid substitutions in the NS5 protein play functional roles in reducing the rate of gRNA replication and increasing sfRNA relative to gRNA levels. We generated five infectious clones of PR1, each bearing one of the five PR2B amino acid residues (

 </xref>) and pfu (

 </xref>). Likewise, sfRNA levels were universally lower for all mutants (

 </xref>). The sfRNA:gRNA ratio (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2
  <italic>H</italic>
 </xref>) increased for all but one of the mutants, although statistical significance was reached only in viruses with NS5 mutation at positions S269N and R891K. Of these, S269N was in the linker region of NS5, while the remaining four mutations were in the RdRp, three of which were arginine-to-lysine substitutions (R596K, R514K, and R891K). The arginine patch in the RdRp was previously found to be important for gRNA binding (
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Consequently, R-to-K substitutions could have resulted in reduced PR2B gRNA binding and thus viral replication (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2 
  <italic>E</italic> and 
  <italic>F</italic>
 </xref>), which is consistent with our observation in all mutants using either the PR1 or PR2B backbone, where the reduction in gRNA appears to be the major determinant of the sfRNA:gRNA ratio. Finally, amino acid 891 was previously shown to be a part of the nuclear localization signal of NS5 translocation (
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), although that study substituted the R amino acid with alanine; R891K did not appear to alter the nuclear localization of PR2B compared with PR1 NS5 protein (
