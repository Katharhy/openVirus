<p>To elucidate the effect that NS5 mutations had on PR2B infection, we generated infectious clone of PR2B and used reverse genetics to rescue viruses that represented the nodes of the phylogenetic tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1
  <italic>A</italic>
 </xref>) as DENV2 evolved from PR1 to PR2B (
 <xref rid="t01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Inoculating these intermediates onto human hepatoma (Huh-7) cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 produced gRNA levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1
  <italic>B</italic>
 </xref>) and infectious viral progenies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1
  <italic>C</italic>
 </xref>) that were intermediate to those of the control PR1 and PR2B viruses at 24 h postinfection (hpi). Levels of gRNA and plaque-forming units (pfu) of PR2B increased as NS5 substitutions in the PR2B genomic backbone was reversed to the PR1 residue. A statistically significant difference in sfRNA levels was observed, although the magnitude of change was small (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1
  <italic>D</italic>
 </xref>). Thus, with increased gRNA levels as PR1 NS5 sequences replaced PR2B NS5, the sfRNA:gRNA ratio was reduced (

  <italic>E</italic>
 </xref>). Correspondingly, 
 <italic>IFN-Î²</italic> expression was increased (
