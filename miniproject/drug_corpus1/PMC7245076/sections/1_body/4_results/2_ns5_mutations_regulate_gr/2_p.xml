<p>To confirm the foregoing findings, we generated infectious clones with a PR1 genomic backbone and replaced its NS5, 3′ UTR, or both with those from PR2B (
 <xref rid="t01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Replacing PR1 NS5 with PR2B NS5, with (PR1NS53UTR) or without (PR1NS5) PR2B 3′ UTR, resulted in reduced gRNA levels in primary monocytes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2
  <italic>A</italic>
 </xref>). In contrast, replacement of PR1 3′ UTR with that from PR2B alone (PR13UTR) did not result in a significant change in gRNA levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2
  <italic>A</italic>
 </xref>). Correspondingly, a greater increase in sfRNA:gRNA ratio was observed in PR1NS5-infected cells and PR1NS53UTR-infected cells than in PR13UTR-infected cells (

  <italic>C</italic>
 </xref>). 
 <italic>IFN-β</italic> expression was likewise reduced in primary monocytes infected with PR1NS53UTR and PR2B DENV2, but not in cells infected with the other two mutants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2
  <italic>D</italic>
 </xref>). That PR1NS5 failed to inhibit IFN-β induction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2
  <italic>D</italic>
 </xref>) despite its sfRNA:gRNA ratio than PR1 is consistent with our previously suggested notion that sfRNA bound and inhibited TRIM25 in a sequence-dependent manner (
 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). These findings suggest that DENV NS5 and 3′ UTR interact under epistasis to reveal the function of DENV sfRNA.
