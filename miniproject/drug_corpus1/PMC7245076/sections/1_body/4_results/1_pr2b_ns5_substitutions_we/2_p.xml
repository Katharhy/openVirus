<p>Four of the five NS5 mutations differentiated PR2B from a sister PR2A clade containing DENV2s that were detected at low frequency (
 <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). These mutations immediately preceded the expansion in the number of PR2B isolates (

 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The resulting maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree was juxtaposed against the 3′ UTR sequence at positions 10300, 10331, and 10389 (
 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Interestingly, PR2A DENV2s isolated in 1990 and 1991 also possessed the same 3′ UTR mutations as PR2B (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1
  <italic>A</italic>
 </xref>), the common ancestor of which could be traced back to a node in 1985 (95% CI, 1983.88 to 1986.88). These findings suggest that the phenotype conferred by the PR2B 3′ UTR could not be manifested without additional mutations in the NS5 gene.
