<p>To systemically define the amino acid substitutions that could have contributed to the emergence of PR2B in 1994, we conducted ancestral state reconstruction on the codon phylogenies of all DENV2s isolated from Puerto Rico dating as far back as 1981. This was done by first estimating the tree topology using the maximum likelihood (ML) method using the general time-reversible (GTR) nucleotide substitution model in Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood (RaXML v. 8) (
 <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and subsequently estimating genetic distances and ancestral sequences using phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood (PAML), version 4 (
 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Whole-genome sequences were obtained from an online database, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) (
 <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Mapping the mutations acquired by PR2B on to the branches of the tree revealed eight unique substitutions that led to the divergence of PR2B from PR1 (
