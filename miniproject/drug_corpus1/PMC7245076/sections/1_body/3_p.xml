<p>However, our focus on the 3′ UTR is driven primarily by curiosity as to how nucleotide substitutions in the 3′ UTR could impact the epidemiologic fitness of DENV. There were other substitutions in the coding regions of the genome that segregated PR2B from PR1, which also could have contributed to the increased epidemiologic fitness of PR2B viruses. To understand the chain of molecular events that led to the 1994 dengue outbreak, we reconstructed the viral ancestors and estimated the time in which the genetic variants emerged. We found that the 3′ UTR mutations were acquired as early as 1985, 9 y before the outbreak. The mutations that immediately preceded the 1994 outbreak were found mostly in the nonstructural 5 (NS5) gene, which encodes viral methyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). We show here that these NS5 substitutions reduced gRNA abundance, and that a reduced gRNA replication rate was necessary for more favorable sfRNA formation. Unexpectedly, we found that increased abundance of sfRNA relative to gRNA further enabled sfRNA to be packaged into DENV envelope (E) protein containing infectious particles. Thus, on infection, sfRNA could be delivered to new susceptible host cells without further de novo synthesis. Our findings suggest that NS5 substitutions in PR2B viruses are necessary to reveal the immune evasive function of sfRNA.</p>
