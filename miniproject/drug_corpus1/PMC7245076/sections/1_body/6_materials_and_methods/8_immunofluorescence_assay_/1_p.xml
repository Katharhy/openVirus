<p>Huh-7 cells were infected at an MOI of 10 of virus in serum-free DMEM. At 24 hpi, infected cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol for 15 min at −20 °C. Following fixation, cells were washed twice with PBS and then being stored at 4 °C. Nonspecific binding was blocked by 30 min of incubation with 1% [wt/vol] BSA/PBS before incubation of cells with primary antibodies against NS5 (5R3, 30 nM), followed by incubation with secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen). Cell nuclei were visualized using DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich, 1:10,000). Coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen).</p>
