<p>Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer. For denaturing, 1× Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad) with 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to samples, followed by boiling for 10 to 15 min. For the nondenaturing condition, 1× Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad) was added to samples without boiling. Samples were subsequently run on polyacrylamide gel for 90 min at 90 V. On transfer, membranes were blocked with 1× PBS containing either 5% nonfat dry milk or 5% BSA. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer. The denaturing condition was applied for XRN1 (Bethyl; 1:2,500), CD63 (Abcam; 1:5,000), phosphorylated IRF3 (Cell Signaling Technology; 1:1,000), IRF3 (Cell Signaling Technology; 1:1,000), β-actin (1:5,000), and LAMP-1 (1:5,000), and the nondenaturing condition was applied for CD9 (Abcam; 1:500), CD81 (Abcam; 1:250), and CD151 (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 1:1,000). Secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit, 1:5,000, and anti-mouse, 1:5,000) were diluted in blocking buffer. Bands were visualized using ECL (Amersham) for chemiluminescence development.</p>
