<p>A549 cells were infected with infectious clones at an MOI of 1 and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, with shaking every 15 min. After incubation, the medium was changed to DMEM with 3% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Cell supernatant was harvested at 24 hpi and subjected to pull-down with Dynabeads (Invitrogen) conjugated with 4G2 antibody or CD63 antibody (Genentech) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For CD63 depletion, culture supernatants were subjected to CD63 pull-down before pull-down with 4G2. The pull-down fraction was subsequently treated with RNAse, and viral RNA extraction was performed using the Qiagen QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit. Following RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and RT-qPCR analysis were conducted as described above.</p>
