<p>DENV2 infectious clones were constructed using the Gibson assembly method (
 <xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). In brief, viral RNA was extracted from strain PR1940 (representing the Puerto Rico endemic clade PR1) and strain PR8541 (representing the Puerto Rico epidemic clade PR2B) using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis kit (Invitrogen), and 2 µL of this cDNA was used to synthesize six DNA fragments that amount to the complete DENV genome using Q5 Hotstart 2× Master Mix (New England BioLabs). PCR products were then gel-extracted and purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and TA cloning was performed using pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega). The QuikChange Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent) was used to incorporate the single site mutations in NS5. Equimolar (0.1 pmol) of pUC19 vector containing the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter and simian virus 40 polyadenylation signal (SV40-pA) and each fragment were assembled with the NEBuilder HiFi Assembly Kit (New England BioLabs) at 50 °C for 1 h.
