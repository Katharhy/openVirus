<p>The assembled products were transfected into Hek293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and Opti-MEM (Gibco). In brief, 5 µL of assembled product was used for transfection, and supernatant was collected 48 h later. Infectious clones were propagated in C6/36 cells supplemented with 3% FBS. Infected cells were observed daily for syncytia (∼3 to 7 d), harvested, and stored at −80 °C until further use. Viral titers were determined by plaque assay. Infectious clones used in subsequent experiments were passaged one to three times in C6/36 cells. Synthesized infectious clones were confirmed by Sanger sequencing as described previously (
