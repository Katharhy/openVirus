<p>Huh7 cells were infected as described above. Cell lysate was harvested at 24 hpi for viral RNA extraction using TRIzol (Life Technologies). Samples were run on a 1% formaldehyde denaturing gel and then transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Bio-Rad) overnight. Hybridization with α
 <sup>32</sup>P dUTP-labeled RNA probes was performed overnight using ULTRAhyb Ultrasensitive Hybridization buffer (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After hybridization, membrane was exposed on a phosphoscreen, and signals were quantified using a Typhoon phosphoimager (GE Healthcare Lifesciences). The primer pair 5′-ATA​AAG​CTT​TAA​TAC​GAC​TCA​CTA​TAG​GGA​GAA​CCT​GTT​GAT​TCA​ACA​GCA​C-3′ and 5′-AGC CCC GTC CAA GGA CGT TAA AAG AAG TC-3′ was used to synthesize a fragment amplifying the 3′ UTR of the DENV2 genome from the whole DENV2 genome cDNA. This fragment was subsequently used for in vitro transcription for synthesis of the α
 <sup>32</sup>P dUTP-labeled RNA probe.
