<p>A549 cells were infected with virus at an MOI of 1 and cotreated with an ascending concentration of NITD008 from 1 μM to 3 μM, 9 μM, and 27 μM for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation, the medium was changed to DMEM with 3% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin containing the aforementioned concentrations of NITD008. Cell lysates were harvested 24 at hpi for RT-qPCR quantification of viral gRNA and sfRNA as described above.</p>
