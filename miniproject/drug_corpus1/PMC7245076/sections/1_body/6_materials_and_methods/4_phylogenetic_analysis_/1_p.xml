<p>Whole-genome sequences of the Puerto Rico DENV2 were retrieved from the NIAID ViPR (
 <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The dataset was imported into Geneious 9.0.5 (
 <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), and multiple sequence alignment was performed using the MAFFT plugin (
 <xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). After alignment, the dataset was scanned to identify any incomplete sequences or sequencing errors that may have resulted in gaps.
