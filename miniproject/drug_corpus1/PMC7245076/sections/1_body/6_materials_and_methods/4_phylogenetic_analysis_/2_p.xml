<p>An ML tree was generated according to the GTR nucleotide substitution model using RAxML (
 <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). PAML (
 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) was used in conjunction with RAxML to map the synonymous and nonsynonymous amino acid mutations along the branches of the tree.
