<p>For the dating analysis, the ML tree was screened using TempEst (
 <xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), and any outlier strains were removed before analysis. A molecular clock was estimated using the uncorrelated relaxed clock model in a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo framework in BEAST 1.8.3. The analysis was performed using the GTR nucleotide substitution model with a gamma distribution of among-site rate variation (GTR+G) and a Gaussian Markov random field Bayesian Skyride coalescent model. The dataset was analyzed for 200 million generations, with sampling every 10,000 runs. After removal of an appropriate burn-in of 10% of the runs, an MCC tree was inferred and visualized with FigTree 1.4.2.
