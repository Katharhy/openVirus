<p content-type="flushleft">Dengue is the most common vector-borne viral disease globally. Dengue virus (DENV), which exists as four antigenically distinct serotypes, afflicts an estimated 100 million people each year with acute disease, some of which are life-threatening (

 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, are both set to grow in the coming years with global warming and transboundary trade and travel (

Without a vaccine that effectively prevents infection by all four DENV serotypes or a licensed drug that can rapidly knock down viral burden in dengue patients and thereby reduce the likelihood of DENV transmission, cyclical dengue epidemics will continue to plague global health.
