<p>Dengue epidemics are mostly thought to result from the emergence of a new serotype of DENV in populations with low serotype-specific herd immunity (
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). However, several outbreaks have occurred in areas where new DENV strains emerged and displaced endemic strains without a change in either viral serotype or genotype. Such instances have been observed in Sri Lanka (
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), Puerto Rico (
 <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), Singapore (
 <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), Vietnam (
 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), Nicaragua (
 <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), Taiwan (
 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and Brazil (
 <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In all of these outbreaks, phylogenetic analyses grouped the newly emerged DENVs into clades distinct from DENVs that circulated before the outbreak. These findings thus suggest the existence of genetic determinants of epidemiologic fitness. Defining the molecular underpinnings of such epidemiologic fitness of DENV not only improves our understanding of dengue virology, but also could be developed into DENV genomic surveillance that scales disease prevention measures based on genetically defined risk of outbreaks (
