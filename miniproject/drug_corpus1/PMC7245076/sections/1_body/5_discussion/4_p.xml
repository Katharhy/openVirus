<p>We have previously suggested that the increased relative abundance of sfRNA compared with gRNA served as a “one-two punch.” We now show that that sfRNA could be delivered in infectious particles and serve as a form of “preemptive strike.” Delivery of sfRNA in infectious particles would inhibit RIG-I before de novo gRNA replication, an increased abundance of which would stimulate RIG-I. Histologically, DENV replication and encapsidation occur concurrently in vesicle packets (VPs) on membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (

As sfRNA formation follows gRNA replication and thus is also localized within the reorganized ER, excess sfRNA could conceivably compete with gRNA for packaging or even encapsidation into infectious particles or virions. To our knowledge, this finding has not been reported previously. The literature only describes how sfRNA is formed and characterizes its multifaceted role in immune evasion through viral RNA–host protein interactions (

 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>
 <xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr"/>–
 <xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Our results also show that packaging of sfRNA into infectious particles is dependent on the strain of DENV, as sfRNA levels must far exceed gRNA levels. Serial passage and early harvest of DENVs in cell cultures may select against slower-replicating but sfRNA-packaging DENV strains. This possibility underscores the need to use low-passaged clinical isolates to examine the epidemiologic fitness of DENV.
