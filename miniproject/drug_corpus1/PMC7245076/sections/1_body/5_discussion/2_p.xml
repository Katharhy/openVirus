<p>Our Bayesian molecular dating analysis revealed that PR2B 3′ UTR mutations were acquired well before the 1994 outbreak. Mutations in the coding region (NS1, NS3, and NS5) of PR2B were acquired after those in the 3′ UTR. These mutations also could have contributed to the emergence of the 1994 dengue outbreak. Indeed, we recently found that another amino acid mutation, T164S, this time in the NS1 protein, resulted in increased secretion of hexameric NS1 (

However, of the eight mutations that segregated PR2A from PR2B, five (62.5%) were in the NS5 gene. The largest multifunctional NS protein in the DENV genome, NS5 consists of an N-terminal methyltransferase domain and a C-terminal RdRp domain connected by a 10-aa-long linker (

 <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). NS5 RdRp enables de novo RNA genome synthesis, and the methyltransferase caps the newly synthesized genome. Thus, we focused our attention on the significance of these NS5 mutations in altering the epidemiologic fitness of DENV2. Indeed, previous studies have shown that mutations in NS5 compromise virus replication (
