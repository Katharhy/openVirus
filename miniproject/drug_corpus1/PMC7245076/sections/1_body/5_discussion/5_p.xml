<p>Our data collectively propose a model to explain the Puerto Rico dengue outbreak in 1994. Mutations in the 3 ′UTR were acquired possibly as early as 1985, although the type I IFN repression phenotype could not be revealed until the mutations in the NS5 were acquired just before the 1994 outbreak. We speculate that if the NS5 mutations had come before the 3 ′UTR mutations, such a strain would not have survived; reducing the rate of gRNA replication without the ability to effectively suppress type I IFN expression likely would have resulted in a DENV strain that was unable to achieve sufficiently high viremia levels to infect blood-feeding 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic>. Instead, acquisition of the 3′ UTR mutations in the backbone of a more rapidly replicating virus allowed this genotype to be sustained until acquisition of the NS5 mutations that produced a sfRNA:gRNA ratio favorable for sfRNA packaging or encapsidation. Our findings suggest a role for positive epistasis between NS5 and the 3′ UTR to reveal a “preemptive strike” function of DENV sfRNA for increased epidemiologic fitness.
