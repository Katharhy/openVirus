<p>Of the five PR2B NS5 mutations, four were located in the RdRp domain (K375R, R596K, R514K, and R891K) and one was located in the linker region (S269N). DENV NS5 RdRp binds the 5′ UTR stem-loop A for initiation of de novo synthesis of the viral genome (

 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), the R-to-K substitutions (R596K, R514K, and R891K) in the RdRp domain of PR2B NS5 could have reduced the efficiency of gRNA binding to the polymerase, thereby reducing the gRNA replication rate. Reduced gRNA could be important to ensure that XRN1 levels are in excess of the uncapped gRNA substrate to generate more sfRNA relative to gRNA. Indeed, this interpretation is well supported by our experimental finding that inhibition of PR1 NS5 polymerase activity using the previously validated antiviral compound, NITD008, increased the sfRNA:gRNA ratio in PR1- and PR13UTR-infected cells.
