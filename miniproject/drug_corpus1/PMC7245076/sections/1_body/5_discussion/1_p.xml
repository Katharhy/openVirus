<p content-type="flushleft">Epidemiologic observations have long suggested that within DENVs exist strains with greater levels of epidemiologic fitness to spread epidemically in natural human-mosquito-human cycles (

The 1994 dengue epidemic in Puerto Rico, in which the emergence of a new clade of DENV2, PR2B, that displaced the endemic PR1 clade, provides a context in which to identify the genetic determinants of the epidemiologic fitness of DENV (
 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Here we add to this body of knowledge and suggest that a reduced gRNA replication rate through the 5-aa substitution in the NS5 protein influences the relative abundance of sfRNA that enabled it to compete favorably with gRNA for packaging into infectious particles.
