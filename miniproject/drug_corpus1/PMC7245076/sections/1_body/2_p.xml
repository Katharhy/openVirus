<p>To gain insight into genetic determinants of epidemiologic fitness, we have taken advantage of the 1994 dengue outbreak in Puerto Rico. In this outbreak, sequence data of the DENV genome revealed the emergence of a clade of DENV2 (PR2B clade) in 1994 that displaced another DENV2 clade (PR1) that had circulated endemically before the outbreak (
 <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). We previously found that the increased epidemiologic fitness of PR2B relative to PR1 was conferred in part by three mutations in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of the viral genome (
 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). These mutations led to production of more subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) relative to genomic viral RNA (gRNA) in PR2B viruses (
 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The formation of sfRNA is mediated by host 5′-3′ exoribonuclease (XRN1), which digests gRNA in a 5′ to 3′ direction but stalls when the enzyme encounters highly conserved secondary RNA structures in the 3′ UTR (
 <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>); thus, sfRNAs are 3′ UTR remnants (
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). These remnants are functional, however, as PR2B sfRNA binds the E3 ligase, TRIM25, in a sequence-dependent manner to reduce its polyubiquitylation activity on RIG-I, which is necessary for sustained and amplified type I IFN induction. Thus, a reduced IFN response could have enabled PR2B DENV2 to achieve higher viremia titers during human infection, increasing the likelihood of a symptomatic outcome as well as transmission to blood-feeding
