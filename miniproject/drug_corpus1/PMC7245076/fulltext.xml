Here we report that positive epistasis between the coding and noncoding regions of the viral genome combined to elicit an epidemiologic fitness phenotype associated with the 1994 DENV2 outbreak in Puerto Rico. We found that five amino acid substitutions in the NS5 protein reduced viral genomic RNA (gRNA) replication rate to achieve a more favorable and relatively more abundant subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA), a byproduct of host 5&#x02032;-3&#x02032; exoribonuclease activity. The resulting increase in sfRNA relative to gRNA levels not only inhibited type I interferon (IFN) expression in infected cells through a previously described mechanism, but also enabled sfRNA to compete with gRNA for packaging into infectious particles. We suggest that delivery of sfRNA to new susceptible cells to inhibit type I IFN induction before gRNA replication and without the need for further de novo sfRNA synthesis could form a &#x0201c;preemptive strike&#x0201d; strategy against DENV.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>dengue</kwd><kwd>epidemiologic fitness</kwd><kwd>sfRNA packaging</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="gs1"><funding-source id="sp1">MOH | National Medical Research Council (NMRC)<named-content content-type="funder-id">501100001349</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp1">NMRC/CIRG/1462/2016</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Ayesa Syenina</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Dhanasekaran Vijaykrishna</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Esther Shuyi Gan</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Hwee Cheng Tan</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Milly M.

Dengue virus (DENV), which exists as four antigenically distinct serotypes, afflicts an estimated 100 million people each year with acute disease, some of which are life-threatening (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The geographic footprints of DENV and its mosquito vector, <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, are both set to grow in the coming years with global warming and transboundary trade and travel (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Without a vaccine that effectively prevents infection by all four DENV serotypes or a licensed drug that can rapidly knock down viral burden in dengue patients and thereby reduce the likelihood of DENV transmission, cyclical dengue epidemics will continue to plague global health.</p><p>Dengue epidemics are mostly thought to result from the emergence of a new serotype of DENV in populations with low serotype-specific herd immunity (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). However, several outbreaks have occurred in areas where new DENV strains emerged and displaced endemic strains without a change in either viral serotype or genotype. Such instances have been observed in Sri Lanka (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), Puerto Rico (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), Singapore (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), Vietnam (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), Nicaragua (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), Taiwan (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and Brazil (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In all of these outbreaks, phylogenetic analyses grouped the newly emerged DENVs into clades distinct from DENVs that circulated before the outbreak. These findings thus suggest the existence of genetic determinants of epidemiologic fitness. Defining the molecular underpinnings of such epidemiologic fitness of DENV not only improves our understanding of dengue virology, but also could be developed into DENV genomic surveillance that scales disease prevention measures based on genetically defined risk of outbreaks (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>To gain insight into genetic determinants of epidemiologic fitness, we have taken advantage of the 1994 dengue outbreak in Puerto Rico. In this outbreak, sequence data of the DENV genome revealed the emergence of a clade of DENV2 (PR2B clade) in 1994 that displaced another DENV2 clade (PR1) that had circulated endemically before the outbreak (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). We previously found that the increased epidemiologic fitness of PR2B relative to PR1 was conferred in part by three mutations in the 3&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR) of the viral genome (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). These mutations led to production of more subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) relative to genomic viral RNA (gRNA) in PR2B viruses (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The formation of sfRNA is mediated by host 5&#x02032;-3&#x02032; exoribonuclease (XRN1), which digests gRNA in a 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; direction but stalls when the enzyme encounters highly conserved secondary RNA structures in the 3&#x02032; UTR (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>); thus, sfRNAs are 3&#x02032; UTR remnants (<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). These remnants are functional, however, as PR2B sfRNA binds the E3 ligase, TRIM25, in a sequence-dependent manner to reduce its polyubiquitylation activity on RIG-I, which is necessary for sustained and amplified type I IFN induction. Thus, a reduced IFN response could have enabled PR2B DENV2 to achieve higher viremia titers during human infection, increasing the likelihood of a symptomatic outcome as well as transmission to blood-feeding <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito vectors (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), collectively increasing the incidence of dengue.</p><p>However, our focus on the 3&#x02032; UTR is driven primarily by curiosity as to how nucleotide substitutions in the 3&#x02032; UTR could impact the epidemiologic fitness of DENV. There were other substitutions in the coding regions of the genome that segregated PR2B from PR1, which also could have contributed to the increased epidemiologic fitness of PR2B viruses. To understand the chain of molecular events that led to the 1994 dengue outbreak, we reconstructed the viral ancestors and estimated the time in which the genetic variants emerged. We found that the 3&#x02032; UTR mutations were acquired as early as 1985, 9 y before the outbreak. The mutations that immediately preceded the 1994 outbreak were found mostly in the nonstructural 5 (NS5) gene, which encodes viral methyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). We show here that these NS5 substitutions reduced gRNA abundance, and that a reduced gRNA replication rate was necessary for more favorable sfRNA formation. Unexpectedly, we found that increased abundance of sfRNA relative to gRNA further enabled sfRNA to be packaged into DENV envelope (E) protein containing infectious particles. Thus, on infection, sfRNA could be delivered to new susceptible host cells without further de novo synthesis. Our findings suggest that NS5 substitutions in PR2B viruses are necessary to reveal the immune evasive function of sfRNA.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="s1"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2"><title>PR2B NS5 Substitutions Were Acquired Immediately before the 1994 Outbreak.</title><p>To systemically define the amino acid substitutions that could have contributed to the emergence of PR2B in 1994, we conducted ancestral state reconstruction on the codon phylogenies of all DENV2s isolated from Puerto Rico dating as far back as 1981. This was done by first estimating the tree topology using the maximum likelihood (ML) method using the general time-reversible (GTR) nucleotide substitution model in Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood (RaXML v. 8) (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and subsequently estimating genetic distances and ancestral sequences using phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood (PAML), version 4 (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Whole-genome sequences were obtained from an online database, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Mapping the mutations acquired by PR2B on to the branches of the tree revealed eight unique substitutions that led to the divergence of PR2B from PR1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1919287117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S1</ext-link>). One of these substitutions was in NS1 (T164S), two were in NS3 (L31F and K418R), and five were in NS5 (S269N, K375R, R514K, R514K, and R891K) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1919287117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S1</ext-link>). In particular, three of the five amino acid substitutions that immediately preceded the expansion of the number of PR2B isolates were all in the NS5 protein. Thus, we focused our study on NS5.</p><p>Four of the five NS5 mutations differentiated PR2B from a sister PR2A clade containing DENV2s that were detected at low frequency (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).

Sequentially, following the K375R substitution that occurred at the root of the PR2A and PR2B clades, R596K was followed by S269N, R514K, and R891K in the PR2B clade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1919287117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S1</ext-link>). We next ascertained when these NS5 mutations were acquired relative to the three nucleotide mutations in the 3&#x02032; UTR using Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees (BEAST) (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The resulting maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree was juxtaposed against the 3&#x02032; UTR sequence at positions 10300, 10331, and 10389 (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Interestingly, PR2A DENV2s isolated in 1990 and 1991 also possessed the same 3&#x02032; UTR mutations as PR2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>), the common ancestor of which could be traced back to a node in 1985 (95% CI, 1983.88 to 1986.88). These findings suggest that the phenotype conferred by the PR2B 3&#x02032; UTR could not be manifested without additional mutations in the NS5 gene.</p><fig fig-type="featured" id="fig01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>NS5 mutations in PR2B proceeded 3&#x02032; UTR mutations.

infectious clones with a PR1 genomic backbone and replaced its NS5, 3&#x02032; UTR, or both with those from PR2B (<xref rid="t01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Replacing PR1 NS5 with PR2B NS5, with (PR1NS53UTR) or without (PR1NS5) PR2B 3&#x02032; UTR, resulted in reduced gRNA levels in primary monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). In contrast, replacement of PR1 3&#x02032; UTR with that from PR2B alone (PR13UTR) did not result in a significant change in gRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>).

This phenotype was also found in PR1NS53UTR, but not in PR1NS5 or PR13UTR, further suggesting that epistatic interaction between DENV NS5 and 3&#x02032; UTR elicited the PR2B phenotype. We also examined the ability of our mutant viruses to infect <italic>A. aegypti</italic>, the natural vector of DENV. All viruses were viable and replicated well in these mosquitos (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1919287117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S3</ext-link>).</p><p>We next determined whether each of these five amino acid substitutions in the NS5 protein play functional roles in reducing the rate of gRNA replication and increasing sfRNA relative to gRNA levels. We generated five infectious clones of PR1, each bearing one of the five PR2B amino acid residues (<xref rid="t01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). All mutant viruses displayed significant reductions in gRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>E</italic></xref>) and pfu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>F</italic></xref>). Likewise, sfRNA levels were universally lower for all mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>G</italic></xref>). The sfRNA:gRNA ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>H</italic></xref>) increased for all but one of the mutants, although statistical significance was reached only in viruses with NS5 mutation at positions S269N and R891K. Of these, S269N was in the linker region of NS5, while the remaining four mutations were in the RdRp, three of which were arginine-to-lysine substitutions (R596K, R514K, and R891K). The arginine patch in the RdRp was previously found to be important for gRNA binding (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Consequently, R-to-K substitutions could have resulted in reduced PR2B gRNA binding and thus viral replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2 <italic>E</italic> and <italic>F</italic></xref>), which is consistent with our observation in all mutants using either the PR1 or PR2B backbone, where the reduction in gRNA appears to be the major determinant of the sfRNA:gRNA ratio. Finally, amino acid 891 was previously shown to be a part of the nuclear localization signal of NS5 translocation (<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), although that study substituted the R amino acid with alanine; R891K did not appear to alter the nuclear localization of PR2B compared with PR1 NS5 protein (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1919287117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S2<italic>M</italic></ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Reduced gRNA Replication Is Required for Augmenting sfRNA:gRNA Ratios.</title><p>Reduced gRNA levels in PR2B compared with PR1 may be fundamental for the observed elevated sfRNA:gRNA ratio that forms the previously postulated &#x0201c;one-two punch.&#x0201d; Theoretically, given a fixed level of XRN1 expression, less gRNA substrate would result in an excess enzyme-to-substrate ratio for more complete digestion of uncapped gRNA to form sfRNA. If this explanation contributed to the observed increase in the sfRNA:gRNA ratio in PR2B viruses, then we should be able to increase the sfRNA:gRNA ratio in PR1 and PR13UTR by reducing gRNA replication. To test this notion, we repeated our experiment but with the addition of the antiviral compound NITD008, to inhibit DENV NS5 polymerase activity (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). To avoid completely eliminating DENV infection, we used NITD008 concentrations below those previously shown to fully inhibit DENV polymerase activity (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Indeed, cotreatment of NITD008 yielded lower gRNA levels at 24 hpi for both PR1 and PR13UTR in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). Likewise, sfRNA levels were also decreased, but the reduction was not as great as that in gRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>). Correspondingly, the sfRNA:gRNA ratio in both PR1- and PR13UTR-infected cells increased with increasing doses of NITD008 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>). As a control, we also treated PR2B-infected cells with NITD008. Similar to the PR1 and PR13UTR, the sfRNA:gRNA ratio was increased with increasing concentration of NITD008 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>); however, gRNA levels dropped below the limit of detection with 3 &#x003bc;M of NITD008, unlike those for PR1 and PR13UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). This finding supports our suggestion that the amino acid substitutions in NS5 reduced the efficiency of gRNA binding and replication. Taken together, our findings suggest that the PR2B NS5 substitution reduced gRNA levels for more favorable sfRNA production relative to gRNA.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig03" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Reduced gRNA replication is required for an increased sfRNA:gRNA ratio.

However, de novo sfRNA synthesis occurs after gRNA replication. RIG-I signaling inhibition would conceptually be more effective if sfRNA were delivered to infected cells to inhibit RIG-I signaling before gRNA replication ensues.

EVs, in the form of either microvesicles (MVs) or exosomes (<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), are products of cellular vesicles that are secreted from cells via exocytosis, which could contain both viral RNA and virions (<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Thus, we measured the levels of both gRNA and sfRNA in the EVs. The larger diameter of MVs compared with exosomes and virions (&#x0003e;100 nm vs. &#x0223c;50 to 100 nm) allows for separation of MVs from exosomes and virions by centrifugation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1919287117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S4<italic>K</italic></ext-link>). Lower numbers of gRNA and sfRNA copies were observed in the pelleted fraction containing MVs compared with fractions with smaller vesicles (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1919287117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S4 <italic>L</italic>&#x02013;<italic>N</italic></ext-link>), suggesting preferential packaging of gRNA and sfRNA in either virions or exosomes. Thus, we knocked down tetraspanins in A549 cells to reduce exosome formation.

Silencing of CD9, CD63, CD81, and CD151 in A549 cells resulted in lower gRNA copies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1919287117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S4 <italic>G</italic> and <italic>I</italic></ext-link>) and sfRNA copies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1919287117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S4 <italic>H</italic> and <italic>J</italic></ext-link>), but without the expected reduction in sfRNA:gRNA ratio in the supernatant for both PR1 and PR2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>). While this finding supports previously published data indicating that DENV gRNA can be contained inside exosomes (<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), the experimental outcome suggests that sfRNA is not packaged primarily in exosomes.</p><p>To determine whether sfRNA is packaged in virions or infectious particles containing DENV envelope (E) protein and are thus infectious, we used a pan-DENV monoclonal antibody, 4G2, to enrich for E-containing infectious particles in the culture supernatant.

RT-qPCR showed that gRNA copies were detectable in all viruses except PR1NS5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>). Interestingly, sfRNA copies were detected in PR1NS5, PR1NS53UTR, and PR2B but not in PR1 and PR13UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4<italic>D</italic></xref>). Correspondingly, sfRNA:gRNA ratios in PR1NS5, PR1NS53UTR, and PR2B were increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4<italic>E</italic></xref>). These findings suggest that sfRNA could be packaged in infectious particles. However, the 4G2 pull-down precipitate also contained exosomes (CD63) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4<italic>F</italic></xref>). To delineate whether sfRNA is packaged exclusively in virions, we used CD63 antibodies to deplete exosomes from culture supernatants before subjecting them to 4G2 pull-down (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1919287117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S5<italic>A</italic></ext-link>).

Taken together, these findings suggest that sfRNA may be packaged in DENV E protein-containing particles, including both exosomes and virions.</p><p>Regardless of whether sfRNA was packaged in exosomes, virions, or both, the presence of DENV E protein raises the possibility that sfRNA could be delivered to susceptible cells via infection. To explore this possibility, we infected A549 cells and measured sfRNA levels at 2 hpi, before detectable gRNA replication ensued (<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). To further reduce the likelihood of de novo sfRNA synthesis in our experiment, we also silenced XRN1 in the inoculated cells. Reduced XRN1 expression did not affect the levels of either gRNA or sfRNA at 2 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4 <italic>F</italic> and <italic>G</italic></xref>), suggesting that sfRNAs were in the inoculum and not de novo synthesized. Furthermore, consistent with our findings in the 4G2-enriched fraction of the culture supernatant, only PR2B sfRNA could be detected in infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4<italic>G</italic></xref>). Correspondingly, a higher sfRNA:gRNA ratio was observed in PR2B-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4<italic>H</italic></xref>).</p><p>Finally, we tested whether the packaged sfRNA can indeed inhibit the type I IFN response directly on delivery to new susceptible cells. We infected A549 cells cotreated with NITD008 at a concentration of 27 &#x003bc;M to ensure inhibition of viral replication and de novo synthesis of sfRNA. We then assessed the levels of phosphorylated IRF3 at 6 hpi. Infection at an MOI of 1 resulted in few to no infected cells at 6 hpi; however, at an MOI of 10, where most of the cells were infected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4<italic>K</italic></xref>), we observed a reduced level of phosphorylated IRF3 in PR1NS53UTR compared with PR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4<italic>J</italic></xref>), indicating early inhibition of the type I IFN response. Taken together, our data hint at the tantalizing possibility that sfRNA can be packaged in DENV E protein-containing infectious particles and delivered into cells for direct inhibition of the type I IFN response but in a DENV strain-dependent manner.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s6"><title>Discussion</title><p content-type="flushleft">Epidemiologic observations have long suggested that within DENVs exist strains with greater levels of epidemiologic fitness to spread epidemically in natural human-mosquito-human cycles (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The genetic determinants of such epidemiologic fitness have remained vague, however. The 1994 dengue epidemic in Puerto Rico, in which the emergence of a new clade of DENV2, PR2B, that displaced the endemic PR1 clade, provides a context in which to identify the genetic determinants of the epidemiologic fitness of DENV (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Here we add to this body of knowledge and suggest that a reduced gRNA replication rate through the 5-aa substitution in the NS5 protein influences the relative abundance of sfRNA that enabled it to compete favorably with gRNA for packaging into infectious particles.</p><p>Our Bayesian molecular dating analysis revealed that PR2B 3&#x02032; UTR mutations were acquired well before the 1994 outbreak. Mutations in the coding region (NS1, NS3, and NS5) of PR2B were acquired after those in the 3&#x02032; UTR. These mutations also could have contributed to the emergence of the 1994 dengue outbreak. Indeed, we recently found that another amino acid mutation, T164S, this time in the NS1 protein, resulted in increased secretion of hexameric NS1 (<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), which has been shown to be a mediator of vascular leakage (<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Consequently, this T164S mutation also could have contributed to more severe dengue and hence more healthcare-seeking patients. However, of the eight mutations that segregated PR2A from PR2B, five (62.5%) were in the NS5 gene. The largest multifunctional NS protein in the DENV genome, NS5 consists of an N-terminal methyltransferase domain and a C-terminal RdRp domain connected by a 10-aa-long linker (<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). NS5 RdRp enables de novo RNA genome synthesis, and the methyltransferase caps the newly synthesized genome. Thus, we focused our attention on the significance of these NS5 mutations in altering the epidemiologic fitness of DENV2. Indeed, previous studies have shown that mutations in NS5 compromise virus replication (<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p><p>Of the five PR2B NS5 mutations, four were located in the RdRp domain (K375R, R596K, R514K, and R891K) and one was located in the linker region (S269N). DENV NS5 RdRp binds the 5&#x02032; UTR stem-loop A for initiation of de novo synthesis of the viral genome (<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Introduction of PR2B NS5 mutations into the PR1 genomic backbone produced mutants with lower rates of gRNA replication. Since an arginine patch in the RdRp may play a role in facilitating viral RNA binding (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), the R-to-K substitutions (R596K, R514K, and R891K) in the RdRp domain of PR2B NS5 could have reduced the efficiency of gRNA binding to the polymerase, thereby reducing the gRNA replication rate. Reduced gRNA could be important to ensure that XRN1 levels are in excess of the uncapped gRNA substrate to generate more sfRNA relative to gRNA. Indeed, this interpretation is well supported by our experimental finding that inhibition of PR1 NS5 polymerase activity using the previously validated antiviral compound, NITD008, increased the sfRNA:gRNA ratio in PR1- and PR13UTR-infected cells.</p><p>We have previously suggested that the increased relative abundance of sfRNA compared with gRNA served as a &#x0201c;one-two punch.&#x0201d; We now show that that sfRNA could be delivered in infectious particles and serve as a form of &#x0201c;preemptive strike.&#x0201d; Delivery of sfRNA in infectious particles would inhibit RIG-I before de novo gRNA replication, an increased abundance of which would stimulate RIG-I. Histologically, DENV replication and encapsidation occur concurrently in vesicle packets (VPs) on membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Synthesized negatively charged viral RNA exits through VP pores and is transported into virus-budding sites in the ER for encapsidation by the positively charged DENV capsid protein (<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). A recently reported study found that specific binding of NS2A to the last 285 nucleotides of the 3&#x02032; UTR facilitates transport of the viral RNA to the virion assembly site (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). As sfRNA formation follows gRNA replication and thus is also localized within the reorganized ER, excess sfRNA could conceivably compete with gRNA for packaging or even encapsidation into infectious particles or virions. To our knowledge, this finding has not been reported previously. The literature only describes how sfRNA is formed and characterizes its multifaceted role in immune evasion through viral RNA&#x02013;host protein interactions (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Our results also show that packaging of sfRNA into infectious particles is dependent on the strain of DENV, as sfRNA levels must far exceed gRNA levels. Serial passage and early harvest of DENVs in cell cultures may select against slower-replicating but sfRNA-packaging DENV strains. This possibility underscores the need to use low-passaged clinical isolates to examine the epidemiologic fitness of DENV.</p><p>Our data collectively propose a model to explain the Puerto Rico dengue outbreak in 1994. Mutations in the 3 &#x02032;UTR were acquired possibly as early as 1985, although the type I IFN repression phenotype could not be revealed until the mutations in the NS5 were acquired just before the 1994 outbreak. We speculate that if the NS5 mutations had come before the 3 &#x02032;UTR mutations, such a strain would not have survived; reducing the rate of gRNA replication without the ability to effectively suppress type I IFN expression likely would have resulted in a DENV strain that was unable to achieve sufficiently high viremia levels to infect blood-feeding <italic>A. aegypti</italic>. Instead, acquisition of the 3&#x02032; UTR mutations in the backbone of a more rapidly replicating virus allowed this genotype to be sustained until acquisition of the NS5 mutations that produced a sfRNA:gRNA ratio favorable for sfRNA packaging or encapsidation. Our findings suggest a role for positive epistasis between NS5 and the 3&#x02032; UTR to reveal a &#x0201c;preemptive strike&#x0201d; function of DENV sfRNA for increased epidemiologic fitness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s7"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s8"><title>Cell Lines.</title><p>Hek293T (ATCC), A549 (ATCC), and Huh7 (Duke Cell Repository) cells were cultured in Dulbecco&#x02019;s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% FBS.
