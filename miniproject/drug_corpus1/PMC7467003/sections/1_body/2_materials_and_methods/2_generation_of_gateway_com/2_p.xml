<p>Expression clones with N-terminal fusion tags (
 <italic>e.g.</italic>, for purification) can be produced simply by preparing the appropriate Gateway-compatible Destination vector. However, to enable the subsequent removal of such N-terminal fusion tags, we generated an additional set of clones containing, at the N-terminus of the ORF, a recognition sequence for nuclear inclusion protease from tobacco etch virus (TEV). TEV sequences were incorporated by amplifying CDS regions from the first collection using forward primers that also provide TEV sequences with the original reverse primers.
