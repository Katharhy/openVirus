<p>Synthesized viral coding sequences were incorporated into Gateway Entry plasmids: either pDONR207 (Invitrogen Cat #12213013) or pDONR223 (

These clones were made by either PCR-amplifying the whole plasmid with primers that eliminated the stop codon, or by amplifying CDS regions from the first collection, using downstream primers with complementary regions that were internal to each stop codon, and which simultaneously incorporated the flanking sequences necessary for incorporation into a Gateway Entry plasmid [pDONR207, pDONR221 (Invitrogen Cat #12536017) or pDONR223].
