<p>Each SARS-CoV-2 CDS bacterial clone (DH5Î± 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strain, NEB Cat# C2987) was isolated from a single colony, and its inserted CDS was confirmed by full-length Sanger sequencing (The Centre for Applied Genomics, Toronto, Canada). All clones with a pDONR221 or pDONR223 backbone were sequenced with M13F and M13R primers. Clones with a pDONR207 backbone were sequenced with customized forward and reverse primers. All primer sequences are available in Table S1.
