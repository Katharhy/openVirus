<p>Based on the published annotation of the genome sequence of the HKU-SZ-005b (GenBank MN975262; 
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Chan 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2020
 </xref>) and Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank MN908947; 
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Wu 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2020
 </xref>) isolates of SARS-CoV-2, we requested the synthesis of viral coding sequences (GenScript and Integrated DNA Technologies), including termination codons and 
 <italic>attB</italic> recombination sequences, with optimization of codon usage to reduce GC content and optimize expression in human and insect cells. A start codon was added to 
 <italic>NSP2â€“16</italic> to allow independent transcription and translation, as the endogenous products are derived from 
 <italic>ORF1AB</italic> by post-translational processing. 
 <italic>ORF9Bwu</italic>, an alternative ORF within the 
 <italic>N</italic> gene from SARS-COV-2 (
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Wu 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2020
 </xref>), was subsequently amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the viral 
 <italic>N</italic> gene with primers listed in Table S1.
