<p>Although our collection facilitates tagging of SARS-CoV-2 proteins for various functional studies, certain applications require removal of tags at some stage, for example, after protein purification. Fusion proteins can potentially interfere with the yield, structure, and function of purified proteins, such as during large scale production and crystallography studies (

 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Carrington and Dougherty 1988</xref>). The TEV sequence is one of the best characterized and widely used endoproteolytic reagents due to its stringent sequence specificity, ease of production, and ability to tolerate a variety of residues at the P1â€™ position of its recognition site (

We note that our clones are not expression vectors in and of themselves, and we have not yet assessed the expression of any of our clones after moving to a Gateway Destination expression vector. However, we note that our Gateway-compatible collection allows users the flexibility to conveniently move any of the SARS-CoV-2 ORFs into any Gateway Destination expression vector with any preferred N-terminal or C-terminal fusion.
