 <italic>NSP11</italic> was omitted due to the incompatibility of its 36 base pair length with the Gateway cloning system (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Cheo

 </xref>). All 28 of these CDS regions are available as clones with and without termination codons. The ‘no-stop’ collection was further extended to include six clones encoding different cleaved products of the spike (S) protein — “S-fragment” 1–6. We also included two CDS variants with in-frame deletions (“S-24nt” and “E-27nt”), one truncated CDS variant (“ORF8B-truncated”), that were each detected by recent viral transcriptome mapping efforts (
