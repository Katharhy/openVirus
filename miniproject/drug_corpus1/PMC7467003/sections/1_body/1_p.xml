<p>Shortly after the outbreak, the complete genome of two SARS-CoV-2 strains were published (

 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Wu 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2020

 <italic>et al.</italic> identified 12 viral open reading frames (ORFs), including one encoding ORF1AB, a large polyprotein which is post-translationally processed into 16 proteins (

 <italic>et al.</italic> discovered two additional viral ORFs (
 <italic>ORF9Bwu</italic> and 
 <italic>ORF10wu</italic>) with unclear functions (

The Gateway system offers efficient and high-throughput transfer of the viral coding sequences (CDSs) into a large selection of Gateway-compatible destination vectors used for protein expression in many biological systems,

 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, insect, or mammalian cells (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2000
 </xref>). Broad availability of a collection of SARS-CoV-2 CDSs has the potential to enable many downstream biochemical and structural studies and thus a better understanding of processes within the viral life cycle, including scalable assays for screening drug candidates that could potentially disrupt these processes.
