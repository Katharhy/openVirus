<p id="p0015">Aside from the tissue injuries that are caused by COVID-19, such as lung and kidney injury, the severity of the disease and the high mortality rates in COVID-19 patients are associated with underlying comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Remarkably, there is a bidirectional relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes 
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. On the one hand, diabetes is associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection 
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Diabetes was found to be one of the prevalent cardiovascular metabolic comorbidities with COVID-19, with a 9.7% incidence (95% confidence interval (CI), 6.9%–12.5%) of diabetes among 1527 COVID-19 patients in a Chinese meta-analysis 
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. At the same time, it was found that patients with diabetes had a two-fold increase in the risk of severe COVID-19 
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. On the other hand, severe bacterial 
 <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and viral respiratory tract infections 
 <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, including SARS-CoV-2 
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, can induce new-onset diabetes. Although the pathophysiological mechanisms are still not clearly understood, some researchers have proposed that SARS-CoV may damage islets and cause acute insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 
 <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Whether there is a link between the development of diabetes and immunization with some types of vaccines—especially inactivated and live attenuated vaccines, which contain the most components of the “killed” virus—remains an issue and requires further study. Therefore, in order to assess and monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines, high-quality clinical vaccine safety studies should be conducted, and more epidemiologic studies on vaccinations and the risk of diabetes are needed.
