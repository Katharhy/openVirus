<p id="p0020">COVID-19 vaccines are most commonly evaluated based on their capability of generating binding and neutralizing antibodies. However, a range of vaccine evaluation methods and models exist, making it difficult to compare the efficacy of different vaccines. In addition to humoral immunity, specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are associated with accelerated clearance of virus and recovery from infection. Previously reported studies on humoral and cellular immunity in recovered patients showed that both B and T cells participate in immune-mediated protection from viral infection, which indicated that an effective viral clearance needs collaborative humoral and cellular immune responses
