<p id="p0030">In addition, local mucosal immunity is critical for protection against respiratory viral diseases in most cases, such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus

 <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The delivery route of the vaccine is very important for the induction of local mucosal immunity. Studies on a live attenuated influenza vaccine found that intranasal delivery of vaccination was more efficient in inducing mucosal antibodies in comparison with intramuscular delivery. Since SARS-CoV-2 mostly invades the human body through the respiratory system, mucosal immunity could play a potentially important antiviral role. Our research team found that the mucosal vaccination of the Ad5-vectored COVID-19 vaccine showed better protective efficacy than intramuscular vaccination in the upper respiratory tract in mice and ferrets with SARS-CoV-2 challenge 
 <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Although the effects of cellular immunity or mucosal immunity have not been quantitatively measured, and their role in establishing effective protection against COVID-19 has not been evaluated, we believe that a candidate vaccine that can elicit multiple immune responses, including mucosal immunity and cellular immunity, may provide better protection against COVID-19 than vaccines that only generate humoral immunity. This needs to be investigated in future studies.
