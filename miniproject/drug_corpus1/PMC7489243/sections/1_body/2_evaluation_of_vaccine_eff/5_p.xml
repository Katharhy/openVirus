In addition, underlying diseases that are common in the elderly are often considered to be contraindications to vaccination, particularly for live vaccines or viral-vectored vaccines; therefore, the use of vaccines for the elderly requires special consideration. Most vaccines that are evaluated in early-phase clinical trials are tested in healthy individuals; however, an immunization regimen that works well in a healthy population may not be suitable or good enough for the elderly or for those with underlying diseases. Using a higher dosage, or giving an additional dose, has often been considered in order to enhance the immune responses of the elderly; examples include hepatitis B vaccines and influenza vaccines
