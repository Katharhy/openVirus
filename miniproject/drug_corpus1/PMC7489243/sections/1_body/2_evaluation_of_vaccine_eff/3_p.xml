<p id="p0025">In a human challenge trials (HCTs) of an oral influenza vaccine using adenovirus as a carrier, the levels of binding antibody and neutralizing antibody of the adenovirus-vectored influenza vaccine were lower than those of an inactivated vaccine, while the T-cell response and IgA level of the adenovirus-vectored influenza vaccine were remarkably higher than those of the inactivated vaccine. The protection rate of the adenovirus-vectored influenza vaccine was found to be significantly higher than that of the inactivated vaccine. This result illustrates that the protective efficacy of a vaccine is not fully correlated with its level of neutralizing antibody, and that the cellular immune and IgA responses generated by an adenovirus-vectored influenza vaccine play important roles in preventing influenza virus infection
