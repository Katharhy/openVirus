<p id="p0010">There are over 160 candidate vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 under development worldwide 
 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>; among these, around 29 candidate vaccines have been tested in clinical trials, including six viral-vector-based vaccines, six messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, four DNA vaccines, eight recombinant-protein-based vaccines, and five inactivated-virus vaccines. The initial findings of the first human trial for a potential vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 have been published 
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of 
 <italic>The Lancet</italic>, shared this progress via social media, saying that the world’s first clinical trial of the COVID-19 vaccine shows that the vaccine is safe, well-tolerated, and can elicit a rapid immunity reaction. Horton stated, “These results represent an important milestone.” A phase 2 trial of this adenovirus type-5 (Ad5)-vectored COVID-19 vaccine was conducted in Wuhan, China. A total of 508 eligible participants aged 18–83 years were randomly assigned to vaccine or placebo. The results showed that the Ad5-vectored COVID-19 vaccine is safe and induced significant humoral and cellular immune responses after a single immunization 
 <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Another adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccine—a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) whose development was led by the University of Oxford—published its phase 1/2 clinical trial results 
 <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine presented an acceptable safety profile and stimulated both humoral and cellular immune responses against COVID-19. Two mRNA vaccines, mRNA-1273 and BNT162b1, also induced both humoral and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 in participants

 <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. An inactivated COVID-19 vaccine caused humoral immunogenicity after two doses, whereas the cellular immune response was not determined in this clinical study 
 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Nevertheless, despite the world’s desperate need for a protective vaccine to help contain the epidemic, great challenges still remain in the development of such a vaccine.
