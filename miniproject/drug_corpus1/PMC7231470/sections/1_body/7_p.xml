<p>One prerequisite for inter-species transmission of a virus is its interaction with the receptor of different hosts. The identification of human ACE2 as the cellular receptor for HCoV-19 sheds light on the viral inter-species transmission route (

Given the importance of ACE2 and other unknown co-receptor(s) in the infection process, it is also crucial to analyze the expression patterns and levels of ACE2 and other co-receptor(s) in mediating the HCoV-19 infection, and by extension, determining the mediating host animals. This kind of molecular characterization of ACE2 and other potential receptors of HCoV-19 in different animals at the lab would provide helpful information regarding the prediction of genetic susceptibility to HCoV-19 and direct the reservoir tracing of the virus in nature.
