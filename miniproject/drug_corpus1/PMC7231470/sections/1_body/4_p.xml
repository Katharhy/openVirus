<p>There are several recent studies showing that Malayan pangolin (
 <italic>Manis javanica</italic>) as a potential natural reservoir or intermediate host of HCoV-19 (

 <xref rid="bZhang2020a" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020a</xref>). In one study, 
 <xref rid="bLam2020" ref-type="bibr">Lam et al. (2020)</xref> performed metagenomic sequencing of lung, intestine and blood samples from the Malayan pangolins and identified viral sequences that belong to two sub-lineages of HCoV-19 related coronaviruses. In particular, five critical residues on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the pangolin virus, playing important roles for human receptor binding, are identical to HCoV-19 (

 <xref rid="bLiu2019" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2019</xref>) also suggested a probable pangolin origin of HCoV-19 (
 <xref rid="bZhang2020a" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020a</xref>). The isolation and comprehensive characterization of a HCoV-19 related coronavirus (Pangolin-CoV) in the pangolins has further implicated the Malayan pangolin as a possible intermediate host for HCoV-19 (
 <xref rid="bXiao2020" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2020</xref>), and HCoV-19 might have originated from possible recombination between the reported Bat-CoV-RaTG13-like virus (
 <xref rid="bZhou2020a" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020a</xref>) and this Pangolin-CoV-like virus (
 <xref rid="bXiao2020" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2020</xref>). Malayan pangolins are found in nature throughout Southeast Asia (including Laos PDR, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, and Indonesia), but not known to be native in China, where HCoV-19 was first reported (

 <xref rid="bZhu2020" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>). Due to its importance as a food source and a traditional Chinese medicine, Malayan pangolins are illegally smuggled in live from Southeast Asia to China to be sold in live animal markets or as dried scales to be sold in Chinese Medicine store. Furthermore, 
 <italic>R. affinis</italic> and 
 <italic>R. malaynus</italic>, as suspected natural reservoir of HCoV-19 (
 <xref rid="bZhou2020a" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020a</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bZhou2020b" ref-type="bibr">2020b</xref>), are also distributed widely in South and Southeast Asia. It remains to be seen whether bats and Malayan pangolins (or any other unknown animal species at the moment) played a role in the generation of HCoV-19 via recombination (

 <xref rid="bAndersen2020" ref-type="bibr">Andersen et al. (2020)</xref> put forward several theories regarding the origins of the HCoV-19 and highlighted the potential role of natural selection in animal host before the zoonotic transfer, natural selection in humans after the animal-to-human transfer, and adaptation during sequential passages. The theories will help uncover the origins of HCoV-19, but direct scientific evidence is needed.
