<p>The investigative work performed on the origins of MERS-CoV also suggests that bats are likely the natural reservoirs of this pathogen (

 <italic>Pipistrellus</italic> sp.) (

 <xref rid="bHemida2014" ref-type="bibr">Hemida et al., 2014</xref>). Multiple studies have shown that there is high seroprevalence of MERS-CoV specific antibodies in dromedary camels (
 <italic>Camelus dromedarius</italic>) from Egypt, Oman and other locations in the Middle East, but that sheep, goats, cattle, and other camelids were seronegative (
 <xref rid="bOmrani2015" ref-type="bibr">Omrani et al., 2015</xref>). Epidemiological work also showed that a majority of confirmed MERS patients had close contact history with dromedary camels, or products derived from these animals, such as camel meat and milk (
 <xref rid="bHemida2017" ref-type="bibr">Hemida et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, the MERS-CoV sequences isolated from patients and close-contact dromedary camels were highly similar, or in some cases, 100% identical (
 <xref rid="bAzhar2014" ref-type="bibr">Azhar et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the evidence supports that while camels serve as the principal source of MERS-CoV transmission to humans, bats may be again the natural reservoir of this pathogen. Additionally, some alpacas (
 <italic>Vicugna pacos</italic>) in the endemic region were also seropositive for MERS-CoV, suggesting this animal may be another source for MERS-CoVs (
 <xref rid="bReusken2016" ref-type="bibr">Reusken et al., 2016</xref>). Based on the available evidence, it seems that the animal-to-human transmissions of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are clear, and sets a good paradigm for tracing the origins of HCoV-19.
