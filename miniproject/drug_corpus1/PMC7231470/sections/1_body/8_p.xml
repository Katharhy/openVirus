<p>It is very important to elucidate the potential sources of HCoV-19 in wild animals and prevent viral resurgence in countries with excellent management of the pandemic. In addition, tracing the susceptible animals and surveillance of HCoV-19-related viruses would be of important significance for preventing similar emerging viruses in the future. Findings from past outbreaks and available studies did have direct impact on subsequent public health policy. After reports on the zoonotic origins of SARS-CoV surfaced (

 <xref rid="bStadler2003" ref-type="bibr">Stadler et al., 2003</xref>), Chinese authorities ordered the slaughter of over 10 000 animals due to be sold in live animal markets, including civets, raccoon dogs, and ferret badgers, and the USA instituted a trade embargo on civet cats (https://www.cdc.gov/sars/about/civet-embargo.html). After dromedary camels were implicated in the spread of MERS-CoV, the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) announced that positive real-time PCR results for MERS-CoV or isolation of the pathogen from dromedary camels is an OIE-notifiable event to mitigate the health risk of the virus to humans, and to prevent international spread. Cooking of camel meat and pasteurization of camel milk before consumption was promoted (

After the discovery that pangolins harbour HCoV-19 related coronaviruses, Chinese authorities put a ban on the trade and sales for wild animals. At present, we are still uncertain of the final consequence of HCoV-19 on wild animal management, and how this will shape our future life and animal conservation and usage.
