<p>The wild animals (bats and pangolins) suspected to be carrying the HCoV-19-like coronaviruses are known to be abundant in Southeast Asia, which is one of the worldâ€™s most biodiverse regions, with over 2 000 new species described between 1997 and 2014 alone, and with likely many new species yet to be discovered (
 <xref rid="bHughes2017" ref-type="bibr">Hughes, 2017</xref>). There is a need to prioritize sampling of animals that may carry SARS-like or HCoV-19-like coronaviruses in this region. Regular and routine investigations into wet markets selling wild exotic animals for consumption is urgently needed, as these animals are often kept in crowded, unsanitary conditions with other species, which may promote viral reassortment and interspecies transmission. On the other hand, to conduct a comprehensive virome screening for wild animals and to establish an archive dataset for all potential viruses across the world may be helpful for future rapid tracing the origins of unknown virus outbreak.
