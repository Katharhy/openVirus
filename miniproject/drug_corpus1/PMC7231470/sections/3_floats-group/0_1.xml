 <abstract abstract-type="note">
  <p>A: Putative zoonotic origin, transmission and infection of HCoV-19 in human and animals. Domestic animals (pigs, chickens and ducks) and laboratory mice cannot be infected (as marked by an X). Other domestic animals, including the MERS-CoV intermediate host dromedary camel, have unknown susceptibility to HCoV-19 and are marked with a question mark. Ferrets, monkeys, tigers, cats and dogs can be infected with HCoV-19. B: Schematic relationship of different mammals and birds based on the phylogenetic tree of the ACE2 protein sequences.</p>
