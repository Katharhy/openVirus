<p id="p0060">Many patients undergoing elective orthopedic procedures, especially hip and knee arthroplasty, suffer from chronic pain and dysfunction. At this time, the United States Surgeon General has recommended suspending elective procedures (including hip and knee arthroplasties) as they are not life-saving procedures and to preserve limited resources. Most hospitals across the nation have followed suit. In addition, the President of the United States has declared a national state of emergency for the coronavirus, and he has suggested each state consider strict quarantine regulations throughout the country.</p>
