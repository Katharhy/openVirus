<p id="p0080">In this time of uncertainty, it is important that we maintain communication with patients through telehealth to help them manage the physical, psychological, spiritual, or economic impacts of this pandemic. Telehealth visits are a good way to keep track of our patients while maintaining social distancing. Patients and physicians alike should practice patience as many people have been impacted by the disruption in their care. Our system is resilient, and elective surgeries will resume when safe and resources are available. During this pandemic, recall the Hippocratic Oath and practice in the best interest of the patient by first doing no harm.</p>
