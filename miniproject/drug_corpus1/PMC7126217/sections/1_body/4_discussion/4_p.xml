<p id="p0255">For a deeper understanding of the mechanism of the antiviral action, the effect of epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin on hemagglutinin and neuraminidase was evaluated by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay and neuraminidase inhibition (NA) assay. Influenza virus is an enveloped RNA virus with hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) embedded in the lipid envelope. Viral adsorption to cells is the initial step of influenza infection, which is performed via the binding between sialic acid on the cell surface and hemagglutinin of the virus (

Results of HAI assay showed that exposure to epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin or goitrin did not affect the hemagglutinin activity of H1N1 virus. The components were indicated not to interfere with the binding of sialic acid and hemagglutinin. On the other hand, for the release of the influenza virus from the cell, NA functions as an enzyme cleaving sialic acid groups from the host glycoproteins (

The components were indicated not able to prevent budding of progeny virus from the cell membrane. Therefore, it is implied that epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin play their antiviral activity by acting as virus neutralizers, which associate with some component on the viral envelope without interfering with viral adsorption or budding.
