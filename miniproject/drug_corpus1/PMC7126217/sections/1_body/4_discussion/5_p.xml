<p id="p0260">Based on the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values obtained from CPE inhibition assay, the activity of the compounds 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> was in the order of progoitrin = goitrin &gt; epigoitrin &gt; epiprogoitrin. Comprehensive comparison of the minimum concentrations exhibiting 100% inhibition and the inhibition rate at a minimum investigated concentration of 0.625 mg/mL obtained from HA assay on embryonated eggs, the activity of the compounds 
 <italic>in ovo</italic> was in the similar order of progoitrin &gt; goitrin &gt; epigoitrin &gt; epiprogoitrin. When comparing the potency of the antiviral activity between the monomers, no remarkable difference was found between the precursor and the myrosinase-derived product (epiprogoitrin vs. epigoitrin and progoitrin vs. goitrin). On the contrary, considerable discrepancy was observed between the enantiomers (epiprogoitrin vs. progoitrin and epigoitrin vs. goitrin). The gap between the antiviral potency of progoitrin and epiprogoitrin was larger than that between goitrin and epigoitrin. S-enantiomers (progoitrin and goitrin) claimed higher activity than R-enantiomers (epiprogoitrin and epigoitrin). It is implied that the heteroaromatic chain/ring is the main functional group of the 
 <italic>Isatidis Radix</italic> derived glucosinolates isomers and their breakdown products. And cyclization of the heteroaromatic chain to the oxazoline ring has no obvious influence on the function. The stereogenic center (chiral carbon atom) in the heteroaromatic chain of epiprogoitrin and progoitrin and in the oxazoline ring of epigoitrin and goitrin is an important structural feature from both chemical and biological points of view. Lucky enough, all the components were found to be safe both to the cells and the embryos.
