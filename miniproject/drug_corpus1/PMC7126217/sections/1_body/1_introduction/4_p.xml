<p id="p0145">In previous study of the authors, the so-called ‘epigoitrin’ used in former reports (

 <sub>18</sub> column. Consequently, the assay marker for 
 <italic>Isatidis Radix</italic> was changed to (R, S)-goitrin in 2010 and 2015 editions of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. In addition, (R, S)-goitrin was first resolved by the authors (
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Nie et al., 2010</xref>) using normal phase liquid chromatography (NPLC). Later, novel supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods were developed for high-throughput chiral separation and stereospecific assay, respectively (

 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). On the other hand, epigoitrin and goitrin were verified as breakdown products of their glucosinolate prototypes, epiprogoitrin ((R)-hydroxy-3-butenylglucosinolate) and progoitrin ((S)-hydroxy-3-butenylglucosinolate), on the effect of myrosinase (

 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2011</xref>). As well as being isomers, pure enantiomeric forms of epiprogoitrin and progoitrin were extracted and resolved by the authors from 
 <italic>Isatidis Radix</italic>. In spite of the chemical structures and the biotransformation of the glucosinolates and their breakdown products are illuminated (
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2011</xref>), the antiviral activity of the monomers and their mode of action remain elusive.
