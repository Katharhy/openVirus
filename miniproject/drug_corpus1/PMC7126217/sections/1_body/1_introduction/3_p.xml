<p id="p0140">Ethnic medicines are valuable heritage and commercially important resources in the prevention and treatment of viral infectious diseases, a growing number of which are accumulating evidence of experimental and/or clinical efficacy (

 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Lia et al., 2019</xref>). Among them, 
 <italic>Isatidis Radix</italic> (“Ban-Lan-Gen” in Chinese, the sun-dried root of 
 <italic>Isatis indigotica</italic> Fortune ex Lindl.) is well-known for its antiviral activity. In ethnic medical practice, 
 <italic>Isatidis Radix</italic> has been prescribed for treating fever, pestilence, sore throat, seasonal toxin, papule caused by warm toxin, macula, scarlatina, mumps, swelling abscess, erysipelas and erysipelas facialis (
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Chinese Pharmacopoeia Commission, 2015</xref>). As officially approved medicinal material and products in China, 
 <italic>Isatidis Radix</italic> and its formulations have been used as the major herbal remedies in prevention and treatment against a wide range of viral infections, such as seasonal epidemics, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and H1N1 flu outbreaks in 2009 (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Deng et al., 2013</xref>). Regardless of the various subtypes of viruses and their rapid mutations, 
 <italic>Isatidis Radix</italic> was found to be effective in clinic against infections caused by influenza viruses with different strains and subtypes (
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Ke et al., 2012</xref>). Notwithstanding the anti-influenza efficacy of 
 <italic>Isatidis Radix</italic> and its preparations is well acknowledged, their active constituents and pharmacological actions have not been elucidated. So far, a few antiviral components have been identified in 
 <italic>Isatidis Radix</italic>, including (3H)-quinazolinone (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2013</xref>), glycoprotein (
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Yamada, 1999</xref>), epigoitrin, 2,4(1H, 3H)-quinazolinedione (
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2005</xref>), indirubin (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Mak et al., 2004</xref>), fructopyrano-(1 → 4)-glucopyranose (
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), clemastanin B (
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2013</xref>), lariciresinol-4-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2015</xref>), polysaccharides (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2017</xref>), isatithioetherin B and isatithioetherin D (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). Among these, the antiviral monomer epigoitrin has received much attention and it was chosen as the marker of antiviral efficacy in 
 <italic>Isatidis Radix</italic> when drafting the 2010 edition of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia.
