 <italic>Isatidis Radix</italic> (“Ban-Lan-Gen” in Chinese and “
 <italic>Isatidis</italic> root” in English) is the sun-dried root of 
 <italic>Isatis indigotica</italic> Fortune ex Lindl. The scientific name of the plant has been checked with

The plant material, grown in good agricultural practice (GAP) base in Yutian, He-Bei Province, was obtained from Beijing Tongrentang Co., Ltd. The origin was authenticated by Associate Professor Shuai Kang, Curator of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Herbarium of National Institutes for Food and Drug Control, using macroscopic and microscopic analysis according to the Chinese pharmacopoeia (
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Chinese Pharmacopoeia Commission, 2015</xref>). For future reference, its specimen (No. B-1) was deposited at the Traditional Chinese Medicine Herbarium, National Institutes of Food and Drug Control (Beijing, PR China). Epiprogoitrin and progoitrin were extracted and isolated form 
 <italic>Isatidis Radix</italic> based on a similar strategy from a previous report (
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2011</xref>). First, the pulverized 
 <italic>Isatidis Radix</italic> was extracted with methanol; then the extraction was deproteinized with ammonium acetate and purified with granular activated carbon to obtain the crude extracts of glucosinolates; and, finally, epiprogoitrin and progoitrin were separated from the crude extracts by preparative ion-pair chromatography. Epigoitrin and goitrin were separated from (R, S)-goitrin reference standard (National Institutes for Food and Drug Control, Lot No. 111753–201706) by SFC chiral resolution on a Chiralpak IC column with acetonitrile and carbon dioxide as the mobile phase (

 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR (Bruker DRX-500), MS (Waters SYNAPT G2) and optical rotation (Rudolph Autopol IV). The purities of the prepared compounds were all determined to be &gt;98% by HPLC (
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2011</xref>) and chiral SFC (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Nie et al., 2016</xref>) methods. Contents of epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin in the plant material were determined to be 0.19%, 0.10%, 0.10% and 0.05% respectively by HPLC methods (
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Nie et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2011</xref>). Epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin were dissolved in 1 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted with sodium chloride injection to get test solutions at concentrations. The solutions were kept at 4 °C in a sterilized container.
