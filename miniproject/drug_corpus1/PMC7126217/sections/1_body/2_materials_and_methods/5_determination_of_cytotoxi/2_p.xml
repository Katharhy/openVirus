<p id="p0170">Cytotoxic effect of epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin was examined by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) method. MDCK cells were cultured in a 96-well plate (3 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/well) for 24 h. The culture supernatant was replaced with solutions containing each of the four components at various concentrations (10
 <sup>−3</sup>-10
 <sup>−7</sup> mol/L). Six duplicates were used for each concentration. After incubation for 72 h, the culture supernatant was discarded, and 190 μL of DMEM and 10 μL of CCK8 were added to each well. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. The fluorescence intensity was recorded by a microplate spectrophotometer (Gemini EM, Molecular Device, USA) at 450 nm. The cell survival rate was calculated, representing the cell viability.
