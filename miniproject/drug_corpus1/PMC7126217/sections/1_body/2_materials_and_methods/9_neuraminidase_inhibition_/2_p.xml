<p id="p0210">To evaluate the inhibition effect of epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin on neuraminidase, the NA inhibition assay was performed in a 96-well microplate reader using the Neuraminidase Inhibitors Screen Kit. For each well, 70 μL of the reaction buffer, 10 μL of NA and 10 μL of sample solution were added. The reaction mixture was vibrated for 1 min and incubated at 37 °C for 2 min for full interaction. Then 10 μL of the fluorescent substrate was added and the entire mixture was vibrated for 1 min and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin were diluted with water to prepare sample solution at different concentrations (0.625, 1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg/mL). Peramivir at different concentrations (0.375, 0.75, 1.5 and 3 mg/mL) were used as the positive control and water was used as the negative control. Triplicates were used for each dilution ratio. The fluorescence was recorded by a microplate spectrophotometer (Gemini EM, Molecular Device, USA) and the excitation wavelength and the emission wavelength were set at 322 nm and 450 nm, respectively. The inhibition rate (%) was calculated as follows: NA inhibitory activity (%) = [1 – (F
 <sub>s</sub> –F
 <sub>0</sub>)/(F
 <sub>m</sub>–F
 <sub>0</sub>)] × 100%, where F
 <sub>s</sub> is the fluorescence intensity of the sample, F
 <sub>0</sub> is the absorbance of the background, and F
 <sub>m</sub> is the absorbance of the negative control.
