<p id="p0180">The 10 day embryonated eggs were inoculated with influenza virus strain A/California/7/2009 (H1N1). The 50% egg infective dose (EID
 <sub>50</sub>) calculated using the Reed-Muench method (

 <italic>in ovo</italic> evaluation was performed using three different protocols. First, the eggs were pre-treated with 0.2 mL of sample solution and incubated at 35 °C for 2 h before administration of 0.1 mL of virus (50 EID
 <sub>50</sub>). Second, the eggs were inoculated with 0.1 mL of virus (50 EID
 <sub>50</sub>) at 35 °C for 2 h before administration of 0.2 mL of sample solution. Third, 0.1 mL of virus (50 EID
 <sub>50</sub>) and 0.2 mL of sample solution were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Then the mixture was administered to the eggs and incubated at 35 °C for 2 h. Before harvesting, all the eggs were stored at 35 °C for 50 h to facilitate the harvest procedure. The eggs were decapped and the allantoic membrane was carefully moved to sides to pipette out the upper allantoic fluid. After harvesting, the allantoic fluid was subjected to hemagglutination (HA) test.
