  <p>Inhibitory effect of epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin on influenza virus A (H1N1) in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). 100 μL of sample solutions at different concentrations were mixed with 100 μL of virus at 100 TCID
   <sub>50</sub>. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the mixtures were added to the cells. After incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO
   <sub>2</sub> for 72 h, the antiviral activity was investigated by cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay and Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) method.
