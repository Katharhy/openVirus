 </sup> Remdesivir is a nucleotide prodrug that inhibits viral RNA replication. The prodrug needs to be activated in the cell into a nucleoside triphosphate which then serves as an alternative substrate for the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The incorporation of the nucleoside triphosphate in the growing viral RNA chain will result in chain termination and therefore halt viral RNA replication. Despite potent efficacy in Ebola virus animal models, remdesivir was less efficacious in a clinical trial conducted in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
