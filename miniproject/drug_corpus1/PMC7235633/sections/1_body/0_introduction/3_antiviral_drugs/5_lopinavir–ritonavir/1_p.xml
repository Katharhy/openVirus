<p>Lopinavir is an HIV protease inhibitor that is usually combined with ritonavir to increase its half-life via cytochrome P450 inhibition. Whether HIV protease inhibitors might also inhibit the coronavirus protease remains a question, because the HIV protease belongs to a different protease family from the two coronavirus proteases (aspartic vs. cysteine protease family, respectively).

 </sup> Furthermore, HIV protease inhibitors were specifically designed to fit in a certain pocket of the HIV protease dimer, but this pocket is not present in coronavirus proteases. Antiviral activity of LPV/r against SARS-CoV-1 was reported in cell culture,

 </sup> In common marmosets infected with MERS-CoV, LPV/r was able to improve the clinical outcome and reduce viral loads in the lungs.

 </sup> However, in a MERS-CoV mouse model, the prophylactic use of LPV/r in combination with interferon-beta only slightly reduced the viral loads in the lungs without impacting other disease parameters.

 </sup> Therapeutic treatment of LPV/r with interferon-beta improved the pulmonary function but did not reduce virus replication or severe lung pathology. In SARS-CoV-1-infected patients, results of the treatment with LPV/r were inconclusive.

 </sup> In addition, two case reports describing MERS patients receiving LPV/r in combination with ribavirin and interferon-alpha reported conflicting results.

 </sup> The preclinical and clinical evidence for the use of LPV/r in COVID-19 patients is thus modest.
