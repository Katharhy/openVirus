<p>Unfortunately, no antiviral drug has yet been approved to treat human coronaviruses. As a specific, highly potent antiviral drug for SARS-CoV-2 will take years to develop and to evaluate in clinical studies, the main focus for COVID-19 treatment is now on the repurposing of drugs that have been approved for other diseases. Such drugs have known safety profiles and drug production strategies have been implemented. Unapproved drugs that showed antiviral activity in animal models for SARS-CoV-1 and/or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), two other coronaviruses causing severe disease, are currently also considered as treatment options. However, repurposed drugs cannot be expected to be highly potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2, as these were not developed specifically against this particular virus.</p>
