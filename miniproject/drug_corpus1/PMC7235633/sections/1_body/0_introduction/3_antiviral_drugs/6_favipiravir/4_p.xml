<p>In an open-label, randomised study, 116 COVID-19 pneumonia patients received favipiravir in combination with conventional therapy, whereas 120 patients received arbidol in combination with conventional therapy. Arbidol is an antiviral drug with activity against influenza virus infection that is approved in Russia and China.

 </sup> The primary outcome of this study was the clinical recovery rate at day 7 after start of treatment, which was defined as recovery of fever, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and cough relief for at least 72 hours. A non-peer-reviewed report on this study describes that in COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms (fever and respiratory symptoms without difficulties in breathing), the clinical recovery rate at day 7 was higher in the favipiravir-treated group when compared to the arbidol-treated group (71.4% vs. 55.9%). Furthermore, the time of cough relief and fever reduction by favipiravir was significantly shorter than that by arbidol. However, for COVID-19 patients with hypertension and/or diabetes, the clinical recovery rate was not significantly different between both groups (54.8% vs. 51.4%). The same picture was observed for critically ill COVID-19 patients. These data suggest that favipiravir might be useful for patients with mild symptoms, but not for severely ill patients.
