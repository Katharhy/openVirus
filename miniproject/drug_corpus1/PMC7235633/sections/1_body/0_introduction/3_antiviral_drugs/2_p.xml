 </sup> Most of these agents have demonstrated antiviral activity in cell culture against coronaviruses. In addition, the World Health Organization (WHO) very recently announced the launch of a large global trial, called SOLIDARITY. This trial will include thousands of patients of different countries and will evaluate the efficacy of what WHO finds the four most promising therapies at this time: the malaria drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine; remdesivir, an experimental antiviral drug; LPV/r, an HIV drug combination; and LPV/r plus interferon-beta, an immunomodulator.
