<p>In a subgroup of COVID-19 patients, a cytokine profile is observed that is similar to the profile in macrophage activation syndrome (MAS).

 </sup> A retrospective analysis in China indicated IL-6 and ferritin as predictors for COVID-19-related mortality, suggesting that hyperinflammation increases the risk of mortality.

 </sup> Anti-cytokine therapies could thus be useful to treat this group of COVID-19 patients that experience such a cytokine-storm syndrome. It must be noted, however, that the selective inhibition of specific cytokines during acute respiratory distress syndrome or sepsis might involve risks, such as reactivation of viral infections and an increased sensitivity for bacterial infections.
