<p>Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) plays a critical role in the defence against viruses and maintaining a proper function of the immune system. GM-CSF might thus be one of the key cytokines involved in the overreacted inflammatory response observed in COVID-19 pneumonia. A yeast-derived version of GM-CSF, Leukine (sargramostim, rhu-GM-CSF), has been approved for use in five clinical indications; the safety profile of this drug is therefore well known. The efficacy of Leukine for the treatment of COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure will be evaluated in a clinical study in Belgium (SARPAC trial). Leukine will be administered in a nebulised form for direct inhalation or through intravenous administration for patients that are already on a respirator.</p>
