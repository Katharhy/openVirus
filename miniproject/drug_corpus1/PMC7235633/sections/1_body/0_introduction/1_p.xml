<p>Approximately 15% of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients will develop severe lung disease. It is thought that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) results in an acute respiratory infection that is cleared in most cases by the immune system after 7 to 14 days.

 </sup> The severe lung pathology that follows in a subset of patients after this acute viral stage is characterised by systemic inflammation reactions. The cytokine storm in these patients seems to be associated with disease severity.

 </sup> Both antiviral agents and immunomodulating drugs might therefore have their place in managing the disease in these patients. Drugs that slow down the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and/or decrease disease symptoms may save the lives of (very) ill patients. In addition, it could reduce the time that is being spent in intensive care units and could thus decrease the pressure on these units by freeing hospital beds. Furthermore, the drugs could be used as a prophylaxis to protect healthcare workers.
