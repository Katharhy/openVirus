<p>Several clinical trials with COVID-19 patients are evaluating repurposed drugs, but there is no uniformity in timing, duration of treatment and study endpoints. In the currently registered clinical trials, the primary outcome was clinical in 66% of the studies, virological in 23%, radiological in 8% or immunological in 3%.

 </sup> As the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is not yet well understood and associations between clinical status and viral clearance, radiological or immunological evaluations are unclear, the use of clinical outcomes should be encouraged. In the SOLIDARITY trial launched by the WHO, only simple outcomes will be measured that are currently relevant for public health: the day the patient left the hospital or died, the duration of the hospital stay, and whether the patient required oxygen or ventilation.
