<p>In this pandemic context, it is essential that clinicians have rapid access to the information from clinical trials. Still, it is important that clinical trials and the reports on their results are of high quality, as these results will guide clinicians in their decision on which drug to use, the dosing and duration of the treatment, and which patients to include and exclude. Clinical trials should thus be designed with care, because robust results are essential. In addition, transparent and complete reporting on these clinical trials is needed to allow independent assessment of the potential benefit for COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, the selection of therapies to be evaluated in clinical studies needs to be based on clear scientific in vitro and preclinical in vivo evidence. We may expect that in the next few weeks carefully performed trials will be reported that will guide doctors around the world to give the best care (both in terms of reducing viral replication and mitigating hyperinflammation) to COVID-19 patients.</p>
