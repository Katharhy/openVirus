<p id="p0050">There is increasing recognition that a state of impaired host immunity accompanied by a significant cell degeneration in secondary lymphoid tissues follows the initial hyperinflammatory phase of COVID-19. First, critically ill high-risk patients with COVID-19 often present with lymphocytopenia: A fall in the total lymphocyte number to 0.6 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>/mL is associated with a mortality rate of 75% [

Second, patients with COVID-19 have high levels of serum IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α and express increased levels of exhaustion markers PD-1 and T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 on the surface of their peripheral T cells, which in turn impair T-cell effector functions and prevent functional memory [
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Finally, compared with cases of pneumonia not caused by SARS-CoV-2, patients with COVID-19 have decreased B cell and Th counts but a comparable number of the main cytokine storm (CS) players including monocytes, neutrophils and natural killer cells [
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These latest data suggest that viral damage is direct rather than inflammatory driven and strongly supports the use of immune-activating drugs that have been little considered to date for fear of exacerbating the inflammatory reaction and causing a CS.
