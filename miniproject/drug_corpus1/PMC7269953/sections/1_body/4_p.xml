<p id="p0055">Among immune-activating drugs, ICIs have been recently tested beyond cancer treatment for their potential to restore immunocompetence in the context of sepsis and influenza infection. A recent phase Ib trial reported that in patients with systemic sepsis, the anti–PD-1 monoclonal antibody nivolumab can restore lymphocyte count and function with no concern on the CS, i.e. levels of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α are unaffected [

 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and as an additional finding, a lower overall rate of influenza among vaccinated patients when compared with rates of laboratory-confirmed influenza has been reported [
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Other data show that ICI-induced pneumonitis is a very rare phenomenon, with 2.5–5% with anti–PD-1/anti–PD-L1 single-agent therapy to 7–10% with dual checkpoint blockade, and most patients experienced clinically significant, new or worsening immune-related adverse events after the first 6 months of treatment [
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These data suggest that ICIs enhance T-cell response to viral antigens without triggering unintended immune consequences including the CS and autoimmunity.
