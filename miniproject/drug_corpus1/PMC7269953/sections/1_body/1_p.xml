<p id="p0040">Higher mortality has been linked to elderly subjects and those with comorbidities including pulmonary disease, cardiac disease, kidney disease, diabetes, hypertension and cancer [

 <italic>per se</italic> increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its complications or rather cancer-associated comorbidities and treatment remains to be clarified. A recent study showed that patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy or surgery in the past month have an increased risk of severe complications compared with those not receiving recent treatments [
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This risk seemed higher in the presence of additional chronic medical conditions, which is consistent with other recent reports [

 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Curiously, none of the patients in this study received anticancer immunotherapy including treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), which are extensively used to treat many cancers. Given the limited number of cases analysed, these findings could simply be due to chance; however, it also adds to other evidence suggesting that ICIs are protective rather than harmful in patients with COVID-19. While chemotherapies are indeed known to exert a systemic immunosuppression along with a myelosuppressive state by lowering the complete blood count and/or impairing the immune regulatory response even in the face of a normal blood test, this seems not to be the case for ICIs. On the contrary, they restore cellular immunocompetence [
