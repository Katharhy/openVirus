<p id="p0065">Regardless of the shortcomings reported in patients receiving single-agent tocilizumab, it is likely that more effective treatments targeting both overexuberant inflammation and exhausted T cells require the combination of two classes of agents because they work through in a different and complementary mechanism. PD-1 expression likely increases to prevent an uncontrolled inflammatory cascade [

This approach requires caution. Indeed, in the early phase of viral infection, the PD-1/PD-L1 axis is also involved in the physiological process of T-cell maturation, implying that PD-1 negatively regulates the terminal differentiation of naive CTLs into effector T cells. Thus, the blockade of the PD-1 pathway adjusts the strength and quality of cytotoxic cell attack to accelerate virus clearance with minimal collateral tissue damage [
