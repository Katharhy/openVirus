<p id="p0070">Most importantly, the CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell immunosurveillance of viruses is dependent on human leucocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) molecules that are expressed on the surface of all nucleated cells. Genetic differences in 
 <italic>HLA</italic> alleles have been recently recognised to confer differential viral susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Data validated in two independent cohorts of patients with cancer receiving ICIs revealed that heterozygous 
 <italic>HLA-I</italic> genotypes were associated with better survival than homozygosity for one or more 
 <italic>HLA-I</italic> genes, and treatment efficacy was diminished by loss of 
 <italic>HLA-I</italic> heterozygosity [
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These findings highlight that genetic variability in the immune system may affect susceptibility to (and severity of) SARS-CoV-2; therefore, strategies to boost immune responses at this stage are certainly important for individuals particularly vulnerable to COVID-19.
