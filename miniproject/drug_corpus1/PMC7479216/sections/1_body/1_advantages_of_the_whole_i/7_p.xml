<p>In spite of the valuable guidelines from the work of Jenner and Pasteur, who with much fewer resources, developed vaccines that controlled and eradicated smallpox that showed a 40% mortality rate (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) and rabies with 100% mortality rate (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>); and even with all the knowledge acquired since then, there is no urgent combined international effort to produce one unique vaccine. Instead, 6 months after the description of the first COVID-19 cases in China, 147 vaccines are reported to be in development all over the world and, only two of them contain the inactivated virus (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). All the other formulations include live attenuated, non-replicating or replicating viral vector, recombinant protein, peptide base, virus-like particle, and virus DNA and RNA. Most of these vaccines are focused on only one antigen of the Coronavirus, therefore, these formulations will certainly be less potent than a vaccine made up of multiple antigens contained in the whole pathogen.
