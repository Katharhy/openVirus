<p>If we use fixation of the structures of some of the isolates that cause the disease, then inactivate them and preserve their whole structures, the possible deleterious effect of the high mutagenicity detected in a few of the proteins of the virus (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) would be overcome by the strong immune response generated against the whole virus structure. Therefore, the mutagenicity should not be critical for the generation of protection, and would not damage the efficacy of the whole vaccine. Furthermore, it might be that the whole virus inactivated vaccine could even induce some cross protection against other Coronovirus agents of SARS, which hold conservative structures (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).
