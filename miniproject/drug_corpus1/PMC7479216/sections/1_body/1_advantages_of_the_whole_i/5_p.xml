<p>It is true that an impressive amount of data about the DNA sequencing of the virus has been gathered in a relatively short period of time and with that, the knowledge of its biological properties increased enormously (23,927 sequences in PUBMED) (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). However, for an urgent strategy, we could also take advantage of the lessons taught by the history of vaccinology in order to prevent the disease and save lives.
