<p>The most important advantage of whole inactivated vaccines is that, unlike the live or attenuated vaccines, they do not cause the disease (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In fact, inactivated vaccines preserve the intact structure of the antigens and their B-cell epitopes that enable them to interact with the antibody paratopes, and promote the synthesis of neutralizing antibodies. They can not only stimulate the humoral, but the cellular immune responses as well, in a manner similar to live viruses, since they preserve the virus structures during inactivation (

Cross-presentation of conserved epitopes to the cytotoxic T cells (CTL), through the major HLA class 1 histocompatibility system, in addition to the viral pathogen associated patterns (PAMPS), which use innate immune receptors such as Toll like receptor 7, can induce T cell mediated responses. In fact, in the late endosome of the infected APC three different events can occur: (1) viral degradation following the exogenous pattern and presentation to CD4 T cells via the MHC class II molecules, (2) cross presentation pathway to CD8 T cells via the MHC class I molecules, and (3) viral membrane fusion following the endogenous pathway. The above mentioned pathways along with the recognition of viral PAMPS, using PRRs such as TLR7, as well as production of cytokines such as IFN-1 can promote potent cellular mediated immune responses (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). However, in the case of Influenza vaccines for instance, the inactivated formulations may not always induce T cell responses as potent as the live-vaccines. In fact, the inactivated vaccine may even prevent or suppress the induction of cross-reactive CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cells (
