<p>Maybe the observed multiple individualistic efforts that have arisen are due to the lack of leadership from the developed nations, which have the highest capacity to produce vaccines. In the USA, for instance, the economic interest of the large vaccine industries in preventive vaccination has recently decreased. Conversely, they have started to invest in immunotherapies or drug treatments. In addition, in the USA there are not large Public Laboratories for production of the vaccines under a governmental request. Consequently, the governmental Public Health decisions are restricted by the interests of the private vaccine companies. In contrast, in some developing countries, where infectious diseases are often the most important causes of mortality, Public Laboratories can produce large amounts of vaccine doses without the need to make a profit, under the auspices of their Ministries of Health. This is the case of Instituto Butantan and Bio-Manguinhos in Brazil, Instituto Biológico de La Plata and the Administración Nacional de Laboratorios e Institutos de la Salud (ANLIS-Malbrán) in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and of the Serum Institute of India. Fortunately, Instituto Butantan will produce the Sinovac inactivated vaccine and Bio-Manguinhos the adenovirus Chadox1 vaccine of Oxford in Brazil. The Serum Institute of India will also produce the Chadox1 vaccine of Oxford.</p>
