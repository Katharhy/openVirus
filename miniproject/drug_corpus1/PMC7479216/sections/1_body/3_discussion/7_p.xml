<p>For instance, the passive transfer in NHPs of human antibodies generated during Phase 1 trials, followed by viral challenge could be considered to assess the risk of disease enhancement (

Experts also recommended including animals vaccinated with formalin inactivated, alum-adjuvanted whole virus SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2, for immunopathology studies, as positive controls. This will help in establish accepted end-points to allow comparison (

Each effect observed should be discussed by the developers with their regulators who will ultimately define the actual requirements for clinical studies (
