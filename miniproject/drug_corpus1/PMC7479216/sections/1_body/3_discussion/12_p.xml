<p>Finally, the modern policies for vaccine regulations should be taken into consideration. These regulations demand that Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III trials should be developed with success before a government licenses a vaccine and uses it on Phase IV trials and for industrialization. This usually takes at least a decade. Although these tests enhance the confidence of a product, one might think that if we are dealing with a vaccine produced by a technology that is already well-established in many licensed vaccines, such as a whole inactivated virus, more rapid or simultaneous tests would be accepted as proofs of concepts (

This would be another increased cost-benefit value of the vaccine, which takes into account the high mortality, worldwide incidence and impressive impact on the economy promoted by the quarantines. Probably, this is what Jenner and Pasteur would have done.
