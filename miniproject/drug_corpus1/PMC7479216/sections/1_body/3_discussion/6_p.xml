<p>The conclusion was that, NHPs could be used to evaluate the anti-COVID-19 vaccines with or without adjuvants to select the formulations with desired efficacy and reduced risk of ADE (

The immunopathology was a consequence to a Th2 type of response to the antigen and it was avoided in vaccines that drive the response to a Th1 immunity, with or without adjuvants. Also, it is known that the presence of fetal calf serum in the preclinical vaccine preparation may induce eosinophil influx to lungs (
