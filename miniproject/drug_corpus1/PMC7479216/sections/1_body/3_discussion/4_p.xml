<p>In murine models, ADE was observed for an inactivated whole virus vaccine against MERS (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>) and against SARS-CoV-1 (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). In fact an inactivated MERS-CoV vaccine, with and without adjuvant, induced in mice neutralizing antibody, reduced the viral load in lungs but showed mononuclear infiltrates containing eosinophils and eosinophils secreting IL-5 and IL-13 cytokines (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). A formalin double-inactivated SARS-CoV-1 (DIV) vaccine, adjuvanted or not, induced also immunopathology involving eosinophils in aged mice (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). In addition, a formalin-inactivated SARS-CoV-1 vaccine promoted ADE in NHP with macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration in the lungs and fibrin and protein-rich edema in the alveolar cavity (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). On the other hand, other inactivated vaccines against SARS were reported as non-inducers of ADE (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>).
