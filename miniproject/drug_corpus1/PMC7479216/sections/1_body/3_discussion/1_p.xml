<p>In the imminence of a pandemic involving high mortality and economic distress, several factors could speed up the development of vaccines. One of them would be the use of an already standardized methodology. It is worth noting that most of the molecularly defined vaccines now in development would meet severe restrictions for large-scale production and this could led to an enormous delay to deliver vaccines for mass vaccination of the public. In contrast to this, nowadays large industries and public laboratories are authorized to produce inactivated vaccines against Influenza. It is also reasonable to hypothesize that generation of protection and immunological memory against a group of antigens will be more efficient than that generated against a single antigen, no matter, how important it is.</p>
