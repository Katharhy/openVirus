<p>Two concerns could be considered as the downside of the inactivated vaccines for SARS diseases. The first would be the fear of an incomplete inactivation of the virus that could cause outbreaks among the vaccine production workers or in vaccinated populations (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). This concern is common to all vaccines produced with native antigens, which demand the production of large mass of pathogens. However, to guarantee safety, each batch of vaccine is submitted to validation of inactivation controls that include sequential passages assays of residual virus infectivity in embryonated eggs or tissue culture, and detection of live virus by TCID50 assays (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The whole virus SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine of Sinovac includes validation of inactivation controls (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). The second concern would be the promotion of an Antibody Disease Enhancement syndrome (ADE) by the vaccine. This is usually related to non-neutralizing antibodies, which determine an increased lung pathology and it was observed before in vaccines against RSV and Measles in the 1960's (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Since SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are phylogenetically related viruses that have caused epidemics over the last 16 years and ADE pathology was present for some SARSCoV-1 and MERS vaccine candidates in animal models, there is also a concern about the induction of ADE syndrome in humans vaccinated with SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). However, ADE pathology is not exclusive for inactivated vaccines and has been also demonstrated for the vectored vaccine expressing N protein, a replicon particle platform expressing S protein (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>), the recombinant protein S with or without gold nanoparticles (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>) and a MVA vectored vaccine expressing S proteins (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>).
