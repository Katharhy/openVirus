<p>After the Sabin anti-polio vaccine, which was launched in the 1960's, many other vaccines have been developed based on whole attenuated viruses. However, poliomyelitis was also induced by the Sabin vaccine poliovirus 2 in healthy subjects (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). This means that, nowadays, live-vaccination with whole wild or attenuated virus is no longer ethically possible, mainly because of the large population of immunocompromised subjects, in which a live-vaccine could cause the disease. Due to these safety issues, whole virus and bacterial dead or inactivated vaccines have progressively substituted live-vaccines.
