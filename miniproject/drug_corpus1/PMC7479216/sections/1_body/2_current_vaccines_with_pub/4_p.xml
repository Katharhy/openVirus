<p>In contrast, the Chadox1 nCoV-19 vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca is composed of a recombinant non-replicant chimpanzee adenovirus, which expresses the S protein of Sars-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Different from the technology used for inactivated vaccines since the 1800's, this adenovirus platform was developed in 2012 (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). The authors aimed to include an adenovirus in the vaccine that would not infect humans, in order to avoid its potential rejection by human antibodies. The chosen Chimpanzee adenovirus was phylogenetically related to the human adenovirus. The inventors deleted the region E1 of the chimpanzee adenovirus genome in order to render the virus defective and non-replicant, while the E3 region was excluded to increase the insert capacity. In addition, a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) containing a codon-optimized full-length spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 with a human tPA leader sequence (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) was added between the deleted E1 region and E4 to facilitate the genetic modifications. This approach has been reported to improve genetic stability (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). However, additional modifications were needed to guarantee that the E4 region of the virus would express a human, instead of a simian protein, that would enable the virus recognition and propagation inside human cells in
