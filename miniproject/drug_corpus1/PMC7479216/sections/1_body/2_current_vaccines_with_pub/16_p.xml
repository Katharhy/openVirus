<p>We conclude that the first results of anti-COVID-19 vaccine candidates confirm that the whole virus inactivated vaccine, which preserves the immunogenicity of all the antigens of the virus and contains PAMPS (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) is more potent than the recombinant vaccines that have only the important S spicula protein, either expressed by an engineered adenovirus (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) or by LNP encapsulated mRNA (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Furthermore, the inactivated vaccine also contains the Alum adjuvant. There are other examples support the superiority of whole inactivated vaccines above those expressing recombinants single antigens. For instance, 7.5 μg/dose of the trivalent inactivated Influenza vaccine is as safe as, but more immunogenic than the 22.5 μg/dose of the recombinant baculovirus-expressed hemagglutinin FluBok vaccine, in young children (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>).
