A recent contract has been signed between Sinovac and the public Laboratory Instituto Butantan of São Paulo, Brazil, in order to produce doses of the vaccine to immunize 8,870 healthcare professionals for a double-blind randomized Phase III trial in Brazil, where the incidence of cases and deaths due to COVID-19 is still high (

In return, the Instituto Butantan will gain the transfer of the technology and the license to manufacture 60,000,000 doses for Brazil. Testing anti-COVID-19 vaccines in Brazil became interesting because of the high morbidity and mortality and active expansion of the epidemics.
