<p>Besides, for a fair comparison of vaccine efficacies, the two SARS-CoV2 vaccines should be assayed in the same field trial, and the efficacy end-points should be determined prior to the assay. Due to the urgency in saving lives, this might be not be feasible during the pandemic. However, for comparative purposes, early infection, disease, severe disease, and death due to COVID-19 or other causes should be recorded as vaccine efficacy end-points. For instance, reduction of the virus load in the nasal and pharynx mucosa indicates not only protection against early infection, but also the blockade of the transmission of infection by respiratory droplets. This means that this end point is particularly important when seeking a vaccine to interrupt the epidemic. In addition, clinical symptoms indicate disease, while pulmonary distress, cytokine storm, need of intensive care, intubation indicate severe disease. The number of deaths due to COVID-19 or other causes should also be recorded and compared in order to evaluate the reduction of mortality.</p>
