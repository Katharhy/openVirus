<p>Notable, the Sinovac inactivated vaccine reduced to zero the viral load in throat swabs (pharynx and crissum), anal swabs and all regions of both lungs of vaccinated and challenged monkeys (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) indicating that the inactivated vaccine prevents not only the early infection but also blocks the transmission of the disease by droplets curtailing the epidemics. In contrast, no viral sgRNA indicative of viral replication, could be detected in BAL fluids, and in the lungs of two of six monkeys vaccinated with Chadox 1 and challenged (

 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), indicating that the Chadox1 vaccine would not prevent the SARS CoV2 human infection nor block its transmission and interrupt the epidemics. Vaccinated and infected subjects will continue to be infectious and spread SARS CoV-2. However, the vaccine will probably, in most cases, reduce the pulmonary symptoms, and make the disease less severe. Accordingly, the inventors of the Chadox1 vaccine seem to be aware of the limitations of its efficacy when they describe it as a vaccine that prevents pneumonia in monkeys (
