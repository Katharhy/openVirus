<p>Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients are at increased risk of various infections, including viral infections due to the underlying disease and immunosuppression. Respiratory viral infections (RVI) are prevalent in both the pre‐ and the post‐engraftment periods. The incidence of RVI is 7.8% among allogeneic and 2.3% among autologous transplant recipients

In addition to other common factors, prolonged neutropenia and lymphopenia, as well as graft‐versus‐host disease, make HCT recipients and patients with hematological malignancies at increased risk of viral infections. HCT recipients present with prolonged viral shedding and have a higher rate of progression to LRTI
