<p>Limited descriptions exist from recent epidemics regarding specific infection prevention and control procedures for patients with cancer. While the application of designated units with cohorting of COVID‐19 patients would be advisable, the significantly larger scale of this pandemic may preclude dedicated nursing for all infected patients. However, where possible, it would be advisable to dedicate health care practitioners to the care of COVID‐19 patients to reduce opportunities for transmission to uninfected patients.</p>
