<p>Patients with suspected COVID‐19 infection should be admitted first to an isolation room, as per standard infection control protocol, as a precaution in case they test positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Grouped areas with minimization of staff overlap with other patient care areas will ideally be available for confirmed COVID‐19 cases. If COVID‐19 infection is excluded, consideration may be given to transfer to the appropriate service as medically indicated; however, patients should be evaluated for the need for quarantine if the patient has been exposed to a close contact of a confirmed case or has other epidemiologic risk. If the patient is positive for SARS‐CoV‐2, then COVID‐19 isolation procedures should be followed as per the medical facility's guidelines (Fig.
