<p>Clinical and basic cancer research is likely to be severely affected by a pandemic. There will most likely be a decrease in trial initiations and accruals, and the pace of progress will slowed

However, the impact will be magnified, perhaps exponentially, by protocol deviations and violations for missed and delayed visits, leading to countless queries and estimated dates of confinement. The burden on research teams will increase markedly, and precious time and resources will be devoted to these tasks rather than accelerating clinical investigation to make up for lost time. During the pandemic, there is a need to carefully reconsider the clinical cancer research processes and procedures that contribute to data integrity and patient safety versus tasks that might ultimately detract from cancer research goals. Further research is needed in this area to address these issues
