<p>In this review, we addressed some of the current challenges associated with managing cancer patients during the COVID‐19 pandemic and provided some guidance and recommendations. This approach is likely applicable to various infectious pandemics. Health care authorities in cancer care should immediately start planning for cancer care delivery during a pandemic. The limited but accumulating evidence suggests that patients with cancer are at higher risk of COVID‐19 infection than individuals without cancer. The main management strategies for patients with cancer in this COVID‐19 pandemic include clear communication and education about hand hygiene, infection control measures, high‐risk exposure, and the signs and symptoms of the COVID‐19. Consideration of risk and benefit for active intervention in the cancer population during an infectious disease pandemic must be individualized. Consideration for postponing elective surgery or chemotherapy for cancer patients with low risk of progression should be considered on a case‐by‐case basis. Minimizing outpatients’ visits and elective admissions can help in mitigating exposure and possible further transmission. Telemedicine may be used to support patients during an infectious pandemic to minimize visits and risk of exposure. More research is needed to further understand SARS‐CoV‐2 virology and epidemiology in the cancer population.</p>
