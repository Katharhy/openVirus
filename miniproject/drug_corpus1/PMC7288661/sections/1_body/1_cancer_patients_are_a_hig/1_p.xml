<p>Accumulating evidence suggests that cancer patients are at higher risk of COVID‐19 infection and more likely to have higher morbidity and mortality than the general population. In a study with a total of 1,524 patients with cancer, cancer patients had a twofold increased risk of COVID‐19 infection when compared with the general population

In another series from a single institution in the Wuhan region, the infection rate of SARS‐CoV‐2 in patients with cancer was 0.79% (95% CI = 0.3–1.2), which was higher than the cumulative incidence of all diagnosed COVID‐19 cases that was reported over the same time period (0.37%, 41,152/11,081,000 cases, data cutoff on February 17, 2020)

The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention described the epidemiological characteristics of 72,314 COVID‐19 cases in mainland China as of February 11, 2020. They reported that 107 patients (0.5%) had cancer, and 6 of them died. The case fatality was 5.6%, which is higher than the overall reported case fatality (2.3%) from COVID‐19

While these analyses are preliminary and require validation from larger international cohorts, several factors could account for an elevated risk for acquiring COVID‐19 and consequent complications amongst cancer patients, including frequent hospital visits and admissions
