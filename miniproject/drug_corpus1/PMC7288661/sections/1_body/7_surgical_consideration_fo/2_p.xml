<p>Delaying elective surgical intervention may be more appropriate for select patients (e.g., early asymptomatic small breast cancer tumors detected on routine screening mammograms). These can be followed until the infectious disease pandemic is more controlled or over. Sixty‐day delays in surgical intervention in clinical stage I or stage II breast cancer were not associated with worse oncological outcomes

The concept of delaying elective surgery is complex when considered across different disease sites, as each site has a unique oncological multidisciplinary approach. The suggested approach to solid tumor diagnosis and treatment decisions during an infectious disease pandemic, including oncological surgical consideration, is shown in Figure
