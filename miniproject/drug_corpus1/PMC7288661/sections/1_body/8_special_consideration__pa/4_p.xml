<p>For NSCLC patients at risk of acquiring SARS‐CoV‐2, health care workers should stress the importance of using PPE and handwashing. Postponing anticancer treatment should be considered according to the patient's risk of infection, performance, and clinical status. Currently, there are no clinical trials to examine the safety and efficacy of antiviral prophylaxis for SARS‐CoV‐2 in cancer patients.</p>
