<p>The Chinese expert groups (Lung Cancer Study Group, Chinese Thoracic Society, Chinese Medical Association, and Chinese Respiratory Oncology Collaboration) recommend, whenever possible, to treat patients with advanced NSCLC as outpatients at the nearest medical center during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Patients who need to be hospitalized should be screened for COVID‐19. Clinicians should remain vigilant not to miss alternative or co‐infecting respiratory infections

Lastly, other potential causes for the respiratory deterioration of NSCLC patients, which could mimic COVID‐19 symptoms, must be considered; these may include obstructive pneumonia, pleural or pericardial effusion, pulmonary embolism, and heart failure; therefore, rapid access to SARS‐CoV‐2 assays is of utmost importance.
