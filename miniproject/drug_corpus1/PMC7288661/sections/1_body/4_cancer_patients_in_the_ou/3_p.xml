<p>While outpatient visits for cancer patients should be reduced to the safest level without jeopardizing patient care, several measures may help reduce transmissions in outpatient settings. Clear communication and education about hand hygiene, infection control measures, the signs and symptoms of the COVID‐19, high‐risk travel or exposure, and the importance of reporting new symptoms to their HCWs should be reinforced. Clinic attendance should be limited to the patient and one visitor (or no visitors). Entry/exit points should be reduced, with signage and personnel at these ports to facilitate communication and policy adherence.</p>
