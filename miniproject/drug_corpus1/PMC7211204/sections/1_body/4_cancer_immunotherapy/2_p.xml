<p id="Par30">Nivolumab (anti-PD1) and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA4) are two of the most successful checkpoint inhibitors currently on the market and have clinically been shown to increase overall survival and tumor progression for inoperable metastatic melanoma. According to the first-quarter average sales prices for 2019 from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the mg/kg price for nivolumab and ipilimulmab was US$28 and US$153, respectively [

For an 80-kg, stage III or higher melanoma patient, a combination regimen of nivolumab and ipilimumab prescribes a 60- and 90-min IV injection every 3 weeks for four cycles, followed by nivolumab every 2 weeks until the patient presents a good progress report or can no longer tolerate treatment. This combination treatment alone amounts to about US$300,000 a year in total overall treatment, not accounting for other point-of-care measure costs such as post-infusion monitoring, which places a significant financial burden on the patient and their family as well as the overall healthcare system [
