<p id="Par32">pDNA-mAbs have demonstrated that they can not only target and shrink specific tumors and those in hematological cancer models in vivo, but they can have a survival advantage and are being generated from a likely cost-effective platform. Duperret et al. reported on in vivo intermuscular DMAb delivery of mouse anti-CTLA4, and showed serum concentrations of up to 85 μg/mL, with a detectable level of expression of 15 μg/mL for over a year [

Mice challenged with tumors and subsequently administered anti-CTLA4 DMAb showed clearance in eight out of ten animals, with all demonstrating immunological memory after re-challenge by clearing 100% of the tumor. Investigators next designed and studied the functionality of DMAb-encoded anti-human CTLA4 ipilimumab and tremelimumab in vitro using donor-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) co-incubated with two different luciferase-expressing lymphoblast cancer models and showed a dose-dependent blockage of CTLA4, leading to increase luciferase expression. Perales-Puchalt et al. extended this work by engineering another important immune checkpoint inhibitor, anti-PD1, and showed expression and functionality supporting the possibility of administering both anti-CTLA4 and PD1 checkpoint as combination therapy [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>]. Therefore, pDNA-mAb delivery of checkpoint inhibitors is important, and the data from early mouse studies are supportive for continued development of high cancer value targets. Such developments provide opportunities to broaden the populations that receive such high-cost therapies.
