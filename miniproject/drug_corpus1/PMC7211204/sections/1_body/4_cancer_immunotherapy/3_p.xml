<p id="Par31">Muthumani et al. were the first to demonstrate a novel DMAb approach to target cancer, developing an anti-prostate-specific membrane antigen (anti-PSMA) encoded DNA in a mouse prostate cancer model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>]. In vivo, their study showed expression for this DMAb delivery of over 105 days post-injection, with important anti-tumor functionality, as tumor-challenged mice exhibited tumor regression and greater than 80% survival 58 days post-challenge compared to 0% survival in the vector control mice. The study also highlighted the potential for DMAb inducing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and phagocytosis (ADCP) with the recruitment of other immune cells such as natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages in identifying and clearing antigen-specific tumors. NK-cell-depleted mice injected with anti-PSMA DMAb and challenged were significantly less able to clear tumor and had less than 10% viability after a 56-day challenge compared to NK-expressing mice. Although in early stages of development, this treatment has the potential to offer an attractive clinical alternative/adjuvant therapy that can be coupled with current standard-of-care treatment options.
