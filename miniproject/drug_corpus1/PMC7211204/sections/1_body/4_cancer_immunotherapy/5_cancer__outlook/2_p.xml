<p id="Par34">Stadler et al. encoded a similar bispecific antibody in mRNA, encoding the tumor-associated antigen claudin, a tight junction protein and epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), which is overexpressed in colorectal, prostate, ovarian, and endometrial cancers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>]. They detected the translated mRNA bispecific antibody, with CD3 and claudin or EpCAM-binding capability, in as little as 6 h following intravenous delivery; plasma at the 6-h time point showed in vitro cytotoxicity at above 90%, with expression still present at the 50% level through day 6 post-injection of mRNA. In vivo data demonstrated three mRNA doses of 3 µg/mouse by IV injection compared to ten doses of 200 µg/kg of recombinant CD3 and claudin protein had comparable median tumor volume. The mRNA-encoded bispecific antibody showed earlier and rapid tumor regression, with fewer overall doses. Overall, both mRNA-encoded bispecific antibodies and DBTE pDNA-mAb approaches offer the ability to harness T-cell functionality in blocking tumor antigen function and initiating potent cytotoxicity, but vary in length of expression, stability, and dosing regimen, with DNA having longer and more durable expression from a single injection compared to mRNA. These are interesting and promising and likely complementary strategies for cancer immunotherapy that deserve significant attention.
