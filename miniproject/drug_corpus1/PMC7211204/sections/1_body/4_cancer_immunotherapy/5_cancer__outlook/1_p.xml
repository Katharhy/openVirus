<p id="Par33">As the pDNA-mAb cancer approach continues through preclinical studies, new complementary applications are also being investigated. BiTEs are another parallel approach that is demonstrating promise in the clinic for bringing T cells into proximity with tumor surface antigens. Blinatumomab is the first BiTE antibody approved by the FDA. It targets hematological acute lymphoblastic leukemia by binding to both CD3 T-cell coreceptor and the malignant B-cell CD19 antigen. This antibody allows for contact-dependent activation of T cells and initiation of cytotoxicity against lymphoblastic cells. Although blinatumomab is highly promising in people, the BiTE has a short half-life of approximately 2 h. The current regimen requires IV delivery for 28 consecutive days and costs about US$90,000 per 28-day course of treatment for patients 45 kg and above [

Therefore, a plasmid-encoded delivered BiTE would undoubtedly improve upon the relative short expression time length and could significantly lower the cost of such an important treatment. Building on previous DMAb studies, Perales-Puchalt et al. engineered a DNA-encoded bispecific T-cell engager (DBTE) that binds to CD3 T cells and the Her2 tumor target [
