<p id="Par35">There is tremendous potential for mAb delivery to have an impact in the infectious diseases arena. Through advancements in antibody discovery technologies, highly specific mAbs are being isolated directly from convalescent humans with activity against anti-microbial resistant bacteria, emerging and re-emerging viral pathogens, and parasitic and fungal diseases. Yet, palivizumab (Synagis), an anti-respiratory syncytical virus mAb, is the only commercially successful mAb approved as a standalone intervention to prevent an infectious disease. Synagis costs can be &gt; US$12,000 for a five-dose (15 mg/kg/dose) regimen, administered at 1-month intervals [

 <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic>, was approved in 2016 and is indicated to reduce recurrence of 
 <italic>C. difficile</italic> infection (CDI) in patients 18 years of age or older who are receiving antibacterial drug treatment of CDI and are at a high risk for recurrence. According to the CMS, Zinplava currently costs &gt; US$4500/g [

The Animal Rule serves as a mechanism to gain approval for drugs and biologics using animal data in situations where it is not feasible or ethical to perform human studies. This mechanism is therefore reserved for unique circumstances such as evaluation of countermeasures against biological select agents. Although many antibodies are currently under preclinical and clinical trial evaluation, in vivo mAb potency, dosage, delivery, and patient cost remain important obstacles that impede administration for the treatment of infectious diseases. Current antibody limitations impede widespread delivery for seasonal outbreaks and epidemics for influenza viruses. Repeat doses are required to lower HIV viral loads. The development and manufacturing timeline for rapid response to emerging infectious disease outbreaks, for example, Ebolavirus, is long and requires cold-chain storage, which may limit deployment in resource-limited areas. Therefore, in vivo nucleic acid-encoded antibody delivery represents an attractive approach for antibody administration targeting infectious diseases.
