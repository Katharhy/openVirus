<p id="Par46">Antibodies are promising for control of antimicrobial resistant organisms and other serious bacterial infections. Each year, at least two million people acquire antimicrobial resistant infections, including multi-drug resistant

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], achieving expression levels of 8 μg/mL for 100 days. This DMAb targeted two 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> proteins (PcrV type III secretion system and Psl exopolysaccharide), protecting against lethal pneumonia in a mouse challenge model. Lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, organ colonization, and lung pathology were observed following both monospecific and bispecific DMAb delivery, similar to the recombinant mAb positive control. Additionally, the bispecific DMAb demonstrated adjunctive activity when delivered in conjunction with a carbapenem-family antibiotic. This demonstrates the potential for DMAb delivery as a standalone intervention or alongside first-line antimicrobials. New-generation pDNA-mAb development to protect against ESKAPE (
