<p id="Par48">To date, the only mRNA-mAb targeting a bacterial pathogen is against botulinum toxin A1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Botulism is caused by the toxin from 
 <italic>Clostridium botulinum</italic> and requires immediate delivery of anti-toxin to prevent paralysis. Thran et al. encoded a camelid VHH antibody targeting botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (BoNT/A), with levels reaching &gt; 100 μg/mL in less than 24 h post-administration. The mRNA-mAb successfully protected against BoNT/A toxin challenge when delivered 6 h post-exposure. Additional development of mRNA-mAbs for rapid delivery against bacterial toxins that require protection within hours of exposure has the potential to be important.
