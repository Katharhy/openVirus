 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. They evaluated both a wild-type (wt) and variant DMAb incorporating the LALA mutation into the Fc region to mitigate dengue secondary infection. The anti-dengue virus DMAb achieved peak expression levels of around 1 μg/mL for at least 19 weeks in mice and demonstrated neutralization of dengue virus serotypes 1–3. Both the anti-dengue virus wt-DMAb and LALA-DMAb demonstrated protection against primary dengue infection. The LALA-DMAb demonstrated protection against dengue virus primary infection, as well as protection in a mouse model of antibody-dependent enhancement that models dengue secondary infection. Overall, this demonstrates the portability of traditional mAb engineering strategies to pDNA-mAb platforms for unique strategies against emerging viral infections.
