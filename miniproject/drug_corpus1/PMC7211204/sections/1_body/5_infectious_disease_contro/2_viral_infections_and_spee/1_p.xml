<p id="Par36">Both DNA- and mRNA-mAbs represent potential rapid delivery platforms for emerging infectious disease control. Both platforms start with initial antigen-specific mAb sequence identification. For pDNA-mAbs, antibody sequences are nucleotide and amino acid optimized using in silico methods, followed by rapid gene synthesis and insertion into the DNA vector backbone. pDNA-mAb DNA can then be amplified in small or large batches, and is ready for in vivo delivery within a short timeline (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The process for mRNA-mAb development is similar, but requires additional manufacturing steps. Antibody sequences are engineered into a DNA plasmid that includes a 5′UTR, 3′UTR, and polyadenylation signal. This is followed by plasmid DNA amplification in bacteria. mRNA-mAbs must then be transcribed from the DNA and formulated and then re-purified and stored for administration in an LNP. This last step is critical for mRNA stability and extends the timeline for delivery in vivo.
