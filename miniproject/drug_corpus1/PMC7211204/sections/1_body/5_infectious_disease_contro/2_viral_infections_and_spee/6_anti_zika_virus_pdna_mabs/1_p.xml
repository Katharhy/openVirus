 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>]. Building on the early studies with the anti-dengue DMAb, Esquivel et al. engineered anti-Zika virus wt-DMAb and LALA-DMAb targeting the virus E protein [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. They showed average expression of 27 μg/mL for the wt-DMAb and 62 μg/mL for the LALA-DMAb, with 70 days of expression. Both anti-Zika virus wt-DMAb and LALA-DMAb protected AG129 mice against Zika virus challenge and, in addition, protected against Zika-related damage to the testes. The investigators next delivered the anti-Zika wt-DMAb to rhesus macaques using a sequential administration strategy on days − 10, − 7, and − 4 before challenge with Zika virus PRVABC59 on day 0. Macaques expressed on average 1 μg/mL of wt-DMAb at the time of challenge, and four out of five animals controlled Zika virus infection. This was the first demonstration that a nucleic acid-encoded antibody can control an infectious disease challenge in a larger animal model, further supporting translation of the DMAb platform for administration in people. This Zika virus DMAb candidate is now in a human trial (NCT03831503), which we will discuss in more detail later in this review (Sect.
