<p id="Par44">Several promising broadly neutralizing antibodies have been identified targeting the HIV env protein and are demonstrating promising results for HIV treatment (reviewed in Ref. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>]). Pardi et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] encoded the HIV-VRC01 antibody into a nucleoside modified mRNA. They achieved peak expression levels of &gt; 150 μg/mL 1 day post-administration, which lasted for 11 days. Eight weeks of expression were achieved with weekly mRNA-VRC01 delivery for 4 weeks. Protection against SF162 and JR-CSF HIV-1 challenges was observed in humanized mice receiving the mRNA-VRC01, similar to recombinant mAb.
