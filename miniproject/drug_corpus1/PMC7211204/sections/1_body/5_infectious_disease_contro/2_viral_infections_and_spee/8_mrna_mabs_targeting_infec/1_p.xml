<p id="Par43">To date, mRNA-mAbs, formulated in LNP, have been evaluated targeting rabies [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], and CHIKV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>]. Human anti-rabies immunoglobulin and the rabies vaccine must be delivered immediately following potential rabies exposure. Thran et al. evaluated an mRNA-mAb platform for rapid expression of an anti-rabies antibody. They observed peak human IgG titers of 10 μg/mL within 4–6 h post-administration and expression for 8 days, before it declined [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This anti-rabies mRNA-mAb provided both pre-exposure (day − 1) and post-exposure (2 h post-infection) protection against lethal rabies virus challenge in mice. In this study, an anti-influenza B mRNA-mAb was also described as a control, expressing at similar levels to the anti-rabies mRNA-mAb.
