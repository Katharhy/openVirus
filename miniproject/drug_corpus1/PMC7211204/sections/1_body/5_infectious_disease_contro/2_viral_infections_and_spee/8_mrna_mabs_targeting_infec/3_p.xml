<p id="Par45">Recently, Kose et al. described an anti-CHIKV mRNA-mAb that was delivered by IV injection to AG129 mice that were then challenged with CHIKV. They demonstrated dose-dependent protection against the virus, with no viral load and protection against arthritis and muscoskeletal disease in competent C57BL6 mice [

However, the infusion duration was over 60Â min, which a significant time for field delivery. Additional studies to reduce mRNA-mAb infusion times would greatly improve the platform to make it more accessible in low-resource settings.
