<p id="Par42">There are approximately 37 million people living with HIV, with the envelope GP (Env) being the primary target for immune responses. Due to the high diversity of Env proteins, vaccine development and therapy have been challenging. Several Env-targeted mAbs have been identified and shown to broadly neutralize multiple circulating HIV-1 strains (reviewed in Ref. [

The DMAbs, delivered alone or in combination, demonstrated long expression for 300Â days and neutralized against the global panel viruses in an in vitro neutralization assay. The data highlight how the combination of sequence optimizations, formulation, delivery, and animal model development can lead to a significant in vivo expression level using pDNA-mAb platforms.
