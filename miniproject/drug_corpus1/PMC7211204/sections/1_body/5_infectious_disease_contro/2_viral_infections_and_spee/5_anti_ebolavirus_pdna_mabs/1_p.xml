<p id="Par40">The 2013–2016 Ebolavirus disease (EVD) epidemic was the largest to date, with over 28,000 confirmed cases and over 11,000 deaths. There is an ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and additional gene-encoded alternatives could be useful for EVD infection control to support post-exposure vaccines and therapeutics. Antibodies against the 
 <italic>Zaire ebolavirus</italic> GP are demonstrating promising therapeutic protection against EVD. The three-mAb ZMapp cocktail was the first antibody combination to demonstrate promise in an EVD outbreak setting [

The pDNA-ZMapp was delivered to mice, followed by challenge 28 days later with mouse-adapted Ebolavirus, demonstrating protection against lethal infection. In a separate study, Patel et al. engineered 26 different anti-GP DMAbs, three mouse-human chimeras, and 23 fully human IgG1 DMAbs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. They performed a series of sequence, formulation, and delivery optimizations to achieve peak expression of DMAb-11 targeting the GP fusion loop of &gt; 50 μg/mL and &gt; 26 μg/mL for DMAb-34, expressing for 365 days following administration. They compared anti-GP DMAb delivery in parallel with recombinant antibody. These studies demonstrated functional equivalency to bind antigen and that DMAbs bind the same molecular epitope as the parent recombinant mAb. Both anti-GP DMAb-11 and DMAb-34 protected mice against lethal mouse-adapted Ebolavirus challenge as single candidates as well as when delivered together. These studies also showed that anti-Ebolavirus GP DMAbs are protective in mice when delivered only 8 days before lethal challenge and also provide long-term partial protection when challenged 82 days post-administration. These studies are the first demonstration of the potential for prophylactic delivery of gene-encoded mAbs to prevent Ebolavirus infection.
