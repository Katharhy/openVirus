<p id="Par39">An estimated 45 million people in the USA were infected by influenza viruses during the 2017–2018 influenza season, resulting in 810,000 hospitalizations and 61,100 deaths [

Advancing mAb delivery could have an important impact on lowering overall influenza disease burden during seasonal influenza epidemics and against potential pandemic viruses. Yamazaki et al. were one of the first to show in vivo expression of a pDNA-mAb anti-influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) mouse IgG1 antibody [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. They demonstrated initial expression of approximately 1 μg/mL anti-HA antibody in mice. Utilizing an early generation electroporation (EP) device, they showed the benefit of delivery and hyaluronidase pre-treatment of the muscle to increase muscle uptake of DNA, resulting in serum levels of &gt; 15 μg/mL in mice and expression for 50 days. The pDNA-mAb expressed anti-HA antibody was detectable in lung bronchioalveolar lavage and protected mice against lethal A/H1N1/Puerto Rico/8 virus challenge. Following these studies, Elliott et al. engineered human IgG1 DMAbs targeting pan-influenza A virus and pan-influenza B virus HA proteins (A/HA and B/HA, respectively) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Using an advanced EP device and hyaluronidase pre-treatment, the anti-HA DMAbs were expressed to levels of &gt; 10 μg/mL against A/HA and &gt; 30 μg/mL against B/HA, with expression for 70 days. Dose titration of both A/HA and B/HA DMAbs was performed and evaluated in parallel with recombinant antibody to demonstrate equivalency to protein antibody. The anti-A/HA DMAbs demonstrated protection against seasonal H1 and H3 viruses, as well as neutralization of several group 1 and group 2 subtypes. Similarly, anti-B/HA DMAbs protected against both B/Yamagata and B/Victoria lineage virus infection in mice. Additionally, a combination of both anti-A/HA and anti-B/HA DMAbs protected against both A/California/7/2009 and B/Florida/4/2006 virus challenges, demonstrating the potential for co-delivery, and protected against homologous re-challenge. In a parallel study, Andrews et al. monitored the delivery of anti-influenza A/H1/HA or A/H3/HA mouse IgG2a pDNA-mAbs long term in mice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], observing similar pharmacokinetics as Elliot et al., supporting the data generated with human IgG1 DMAbs in mice. They reported a maximum expression with one A/H3/HA pDNA-mAb of 5 μg/mL in BALB/c mice, with expression lasting for 44 weeks. A combination of all three A/HA pDNA-mAbs protected mice against lethal A/H1N1/WSN/33 and A/H3N2/Aichi/2/68 challenges and protected against virus re-challenge. Taken together, these three studies highlight mouse IgG pDNA-mAbs as in vivo antibody development tools and the potential to evaluate fully human IgG1 pDNA-mAbs in the mouse model to demonstrate preclinical protection against seasonal and pandemic influenza A and B viruses.
