<p id="Par52">The concept of immediate and persistent protection introduced by Muthumani et al. is intriguing. Since pDNA-mAbs express for months, they have the potential to afford a new way for both pre-exposure and post-exposure prevention that has previously been unachievable with recombinant biologics. Additional studies to confirm immunogenicity and protective efficacy with combined pDNA-mAb-vaccine delivery would be informative.</p>
