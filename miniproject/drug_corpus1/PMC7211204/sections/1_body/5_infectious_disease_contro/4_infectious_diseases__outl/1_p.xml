<p id="Par49">pDNA-mAb platforms can be utilized to rapidly evaluate potential mAb candidates. Antibodies isolated from infected or convalescent individuals can be directly engineered into pDNA-mAb for in vivo evaluation in a biologically relevant environment. The top candidates from such a pipeline can then be rapidly tested in animal models. The simplicity and flexibility of synthetic DNA plasmid enables rapid scaling for administration in a person. This could open a new paradigm for rapid antibody administration in response to an outbreak (Fig.
