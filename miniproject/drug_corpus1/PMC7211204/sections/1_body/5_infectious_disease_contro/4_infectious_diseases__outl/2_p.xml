<p id="Par50">Several funding agencies have expressed interest in this process for the rapid development of nucleic acid biologics, including the National Institutes of Health, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF). The DARPA Pandemic Prevention Program (P3) was initiated in 2017, with the goal of pandemic prevention in less than 60 days through rapid deployment of nucleic acid-vectored synthetic DNA or mRNA technologies delivering protective antibody. Similar to what is shown in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, the program is supporting rapid isolation, nucleic acid development, and delivery approaches to achieve protective in vivo expression levels within 3 days of administration. In the final stage of the DARPA P3 program, the DNA and mRNA technologies will be tested in a capability test with an unknown pathogen.
