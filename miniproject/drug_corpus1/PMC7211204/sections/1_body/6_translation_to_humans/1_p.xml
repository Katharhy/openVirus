<p id="Par54">Large animal studies and data from human clinical trials will be highly informative for gene-encoded mAb delivery platforms. An older study by Tjelle et al. demonstrated in vivo expression of a mouse IgG2a pDNA-mAb in sheep, observing expression levels as high as 50 ng/mL before development of sheep anti-mouse antibodies [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This is the first study to demonstrate microgram expression levels in larger animals more similar in mass to people. Previously, Timmerman et al. evaluated plasmid DNA delivery of an anti-idiotype antibody targeting B-cell lymphoma, observing modest anti-tumor activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">131</xref>]. However, this study did not measure in vivo expression levels. Building on these previous studies, significant advancements in formulation and delivery are now leading to higher expression levels in monkeys (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, not previously published). At the start of these studies, animals received four to six IM injections (animals in black); however, only 0–30 ng/mL human IgG expression levels were detectable in rhesus macaques following DMAb delivery. Following a series of optimizations, expression increased to a 4–7 µg/mL (summary of data from non-human primates receiving 2–9 mg total DNA in 4–6 injection sites) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, magenta), and additional device/delivery optimizations, including hyaluronidase treatment, have led to further increases, now to levels &gt; 30 µg/mL (6 mg total DNA injection, six injections), which express for 35 days before elimination via the development of macaque anti-human antibodies (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, teal). Wise et al. demonstrated that using an optimized delivery strategy with a 6-mg dose, divided across six injection sites, anti-HIV DMAb delivery can achieve in vivo expression levels as high as 34.4 µg/mL [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. These expression levels parallel mRNA expression levels, which are at &gt; 30 μg/mL in rhesus macaques [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>]. Only AAV can surpass these levels in macaques; however, virus take in animals is reported to be not consistent with AAV, and there were wide variations in delivery observed, ranging from 0 to 270 µg/mL across multiple studies.
