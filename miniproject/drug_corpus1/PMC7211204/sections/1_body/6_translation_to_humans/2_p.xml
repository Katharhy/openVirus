<p id="Par55">Dose scaling is an important consideration for non-viral and viral vector-encoded antibodies. Plasmid DNA is transiently transfected into muscle and may persist in the tissue for a few weeks. Likewise, viral vectors typically persist in tissues for a few months, or permanently if integrated. This is quite different to a biologic, for which the maximum amount of drug is at the time of infusion. mRNA is most similar to traditional protein biologics, as it is rapidly expressed and degraded. Therefore, initial empiric dose escalation studies will be important to set the bar and move the field to optimal doses in the clinic. Additional optimizations including sequential administration [
