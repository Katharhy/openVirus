<p id="Par56">Recently, Priddy et al. evaluated in vivo administration of an AAV-vector encoding the anti-HIV PG9 (AAV-PG9) antibody in people [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">132</xref>]. No expression of PG9 was detected in participants’ sera, although PG9 was detected in muscle biopsies. One possibility for the lack of detection is the high enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) limit of detection (2.5 µg/mL), and more sensitive assays are likely needed as development continues. Furthermore, ADA was observed against both the AAV vector and PG9, suggesting that it did induce an immune response. More studies are needed in this regard to build on this initial study.
