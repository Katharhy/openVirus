<p id="Par57">A first-in-human phase I trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic expression of the anti-E protein Zika virus DMAb (INO-A002) is currently underway (NCT03831503; trial start date: February 7, 2019; estimated study completion: February 2021). In this study, dose escalation starting at 0.5 mg up to 4 mg of INO-A002 is being evaluated in healthy human volunteers. Supported by the preclinical data in mice and macaques, the human study will deliver DMAb in formulation with recombinant human hyaluronidase to improve drug dispersion. In parallel, a first-in-human mRNA-mAb phase I trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of an mRNA-encoded anti-CHIKV antibody (mRNA-1944) is also underway led by Moderna (NCT03829384; trial start date: January 22, 2019; estimated study completion: September 2020). This study will evaluate dose escalations starting with 0.1 up to 1 mg/kg via IV administration. At a recent presentation at the Oligonucleotide Therapy Society (2019), Moderna presented mRNA-1944 data demonstrating expression in people at levels &gt; 1 µg/mL even in the lowest dose group [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Following IV infusion with mRNA-1944, peak expression was reached within 24 h, declining afterwards, with detectable levels for at least 84 days, with the 0.3 mg/kg dose. Patients were treated with anti-histamine, and at 0.6-mg/kg doses there were multiple adverse events observed. However, this trial is a very positive development for nucleic acid biologics. While much more work is needed, this study is an important advance for the field. Together, these trials will be informative to help understand additional optimizations that must be undertaken to improve human translation of nucleic acid-encoded antibodies and will be significant for the field.
