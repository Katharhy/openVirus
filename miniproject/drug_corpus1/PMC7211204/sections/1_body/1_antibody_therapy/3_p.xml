<p id="Par5">With all mAb biologics, cold-chain storage and transportation is required to enable reasonable product shelf life. Temperature control is important for lengthening mAb biologic stability and storage. However, the need for a cold-chain can limit global distribution to at-need populations in resource-limited areas, and requires additional production runs to resupply patients, due to expiring product. For these reasons and others, novel creative approaches for in vivo gene-encoded mAb delivery building on existing biologic technologies are under investigation, with the goals of increasing patient accessibility and providing novel clinical options for this growing class of important biologics.</p>
