<p id="Par4">Despite these many advances, large-scale bioprocessing is faced with challenges that currently hamper wider global deployment. The intrinsic biochemical and biophysical properties of antibody sequences are frequent liabilities for large-scale manufacturing and may also lead to post-manufacturing aggregation and stability issues. Such limitations may prevent an otherwise highly potent and effective mAb from advancing through development and into the clinic [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Delivery challenges must also be overcome as in vivo administration of mAb biologics often requires high doses (grams of mAb) to achieve therapeutic efficacy, frequently at a high cost (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). While the cost of raw materials is relatively inexpensive, bioprocess manufacturing and purification can be lengthy and costly (reviewed in Ref. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]). The price of mAb biologics is driven by a combination of research and development costs, duration of treatment, patient market size, geographic location, private insurance coverage, and availability of biosimilars [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. mAbs requiring higher doses need to be administered through slow intravenous (IV) infusions to limit infusion reactions. IV delivery frequently requires hours of clinical monitoring and may involve post-infusion monitoring for allergic or anaphylactic reactions, further increasing the medical personnel required and costs of administration. Subcutaneous (SC) delivery has advantages for lower dose antibody delivery, including being less invasive and the possibility for self-administration in several indications, such as rheumatoid arthritis, primary immunodeficiencies, and multiple sclerosis [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Drug autoinjectors have greatly improved the uptake and convenience of SC delivery, also regulating dosing. However, SC delivery is associated with pain related to injection volume and injection site reactions, and absorption is slow due to reliance on the lymphatic system [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. As a result, the mAb may be eliminated before reaching systemic circulation (reviewed in Ref. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]). Nonetheless, the impact and importance of mAbs on human disease and the growth in new applications of such technology cannot be understated.
