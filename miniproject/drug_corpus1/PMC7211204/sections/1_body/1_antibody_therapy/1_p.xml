<p id="Par3">Monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy has changed the landscape of modern medicine. To date, there are over 80 different mAb biologics approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) for treatment of infectious diseases, cancer, asthma, and autoimmunity, among others. With these successes, the field is expanding into new and exciting related areas for biologics that target multiple specificities. This includes a range of bispecific and trispecific mAbs which can bind to the same or multiple antigens. Among the newest mAb-related biologics are bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs), bispecific and trispecific killer cell engagers (BiKEs and TRiKEs), and dual-affinity re-targeting antibodies (DARTs), as well as many others (reviewed in Ref. [

These developments are the direct result of over 40 years of continuous advances in mAb isolation approaches, including hybridoma technologies, yeast surface display, phage display, and, more recently, single B-cell sorting strategies that identify paired heavy chain and light chain from single cells, among others (reviewed in Refs. [

New structural engineering strategies to improve potency and cell culture production, as well as the parallel development of sophisticated bioprocess manufacturing technologies, have additionally contributed to meet the growing demands for mAb biologics [
