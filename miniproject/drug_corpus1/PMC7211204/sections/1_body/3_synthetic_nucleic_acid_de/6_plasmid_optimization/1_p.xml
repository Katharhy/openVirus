<p id="Par25">The most studied promoters for DNA-mAb delivery are associated with the use of the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>] or the chicken beta-actin (CAG) promoter [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. Learning from the mRNA field, further optimizations in the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs), polyadenylation signals, and other post-translational response elements should also provide added benefits. Other strategies include evaluating heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) gene delivery on one versus two plasmids. In several early studies, it was demonstrated that two-plasmid delivery affords superior expression to single-plasmid delivery [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Additional study is necessary in order to understand the biological reason for these expression differences and improve on strategies to develop single-plasmid pDNA-mAbs as well as other modifications. As the pDNA-mAb platforms advance, considerations such as shrinking plasmid backbones, including studies of closed linear DNA and minicircles, as well as linear deliveries represent interesting alternative options that are worth exploration.
