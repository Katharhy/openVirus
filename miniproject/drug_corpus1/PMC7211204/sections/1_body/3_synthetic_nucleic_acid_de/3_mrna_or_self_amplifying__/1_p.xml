<p id="Par14">mRNA offers a platform with the ability to rapidly express protein, bypassing DNA to RNA processing and directly attaching to ribosomes in the cytoplasm for translation of the protein of interest. This results in a fast and efficient delivery, followed by a single round of expression leading to bolus protein expression and secretion. RNA, with its oxygenated 3′ sugar backbone, is inherently unstable, especially in alkaline pH, and prone to enzymatic activity and degradation. This increases the chances of RNA integration via reverse polymerase transcription processes. Synthetic mRNA must encode all the necessary RNA processing structures, including a 5′ cap in the correct orientation and a polyadenylation tail, limiting its overall coding capacity [
