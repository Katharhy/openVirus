<p id="Par15">Synthetic in vitro-transcribed (IVT) mRNA is more biochemically unstable compared to DNA, and this has driven the search for rapid parallel advances in various LNP formulations for packaging the RNA. LNPs improve overall stability as well as providing a means for IVT mRNA to enter target cells. Delivery by specific LNP has significantly reduced recognition of mRNA by innate sensors; however, mRNA must exit the LNP into the cytoplasm in order to be translated, and therefore still encounters sensors. This results in recognition by innate pattern recognition receptors such as toll-like receptors TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 that respond to mRNA by inducing inflammatory responses via endosomal compartments and retinoic acid-inducible gene-like receptors (RLRs), RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2, that recognize unmethylated CpG nucleotides (or strands as in plasmid delivery) and single-stranded RNA to initiate degradation [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. RNA sensors can be particularly inflammatory. For this reason, modified nucleosides such as pseudouridine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and 5-methylcytidine are being advanced to enhance translation and stability, as well as lower innate inflammation via many of the innate immune sensors (reviewed in Ref. [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. In contrast to mRNA, supercoiled plasmid DNA drives more limited innate stimulation of cytosolic DNA sensors (STING, c-GAS, and TBK1) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] and activation of TLR9 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], even in the context of advanced electroporation delivery. However, additional investigations and developments in this area are receiving significant attention to further improve mRNA delivery and prevent undesirable immune activation in dose escalation studies.
