<p id="Par21">As nucleic acid-delivered antibody technologies begin to demonstrate interesting preclinical results, questions have arisen concerning how to control the magnitude and duration of in vivo expression. While long-lasting expression of antibodies targeting infectious pathogens is unlikely to be problematic, prolonged expression of checkpoint inhibitors could have lasting immune impact. Therefore, strategies that serve as on/off switches would be useful. Gene therapy studies with viral vectors have previously considered herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) as a potential “suicide” gene in combination with the antiviral ganciclovir. However, HSV-tk can be immunogenic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>] and is not active in non-dividing cells such as skeletal muscle [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Alternatively, the inducible caspase-9 system (iCasp9) has also been studied. The iCasp9 system employs a modified caspase 9, combined with a homodimerization domain that is activated in combination with a chemical inducer of dimerization (CID), leading to apoptosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. Unlike HSV-tk, iCasp9 is active in non-dividing cells. iCasp9-based systems are being evaluated as safety switches for chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) engineering and therapy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. In recent studies from the CAR-T field, Mestermann et al. employed the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib to suppress T-cell receptor signaling [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. However, dasatinib has been shown to be toxic in skeletal muscle cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. Furthermore, dasatinib does not completely remove CAR-T from circulation, rather it suppresses activity. In addition, the ligand-inducible RheoSwitch Therapeutic System has been evaluated in animal models [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>] and people for regulation of interleukin-12 delivered by an Ad vector [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. Building on these studies from the gene therapy and CAR-T fields, additional study of gene safety switches in skeletal muscle would be useful for pDNA-mAb platforms.
