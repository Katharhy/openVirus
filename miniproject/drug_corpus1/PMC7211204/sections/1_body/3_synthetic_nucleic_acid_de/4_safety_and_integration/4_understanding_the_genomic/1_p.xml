<p id="Par19">Further understanding of potential RNA methylation and the impact of epigenetic modifications is still needed. However, our understanding of RNA retrotransposons through long interspersed element (LINE) and short interspersed element (SINE) processes has informed much about the potential for DNA or RNA integration. The risk of integration for either platform is theoretical, which is not the case for many viral vectors. A survey of integration historical events in the human genome is illustrative. For example, specific elements such as LINEs and SINEs make up roughly 30% of the entire sequenced human genome and are distributed at intergenic and intragenic regions, respectively [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Both LINEs and SINEs move through the genome via RNA intermediates that are converted to DNA before integrating into the genome at a different location. These transposons can have either an advantageous or deleterious effect. Findings by Kaessmann et al. and others have shown that, similar to SINEs, mRNA retrotransposons can also integrate with the help of LINE-encoded reverse transcriptase (RT) enzymes. These RT enzymes recognize polyadenylated mRNA destined to be copied into cDNA and lead to host integration of transposed genes with varying mutation and functional capacity [

 <italic>ALU</italic>, and SVA) that are known to have deleterious effects in humans by mobilizing nonspecific integration, which results in the abrogation of genetic functionality in somatic neuronal development [
