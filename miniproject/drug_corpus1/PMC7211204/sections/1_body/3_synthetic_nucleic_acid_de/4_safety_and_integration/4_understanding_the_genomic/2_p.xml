<p id="Par20">Synthetic plasmid DNA has been extensively studied and has been administered to thousands of healthy human participants in numerous clinical trials over the past 3 decades. To date, there have been no reports of any serious adverse events related to plasmid DNA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. DNA delivery has a local biodistribution and stays at the site of initial injection, typically clearing within 2 months of administration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. The injection is well-tolerated, with only mild-to-moderate local (injection site) reactogenicity and no systemic toxicity observed in the thousands of persons studied, irrespective of higher dose administrations, in contrast to mRNA. Plasmid DNA delivery represents almost 15.4% of gene therapy vectors that have been investigated in human clinical trials (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. This number does not include the numerous human trials evaluating plasmid DNA vaccines against infectious diseases in normal healthy persons. The theoretical possibility for plasmid DNA integration is often cited as a risk factor for this platform. However, in experimental studies, plasmid integration events occur at rates 
 <italic>below</italic> the statistical rate for DNA integration observed in nature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>], or the background mutation rate of normal exposure to the sun. To date, there have been no integration events in the preclinical studies in the tens of thousands of individuals receiving plasmid DNA, supporting the safety of synthetic DNA plasmid-based technologies like pDNA-mAbs. DNA transposons exist as part of &lt; 3% of the genome; however, they are considered ancestral, and there is no evidence for new DNA transpositional activity for at least 37 million years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>], again supporting the rare nature of such an event. Much of the activity of DNA transposons occurred during early primate evolution and appears to have ceased. Double-stranded DNA requires an additional integrase for genome insertion. This machinery is unlikely to be available in adult human cells. This is clearly unlike the LINE and SINE RNA intermediary retrotransposons that continue to exert mobile transpositional activity in the genome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>], suggesting additional study of the RNA in such events could be informative.
