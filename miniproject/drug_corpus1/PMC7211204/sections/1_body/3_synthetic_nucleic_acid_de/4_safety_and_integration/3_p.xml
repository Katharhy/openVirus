<p id="Par18">The mRNA delivery field is still relatively new and there have only been a few mRNA gene therapy clinical trials and even fewer for delivery of antigens as vaccines or for in vivo encoded antibody delivery. The few mRNA studies reported have described primarily mild-to-moderate injections site reactions [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]; however, these can have a high frequency, and occasionally they have been serious. In a small vaccination study, a serious adverse event was reported following administration of an mRNA-rabies vaccine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The afflicted individual presented with transient Bellâ€™s palsy, recovering after a second vaccination. Vaccine studies with an mRNA H7N9 vaccine demonstrated that intravenously delivered mRNA can disseminate to different tissues, such as the liver, heart, brain, kidney, and many others [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], with many individuals exhibiting less severe fevers and chills. The vaccine was immunogenic and produced serological responses in most vaccinated persons. The long-term impact of antibody production from many of these tissues is only beginning to be followed. As the field is still relatively new, additional studies and monitoring will be informative for the safety of mRNA delivery in people. As mRNA currently requires LNP formulation, further studies to evaluate the safety of different formulations in the clinic are ongoing. An ongoing important first-in-human trial to evaluate the safety of an anti-chikungunya virus (anti-CHIKV) mRNA-encoded mAb (mRNA-mAb) mRNA-1944 is recruiting (NCT03829384). The interim safety results from this study were reported at the Oligonucleotide Therapy Society Meeting (October 2019), with no adverse events reported in the lowest 0.1- and 0.3-mg/kg dose groups. However, grade 1, 2, and 3 adverse events were observed in the 0.6-mg/kg group [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Importantly, expression was observed of the encoded antibody, which is a very exciting development for the field. Microgram levels of antibody were reported after continuous administration of mRNA Ab for several hours by the IV administration route. These exciting results, while showing some challenges, are very important. Continued study and development in this area will provide important guideposts regarding the potency and the safety of this approach.
