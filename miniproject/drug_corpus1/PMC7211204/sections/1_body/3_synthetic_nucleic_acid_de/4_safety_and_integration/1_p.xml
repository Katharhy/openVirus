<p id="Par16">Understanding the safety of gene delivery platforms is paramount for in vivo antibody gene delivery to progress. The safety data to date for both non-viral and viral vectors have been established from vaccine and gene therapy studies. Ongoing studies in humans with gene-encoded mAbs will be informative as the field moves forward (NCT03831503, NCT03829384).</p>
