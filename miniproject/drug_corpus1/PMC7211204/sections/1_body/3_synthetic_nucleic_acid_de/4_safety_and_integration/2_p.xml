<p id="Par17">Viral vectors have mostly been focused in the area of disease therapy, with few studies in normal healthy humans for gene therapy. In a limited number of studies, adverse events, including lymphopenia and neutropenia, among others, have been reported for Ad vectors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], and concerns over genotoxicity are being raised for AAV (reviewed in Ref. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]). This includes evidence suggesting genome integration by AAV vectors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], potentially resulting in permanent rather than transient gene transfer. Such integration events are still unpredictable and require additional study to further elucidate. Higher doses of viral vector may circumvent pre-existing immunity; however, toxicity has been reported in dose escalation studies with Ad vectors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>], including one fatality due to high-dose vector delivery [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Similarly, high-dose AAV vector delivery in pig and non-human primate studies has also been associated with severe toxicity, under specific conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>], but most clinical studies which have focused on more moderate doses support that AAV delivery is very well-tolerated in the clinic. Excitingly, clinical impact has been achieved for specific applications [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], underscoring the importance of this approach. However, the utility of AAV for systemic delivery has continued to show challenges, with anti-vector immune responses, as well as breaking tolerance to the encoded transgene. This area is receiving additional attention. Additional development is important and is likely to eventually pay more dividends in the clinic.
