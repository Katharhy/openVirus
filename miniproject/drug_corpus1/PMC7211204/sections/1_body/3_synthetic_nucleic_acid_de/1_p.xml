<p id="Par11">DNA and RNA represent the nucleic acid building blocks of life. DNA must first be transcribed into mRNA before translation to proteins. In vitro-transcribed mRNA delivery circumvents in vivo transcription, leading directly to protein translation. Although related, there are significant differences between DNA- and mRNA-vectored antibody delivery approaches.</p>
