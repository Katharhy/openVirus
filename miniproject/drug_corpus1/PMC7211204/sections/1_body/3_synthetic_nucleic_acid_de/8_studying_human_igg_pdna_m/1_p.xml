<p id="Par28">pDNA-mAb studies with species-matched Fc, such as studies with fully mouse (Fab and Fc) antibodies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>] or fully sheep antibodies (Fab and Fc) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], show long antibody expression in circulation. Not surprisingly, human antibody evaluation is challenging in animal models, as they develop a rapid immune response against foreign human Fc. It is also well-described that fully human antibodies have the potential to develop ADA responses in people. These immune responses can also be directed against the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]. Additional approaches to assess fully human biologics in non-clinical and preclinical models are therefore needed. Patel et al. showed that the anti-DMAb antibody response is MHC class II-dependent and can be overcome in mouse models using T-cell depletion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The T-cell-depleted animal is an important model, as a fully functional immune system returns in 14–21 days by normal thymopoiesis, allowing for complex immune and challenge studies to be performed. Other pDNA-mAb and mRNA-mAb studies utilized immunodeficient animal models such as athymic nude mice and RAG1 knockout, SCID, or NSG mice as alternative models to evaluate human IgG antibody expression and functionality. However, immune-deficient mice are unable to model the intricacies of a functional immune system and should be considered carefully as preclinical models. A recent study observed that NSG mice cleared recombinant mAb faster than other mouse models, presenting a significant challenge when evaluating biologics in this model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>]. Additional studies to help evaluate fully human pDNA-mAbs in mouse models would be highly informative for both non-viral and viral delivery and provide an important path forward for preclinical evaluation of in vivo-delivered antibodies [
