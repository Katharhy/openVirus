<p id="Par24">Advancements such as hyaluronidase pre-treatment of muscles to transiently facilitate dispersion through the extracellular matrix (ECM), coupled with updated electroporation, have greatly enhanced this approach [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. In the early pDNA-mAb studies, Yamazaki et al. observed 4-ng/mL expression in mice before hyaluronidase pre-treatment and as high as &gt; 15 μg/mL following hyaluronidase pre-treatment in mice [
