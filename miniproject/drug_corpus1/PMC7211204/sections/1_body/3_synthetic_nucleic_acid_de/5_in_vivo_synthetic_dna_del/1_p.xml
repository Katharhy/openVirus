<p id="Par23">Plasmid DNA is administered by a local injection. To date, this has been performed focusing on IM delivery strategies; however, other routes such as intradermal (ID) may be important as the platform advances. Early studies used needle and syringe delivery or older delivery devices, inducing very low in vivo expression levels [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. More recently, through engineering the inserts for increased in vivo expression and using more advanced systems like adaptive CELLECTRA™ electroporation, improved levels of in vivo antibody expression have been reported in many animal studies. The adaptive electroporation utilizes a direction-changing field, with depth-sensing novel technology and integrated resistance sensing. This greatly improves DNA delivery tolerability, as well as enhances in vivo transfection efficiency approximately 500- to 1000-fold, leading to a direct increase in protein expression [
