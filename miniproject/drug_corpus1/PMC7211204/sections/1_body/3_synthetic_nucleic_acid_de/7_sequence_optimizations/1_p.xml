 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Interestingly, many of the rules that have been thoroughly studied over decades to establish traditional antibody manufacturing are unique with regard to in vivo mAb expression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Patel et al. made the first observation that in vitro pDNA-mAb expression data did not correlate with in vivo expression levels using the DMAb platform [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. For example, recombinant anti-Ebola glycoprotein (GP) mAb 4G7 is a challenging antibody to manufacture in vitro; however, it is feasible through modified cell lines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>]. However, the original version of DMAb-4G7 had no expression in vivo as a human IgG1 pDNA-mAb. Patel et al. introduced single amino acid modifications into the Fab framework region to optimize DMAb-4G7 to restore in vivo expression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Similar modifications were introduced into the framework of an anti-CTLA4 DMAb [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>] and anti-HIV DMAbs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] to achieve highly optimized in vivo expression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. Therefore, sequence optimizations have clearly played a critical role in in vivo expression of synthetic pDNA-mAbs. Further studies evaluating the contribution of amino acid modifications at the cellular level will provide highly valuable insights into the biology of in vivo-delivered antibodies. Like traditional antibody studies, approaches that reduce the immunogenicity of amino acid substitutions will also be valuable. Taken together, these modifications introduce a new approach to selectively modify pDNA-mAbs that would otherwise be discarded by traditional sequence liability screening methods, opening new avenues for delivery of highly potent and important antibodies.
