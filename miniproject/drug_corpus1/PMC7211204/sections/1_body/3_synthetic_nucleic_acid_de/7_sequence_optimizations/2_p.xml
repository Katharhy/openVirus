<p id="Par27">Additionally, many of the Fc modifications identified in traditional antibody research can be applied to synthetic pDNA-mAbs. Introduction of the L234A, L235A (LALA) mutation to the pDNA-mAb Fc can abrogate Fc receptor (FcR) interactions, similarly to recombinant antibody [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. Other strategies to increase the duration of biologic antibodies in vivo include modifications in the Fc region that will increase interactions with the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>]. These modifications include M252Y/S254T/T256E (YTE) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>] in the Fc CH2 regions and M428L/N434S (LS) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>] and N434H [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>] in the CH3 region. New modifications including YTW/KF [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>] have been identified, and further study to determine potential benefits for nucleic acid-encoded mAbs will be highly informative to further extend expression in vivo. Overall, sequence engineering has been key to the success of synthetic DMAbs, and although similar modifications have not yet been studied for other pDNA-mAbs or mRNA-mAbs, such modifications will likely be important for diverse gene-encoded platforms.
