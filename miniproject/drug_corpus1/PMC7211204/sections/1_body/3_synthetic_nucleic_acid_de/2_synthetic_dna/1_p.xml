<p id="Par12">DNA is a highly stable, double-stranded regulated nucleic acid with antiparallel nitrogenous bases bonded by intervening deoxygenated pentameric sugar and a phosphate backbone capable of being read and faithfully transcribed into mRNA. This can generate logs of mRNA from a single DNA expression cassette. The naïve mRNA is then processed through enzymatic removal of noncoding introns and subsequent ligation of coding exons with the final addition of a 5′ 7-methyl guanosine and polyadenylated 3′ to buffer against nuclease activity, yielding a mature mRNA that is translated into protein by ribosomal enzymes [

The recent change to synthetic generation of highly designed, synthetic inserts has had a major impact on the platform. Synthetic plasmid DNA vectors can be engineered to encode large, complex proteins. This is achieved through space-saving plasmid engineering encoding only designed coding sequences with enhanced leader and optimized stop sequence which are required for natural downstream mRNA processing and termination, but have improved performance compared to native sequences. The natural temperature stability of pure DNA means that synthetic plasmid DNA vectors can be stored at ambient temperatures for extended periods of time, as they can withstand significant temperature fluctuations without damage [

Synthetic DNA is therefore capable of being developed to be cold-chain independent, making it highly attractive for product development and administration in resource-limited settings. One dramatic difference compared with viral delivery is that synthetic DNA does not induce anti-vector backbone immune responses and a homologous synthetic DNA backbone encoding the same or a different gene can be re-administered over and over [
