<p id="Par13">Plasmid DNA-encoded mAbs (pDNA-mAbs) are engineered to carry synthetic antibody genes, similar to AAV-mAb platforms. The literature describes that pDNA-mAbs can exhibit peak serum concentrations after just 2 weeks and then can express at consistent levels for 2–3 months and decline thereafter as the plasmid is lost from cells and then cleared from the serum due to the natural half-life of immunoglobulin G (IgG) [
