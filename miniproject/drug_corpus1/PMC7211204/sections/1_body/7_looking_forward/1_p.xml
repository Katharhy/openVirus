<p id="Par58">The clinical use of mAbs has had a dramatic impact on improving human health and affording a better quality of life for many individuals. However, use has been restricted to disease populations with high commercial value, due in part to the high cost of development of these biologics. The future for pDNA-mAbs and gene-encoded antibodies is promising and presents interesting opportunities to make life-saving biologics more accessible. pDNA-mAbs build on existing antibody technologies and can be engineered to deliver new types of biologics, such as bispecifics [

Other modifications including half-life extension to improve interactions with the neonatal FcRs and glycosylation profiles would be highly informative for modulation of in vivo duration and effector functions. Further in vivo modification may be accomplished through co-delivery of different enzymes to direct post-translational processing. pDNA-mAbs and mRNA are opening a new direction in the field that was previously limited to biologics, with powerful potential applications for in vivo delivery, including new classes of non-immunoglobulin biologics such as T-cell and other cell engagers, as part of this new approach for advancing a novel area of “nucleic acid-based medicines.” The initial studies described in this review represent the tip of the iceberg for their potential applications, as we are just entering the clinic. While early, these highly disruptive nucleic acid technologies have the potential to transform our approaches to the development of biologics, opening up new areas of opportunity for disease treatments of global importance for patients and for animal health.
