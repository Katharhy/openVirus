<p id="Par6">In vivo gene-encoded antibody delivery is an elegant approach that may address many limitations of traditional antibody biologics. In general, the antibody heavy- and light-chain complementary DNA (cDNA) are examined and then optimized or designed for encoding and expression specifically for the type of vector chosen for in vivo delivery. Historically, in the gene therapy arena, viral vectors [adeno-associated virus (AAV) is the current favored viral vector] have been promising for in vivo transfection and gene expression. More recently, the newly emerging non-viral synthetic nucleic acids [synthetic DNA formulated for facilitated delivery by electroporation, or formulated lipid nanoparticle (LNP) encapsulated messenger RNA (mRNA)] have started to receive considerable attention. The synthetic antibody is transcribed (in the case of AAV and synthetic DNA) and translated within the in vivo transfected targeted cells, followed by antibody secretion into the systemic circulation. RNA approaches use LNP to allow for delivery in vivo, and then the mRNA is directly loaded on ribosomes for translation in the cytoplasm, skipping the nuclear steps used by AAV and DNA deliveries. The synthetic nucleic acid field is rapidly providing insights into the in vivo biology of genetic expression which suggest novel exciting strategies for drug delivery, with broad implications for the prevention and treatment of disease. A high-level summary of synthetic DNA and synthetic mRNA and comparison with viral vector delivery platforms for in vivo mAb delivery is presented in Table
