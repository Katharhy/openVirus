<p id="Par7">The original studies surrounding in vivo antibody gene delivery focused primarily on gene delivery using recombinant viral vectors such as AAV and adenovirus (Ad), which were advanced clinically, building on work in the traditional gene therapy-based field. Among these choices, AAV has been the most studied option for mAb delivery, due to its particular advantages. These include the fact that it is more immune silent as a vector compared with other viral vector platforms and can achieve long persistence of the genetic cassette with a single administration (reviewed in Ref. [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] or hexon (Ad) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] proteins. In vivo viral vectors encoding antibody genes have been reported to be administered either locally [via intramuscular (IM), intranasal (IN), intraocular (IO), or intracranial (IC) routes] or systemically via IV or intrathecal (IT) routes, leading to viral infection with production of the virus-encoded antibody predominately from liver and lung and perhaps other tissues (reviewed in Ref. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]). Interestingly, AAV vectors take several weeks to reach their peak expression; therefore, to accelerate expression, De et al. evaluated a combination of both an Ad vector-encoded antibody followed by an AAV-encoded mAb targeting anthrax and demonstrated successful rapid and long-lasting expression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Around the same time, Skaricic et al. demonstrated delivery of a murine version of the anti-respiratory syncytial virus antibody palivizumab using Ad serotype 5 and AAVrh.10 vectors, showing protection and expression for 20 weeks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. With additional vector promoter optimizations, AAV vectors are capable of high antibody expression, approaching 1 mg/mL serum concentration at the highest vector doses in mice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. High systemic AAV-mAb expression levels have been observed in macaques that have uptake of the transgene, typically in the range of up to 100 μg/mL in serum (reviewed in Ref. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]) and as high as 270 μg/mL in a single macaque, with expression for 2 years. However, expression can decrease in animals when suppressed by host development of anti-vector cellular immunity or host anti-drug antibody (ADA) immune responses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In humans, re-administration of AAV vectors can be difficult due to rapid development of serotype-specific antibodies.
