<p id="Par9">Development of additional AAV vector serotypes targeting different tissues and assessing different routes of delivery is ongoing. Many of the initial AAV-mAb studies were performed utilizing IM delivery. IV delivery is less targeted, resulting in viral vector delivery and production in multiple tissues, including liver, lung, and others. Limberis et al. have focused on AAV9 delivery to the lungs via IN delivery for anti-influenza virus [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and Laursen et al. demonstrated AAV9 delivery of an anti-influenza multi-domain antibody [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Additionally, Limberis et al. described the delivery of anti-Ebolavirus AAV-mAbs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, a parallel study evaluating AAV9 delivery of the same anti-Ebolavirus antibodies by IM and IN delivery routes demonstrated different results based on the route of administration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. These data support the hypothesis that there may be variations in delivery take of AAV vectors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and that further studies investigating different routes of delivery continue to be important. Nevertheless, the data with viral vectors, particularly AAV-mAbs, are promising and supportive of the potential for an in vivo mAb delivery approach to administer highly potent antibodies. These vectors have unique advantages and disadvantages, supporting the need for more work in this area. Importantly, these studies serve as an important foundation for the development of additional in vivo mAb approaches using non-viral delivery platforms.
