<p id="Par8">AAV-mAbs have been studied for their ability to deliver anti-HIV broadly neutralizing antibodies. AAV serotypes 1, 2, and 8 have been evaluated as vector backbones for delivery of anti-HIV mAbs b12, VRC01, VRC07, and 10-1074, and immunoadhesins such as eCD4Ig (reviewed in Ref. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]). However, it was observed that these viral vectors were limited to single-use delivery, as natural serology and vector-induced neutralizing antibodies impaired repeat administration. This reduces the potential applications for long-term, repeat delivery of anti-HIV AAV-mAbs or delivery of combinations of anti-HIV mAbs.
