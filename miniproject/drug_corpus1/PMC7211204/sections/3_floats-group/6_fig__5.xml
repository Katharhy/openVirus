  <p>Nucleic acid-encoded mAb timeline. Antibodies are identified from infected individuals and sequences are confirmed to binding and/or neutralize the target antigen. The mAb gene is then synthesized and cloned into a DNA plasmid, followed by amplification and DNA scale up. At this point, all pDNA-mAbs are ready for in vivo administration. mRNA requires additional processing, including DNA linearization, followed by mRNA transcription. RNA stability must be evaluated and formulated into LNPs before an mRNA-mAb is ready for in vivo delivery.
