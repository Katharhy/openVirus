The field has advanced dramatically over the past 40&#x000a0;years, driven in part by major advances in isolation and manufacturing technologies that have brought these important biologics to the forefront of modern medicine. However, the global uptake of monoclonal antibody (mAb) biologics is impeded by biophysical and biochemical liabilities, production limitations, the need for cold-chain storage and transport, as well as high costs of manufacturing and distribution. Some of these hurdles may be overcome through transient in vivo gene delivery platforms, such as non-viral synthetic plasmid DNA and messenger RNA vectors that are engineered to encode optimized mAb genes. These approaches turn the body into a biological factory for antibody production, eliminating many of the steps involved in bioprocesses and providing several other significant advantages, and differ from traditional gene therapy (permanent delivery) approaches. In this review, we focus on nucleic acid delivery of antibody employing synthetic plasmid DNA vector platforms, and RNA delivery, these being important approaches that are advancing simple, rapid, in vivo expression and having an impact in animal models of infectious diseases and cancer, among others.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OPP1163327</award-id><award-id>OPP1201239</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weiner</surname><given-names>David B.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI141236</award-id><award-id>U19 AI142777</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weiner</surname><given-names>David B.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="FPar1"><title>Key Points</title><p id="Par2">

</p></sec><sec id="Sec1"><title>Antibody Therapy</title><p id="Par3">Monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy has changed the landscape of modern medicine. To date, there are over 80 different mAb biologics approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) for treatment of infectious diseases, cancer, asthma, and autoimmunity, among others. With these successes, the field is expanding into new and exciting related areas for biologics that target multiple specificities. This includes a range of bispecific and trispecific mAbs which can bind to the same or multiple antigens. Among the newest mAb-related biologics are bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs), bispecific and trispecific killer cell engagers (BiKEs and TRiKEs), and dual-affinity re-targeting antibodies (DARTs), as well as many others (reviewed in Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). These developments are the direct result of over 40 years of continuous advances in mAb isolation approaches, including hybridoma technologies, yeast surface display, phage display, and, more recently, single B-cell sorting strategies that identify paired heavy chain and light chain from single cells, among others (reviewed in Refs. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]). New structural engineering strategies to improve potency and cell culture production, as well as the parallel development of sophisticated bioprocess manufacturing technologies, have additionally contributed to meet the growing demands for mAb biologics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Different types of traditional Ig, bispecific Ig, and non-Ig designs. <italic>Ig</italic> immunoglobulin, <italic>BiTE</italic> bispecific T cell engager, <italic>BiKE</italic> bispecific natural killer&#x000a0;engager, <italic>scFv</italic> single-chain variable fragment, <italic>DART</italic> dual affinity retargeting, <italic>DVD-IgG</italic> dual variable domain immunoglobulin</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40259_2020_412_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par4">Despite these many advances, large-scale bioprocessing is faced with challenges that currently hamper wider global deployment. The intrinsic biochemical and biophysical properties of antibody sequences are frequent liabilities for large-scale manufacturing and may also lead to post-manufacturing aggregation and stability issues. Such limitations may prevent an otherwise highly potent and effective mAb from advancing through development and into the clinic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Delivery challenges must also be overcome as in vivo administration of mAb biologics often requires high doses (grams of mAb) to achieve therapeutic efficacy, frequently at a high cost (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). While the cost of raw materials is relatively inexpensive, bioprocess manufacturing and purification can be lengthy and costly (reviewed in Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]). The price of mAb biologics is driven by a combination of research and development costs, duration of treatment, patient market size, geographic location, private insurance coverage, and availability of biosimilars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. mAbs requiring higher doses need to be administered through slow intravenous (IV) infusions to limit infusion reactions. IV delivery frequently requires hours of clinical monitoring and may involve post-infusion monitoring for allergic or anaphylactic reactions, further increasing the medical personnel required and costs of administration. Subcutaneous (SC) delivery has advantages for lower dose antibody delivery, including being less invasive and the possibility for self-administration in several indications, such as rheumatoid arthritis, primary immunodeficiencies, and multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Drug autoinjectors have greatly improved the uptake and convenience of SC delivery, also regulating dosing. However, SC delivery is associated with pain related to injection volume and injection site reactions, and absorption is slow due to reliance on the lymphatic system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] for biodistribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. As a result, the mAb may be eliminated before reaching systemic circulation (reviewed in Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]). Nonetheless, the impact and importance of mAbs on human disease and the growth in new applications of such technology cannot be understated.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Cost of mAb per regimen (USD): the cost in USD for a single regimen of several mAbs based on 2019 first quarter Average Sale Price Files set by U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. <italic>USD</italic> U.S. dollars</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40259_2020_412_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par5">With all mAb biologics, cold-chain storage and transportation is required to enable reasonable product shelf life. Temperature control is important for lengthening mAb biologic stability and storage. However, the need for a cold-chain can limit global distribution to at-need populations in resource-limited areas, and requires additional production runs to resupply patients, due to expiring product. For these reasons and others, novel creative approaches for in vivo gene-encoded mAb delivery building on existing biologic technologies are under investigation, with the goals of increasing patient accessibility and providing novel clinical options for this growing class of important biologics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>In Vivo Antibody Gene Delivery</title><p id="Par6">In vivo gene-encoded antibody delivery is an elegant approach that may address many limitations of traditional antibody biologics. In general, the antibody heavy- and light-chain complementary DNA (cDNA) are examined and then optimized or designed for encoding and expression specifically for the type of vector chosen for in vivo delivery. Historically, in the gene therapy arena, viral vectors [adeno-associated virus (AAV) is the current favored viral vector] have been promising for in vivo transfection and gene expression. More recently, the newly emerging non-viral synthetic nucleic acids [synthetic DNA formulated for facilitated delivery by electroporation, or formulated lipid nanoparticle (LNP) encapsulated messenger RNA (mRNA)] have started to receive considerable attention. The synthetic antibody is transcribed (in the case of AAV and synthetic DNA) and translated within the in vivo transfected targeted cells, followed by antibody secretion into the systemic circulation. RNA approaches use LNP to allow for delivery in vivo, and then the mRNA is directly loaded on ribosomes for translation in the cytoplasm, skipping the nuclear steps used by AAV and DNA deliveries. The synthetic nucleic acid field is rapidly providing insights into the in vivo biology of genetic expression which suggest novel exciting strategies for drug delivery, with broad implications for the prevention and treatment of disease. A high-level summary of synthetic DNA and synthetic mRNA and comparison with viral vector delivery platforms for in vivo mAb delivery is presented in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of different in vivo antibody gene delivery platforms</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"/><th align="left">Synthetic DNA</th><th align="left">mRNA</th><th align="left">Viral vector</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Starting material</td><td align="left">Plasmid DNA</td><td align="left">Plasmid DNA</td><td align="left">Plasmid DNA</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Injected material</td><td align="left">Plasmid DNA/by EP</td><td align="left">mRNA in LNP</td><td align="left">AAV, Ad vector</td></tr><tr><td align="left">In vivo product</td><td align="left">mAb, BsMAb</td><td align="left">mAb, BsMAb</td><td align="left">mAb, BsMAb</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Transient</td><td align="left">Yes</td><td align="left">Yes</td><td align="left">Yes; however, rare cases may integrate (AAV)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Cell compartment</td><td align="left">Nucleus</td><td align="left">Cytoplasm</td><td align="left">Nucleus</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Integration</td><td align="left">None observed in humans</td><td align="left">Low probability data early</td><td align="left">Possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Anti-vector immunity</td><td align="left">No</td><td align="left">No</td><td align="left">Yes, serotype specific</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Duration of a single administration</td><td align="left">Weeks/months</td><td align="left">Days/weeks</td><td align="left">Months/years</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Delivery route</td><td align="left">ID, IM</td><td align="left">IV, IM/ID</td><td align="left">IM, IN, IV, IC, IO, IT</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Tissue specificity/tropism</td><td align="left">Local site of administration</td><td align="left">Non-specific</td><td align="left">Serotype dependent</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Vector take</td><td align="left">High in animals</td><td align="left">High in preclinical</td><td align="left">Variable</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Human safety</td><td align="left">Very safe, no SAEs in 1000s of individuals</td><td align="left">Ongoing trials, SAEs reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]</td><td align="left">Safe but potential for integration (AAV)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Ease of manufacturing</td><td align="left">Yes</td><td align="left">Likely yes with caveats</td><td align="left">Moderate</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Cold-chain free</td><td align="left">Yes</td><td align="left"><p>Possible (with LNP)</p><p>No (without LNP)</p></td><td align="left">No</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>AAV</italic> adenovirus-associated virus, <italic>Ad</italic> adenovirus, <italic>BsMAb</italic> bispecific mAb, <italic>EP</italic> electroporation, <italic>IC</italic> intracranial, <italic>ID</italic> intradermal, <italic>IM</italic> intramuscular, <italic>IN</italic> intranasal, <italic>IO</italic> intraocular (subretinal and intravitreal), <italic>IT</italic> intrathecal, <italic>IV</italic> intravenous, <italic>LNP</italic> lipid nanoparticle, <italic>mAb</italic> monoclonal antibody, <italic>mRNA</italic> messenger RNA, <italic>SAEs</italic> serious adverse events</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Viral Vector-Encoded Antibodies</title><p id="Par7">The original studies surrounding in vivo antibody gene delivery focused primarily on gene delivery using recombinant viral vectors such as AAV and adenovirus (Ad), which were advanced clinically, building on work in the traditional gene therapy-based field. Among these choices, AAV has been the most studied option for mAb delivery, due to its particular advantages. These include the fact that it is more immune silent as a vector compared with other viral vector platforms and can achieve long persistence of the genetic cassette with a single administration (reviewed in Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]). Viral vector delivery is dependent on viral surface receptor-mediated entry into cells, with different vectors displaying unique tissue tropisms (e.g., liver, muscle, and lung) based on their surface capsid (AAV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] or hexon (Ad) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] proteins. In vivo viral vectors encoding antibody genes have been reported to be administered either locally [via intramuscular (IM), intranasal (IN), intraocular (IO), or intracranial (IC) routes] or systemically&#x000a0;via IV or intrathecal (IT) routes, leading to viral infection with production of the virus-encoded antibody predominately from liver and lung and perhaps other tissues (reviewed in Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]). Interestingly, AAV vectors take several weeks to reach their peak expression; therefore, to accelerate expression, De et al. evaluated a combination of both an Ad vector-encoded antibody followed by an AAV-encoded mAb targeting anthrax and demonstrated successful rapid and long-lasting expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Around the same time, Skaricic et al. demonstrated delivery of a murine version of the anti-respiratory syncytial virus antibody palivizumab using Ad serotype 5 and AAVrh.10 vectors, showing protection and expression for 20&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. With additional vector promoter optimizations, AAV vectors are capable of high antibody expression, approaching 1&#x000a0;mg/mL serum concentration at the highest vector doses in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. High systemic AAV-mAb expression levels have been observed in macaques that have uptake of the transgene, typically in the range of up to 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL in serum (reviewed in Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]) and as high as 270&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL in a single macaque, with expression for 2&#x000a0;years. However, expression can decrease in animals when suppressed by host development of anti-vector cellular immunity or host anti-drug antibody (ADA) immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In humans, re-administration of AAV vectors can be difficult due to rapid development of serotype-specific antibodies.</p><p id="Par8">AAV-mAbs have been studied for their ability to deliver anti-HIV broadly neutralizing antibodies. AAV serotypes 1, 2, and 8 have been evaluated as vector backbones for delivery of anti-HIV mAbs b12, VRC01, VRC07, and 10-1074, and immunoadhesins such as eCD4Ig (reviewed in Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]). However, it was observed that these viral vectors were limited to single-use delivery, as natural serology and vector-induced neutralizing antibodies impaired repeat administration. This reduces the potential applications for long-term, repeat delivery of anti-HIV AAV-mAbs or delivery of combinations of anti-HIV mAbs.</p><p id="Par9">Development of additional AAV vector serotypes targeting different tissues and assessing different routes of delivery is ongoing. Many of the initial AAV-mAb studies were performed utilizing IM delivery. IV delivery is less targeted, resulting in viral vector delivery and production in multiple tissues, including liver, lung, and others. Limberis et al. have focused on AAV9 delivery to the lungs via IN delivery for anti-influenza virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and Laursen et al. demonstrated AAV9 delivery of an anti-influenza multi-domain antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Additionally, Limberis et al. described the delivery of anti-Ebolavirus AAV-mAbs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, a parallel study evaluating AAV9 delivery of the same anti-Ebolavirus antibodies by IM and IN delivery routes demonstrated different results based on the route of administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. These data support the hypothesis that there may be variations in delivery take of AAV vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and that further studies investigating different routes of delivery continue to be important. Nevertheless, the data with viral vectors, particularly AAV-mAbs, are promising and supportive of the potential for an in vivo mAb delivery approach to administer highly potent antibodies. These vectors have unique advantages and disadvantages, supporting the need for more work in this area. Importantly, these studies serve as an important foundation for the development of additional in vivo mAb approaches using non-viral delivery platforms.</p><p id="Par10">We focus below more specifically on <italic>non-viral antibody gene delivery</italic> technologies using synthetic mRNA or synthetic plasmid DNA vectors (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Nucleic acid antibody gene delivery using synthetic DNA or mRNA administration into the cell</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40259_2020_412_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Synthetic Nucleic Acid Delivery</title><p id="Par11">DNA and RNA represent the nucleic acid building blocks of life. DNA must first be transcribed into mRNA before translation to proteins. In vitro-transcribed mRNA delivery circumvents in vivo transcription, leading directly to protein translation. Although related, there are significant differences between DNA- and mRNA-vectored antibody delivery approaches.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Synthetic DNA</title><p id="Par12">DNA is a highly stable, double-stranded regulated nucleic acid with antiparallel nitrogenous bases bonded by intervening deoxygenated pentameric sugar and a phosphate backbone capable of being read and faithfully transcribed into mRNA. This can generate logs of mRNA from a single DNA expression cassette. The na&#x000ef;ve mRNA is then processed through enzymatic removal of noncoding introns and subsequent ligation of coding exons with the final addition of a 5&#x02032; 7-methyl guanosine and polyadenylated 3&#x02032; to buffer against nuclease activity, yielding a mature mRNA that is translated into protein by ribosomal enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Initial DNA vectors were developed by direct cloning and expression of natural sequence inserts derived from the host. The recent change to synthetic generation of highly designed, synthetic inserts has had a major impact on the platform. Synthetic plasmid DNA vectors can be engineered to encode large, complex proteins. This is achieved through space-saving plasmid engineering encoding only designed coding sequences with enhanced leader and optimized stop sequence which are required for natural downstream mRNA processing and termination, but have improved performance compared to native sequences. The natural temperature stability of pure DNA means that synthetic plasmid DNA vectors can be stored at ambient temperatures for extended periods of time, as they can withstand significant temperature fluctuations without damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Synthetic DNA is therefore capable of being developed to be cold-chain independent, making it highly attractive for product development and administration in resource-limited settings. One dramatic difference compared with viral delivery is that synthetic DNA does not induce anti-vector backbone immune responses and a homologous synthetic DNA backbone encoding the same or a different gene can be re-administered over and over [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. As a result, DNA is a promising platform for in vivo delivery of vaccines, protein replacement, or antibody genes, especially when combined with enhanced delivery, as discussed in Sects.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec">4</xref>, <xref rid="Sec15" ref-type="sec">5</xref>, <xref rid="Sec25" ref-type="sec">6</xref>, and <xref rid="Sec26" ref-type="sec">7</xref>. DNA is transiently expressed and can continue to produce protein as a depot until it is lost from cells. In general, as plasmid delivery is non-live, non-replicating, and non-integrating, these deliveries are transient.</p><p id="Par13">Plasmid DNA-encoded mAbs (pDNA-mAbs) are engineered to carry synthetic antibody genes, similar to AAV-mAb platforms. The literature describes that pDNA-mAbs can exhibit peak serum concentrations after just 2&#x000a0;weeks and then can express at consistent levels for 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;months and decline thereafter as the plasmid is lost from cells and then cleared from the serum due to the natural half-life of immunoglobulin G (IgG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].

However, in contrast to viral vectors, synthetic DNA requires an efficient delivery system. By far the most advanced of these are the adaptive electroporation systems, where a consistency of in vivo DNA delivery and efficiency has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], representing potential utility for pDNA-mAb delivery, at least preclinically.

This results in a fast and efficient delivery, followed by a single round of expression leading to bolus protein expression and secretion. RNA, with its oxygenated 3&#x02032; sugar backbone, is inherently unstable, especially in alkaline pH, and prone to enzymatic activity and degradation. This increases the chances of RNA integration via reverse polymerase transcription processes. Synthetic mRNA must encode all the necessary RNA processing structures, including a 5&#x02032; cap in the correct orientation and a polyadenylation tail, limiting its overall coding capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].

LNPs improve overall stability as well as providing a means for IVT mRNA to enter target cells. Delivery by specific LNP has significantly reduced recognition of mRNA by innate sensors; however, mRNA must exit the LNP into the cytoplasm in order to be translated, and therefore still encounters sensors. This results in recognition by innate pattern recognition receptors such as toll-like receptors TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 that respond to mRNA by inducing inflammatory responses via endosomal compartments and retinoic acid-inducible gene-like receptors (RLRs), RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2, that recognize unmethylated CpG nucleotides (or strands as in plasmid delivery) and single-stranded RNA to initiate degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].

For this reason, modified nucleosides such as pseudouridine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and 5-methylcytidine are being advanced to enhance&#x000a0;translation and stability, as well as lower innate inflammation via many of the innate immune sensors (reviewed in Ref.

In a limited number of studies, adverse events, including lymphopenia and neutropenia, among others, have been reported for Ad vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], and concerns over genotoxicity are being raised for AAV (reviewed in Ref.

Similarly, high-dose AAV vector delivery in pig and non-human primate studies has also been associated with severe toxicity, under specific conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>], but most clinical studies which have focused on more moderate doses support that AAV delivery is very well-tolerated in the clinic. Excitingly, clinical impact has been achieved for specific applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], underscoring the importance of this approach. However, the utility of AAV for systemic delivery has continued to show challenges, with anti-vector immune responses, as well as breaking tolerance to the encoded transgene. This area is receiving additional attention. Additional development is important and is likely to eventually pay more dividends in the clinic.</p><p id="Par18">The mRNA delivery field is still relatively new and there have only been a few mRNA gene therapy clinical trials and even fewer for delivery of antigens as vaccines or for in vivo encoded antibody delivery. The few mRNA studies reported have described primarily mild-to-moderate injections site reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]; however, these can have a high frequency, and occasionally they have been serious. In a small vaccination study, a serious adverse event was reported following administration of an mRNA-rabies vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The afflicted individual presented with transient Bell&#x02019;s palsy, recovering after a second vaccination. Vaccine studies with an mRNA H7N9 vaccine demonstrated that intravenously delivered mRNA can disseminate to different tissues, such as the liver, heart, brain, kidney, and many others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], with many individuals exhibiting less severe fevers and chills. The vaccine was immunogenic and produced serological responses in most vaccinated persons. The long-term impact of antibody production from many of these tissues is only beginning to be followed. As the field is still relatively new, additional studies and monitoring will be informative for the safety of mRNA delivery in people. As mRNA currently requires LNP formulation, further studies to evaluate the safety of different formulations in the clinic are ongoing. An ongoing important first-in-human trial to evaluate the safety of an anti-chikungunya virus (anti-CHIKV) mRNA-encoded mAb (mRNA-mAb) mRNA-1944 is recruiting (NCT03829384). The interim safety results from this study were reported at the Oligonucleotide Therapy Society Meeting (October 2019), with no adverse events reported in the lowest 0.1- and 0.3-mg/kg dose groups. However, grade 1, 2, and 3 adverse events were observed in the 0.6-mg/kg group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Importantly, expression was observed of the encoded antibody, which is a very exciting development for the field. Microgram levels of antibody were reported after continuous administration of mRNA Ab for several hours by the IV administration route. These exciting results, while showing some challenges, are very important. Continued study and development in this area will provide important guideposts regarding the potency and the safety of this approach.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Understanding the Genomic Impact of mRNA and DNA Delivery</title><p id="Par19">Further understanding of potential RNA methylation and the impact of epigenetic modifications is still needed. However, our understanding of RNA retrotransposons through long interspersed element (LINE) and short interspersed element (SINE) processes has informed much about the potential for DNA or RNA integration. The risk of integration for either platform is theoretical, which is not the case for many viral vectors. A survey of integration historical events in the human genome is illustrative. For example, specific elements such as LINEs and SINEs make up roughly 30% of the entire sequenced human genome and are distributed at intergenic and intragenic regions, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Both LINEs and SINEs move through the genome via RNA intermediates that are converted to DNA before integrating into the genome at a different location. These transposons can have either an advantageous or deleterious effect. Findings by Kaessmann et al. and others have shown that, similar to SINEs, mRNA retrotransposons can also integrate with the help of LINE-encoded reverse transcriptase (RT) enzymes. These RT enzymes recognize polyadenylated mRNA destined to be copied into cDNA and lead to host integration of transposed genes with varying mutation and functional capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Using retrotransposon capture sequencing (RC-seq), Baillie et al. were able to identify three active families of retrotransposons (L1, <italic>ALU</italic>, and SVA) that are known to have deleterious effects in humans by mobilizing nonspecific integration, which results in the abrogation of genetic functionality in somatic neuronal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Undoubtedly, these studies highlight the complexity and divergence of mRNA processes and the natural challenges and opportunities that exist to enhance a robust safety profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>].<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p><bold>a</bold> Elements in the human genome (adapted from Ref.

To date, there have been no reports of any serious adverse events related to plasmid DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. DNA delivery has a local biodistribution and stays at the site of initial injection, typically clearing within 2&#x000a0;months of administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. The injection is well-tolerated, with only mild-to-moderate local (injection site) reactogenicity and no systemic toxicity observed in the thousands of persons studied, irrespective of higher dose administrations, in contrast to mRNA. Plasmid DNA delivery represents almost 15.4% of gene therapy vectors that have been investigated in human clinical trials (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. This number does not include the numerous human trials evaluating plasmid DNA vaccines against infectious diseases in normal healthy persons. The theoretical possibility for plasmid DNA integration is often cited as a risk factor for this platform. However, in experimental studies, plasmid integration events occur at rates <italic>below</italic> the statistical rate for DNA integration observed in nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>], or the background mutation rate of normal exposure to the sun. To date, there have been no integration events in the preclinical studies in the tens of thousands of individuals receiving plasmid DNA, supporting the safety of synthetic DNA plasmid-based technologies like pDNA-mAbs. DNA transposons exist as part of&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;3% of the genome; however, they are considered ancestral, and there is no evidence for new DNA transpositional activity for at least 37 million years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>], again supporting the rare nature of such an event. Much of the activity of DNA transposons occurred during early primate evolution and appears to have ceased. Double-stranded DNA requires an additional integrase for genome insertion. This machinery is unlikely to be available in adult human cells. This is clearly unlike the LINE and SINE RNA intermediary retrotransposons that continue to exert mobile transpositional activity in the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>], suggesting additional study of the RNA in such events could be informative.</p><p id="Par21">As nucleic acid-delivered antibody technologies begin to demonstrate interesting preclinical results, questions have arisen concerning how to control the magnitude and duration of in vivo expression. While long-lasting expression of antibodies targeting infectious pathogens is unlikely to be problematic, prolonged expression of checkpoint inhibitors could have lasting immune impact. Therefore, strategies that serve as on/off switches would be useful. Gene therapy studies with viral vectors have previously considered herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) as a potential &#x0201c;suicide&#x0201d; gene in combination with the antiviral ganciclovir. However, HSV-tk can be immunogenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>] and is not active in non-dividing cells such as skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Alternatively, the inducible caspase-9 system (iCasp9) has also been studied. The iCasp9 system employs a modified caspase 9, combined with a homodimerization domain that is activated in combination with a chemical inducer of dimerization (CID), leading to apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. Unlike HSV-tk, iCasp9 is active in non-dividing cells. iCasp9-based systems are being evaluated as safety switches for chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) engineering and therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. In recent studies from the CAR-T field, Mestermann et al. employed the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib to suppress T-cell receptor signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. However, dasatinib has been shown to be toxic in skeletal muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. Furthermore, dasatinib does not completely remove CAR-T from circulation, rather it suppresses activity.

More recently, through engineering the inserts for increased in vivo expression and using more advanced systems like adaptive CELLECTRA&#x02122; electroporation, improved levels of in vivo antibody expression have been reported in many animal studies. The adaptive electroporation utilizes a direction-changing field, with depth-sensing novel technology and integrated resistance sensing.

Additional study is necessary in order to understand the biological reason for these expression differences and improve on strategies to develop single-plasmid pDNA-mAbs as well as other modifications.

Patel et al. made the first observation that in vitro pDNA-mAb expression data did not correlate with in vivo expression levels using the DMAb platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. For example, recombinant anti-Ebola glycoprotein (GP) mAb 4G7 is a challenging antibody to manufacture in vitro; however, it is feasible through modified cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>]. However, the original version of DMAb-4G7 had no expression in vivo as a human IgG1 pDNA-mAb. Patel et al. introduced single amino acid modifications into the Fab framework region to optimize DMAb-4G7 to restore in vivo expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Similar modifications were introduced into the framework of an anti-CTLA4 DMAb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>] and anti-HIV DMAbs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] to achieve highly optimized in vivo expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. Therefore, sequence optimizations have clearly played a critical role in in vivo expression of synthetic pDNA-mAbs. Further studies evaluating the contribution of amino acid modifications at the cellular level will provide highly valuable insights into the biology of in vivo-delivered antibodies. Like traditional antibody studies, approaches that reduce the immunogenicity of amino acid substitutions will also be valuable. Taken together, these modifications introduce a new approach to selectively modify pDNA-mAbs that would otherwise be discarded by traditional sequence liability screening methods, opening new avenues for delivery of highly potent and important antibodies.</p><p id="Par27">Additionally, many of the Fc modifications identified in traditional antibody research can be applied to synthetic pDNA-mAbs.

Other strategies to increase the duration of biologic antibodies in vivo include modifications in the Fc region that will increase interactions with the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>].

Although blinatumomab is highly promising in people, the BiTE has a short half-life of approximately 2&#x000a0;h. The current regimen requires IV delivery for 28 consecutive days and costs about US$90,000 per 28-day course of treatment for patients 45&#x000a0;kg and above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>]. Therefore, a plasmid-encoded delivered BiTE would undoubtedly improve upon the relative short expression time length and could significantly lower the cost of such an important treatment. Building on previous DMAb studies, Perales-Puchalt et al. engineered a DNA-encoded bispecific T-cell engager (DBTE) that binds to CD3 T cells and the Her2 tumor target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>]. This study demonstrated consistent in vivo expression and cytotoxic activity for approximately 4&#x000a0;months, with potent functional activity showing 8/10 tumor regression/clearance in mice&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;40&#x000a0;days after tumor challenge.</p><p id="Par34">Stadler et al. encoded a similar bispecific antibody in mRNA, encoding&#x000a0;the tumor-associated antigen claudin, a tight junction protein and epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), which is overexpressed in colorectal, prostate, ovarian, and endometrial cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>]. They detected the&#x000a0;translated mRNA bispecific antibody, with CD3 and claudin or EpCAM-binding capability, in as little as 6&#x000a0;h&#x000a0;following intravenous delivery; plasma at the 6-h time point showed in vitro cytotoxicity at above 90%, with expression still present at the 50% level through day 6 post-injection of mRNA. In vivo data demonstrated three mRNA doses of 3&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mouse by IV injection compared to ten doses of 200&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/kg of recombinant CD3 and claudin protein had comparable median tumor volume. The mRNA-encoded bispecific antibody showed earlier and rapid tumor regression, with fewer overall doses. Overall, both mRNA-encoded bispecific antibodies and DBTE pDNA-mAb approaches offer the ability to harness T-cell functionality in blocking tumor antigen function and initiating potent cytotoxicity, but vary in length of expression, stability, and dosing regimen, with DNA having longer and more durable expression from a single injection compared to mRNA. These are interesting and promising and likely complementary strategies for cancer immunotherapy that deserve significant attention.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Infectious Disease Control</title><p id="Par35">There is tremendous potential for mAb delivery to have an impact in the infectious diseases arena.

Two additional mAbs, raxibacumab and obiltoxaximab, have been approved for treatment of inhalational anthrax via the FDA Animal Efficacy Rule. The Animal Rule serves as a mechanism to gain approval for drugs and biologics using animal data in situations where it is not feasible or ethical to perform human studies. This mechanism is therefore reserved for unique circumstances such as evaluation of countermeasures against biological select agents. Although many antibodies are currently under preclinical and clinical trial evaluation, in vivo mAb potency, dosage, delivery, and patient cost remain important obstacles that impede administration for the treatment of infectious diseases. Current antibody limitations impede widespread delivery for seasonal outbreaks and epidemics for influenza viruses. Repeat doses are required to lower HIV viral loads. The development and manufacturing timeline for rapid response to emerging infectious disease outbreaks, for example, Ebolavirus, is long and requires cold-chain storage, which may limit deployment in resource-limited areas. Therefore, in vivo nucleic acid-encoded antibody delivery represents an attractive approach for antibody administration targeting infectious diseases.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Viral Infections and Speed to Intervention</title><p id="Par36">Both DNA- and mRNA-mAbs represent potential rapid delivery platforms for emerging infectious disease control. Both platforms start with initial antigen-specific mAb sequence identification. For pDNA-mAbs, antibody sequences are nucleotide and amino acid optimized using in silico methods, followed by rapid gene synthesis and insertion into the DNA vector backbone. pDNA-mAb DNA can then be amplified in small or large batches, and is ready for in vivo delivery within a short timeline (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The process for mRNA-mAb development is similar, but requires additional manufacturing steps. Antibody sequences are engineered into a DNA plasmid that includes a 5&#x02032;UTR, 3&#x02032;UTR, and polyadenylation signal. This is followed by plasmid DNA amplification in bacteria. mRNA-mAbs must then be transcribed from the DNA and formulated and then re-purified and stored for administration in an LNP. This last step is critical for mRNA stability and extends the timeline for delivery in vivo.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Nucleic acid-encoded mAb timeline.

The anti-A/HA DMAbs demonstrated protection against seasonal H1 and H3 viruses, as well as neutralization of several group 1 and group 2 subtypes. Similarly, anti-B/HA DMAbs protected against both B/Yamagata and B/Victoria lineage virus infection in mice. Additionally, a combination of both anti-A/HA and anti-B/HA DMAbs protected against both A/California/7/2009 and B/Florida/4/2006 virus challenges, demonstrating the potential for co-delivery, and protected against homologous re-challenge.

Following a series of optimizations, expression increased to a 4&#x02013;7 &#x000b5;g/mL (summary of data from non-human primates receiving 2&#x02013;9 mg total DNA in 4&#x02013;6 injection sites) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, magenta), and additional device/delivery optimizations, including hyaluronidase treatment, have led to further increases, now to levels &#x0003e;&#x000a0;30 &#x000b5;g/mL (6&#x000a0;mg total DNA injection, six injections), which express for 35 days before elimination via the development of macaque anti-human antibodies (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, teal). Wise et al. demonstrated that using an optimized delivery strategy with a 6-mg dose, divided across six injection sites, anti-HIV DMAb delivery can achieve in vivo expression levels as high as 34.4 &#x000b5;g/mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. These expression levels parallel mRNA expression levels, which are at &#x0003e;&#x000a0;30&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL in rhesus macaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>]. Only AAV can surpass these levels in macaques; however, virus take in animals is reported to be not consistent with AAV, and there were wide variations in delivery observed, ranging from 0 to 270 &#x000b5;g/mL across multiple studies.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>DMAb expression NHPs following sequence, delivery, and formulation optimizations. <italic>DMAb</italic>&#x000a0;DNA-encoded mAb,&#x000a0;<italic>NHP</italic> non-human primate.

Plasmid DNA is transiently transfected into muscle and may persist in the tissue for a few weeks. Likewise, viral vectors typically persist in tissues for a few months, or permanently if integrated. This is quite different to a biologic, for which the maximum amount of drug is at the time of infusion. mRNA is most similar to traditional protein biologics, as it is rapidly expressed and degraded. Therefore, initial empiric dose escalation studies will be important to set the bar and move the field to optimal doses in the clinic. Additional optimizations including sequential administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], formulation, and delivery technology are rapidly developing and will likely contribute to increases in delivery in vivo.</p><p id="Par56">Recently, Priddy et al. evaluated in vivo administration of an AAV-vector encoding the anti-HIV PG9 (AAV-PG9) antibody in people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">132</xref>]. No expression of PG9 was detected in participants&#x02019; sera, although PG9 was detected in muscle biopsies. One possibility for the lack of detection is the high enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) limit of detection (2.5&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL), and more sensitive assays are likely needed as development continues. Furthermore, ADA was observed against both the AAV vector and PG9, suggesting that it did induce an immune response. More studies are needed in this regard to build on this initial study.</p><p id="Par57">A first-in-human phase I trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic expression of the anti-E protein Zika virus DMAb (INO-A002) is currently underway (NCT03831503; trial start date: February 7, 2019; estimated study completion: February 2021). In this study, dose escalation starting at 0.5&#x000a0;mg up to 4&#x000a0;mg of INO-A002 is being evaluated in healthy human volunteers. Supported by the preclinical data in mice and macaques, the human study will deliver DMAb in formulation with recombinant human hyaluronidase to improve drug dispersion. In parallel, a first-in-human mRNA-mAb phase I trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of an mRNA-encoded anti-CHIKV antibody (mRNA-1944) is also underway led by Moderna (NCT03829384; trial start date: January 22, 2019; estimated study completion: September 2020). This study will evaluate dose escalations starting with 0.1 up to 1&#x000a0;mg/kg via IV administration. At a recent presentation at the Oligonucleotide Therapy Society (2019), Moderna presented mRNA-1944 data demonstrating expression in people at levels&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;1&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL even in the lowest dose group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Following IV infusion with mRNA-1944, peak expression was reached within 24&#x000a0;h, declining afterwards, with detectable levels for at least 84&#x000a0;days, with the 0.3&#x000a0;mg/kg dose. Patients were treated with anti-histamine, and at 0.6-mg/kg doses there were multiple adverse events observed. However, this trial is a very positive development for nucleic acid biologics. While much more work is needed, this study is an important advance for the field. Together, these trials will be informative to help understand additional optimizations that must be undertaken to improve human translation of nucleic acid-encoded antibodies and will be significant for the field.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Looking Forward</title><p id="Par58">The clinical use of mAbs has had a dramatic impact on improving human health and affording a better quality of life for many individuals. However, use has been restricted to disease populations with high commercial value, due in part to the high cost of development of these biologics. The future for pDNA-mAbs and gene-encoded antibodies is promising and presents interesting opportunities to make life-saving biologics more accessible. pDNA-mAbs build on existing antibody technologies and can be engineered to deliver new types of biologics, such as bispecifics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], trispecifics, and alternative forms and isotypes. Other modifications including half-life extension to improve interactions with the neonatal FcRs and glycosylation profiles would be highly informative for modulation of in vivo duration and effector functions. Further in vivo modification may be accomplished through co-delivery of different enzymes to direct post-translational processing. pDNA-mAbs and mRNA are opening a new direction in the field that was previously limited to biologics, with powerful potential applications for in vivo delivery, including new classes of non-immunoglobulin biologics such as T-cell and other cell engagers, as part of this new approach for advancing a novel area of &#x0201c;nucleic acid-based medicines.&#x0201d; The initial studies described in this review represent the tip of the iceberg for their potential applications, as we are just entering the clinic. While early, these highly disruptive nucleic acid technologies have the potential to transform our approaches to the development of biologics, opening up new areas of opportunity for disease treatments of global importance for patients and for animal health.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>The original version of this article was revised: Due to Open Access change from CC BY-NC to CC BY</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Change history</bold></p><p>4/2/2020</p><p>The article In Vivo Delivery of Nucleic Acid-Encoded Monoclonal Antibodies, written by Ami Patel, Mamadou A.
