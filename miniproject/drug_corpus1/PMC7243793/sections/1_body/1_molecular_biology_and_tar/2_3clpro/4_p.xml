<p id="p0070">Interestingly, some compounds binding to the active site of the 3CLpro—using a noncovalent mechanism—have been established. A high-throughput screening (HTS) identified pyrazolidinone (
 <bold>5</bold>), which displayed 1,3,5-triaryl substitution patterns, as SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors.

 </xref> α-aminoacylamides were identified by an HTS, and a strong stereochemical effect was noted. The simple one-pot accessible scaffold by an Ugi-four component condensation was the key to rapidly generate structure activity relationship (SAR) for the putative P2-P1 and P1 subgroups. An optimized version ML188 (
 <bold>7</bold>) was designated as the probe status (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> ). A P3 truncated version of 
 <bold>8</bold> allowing for significant molecular weight (MW) reduction without diminishing potency was developed as a second probe ML300 (
 <bold>9</bold>) with potent enzyme inhibition and cellular activity. These compounds comprise rare examples of a noncovalent SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitor of moderate MW with good enzyme and antiviral inhibitory activity. However, these molecules suffer from extensive metabolism and rapid clearance. Nonetheless, they are a promising starting point for further drug development.
