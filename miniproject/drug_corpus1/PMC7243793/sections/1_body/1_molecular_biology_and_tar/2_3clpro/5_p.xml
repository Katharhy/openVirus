<p id="p0075">Even if such compounds cannot be rapidly developed to cope with the current situation, their development is highly warranted to be prepared for likely future CoV outbreaks. It is noteworthy that different computational approaches, including machine learning, have been published to propose approved drugs potentially binding to 3CLpro (drug repurposing).

 </xref> One such approach virtually screened commercial medicines in the DrugBank database for binding into the active site of Mpro.

 </xref> Ten different commercial medicines were proposed that might form hydrogen bonds to key residues within the binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, which might have higher mutation tolerance than lopinavir or ritonavir.
