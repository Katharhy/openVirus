<p id="p0125">Mutations in the S protein are the ones causing the zoonosis, and as a result, not all of them will lead to their binding to ACE2. Therefore, drugs targeting the S protein-ACE2 interaction might not apply to some of the future CoVs. On the other hand, the spike-shaped protein on the surface of the viruses causing SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 provides a tantalizing target for antibodies or other compounds, which could prevent CoVs from invading human cells.
