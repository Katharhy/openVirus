<p id="p0090">The coronaviral PLpro is another attractive antiviral drug target because it is essential for CoV replication. The structure, function, and inhibition of the SARS-CoV PLpro has been extensively reviewed.

 </xref> Although the primary function of PLpro and 3CLpro is to process the viral polyprotein in a coordinated manner, PLpro has the additional function of stripping ubiquitin and ISG15 from host-cell proteins to help CoV to evade the host innate immune responses. Therefore, it was recently argued that targeting PLpro with antiviral drugs might have an advantage in not only inhibiting viral replication but also inhibiting the dysregulation of signaling cascades in infected cells that might lead to cell death in surrounding, uninfected cells.
