<p>No specific treatment has yet been developed for coronavirus infections, despite the enormous advances in antiviral drug therapy in recent years. Chronic diseases such as infections with HIV or hepatitis B virus can now be treated with virustatics. These substances bring about long-term suppression of viral replication—and in the case of chronic hepatitis C, cure. Drugs are also available for acute viral infections. Treatment with aciclovir can save the life of a patient with herpes encephalitis. Nucleoside analogs may shorten the course of a herpes simplex infection, but the effect tends to be minor in patients with an intact immune system. The course of influenza can be slightly abbreviated by neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir, but only if treatment is initiated very early. As a number of placebo-controlled studies have shown, no additional benefit is achieved—in a patient with functioning immune defenses—when administration of the drug is delayed to even just a few days after onset of infection.</p>
