<p>Some pharmacological substances are known to possess high activity against coronaviruses in vitro, but their efficacy and tolerability remain to be explored. Since most cases of COVID-19 run a mild course, it has to be clarified whether administration of virustatics would be advisable in such cases and whether early initiation of treatment would be essential. This requires careful consideration of the benefits versus the risks. In most cases of COVID-19 it first becomes clear after a few days whether the infection is spreading to the lower respiratory tract, i.e., whether pneumonia will ensue. Trials are therefore necessary to determine whether efficacy can be demonstrated also when treatment is commenced later.</p>
