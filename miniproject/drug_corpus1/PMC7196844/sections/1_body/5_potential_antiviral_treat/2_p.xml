<p>Glucocorticoid treatment was tried two decades ago in patients with SARS, but turned out not to be beneficial because it delayed elimination of the virus. Treatment with corticosteroids is also not recommended for COVID-19 (

This substance can be administered to treat infections with respiratory syncytial (RS) viruses or chronic hepatitis C. In patients with SARS it was usually given in combination with glucocorticoids. Clinically and also radiologically confirmed successful treatment was reported, but none of the studies included a control group, so it remains uncertain whether the medications took effect or whether recovery was spontaneous. The situation is similar for the administration of some antiretrovirals, such as lopinavir and nelfinavir, that were developed for the treatment of HIV infection.
