<p>Genome analysis of the new viruses has shown that—despite a number of mutations—there are structural analogies between the binding sites of the SARS virus and SARS-CoV-2. For the new viruses too, ACE2 serves as receptor and thus as entry point to the human body (
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). A crucial part is also played by a serine protease in the host cells: this enzyme, known as transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), enables fusion with the host cell and is thus an important factor in the dissemination of influenza viruses and coronaviruses in the cells of the human body.
