<p>Viruses cannot replicate outside cells. They therefore need access to the cells of a host organism before they can spread. Transmission of a zoonosis to humans implies the existence of a (new) route by which it infiltrates human cells. The SARS virus uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the lungs as receptor, docking by means of the spikes on its envelope. In the renin–angiotensin system, ACE2 serves to counter the action of ACE, which is well known in pharmacology as a target structure for antihypertensives (ACE inhibitors). ACE2 can metabolize both angiotensin I and angiotensin II. The resultant angiotensin- (
