  <title>Phylogenetics applied to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) molecular epidemiology investigation revealed the history of the virus dissemination among humans. (A) Phylogenetic tree of HIV-1 and related simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) sequences reveals the multiple virus cross-species transmission events that originated HIV-1 groups. (B) The successful global spread of HIV-1 group M and fast diversification in multiple phylogenetic lineages. Figure depicts the current 10 subtypes and the most widely spread recombinant form CRF02_AG. (C) Phylogenetic tree representing the virus dispersion of a given HIV-1 subtype in space and time, which can reveal transmission routes between and within geographic locations represented by different branch colours. (D) When sampling coverage is high, phylogenies are informative to investigate transmissions in the social space, also known as HIV-1 transmission network reconstruction. The figure shows a hypothetical contact network, where sampled individuals (in purple) formed a closely related cluster in the tree.</title>
