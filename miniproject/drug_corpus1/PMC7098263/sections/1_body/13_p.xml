<p>Phylodynamics analyses combined with birth-death models could be a useful tool to elucidate the impact of preventive or therapeutic strategies on localised HIV epidemics. A recent study dated back the origin of a Belgian HIV-1 subtype F1 epidemic among men having sex with men (MSM) to the early 2000s and suggested that its extensive growth was controlled about 10 years later, most likely due to highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prevention.

 </xref> Another study estimated that major shifts in HIV-1 transmission for subtypes B and G Portuguese clades occurred around the late 1990s and early 2000s, also coinciding with the introduction of ART and the scale-up of harm reduction for IDU.

 </xref> Analyses of the HIV-1 subtype C epidemic in heterosexual population from southern Brazil support that major changes in viral transmission dynamics (transient epidemic stabilisation and resume epidemic increase) coincides with peopleâ€™s behavioral changes driven by implementation of prevention efforts and perception of risk for HIV transmission.

 </xref> Phylodynamics analyses of viral sequences recovered from newly HIV-infected individuals will certainly contribute to detect rapidly expanding HIV-1 lineages and to assess the impact of public health interventions on localised and country-wide epidemics on real time.
