<p>Phylodynamics studies were also employed to resolve country-level dissemination dynamics of new and established HIV lineages. Illustrating this approach, two studies explored the origin of HIV-1 CRFs lineages recently detected in Brazil that mostly circulate in West (CRF02_AG) and Central (CRF45_cpx) Africa.

 </xref> The estimated onset dates of the CRF02_AG and CRF45_cpx local clades indicated that these CRFs were circulating in Brazil for about 20-30 years before their detection by the public health surveillance system. Those studies revealed that the CRF02_AG and CRF45_cpx Brazilian epidemics did not resulted from rapid expansion of recently introduced viruses, but from slow dissemination of ancient viral introductions combined with delayed detection by the public health system.
