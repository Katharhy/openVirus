<p>When a dense body of clinical and demographic data from patients is available, the source attribution methods could be used to find potential transmission pairs and resolve the timing and direction of the infection. Ratmann et al.

 </xref> used this approach to study the HIV transmission dynamics among MSM in a Dutch cohort and found that 71% of the transmissions have origin in undiagnosed man. This highlights that the prevention potential of immediate ART is limited without an approach that includes intensification of HIV testing and also points out the importance of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as an effective intervention among this population. Maybe the most ambitious application of phylogenetics and molecular epidemiology on HIV is the real-time (or near-real-time) monitoring of HIV transmission networks growth. In British Columbia, Canada, an automated HIV monitoring system is helping to track the virus dissemination and was shown to be effective in reducing transmitted HIV drug resistance.

 </xref> Implementation of such approach requires integration across clinical, laboratory, sequence analysis and public health teams (which will ultimately conduct interventions).
