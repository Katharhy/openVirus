<p>Phylogenetics has also greatly improved our understanding of the early spread of the HIV-1 group M, particularly during the period of cryptic dissemination in human populations. Circulation of the HIV-1 group M in humans was first detected in the United States of America and Europe in the early 1980s, shortly after recognition of the AIDS epidemic.

 </xref> Genetic evidence, however, revealed that this HIV-1 group was already present in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) by the late 1950s, tracing the most recent common ancestor of all HIV-1 group M strains back to a human host that probably lived in Kinshasa (capital of the DRC) in the beginning of the twentieth century.

 </xref> The most recent phylogeographic study supports that during the pre-epidemic phase the HIV-1 group M primary spread from Kinshasa, reaching the neighboring city of Brazzaville (capital of the Republic of Congo) and southern DRC locations (Lubumbashi and Mbuji-Mayi) by the late 1930s, and central (Bwamanda) and northern (Kisangani) DRC locations by the middle 1940s and the early 1950s, respectively.
