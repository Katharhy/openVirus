<p>In an attempt to reconstruct the HIV transmission events in a population, the better the sampling coverage, the closer to reality is the inferred network. In this sense, most of the studies in this field have used databases compiled by national services for screening of drug-resistance mutations (genotyping), which generate HIV partial genome sequences for virtually every individual entering/failing therapy. Focusing on highly supported phylogenetic clusters mostly compose by local (from a single country) individuals, Hué et al.

 </xref> reported the importance of multiple subtype B lineages circulating in separate transmission networks in the United Kingdom (UK) and also how the growth rate decrease of these networks was more likely to be correlated to behavior changes than to the introduction of ART. Still in UK, Hughes et al.

 </xref> estimated that clustering rates and the number of transmissions happening in the acute phase were much smaller among heterosexual then in the men who have sex with men (MSM) group. In Switzerland, Koyous et al.

 </xref> revealed the importance of IDU in spreading HIV to heterosexual individuals during the 1980’s and the diminishing role of this relationship over time.
