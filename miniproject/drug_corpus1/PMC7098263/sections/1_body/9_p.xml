<p>The global dissemination of the pandemic-subtypes/CRFs resulted in local epidemics that usually differ in epidemic size and geographic range. Since temporal changes in the spatial dispersion and population size of HIV-infected individuals leave an imprint on HIV genetic diversity and phylogenetic patterns, we can use model-based phylodynamic inference methods to track the phylogeographic and demographic history of the HIV-1 epidemic within a defined area [
