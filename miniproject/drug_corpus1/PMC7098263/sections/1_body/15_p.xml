<p>The absence of proofreading activity of the viral reverse transcriptase and fast replication rate make mutations to accumulate in HIV genomes in an epidemiological timescale.

 </xref> This not only means that we can trace HIV dissemination throughout wide territories (as continent or countries) along the decades, but also that the genetic diversity accumulates faster enough to reconstruct the viral transmission network, which describes the history of infections at the resolution of individual cases. The basic assumption is that closely related viruses in a phylogenetic tree is an indication that the hosts are connected by a common source, a direct or a short chain of transmissions [

In the recent years, the use of phylogenetic analysis combined with the huge availability of HIV sequences has become an increasingly important research area to reconstruct HIV transmission networks and understand transmission dynamics in concentrated and generalised epidemics.
