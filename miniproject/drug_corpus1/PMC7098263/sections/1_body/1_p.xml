<p>The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has been spreading in human populations over the last 100 years and is responsible for most of the global HIV/AIDS pandemic. Phylogenetic analyses of simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) sequences from different species of non-human primates and of HIV-1 sequences from Central African countries were decisive to elucidate the origin of this pandemic human virus. Those analyses revealed that the four HIV-1 phylogenetic clades termed groups (M, N, O and P) have resulted from different cross-species transmission events of SIV from chimpanzees (
 <italic>Pan troglodytes</italic>) and gorillas (
 <italic>Gorilla gorilla)</italic> to humans.

 <italic>Pan troglodytes troglodytes</italic> and 
 <italic>Gorilla gorilla gorilla</italic>, endemic from Cameroon, were pointed as the sources of the zoonotic transmissions to humans, originating the groups M and N, and O and P, respectively [
