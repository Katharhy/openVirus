<p>Some studies point that variance in the dispersion routes of HIV-1 subtypes and CRFs was probably shaped by spatial and geopolitical factors that affected human activities in the second half of the 20th century, such as migration, tourism and trade.

 </xref> Future studies comparing the evolutionary and population dynamics of different HIV-1 subtypes/CRFs spreading in the same populations would be necessary to fully understand the factors that shape the contrasting epidemic success of different HIV-1 clades.
