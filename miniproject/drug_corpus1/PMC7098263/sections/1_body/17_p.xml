 </xref> expanded these findings by modeling heterogeneity of transmission and sampling rates among HIV infected subpopulations, reporting that phylogenetic clusters tend to be enriched with individuals sampled soon after the infection. In other words, transmission networks, as defined by a phylogenetic cluster with high statistical support and small within clade genetic distance, might better represent individuals highly engaged in accessing primary care, instead of vulnerable subpopulations burdened by high transmission rates. Thus, caution is needed when interpreting and analysing phylogenetic-based HIV-1 transmission networks.
