<p>Phylodynamics analyses also helped to elucidate the origin and populationsâ€™ dynamics of HIV-1 lineages spreading within small communities. One example was the characterisation of an HIV outbreak in children from a Libyan hospital that occurred in 1998, suspected to have originated from the malicious intervention of foreign medical staff.

 </xref> The authors found that the CRF02_AG outbreak affecting Libyan children arose from a single viral introduction from West Africa before March 1998 and that many of the HIV infections already occurred before the foreign medical staff arrived, excluding their participation in the initial transmissions. Another example was the characterisation of a spatially localised iatrogenic outbreak occurred in rural Cambodia in 2014-2015, suspected to be caused by an unlicensed health practitioner.

 </xref> The iatrogenic hypothesis was confirmed by the phylodynamics analysis that date the origin of the outbreak to September 2013 and estimated that the transmission reached a peak of 15 new HIV infections per day one year later, declining thereafter, coinciding with the date of arrest of the practitioner by the police.
