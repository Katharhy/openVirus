<p>Phylogenetics analysis has been successful in identifying and analysing HIV-1 transmission networks, especially when sampling covers a great proportion of the infected population and when combined with detailed epidemiological and clinical data. Consequently, most studies describe transmission dynamics in developed countries, while significant sequencing efforts are still needed to phylogenetic methods be able to capture HIV transmission networks where the epidemic is worst. In an intermediate position, middle income countries might find in the phylogenetic approach a way to design better public health campaigns to halt HIV dissemination. Brazil, for instance, has one of the biggest public health systems in the world and access to ART is free and universal, with genotyping service deployed for those who fail therapy. This could be a good source of data to investigate HIV transmission dynamics in the country and complement the scarce literature on this topic.
