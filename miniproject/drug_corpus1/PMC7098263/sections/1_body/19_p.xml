<p>While phylogenetics has been increasingly deployed to study HIV transmission dynamics in developed countries with concentrated epidemics, where viral sequences are routinely sampled, few studies were able to apply these tools in resource-limited locations, where the epidemic is generalised and HIV has the greatest burden. The main limitation is the lack of a good sampling coverage of these locations, for example, African countries has more than 60% of the HIV infection cases in the world, but less than 30% of the public available sequences. Yet, cohort studies like the HIV Incidence Provincial Surveillance System (HIPSS) and the Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS) has enlighten important features of HIV dissemination in geographic settings with huge epidemics like South Africa and Uganda, respectively.
