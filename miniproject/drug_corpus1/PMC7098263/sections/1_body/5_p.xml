<p>Around 1960, HIV-1 group M transitioned to a second phase of faster exponential growth that coincides with the geographical expansion of group M out of the DRC.

 </xref> The introduction and subsequent genetic diversification of some group M strains into new geographic regions resulted in strongly supported phylogenetic clades within the group M diversity, referred to as “subtypes” (A to D, F to H, J, K and L) [

 </xref> In addition, some inter-subtype recombinant strains named as “Circulating Recombinant Forms” (CRFs) were also spread across different individuals and branched as well-supported clades within the group M phylogenetic tree.

 </xref> While some subtypes (A to F) and CRFs (CRF01_AE and CRF02_AG) are globally disseminated and should thus be defined as pandemic variants, others are mostly restricted to central Africa and/or to a single country and are regarded as endemic-subtypes and local CRFs.
