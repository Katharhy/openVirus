<p>Phylodynamics could provide important epidemiological insights about HIV-1 epidemics affecting a vast geographic area. This approach, for example, was used to resolve the spatiotemporal dynamics of the HIV-1 subtype A variant that dominates the epidemic in the former Soviet Union (A
 <sub>FSU</sub>) and of the non-pandemic subtype B variants prevalent in the Caribbean region (B
 <sub>CAR</sub>).
