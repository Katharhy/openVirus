    "Cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are escalating rapidly across the globe, with the mortality risk being especially high among those with existing illness and multi-morbidity. The immunosuppressed status of some cancer patients increases their risk of infection compared with the general population, and cancer treatment within 2Â weeks of COVID-19 diagnosis was reported as a risk factor for developing severe events. Palliative care workers have an essential role in the response to COVID-19 by responding rapidly and flexibly; ensuring protocols for symptom management are available, considering redeploying staffs and volunteers to provide psychosocial and bereavement care and using technology to communicate with patients and carers."
