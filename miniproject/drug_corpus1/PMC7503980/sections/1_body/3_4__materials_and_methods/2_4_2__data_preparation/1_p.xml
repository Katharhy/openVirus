<p>Protein sequences were downloaded from the UniProt database (
 <uri xlink:href="https://www.uniprot.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.uniprot.org/</uri>) with the following accession numbers: Gaba alpha subunit, P14867 
 <sc>d</sc>-alanyl-
 <sc>d</sc>-alanine carboxypeptidase Q75Y35, Angiotensin-converting enzyme P12821, HIV 1 Integrase Q7ZJM1, 30S ribosomal protein S9 P0A7X3, Vasopressin V2 receptor P30518. The FASTA COVID-19 M
 <sup>pro</sup> sequence was downloaded from RCSB, PDB ID 6LU7 and the corresponding IS was calculated. A set of 1490 approved Drugbank [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-03830" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] drugs with corresponding SMILES was subjected to IS and CS calculation with M
 <sup>pro</sup>. All calculations were carried out using our in-house software.
