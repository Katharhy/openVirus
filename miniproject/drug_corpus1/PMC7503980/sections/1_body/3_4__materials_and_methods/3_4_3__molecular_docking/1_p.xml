<p>Molecular docking of selected candidates into the crystal structure of M
 <sup>pro</sup> was carried out. The receptor three-dimensional structure was downloaded from RCSB, PDB ID 6LU7 [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-25-03830" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. All ligands, waters and ions were removed from PDB file. Two grid boxes with dimensions 24 × 24 × 24 Å were set to span all amino acid residues interacting with co-crystallized inhibitor N3 in case of the catalytic site. For the allosteric domain, it was set to span the residues interacting in the dimer interface. The (x, y, z) centers of the grid boxes were (−11.775, 13.910, 66.706) for the catalytic site and (−22.521, 1.749, 50.782) for the allosteric domain. Selected drugs from the previous step were converted from SMILES to 3D SDF and further to PDB files, and protonated at physiological pH. Geometry optimization was carried out in MOPAC 2016 [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-03830" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] at PM7 level of theory [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-03830" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Default software settings for hydrophobic and hydrophilic terms in docking search function were used. Exhaustiveness was set to 50. Molecular docking was carried out in Autodock Vina [
