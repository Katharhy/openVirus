<p>A number of drugs selected in our study as repositioning candidates that potentially bind to the catalytic site were also identified in other 
 <italic>in silico</italic> studies that analyzed the same target. In the molecular docking study, bacampicillin was among the best repurposed drugs against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 [
