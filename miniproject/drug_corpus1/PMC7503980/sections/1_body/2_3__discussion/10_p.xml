<p>The use of structural models of proteinâ€“drug complexes, combined with the ISM-SM approach, can improve inhibitors against M
 <sup>pro</sup>. Novel or modified ligands should maintain ISM spectrum features of the known inhibitors by targeting a specific domain in M
 <sup>pro</sup> (i.e., containing reported frequency values in their CS). The next step, involving short-range interaction approaches, should be oriented not only towards modifications that strengthen interactions with amino acid residues of the binding site. The introduction of functional groups that interact with near residues, identified in specific domains by ISM, should also be considered.
