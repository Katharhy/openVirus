<p>In addition, by calculating CS of the drug, its main target and M
 <sup>pro</sup>, we give a proof of the concept of our method, implicating that the drug targets both proteins. For instance, in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-03830">Figure S9</xref> is presented CS of mezlocillin, M
 <sup>pro</sup>, and 
 <sc>d</sc>-alanyl-
 <sc>d</sc>-alanine carboxypeptidase (Uniprot code Q75Y35), one of its main targets. For all three entities, the common frequency value in CS is at F(0.1923). CS of docking top hits, M
 <sup>pro</sup>, and their main targets are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-03830">Figures S8â€“S14 (in the Supplementary Materials)</xref>.
