<p>MS-based metabolomics studies targeted or untargeted metabolites (e.g., carbohydrates, amino acids, organic acids, amines, nucleotides, aliphatic, and aromatic compounds) and their perturbation with disease or infection.

 </sup> Metabolites are transformed chemical entities during cellular metabolism and serve as direct signatures of biochemical activity; therefore, their levels are exquisitely sensitive to a wide range of perturbations linked to disease onset, infection, and/or pathogenesis.

 </sup> MS-based untargeted metabolomics is performed as a global analysis of metabolite profiles in any given biological material and has the potential to uncover thousands of metabolites and link them to their cellular networks.

 </sup> MS-based metabolomics has been applied in several pandemic and epidemic diseases to identify potential therapeutic targets. For example, LC–HRMS-based metabolomics has been used to identify chemical ligands that can block nucleoprotein, a promising antiviral druggable target of Ebola and Marburg viruses.

 </sup> Using UHPLC–Q-TOF MS based global metabolomics, Tian et al. observed that H1N1 influenza virus modulates energy metabolism including TCA cycle, lipid, nucleotide, and glutathione metabolism to efficiently carry out its life cycle in the host cell.
