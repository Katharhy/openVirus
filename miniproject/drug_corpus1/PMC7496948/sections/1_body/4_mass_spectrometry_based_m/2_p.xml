<p>In COVID-19 patients, using an LC-ESI-MS/MS-based targeted metabolomics approach, Wu et al. reported malic acid of the TCA cycle, carbamoyl phosphate of the urea cycle, and guanosine monophosphate (GMP) of nucleotide biosynthesis were profoundly altered in COVID-19 fatal patients (

 </sup> In a separate study, using UPLC–MS/MS-based untargeted metabolomics, Shen et al. performed molecular profiling of COVID-19 sera and identified significant activation of the kynurenine pathway with elevated kynurenate, kynurenine, and 8-methoxykynurenate in COVID-19 patients. In contrast, another study found decreased levels of choline and its derivative phosphocholine as well as global suppression of amino acids, and derivatives such as glutamate, arginine,

 <sc>l</sc>-glutamate, urea, fumarate, argininate, asymmetric dimethylarginine, symmetric dimethylarginine, homoarginine, and 
 <italic>N</italic>-acetylarginine were observed in the sera of nonsevere COVID-19 patients compared to healthy (

 </sup> Similarly, using both UHPLC–MS-based targeted and untargeted metabolomics, Thomas et al. identified increased levels of kynurenine, glucose, and free fatty acids but widespread decreased levels of nitrogen metabolism including creatine, creatinine, polyamine, and circulating amino acids in COVID-19 patients (

 </sup> As MS-based metabolomics techniques allow us to measure many metabolites relating to a wide variety of viral infection and pathogenesis, large-scale comprehensive studies on COVID-19 can assist scientific research to better understand this pandemic and potential treatments (
