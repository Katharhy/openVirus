<p>Glycomics analyzes the comprehensive study of glycomes, the entire complement of sugars, whether free or present in other molecules. Glyocosylation is one of the most common forms of post-translational modifications of proteins, but glycan are also key players in lipid modification such as in galactosylcerebrosides and phosphatidylinositols. In many cases, bacteria and viruses utilize carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions to infect the host, and this phenomena could be pertinent to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

 </sup> Extensive glycosylation of virus spike protein has been reported in MARS and SARS and offers a potential pathway to study for treatment.

 </sup> Indeed, heavy glycan occupancy along with three novel O-glycosylation sites was observed in ACE2 receptor infected by SARS-CoV-2.

 </sup> In another study, using LCâ€“MS, SARS-CoV-2 infection showed glycans mimic the polypeptide epitope that modulates Spike-ACE2 interactions.

 </sup> Based on limited studies of glycans role in COVID-19, one can infer that glycans are one of the key players not only in the viral envelope but also on host receptor binding. Hence, understanding glycoscience in SARS-CoV-2 infection is another meaningful window to guide current vaccine development policy for COVID-19 pandemic.
