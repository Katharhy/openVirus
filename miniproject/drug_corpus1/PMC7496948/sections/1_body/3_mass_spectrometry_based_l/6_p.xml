<p>Pandemic influenza as well as the emergence of novel respiratory viruses SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV cause acute respiratory symptoms due to the production of sputum, a lipid rich component, at the respiratory tract.

 </sup> It is evident from the discussion that bursts of lipid accumulation are likely due to viral replication kinetics. In contrast, a study identified development of hypolipidemia in patients with COVID-19 symptoms where the degree of hypolipidemia positively correlated with the disease severity.

 </sup> Overall, lipidomic studies have shown several critical insights about the role of diverse lipid molecules in COVID-19 pathogenesis. It will be a useful resource to correlate lipid profiles with therapy or vaccine outcomes as well as potential of drug targets to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, a larger study of COVID-19 patients with different clinical conditions should be subjected to global lipidome analysis to uncover the detailed role lipids play in COVID-19 patients (
