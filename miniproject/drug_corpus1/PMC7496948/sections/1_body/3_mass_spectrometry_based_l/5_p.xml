<p>As there is no specific vaccine/treatment available for COVID-19, knowledge from lipidome studies can be useful to develop druggable targets. For example, bioactive lipids such as oleoylethanolamide (OEA), arachidonic acid (AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are known from existing viral pathogenesis to inactivate enveloped viruses and inhibit microbial proliferation/replication.

 </sup> As SARS-CoV-2, SARS, and MERS are all enveloped viruses, AA, EPA, and DHA can be applied to inactivate these virus infections and their appropriate doses may reduce morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 and other similar conditions.
