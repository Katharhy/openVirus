<p>LCâ€“MS-based human blood plasma lipidome analysis identified that Ebola infection promotes profound modulation in global lipid profiles where PS, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), Cer, phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and diacylglycerol (DG) were shown as increased with fatalities and suggested potential therapeutics toward targeting lipids such as PS in antiviral therapy.

 </sup> Ultra-High performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-quadrupole-time of flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS)-based global lipidomics analysis of human Huh-7 cells uninfected or infected with MERS-CoV or HCoV-229E demonstrated that elevated levels of lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC), lysoPEs, and fatty acids (FAs) assisted with the replication of HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV viruses.

 </sup> As lipids play numerous indispensable cellular functions and are involved in multiple steps in the virus life cycle, a global understanding of the role lipids play in COVID-19 infection could provide potentially significant insights about virus pathogenesis and management. As a frontline study, using LC-ESI-MS/MS, Wu et al. identified that DGs, FAs, and triglycerides (TGs) were identified in higher abundance in the fatality group as well as increased with the deterioration of the disease. In contrast, phosphatidylcholines (PC) were found as gradually reduced lipids over the course of COVID-19 fatalities. Overall, this study observed dyslipidemia in COVID-19 patients and provides evidence of potential therapeutic strategies.
