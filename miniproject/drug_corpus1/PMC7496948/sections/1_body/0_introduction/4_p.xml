<p>Mass spectrometry (MS)-based integrated omics includes proteomics, glycomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics studies which provide a comprehensive snapshot of pathogen-induced changes to the host following infection, invasion, persistence, and pathogenesis and can prime the identification of novel therapeutic targets for preventing or lessening disease severity.

 </sup> Pathogen infection can be primed through the manipulation of host metabolism.

 </sup> Adaptation into the host metabolic landscape is a prerequisite for viral pathogen to replicate, thrive, and out-compete neighboring cells that they invade. Therefore, understanding the role of metabolism through viral pathogenesis is valuable for next generation therapy development. Here, we will provide current integrated knowledge of MS-based genomics, proteomics, glycomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics technologies in emerging pathogen studies, specifically focused on the opportunities and challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
