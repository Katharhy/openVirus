<p>Rapid pathogen identification is a key aspect in an infectious disease outbreak such as COVID-19 for appropriate preventative measures. However, current COVID-19 diagnostic techniques such as PCR or immunoassay is insufficient because of reagent shortages that can lead to a reduction in turnaround time for disease detection. Recent developments of direct MS such as segmented flow (SF)-MS and paper spray ionization (PSI)-MS have shown the potential for rapid, sensitive, highly reproducible, and comparable results to conventional LCâ€“MS in their ability to identify biomarkers in the diagnosis of cancer and the discrimination of various bacterial strains, respectively.

 </sup> Notably, PSI-MS has emerged as a rapid (&gt;30 s) analytical technique to discriminate bacterial strains from raw specimens with minimal to no sample preparation requirements; however, the capability of PSI-MS in viral detection has not been studied. PSI-MS should be explored as a method to differentiate different viral strains based on potential strain specific molecular signatures.
