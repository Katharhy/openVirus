<p>Discovery of biomarkers and investigation of altered molecular networks through an integrated “omics” approach could be a valuable tool for better understanding of COVID-19. As proteomics, glycomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics are end products of upstream genomic and transcriptomics activities, future research should focus on integrated omics in COVID-19 which could help to better understand the molecular mechanisms of infection, pathogenesis, and therapeutic targets. As antiviral strategies are broadly based on directly targeting the virus or indirectly targeting the virus via host molecular modulation, MS-based multiplexing technologies could open critical knowledge in these fields for defeating the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
