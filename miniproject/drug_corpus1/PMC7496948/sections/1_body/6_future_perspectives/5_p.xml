<p>It is likely that many different technologies will contribute to develop strategies for treatment such as antiviral compounds, bioactive molecules, purified plasma, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), viral molecule analogous compound, and vaccines to eventually prevent COVID-19. Besides MS technologies, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is also often use as a rapid, quantitative, and highly reproducible approach in a variety of systems biology research and could be applicable in disease outbreaks.

 </sup> However, MS-based technologies have incredible potential in this space. For example, mAbs has shown a wide range of therapeutic benefit in COVID-19.

 </sup> However, higher quality characterization of intact mAbs is important. Top-down MS-based proteomics isa comprehensive technique used to decipher intact protein structure with significantly higher detection efficiency of protein level sequence and post translational modifications (PTMs). Therefore, top-down MS can be utilized for global elucidation of mAbs structure and PTMs by fragmentation.
