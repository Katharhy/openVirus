<p>However, many MS instruments are either high cost to obtain or require a significant lab footprint to operate for many clinics. Hence, the development or translational of portable MS can be very important for clinical lab adoption as well as the potential for remote testing and screening. Indeed, miniaturized MS has been around for a decade as a fast and portable analytical tool in space research, security, and food science but it often faces the challenge of false expectations.
