<p>As a resource for MS-based COVID-19 research, this review explored the current knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 infections and pathogenesis in context to genomics, proteomics, glycomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics of diverse COVID-19 patient materials and cellular model systems. The rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 by fast and unambiguous testing is widely needed in response to the current outbreak.

 </sup> LCâ€“MS-based technologies have been predominantly employed since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to identify SARS-CoV-2 using proteomic markers, to understand drug targets, to evaluate drug efficacy, or to elucidate the molecular mechanism upon SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and disease severity. As COVID-19 continues to progress and the complexity of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and symptoms continues to grow, the strength and beneficial aspects of MS and its allied technologies should be utilized to better understand the COVID-19 pandemic. One of biggest challenge in current frontline PCR techniques for COVID-19 detection is its inability to detect mutation and unknown pathogens. PCR-based diagnostic testing is predominantly based on the identification of individual genetic targets. MS techniques such as PCR-ESI-MS (polymerase chain reaction coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry) represents a novel multiplexed method that has recently emerged for broad range pathogen testing. PCR-ESI-MS technology is capable of identifying nearly all known pathogens directly from clinical specimens as well as identifying genetic evidence/amplicon of unknown pathogens with a broad genetic amplification approach.

 </sup> Therefore, possibilities and advantages of PCR-ESI-MS should be explored in COVID-19 diagnostics.
