<p>Similarly, in metabolomics, the kynurenine pathway has been implicated as a key elevated metabolic dependency as well as suppression of amino acid pools in COVID-19 patients. In addition, metabolomics has been utilized to predict antiviral drug efficacy in COVID-19.

 </sup> Therefore, the level of metabolites should be actively explored with immune response, vaccine or drug efficacy. Diverse genetic or epigenetic factors have been identified with viral infection and pathogenesis and could be explored to better understand the host immune response and therapeutic target.

 </sup> Different post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation have shown association with diverse pathogen infection, and their role should also be investigated in context with SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease progression in COVID-19.

 </sup> Extracellular vehicles (EVs) such as exosomes have been identified as a molecular vehicle that can carry host and pathogen-derived nucleic acid, protein, metabolite, and lipid.

 </sup> Hence, the role of EVs in SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, transmission, and pathogenesis should be explored in COVID-19.
