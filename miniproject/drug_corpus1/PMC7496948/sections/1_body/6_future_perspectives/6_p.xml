<p>Biomarkers associated with COVID-19 disease severity or treatment should be actively explored through an MS-based multiplex approach. Downregulated apolipoproteins and elevated nucleotide metabolism has been identified as a molecular signature with COVID-19 disease severity and suggest that these metabolic vulnerabilities can be further validated from a therapeutic standpoint. Consistent with several other pandemic and epidemic diseases, lipidomics of COVID-19 patients has shown association of lipid levels with disease severity. The role of FAs, glycerolipid, glycerophospholipid, and sterol lipids should be investigated with severe or mild COVID-19 patients. Bioactive lipids have been implicated as antiviral agents. Hence, therapeutic aspects of bioactive lipids such as OEA, AA, EPA, and DHA should be further explored for treating COVID-19. Accumulation of ceramide has been shown to negatively affect viral pathogenesis including influenza virus. Therefore, the detailed role of ceramide and its potential therapeutic benefit should be explored in COVID-19.</p>
