  <p>MS-based metabolomics and lipidomics to study COVID-19. Recent metabolomics and lipidomics study on COVID-19 pandemic was used to develop this workflow. SARS-CoV-2 virus with different symptomatic patient conditions or infected cell models are shown. Typically, serum, plasma, and PBMCs from blood and other biomatrices such as urine, saliva, swab, and breath specimens can be utilized for targeted or untargeted metabolomics or lipidomics analysis in COVID-19 patients. MS spectral comparison followed by multivariate statistical analysis can be utilized to study metabolite or lipid-based biomarker with different level of COVID-19 severities. For detail about different COVID-19 metabolomic and lipidomic study sample preparation, data collection, and analysis, see
