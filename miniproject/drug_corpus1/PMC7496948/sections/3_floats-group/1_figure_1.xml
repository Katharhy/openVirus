  <p>MS-based proteomics to study COVID-19. Workflow developed based on recent proteomic analysis on COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 virus with different symptomatic patient conditions or infected cell model are shown. Typically, serum, plasma, and PBMCs from blood as well as urine, saliva, and nasal swabs have been utilized for targeted or untargeted proteomic analysis in COVID-19 patients. MS spectral comparison followed by multivariate statistical analysis can be applied for biomarker analysis with different levels of COVID-19 severities. For details about different COVID-19 proteomic sample preparation, data collection, and analysis, see
