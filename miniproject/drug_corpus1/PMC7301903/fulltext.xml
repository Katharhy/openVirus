considered as a life-threatening pandemic
viral infection. Finding an antiviral drug or a vaccine is the only
route for humans&#x02019; survival against it. To date, no specific
antiviral treatment has been confirmed. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs)
have been widely regarded as a promising solution to combat harmful
microorganisms. They are biologically active molecules produced by
different organisms as an essential component of their innate immune
response against invading pathogens. Lactoferrin (LF), one of the
AMPs, is an iron-binding glycoprotein that is present in several mucosal
secretions. The antiviral activity of LF exists against a wide range
of human and animal viruses (DNA and RNA). LF was proven to increase
the host immunity against viral infection. Since LF is one of the
constituents of breast milk and significantly located at the mucosal
layers of the human body, it is considered the first line of defense
against microbial infection. LF was reported to have antiviral activity
against SARS-CoV infection. The significant antiviral activity of
LF makes it a potential option as an immunity enhancer, a drug or
a drug conjugate with conventional antivirals. The affordability,
environmental safety, and efficiency of LFs will make them superior
to all other control strategies.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>AMPs</kwd><kwd>antiviral</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>lactoferrin</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>pt0c00059</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>pt0c00059</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Coronaviruses are zoonotic,
enveloped, positive, single-stranded RNA viruses that can infect animals
and humans, causing respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and neurologic
diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> The family of Coronaviruses
is classified into four genera: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> Coronaviruses infecting humans are categorized
within alpha and beta, among which originated two major epidemics:
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> Animals are the natural reservoir hosts that
play a crucial role in transmitting Coronaviruses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> The present outbreak of coronavirus, known as Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) or (COVID-19), is considered
the third documented transmitted animal-to-human-infection, and was
declared as pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> COVID-19 is currently considered as one of the
most life-threatening pandemic viral infections that humanity has
witnessed in the past decades. Since SARS-CoV-2 shares 96% similarity
to the whole genome of coronavirus infecting bats, this indicates
that bats are most likely the hosts that transmitted COVID 19 to humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> Furthermore, there were some reports mentioning
snakes, pangolins, and minks as other possible virus reservoirs for
SARS-CoV-2 human infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup></p><p>Phelan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> proposed human-to-human
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 which is the main source of infection.
Moreover, routes of transmission were confirmed to take place through
respiratory droplets, contact, and aerosol. In addition, Gu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> suggested the digestive system as an alternative
transmission route for its infection. The virus was detected in feces
of several infected cases, which may indicate the possibility of virus
replication in the digestive system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> However,
it is still not confirmed that eating virus-contaminated food may
be a source of infection and transmission. The virus stability <italic>in vitro</italic> varies depending on the subjected surfaces: plastic
(72 h), stainless steel (48 h), cardboard (24 h), copper (4 h) and
3 h in air.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup></p><p>The viral genome of
SARS-Cov-2 showed approximately 80% similarity
with SARS-CoV. However, it was nearly 95% identical with seven conserved
replicase domains, indicating that both viruses belong to the same
species. However, phylogenetic analysis showed that RaTG13 and the
spike gene (S) in bats are the closest relative to SARS-CoV-2, thus
forming a distinct lineage from other SARS-CoVs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup></p><p>The basic reproduction number of infection (<italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>) was estimated to be 2.0&#x02013;2.5 by the
WHO,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> indicating a higher transmission
infection rate
than SARS-CoV. Confirmed cases and deaths are elevating daily and
the short-term solution, so far, is home quarantine to lessen the
infection rates. This is affecting the world economy and will later
cause severe implications on human welfare. Accordingly, finding an
antiviral drug or a vaccine is the only route for survival of humans
against COVID-19 infection. Several routes of antiviral drugs are
still under study and to date, no specific antiviral treatment has
been confirmed.</p><p>Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been widely
regarded as a promising
solution to combat harmful microorganisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> They are biologically active molecules produced by a wide variety
of organisms as an essential component of their innate immune response
against invading pathogens. AMPs are short sequence peptides polymer
ranging from 10 to 100 amino acids, positively charged, amphiphilic.
They have been isolated from organisms, belonging to six kingdoms,
including humans. The Antimicrobial Peptide Database (APD) contains
more than 3000 antimicrobial peptides, among which are 189 AMPs with
antiviral activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup></p><p>The antimicrobial
effect of AMPs was reported to either act on
the membrane of different pathogenic microorganisms including bacteria,
fungus, and virus or modulate the innate immune response in higher
organisms. Depending on the kind of pathogen, the AMPs may be expressed
either constitutively or inducibly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup></p><p>The antiviral activity of the AMPs was shown against enveloped
RNA and DNA viruses, except some nonenveloped viruses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> The antiviral activity of AMPs takes place according to its action
due to adsorption on the viral surface and entry process or its direct
effect on the viral envelope.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup></p><p>The
AMPs positively charged residues enable them to interact electrostatically
with negatively charged cell surface molecules such as heparan sulfate.
Heparan sulfate consists of glycosaminoglycan molecules that are strongly
related to viral attachment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> It was proven
that AMPs that block heparan sulfate should be able to reduce the
viral infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> Also, the AMPs antiviral
effect is related to their ability to inhibit the spread of a virus
from a cell to another cell across tight junctions (cell-to-cell spread)
or inhibit the formation of giant cells (syncytium).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup></p><p>Lactoferrin (LF), one of the AMPs, is an iron-binding
glycoprotein
that is present in several mucosal secretions which have a significant
activity in the innate immune system. LF is known to have a wide spectrum
of antimicrobial activity against bacteria, fungi, and several viruses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> The antiviral activity of LF exists against
a wide range of human and animal viruses (both DNA and RNA) due to
its ability to inhibit replication of those viruses. Moreover, LF
was proven to increase the host immunity against viral infection,
rather than acting against the virus after infection, by preventing
virus entry to the host cell, through blocking cellular receptors,
or direct binding to the virus particles. Since LF is one of the constituents
of breast milk, studies have shown that at least part of the antiviral
properties of breast milk can be attributed to a direct antiviral
activity of LF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> Many studies have proven
that LF has a significant role against viruses, among which are HCV,
HSV, HIV, polio-, and the rotavirus. However, the LF antiviral mechanisms
vary among viruses, where it may bind either directly to the virus
particle or to the host cell receptor or coreceptor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> LF is significantly located at the mucosal layers of the human body,
which is considered as the first defense line against microbial infection,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> so LF is likely to have an efficient antiviral
activity against Coronaviruses.</p><p>The significant antiviral activity
of LF makes it a potential option
as a drug or a drug conjugate with conventional antivirals. This combination
will lessen or eliminate the side effects caused by the antiviral
drugs and may prevent drug resistance. Many studies reported synergistic
activities of the combinations of conventional drugs with LF <italic>in vitro</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup></p><p>In 2011, Lang
et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> reported the
antiviral activity of LF against SARS-CoV infection through an increased
host immune response. LF interfered at the stage of the virus adsorption
by blocking the binding of the spike protein to host cell receptors.</p><p>The COVID-19 virus outbreak in late 2019, which spread from China,
led to a pandemic infection. So far, current approaches have not yet
proven to be efficient. Many alternatives are proposed nowadays, and
antiviral peptides are among them. This article may reveal more facts
about the feasibility of using the AMPs in general and LF in particular,
as an antiviral treatment. As a result, it can be a corner stone for
more future research on the LFs as antiviral therapy in general and
against COVID-19 in particular. The affordability, environmental safety,
and efficiency of LFs will make them superior to all other control
strategies, especially since LF is a safe natural protein that is
a commercially already produced drug at an affordable price. Therefore,
the objectives of this article are short-term and long-term objectives.
For the short-term objectives, the first is to ensure efficient and
instant treatment and protection of humans from the viral infections
such as that caused by COVID-19 and as a result, decrease the humans&#x02019;
mortality rate that has been rising at an exponential rate since the
abrupt appearance of this viral infection. The second is to prevent
the transmission of this disease among humans by increasing their
immunity. A long-term objective is protection of humans from this
viral infection, which will bring back normal life and which will
have a huge impact on the economy worldwide after the huge financial
loss that was caused due to the spread of that infection. The second-long-term
objective is to ensure the healthiness of people and to protect them
not only against COVID-19 but also against any emerging viral infection,
and accordingly, this will maximize the social welfare of humans.</p></body><back><notes notes-type="" id="notes-3"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>S.E. and
