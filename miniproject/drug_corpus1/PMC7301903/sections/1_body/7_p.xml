<p>The AMPs positively charged residues enable them to interact electrostatically with negatively charged cell surface molecules such as heparan sulfate. Heparan sulfate consists of glycosaminoglycan molecules that are strongly related to viral attachment.

 </sup> It was proven that AMPs that block heparan sulfate should be able to reduce the viral infection.

 </sup> Also, the AMPs antiviral effect is related to their ability to inhibit the spread of a virus from a cell to another cell across tight junctions (cell-to-cell spread) or inhibit the formation of giant cells (syncytium).
