<p>Coronaviruses are zoonotic, enveloped, positive, single-stranded RNA viruses that can infect animals and humans, causing respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and neurologic diseases.

 </sup> The family of Coronaviruses is classified into four genera: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
 </sup> Coronaviruses infecting humans are categorized within alpha and beta, among which originated two major epidemics: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs)

 </sup> Animals are the natural reservoir hosts that play a crucial role in transmitting Coronaviruses.

 </sup> The present outbreak of coronavirus, known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) or (COVID-19), is considered the third documented transmitted animal-to-human-infection, and was declared as pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).

 </sup> COVID-19 is currently considered as one of the most life-threatening pandemic viral infections that humanity has witnessed in the past decades. Since SARS-CoV-2 shares 96% similarity to the whole genome of coronavirus infecting bats, this indicates that bats are most likely the hosts that transmitted COVID 19 to humans.

 </sup> Furthermore, there were some reports mentioning snakes, pangolins, and minks as other possible virus reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2 human infection
