 </sup> They are biologically active molecules produced by a wide variety of organisms as an essential component of their innate immune response against invading pathogens. AMPs are short sequence peptides polymer ranging from 10 to 100 amino acids, positively charged, amphiphilic. They have been isolated from organisms, belonging to six kingdoms, including humans. The Antimicrobial Peptide Database (APD) contains more than 3000 antimicrobial peptides, among which are 189 AMPs with antiviral activities.
