 </sup> indicating a higher transmission infection rate than SARS-CoV. Confirmed cases and deaths are elevating daily and the short-term solution, so far, is home quarantine to lessen the infection rates. This is affecting the world economy and will later cause severe implications on human welfare. Accordingly, finding an antiviral drug or a vaccine is the only route for survival of humans against COVID-19 infection. Several routes of antiviral drugs are still under study and to date, no specific antiviral treatment has been confirmed.
