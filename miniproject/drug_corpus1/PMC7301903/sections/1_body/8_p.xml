<p>Lactoferrin (LF), one of the AMPs, is an iron-binding glycoprotein that is present in several mucosal secretions which have a significant activity in the innate immune system. LF is known to have a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity against bacteria, fungi, and several viruses.

 </sup> The antiviral activity of LF exists against a wide range of human and animal viruses (both DNA and RNA) due to its ability to inhibit replication of those viruses. Moreover, LF was proven to increase the host immunity against viral infection, rather than acting against the virus after infection, by preventing virus entry to the host cell, through blocking cellular receptors, or direct binding to the virus particles. Since LF is one of the constituents of breast milk, studies have shown that at least part of the antiviral properties of breast milk can be attributed to a direct antiviral activity of LF.

 </sup> Many studies have proven that LF has a significant role against viruses, among which are HCV, HSV, HIV, polio-, and the rotavirus. However, the LF antiviral mechanisms vary among viruses, where it may bind either directly to the virus particle or to the host cell receptor or coreceptor.

 </sup> LF is significantly located at the mucosal layers of the human body, which is considered as the first defense line against microbial infection,
