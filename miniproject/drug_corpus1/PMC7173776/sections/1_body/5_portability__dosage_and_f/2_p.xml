<p id="Par19">The drug product configuration must accommodate the appropriate dose and route of administration. If the dose is large for infectious diseases (&gt;500 milligrams or more), the volume limits of subcutaneous administration will be exceeded for conventional injections, and intramuscular or intravenous administration routes would be used. High-concentration liquid formulations (≥150 milligrams per milliliter) would be advantageous, but given the limited development time available more conservative concentrations of 50–75 milligrams per milliliter and frozen or lyophilized drug product storage should be considered. A lyophilizate has drawbacks of the time required for processing (3 or more days longer than liquid) plus the greater risk of running a cGMP batch without a pilot run if materials or time were limiting.</p>
