<p id="p0030">Coronaviruses are enveloped, giant, unsegmented positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses having varying genome sizes between 26 to 32 kb. They can infect humans and also a wide range of wild animals (
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Cronjé, 2017</xref>). To date, four subfamilies, namely alpha, beta, gamma, and delta coronaviruses, out of which alpha and beta have their origin from bats while gamma and delta subspecies originated from birds and pigs. Six coronavirus species have the potential to cause human disease out of which four, namely 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1 are prevalent, causing common cold-like symptoms (
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Hui et al., 2020</xref>). The remaining two having zoonotic origin are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks (SARS) in 2002–2003 in Guangdong, China (

 <xref rid="bib165" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) the causal agent for severe respiratory disease outbreaks in 2012 in the Middle East (
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Chowell et al., 2015</xref>). Recently a new coronavirus outbreak having origin from Wuhan, China (
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Hui et al., 2020</xref>), had posed a severe threat to public health worldwide (
 <xref rid="bib165" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>). To date (July 3, 2020), approximately 10.71 million persons belonging to 215 countries and territories are suffering from the pandemic with a death toll of more than 517,877 (
 <xref rid="bib109" ref-type="bibr">Organization, 2020b</xref>). The USA is the most affected country, and it contributes about 25.80% of the total COVID-19 cases, followed by Brazil, Russia, and India (
 <xref rid="bib109" ref-type="bibr">Organization, 2020b</xref>). Being a contagious disease, COVID-19 mainly transmits person to person (
 <xref rid="bib116" ref-type="bibr">Ralph et al., 2020</xref>), but the origin of the disease was the result of a human-animal interface (
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Lake, 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib152" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 can replicate in both upper as well as lower respiratory tract, and the virus enters the lung epithelial cells via interaction between viral spike (S) protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor (
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Dhama et al., 2020</xref>). The mean incubation period of the virus is 5–6 days, with a range of 2–14 days (
 <xref rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr">Mission, 2020</xref>). Major common symptoms at the onset of illness are fever (88.7%), cough (67.8%), fatigue (38.1%), dyspnea (18.7%), and myalgia (14.9%) (
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Guan et al., 2020</xref>). These could be followed by other symptoms with less rate of an occurrence like sputum production, headache, dizziness, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and upper respiratory tract symptoms, including sore throat, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhoea. The severity of infection can lead to complications like septic shock (
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Guan et al., 2020</xref>), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), arrhythmia (
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Guan et al., 2020</xref>), RNAaemia (
 <xref rid="bib146" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), acute kidney injury (
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Guan et al., 2020</xref>), acute cardiac injury (
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2020</xref>) pneumonia (
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Guan et al., 2020</xref>) and secondary infections (
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). COVID-19 has a current death rate of 1.4% (
 <xref rid="bib106" ref-type="bibr">Olson et al., 2020</xref>), lower than the initial estimate of 3.4% (
 <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Lai et al., 2020</xref>), but the disease has more severity in the older age, with a death rate of 14.8% in the patients having age above 80 years. In contrast, children are the least affected, showing milder or even asymptomatic infection (
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Columbus et al., 2020</xref>). Recent studies had shown that the fatality rate changes with the pre-existing medical conditions where the person with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, and cancer are at higher risk (
 <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). COVID-19 being highly contagious transmits and spreads at a very faster rate despite a large number of preventive measures like respiratory hygiene, quarantization, isolation, social distancing, avoidance of public gatherings, etc. (
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Cetron and Landwirth, 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Columbus et al., 2020</xref>). Developing some potential therapeutics against COVID-19 infection is the only way to cope with such a pandemic.
