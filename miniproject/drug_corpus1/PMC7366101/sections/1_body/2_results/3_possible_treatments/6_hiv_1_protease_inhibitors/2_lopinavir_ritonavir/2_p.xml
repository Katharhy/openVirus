<p id="p0090">Lopinavir/ritonavir is a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug used in conjunction with other medical products to treat children over 14 days of age and adults diagnosed with HIV-1 (
 <xref rid="bib135" ref-type="bibr">Su et al., 2019</xref>). Lopinavir is a highly-specific HIV-1 protease inhibitor. Such inhibitors are derived structurally from a sequence of symmetry-based lead compounds, constructed by considering the target enzyme's C2 symmetric structure (
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abraham, 2007</xref>). Ritonavir significantly inhibits the metabolism of lopinavir, ritonavir/lopinavir coadministration in healthy human volunteers increased the region under the plasma concentration-time curve for lopinavir by more than a hundred times (

 <italic>in vitro</italic>. They recorded 4 mg/ml of lopinavir and 50 mg/ml of ribavirin inhibited SARS-CoV after incubation of 48 h and the agents when combined act synergistically (

Later de Wilde and colleagues identified the antiviral activity of lopinavir against SARS-CoV and showed an EC50 value of 17.1 ± 1 μM in Vero E6 cells, which is close to the upper limit of previously reported lopinavir's plasma concentrations in patients diagnosed with HIV (
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">de Wilde et al., 2014</xref>). Lopinavir and ritonavir can bind to Mpro (main protease), a key coronavirus enzyme which plays a significant role in facilitating viral replication (
 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Wang, 2020</xref>). Lopinavir appears to block the key protease of SARS-CoV, which inhibits the replication of the virus (
