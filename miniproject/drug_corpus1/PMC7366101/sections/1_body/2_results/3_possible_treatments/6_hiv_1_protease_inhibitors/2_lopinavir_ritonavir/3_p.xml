<p id="p0095">Cao B and colleagues reported that 199 laboratory-confirmed Patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 were randomized; 99 were allocated to the group of lopinavir-ritonavir and hundred patients to the group of standard treatment. In the group of lopinavir-ritonavir and the group of standard care, mortality at twenty-eight days was comparable, and no significant differences in viral clearance were observed. No benefit has been observed beyond standard care with lopinavir-ritonavir treatment in hospitalized adult patients suffering from extreme COVID-19. Potential studies in critically ill patients might help to confirm or exclude the possibility of therapy again (
