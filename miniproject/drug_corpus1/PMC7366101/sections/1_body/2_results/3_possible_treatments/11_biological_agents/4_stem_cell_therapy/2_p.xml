<p id="p0175">Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been broadly used in cell therapies based on various preclinical and clinical studies regarding their safety and efficacy (
 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Kamen et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib150" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et al., 2015</xref>). MSCs have immunomodulatory effects and are capable of differentiation (
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Galipeau and Sensébé, 2018</xref>). MSC's immunomodulatory effects are due to its ability to communicate directly with immune cells or to the paracrine secretion of several forms of cytokines (
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bernardo and Fibbe, 2013</xref>). The cytokines are triggered further by the stimulation of toll-like receptors in MSCs on stimulation by pathogen-associated molecules like LPS or double-stranded RNA from the virus (

 <xref rid="bib148" ref-type="bibr">Waterman et al., 2010</xref>). After MSC infusions in many diseased conditions, the resulting improvement was attributed mostly to their immunomodulatory effects (

 <xref rid="bib114" ref-type="bibr">Prockop and Oh, 2012</xref>). A study where seven COVID-19 patients were administered with human MSCs (10
 <sup>6</sup> cells per kilogram of weight, intravenously) resulted in improved functional outcomes and fast recovery (
 <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Leng et al., 2020</xref>). The symptoms of all the patients and pulmonary functions improved in 2 days significantly after transplantation, and also no adverse effects were seen for 14 days. Increases in peripheral lymphocytes, reductions in C-reactive protein, and overactivated cytokine-secreting immune cells (CXCR3+CD8 + T cells, CXCR3+CD4 + T cells, and CXCR3 + natural killer (NK) cells) disappeared within 3–6 days of treatment. Besides that, there was a decline in TNF-α level, whereas IL-10 and a group of CD11c + CD14
 <sup>+</sup> CD11bmid regulatory dendritic cell (DC) population increased (
