<p id="p0170">Two separate meta-analyses done by Mair-Jenkins et al. (identified severe influenza and 32 studies of SARS coronavirus infection) and Luke TC et al. (identified eight reviews during 1918â€“1925 involving 1703 patients with influenza pneumonia) showed a reduction in mortality in patients receiving convalescent plasma compared with control (

In a recent case study at the infectious disease department, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital in Shenzhen, China involved five critically ill patients with COVID-19 and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) who received transfusion with convalescent plasma from 5 recovered COVID-19 patients between 10 and 22 days after admission (
 <xref rid="bib128" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2020</xref>). The administration of convalescent plasma results in an improvement in the patient's clinical condition, including the normalization of body temperature, decrease in SOFA score, and viral load (became negative within 12 days after the transfusion). Also, increased PAO2/FIO2 (ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the percentage of inspired oxygen.) was observed within 12 days (
