<p id="p0160">Tocilizumab is a recombinant monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody against the human interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor. Membrane-bound IL-6 receptors (sIL-6R and mIL-6R) and soluble are two forms of the receptor to which tocilizumab binds specifically and inhibits downstream signal transduction (

Similar in patients with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 patients also show higher plasma levels of cytokines, including IL-6, growth factors and proteins that indicated a cytokine storm and related to the severity of the disease and its prognosis (

A study involving 21 patients treated with tocilizumab in China demonstrated rapid improvement in fever, oxygen intake, lung lesion opacity, levels of C-reactive protein, and lymphocyte concentration in peripheral blood. Out of 21, 19 (90.5%) were discharged on an average of 13.5 days after the treatment which shows a promising effect of tocilizumab, however, more studies are required regarding its efficacy and safety (
