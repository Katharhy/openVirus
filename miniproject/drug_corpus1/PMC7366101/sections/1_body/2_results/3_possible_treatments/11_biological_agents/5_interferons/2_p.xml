<p id="p0185">Interferons (IFNs) consist of a group of secreted a-helical cytokines triggered by stimulation of toll-like receptors in response to different cell surface biomolecules. Interferon-alfa (IFN-α) is a broad-spectrum antiviral, widely used to combat hepatitis. It is documented to impair 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> SARS-CoV reproduction (
 <xref rid="bib133" ref-type="bibr">Stockman et al., 2006</xref>). Interferon-beta (IFN-ß) is a naturally occurring protein that orchestrates antiviral responses of the body (
 <xref rid="bib133" ref-type="bibr">Stockman et al., 2006</xref>). IFN-α and -ß both have shown anti-SARS-CoV activity

 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Hensley et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib134" ref-type="bibr">Ströher et al., 2004</xref>). IFN-ß has also displayed potent activity against MERS-CoV 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> with an IC50 of 1.37 U/ml (
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Hart et al., 2014</xref>). Antiviral effect of IFN type I (IFN-α and IFN-ß) against SARS-CoV were stated in twelve 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies (
 <xref rid="bib133" ref-type="bibr">Stockman et al., 2006</xref>). It is also apparent from previous reports that IFN-ß was superior to IFN-α against SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="bib125" ref-type="bibr">Scagnolari et al., 2004</xref>). Effective synergistic results for leukocytic IFN-α with ribavirin (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2004</xref>), IFN-ß with ribavirin (
 <xref rid="bib100" ref-type="bibr">Morgenstern et al., 2005</xref>), and IFN-ß with IFN-α have also been reported against SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="bib122" ref-type="bibr">Sainz et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib125" ref-type="bibr">Scagnolari et al., 2004</xref>). In an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study, following recombinant type-I IFN-α treatment, SARS-CoV-2 revealed a significant decrease in viral replication (
 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Lokugamage et al., 2020</xref>). Besides several other agents, IFN-α is also recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in the guidelines issued by the National Health Commission &amp; State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Commision, 2020</xref>). Further preclinical/clinical studies are required to depict the efficacy and the safety of interferons for the COVID-19 treatment.
