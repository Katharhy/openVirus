<p id="p0145">At recommended doses used to treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis, it is predicted that free plasma concentrations of baricitinib are sufficient to inhibit AAK1, and potentially GAK (

The high specificity of baricitinib to NAKs, its anti-inflammatory properties, and its ability to minimize associated chronic interferonopathy inflammation along with its beneficial pharmacokinetic properties seem to make it a suitable candidate for the future SARS-CoV-2 treatment (
 <xref rid="bib131" ref-type="bibr">Stebbing et al., 2020</xref>). The ability for combination therapy with baricitinib is significant despite its low binding of plasma proteins and limited interaction with cytochrome p450 (CYP) enzymes and drug transporters. Also, baricitinib may be paired with the direct-acting antivirals (lopinavir or ritonavir and remdesivir) already used in the COVID-19 outbreak. Baricitinib combinations of these direct-acting antivirals will decrease viral infectivity, viral replication, and an abnormal inflammatory response from the host (
