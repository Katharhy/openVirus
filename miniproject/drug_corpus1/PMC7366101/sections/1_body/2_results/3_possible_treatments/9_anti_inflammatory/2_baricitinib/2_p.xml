<p id="p0140">The baricitinib is a Janus kinase inhibitor (JAK), an approved drug for rheumatoid arthritis. It can be an effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 to inhibit viral entry and inflammation (

 <xref rid="bib131" ref-type="bibr">Stebbing et al., 2020</xref>). Baricitinib, besides being JAK inhibitor, also has more affinity for AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1) and binds cyclin G-associated kinase (GAK), which are amongst the primary regulators of endocytosis (

Janus kinase inhibitor-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling inhibitors are considered efficient against the effects of high cytokine levels (including interferon Î±) usually observed in persons with COVID-19 (
