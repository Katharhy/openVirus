<p id="p0085">Recent data from large randomized controlled trials showed no evidence of benefit for viral clearance, mortality or other outcomes of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine treatment over standard care in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="bib138" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, previous reports of reduced viral shedding with the treatment of these two drugs have not been consistently replicated. Also, the current US treatment guidelines do not recommend the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (FDA Revokes EUA, 2020; 
 <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Letter revoking EUA, 2020</xref>). On the other hand, serious side effects, including methemoglobinemia and cardiac adverse events in COVID-19 patients, the known and potential benefits of these two drugs do not outweigh the known and potential risks for the authorized use. Therefore, based on the collective scientific evidence available, food and drug administration (FDA) revoked emergency use authorization (EUA) for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine on June 15, 2020 (FDA Revokes EUA, 2020; 
 <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Letter revoking EUA, 2020</xref>). Meanwhile, on June 17, 2020, WHO stopped the hydroxychloroquine arm of the solidarity trial to find an effective COVID-19 treatment (
