<p id="p0070">When given orally, chloroquine gets widely distributed throughout the body, including the lungs. In Vero E6 cells, the EC90 value of chloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 was 6.90 μM, which can be clinically attained in the plasma as observed in the case of rheumatoid arthritis patients undergoing 500 mg administration (
 <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Kapoor and Kapoor, 2020</xref>). Wang et al. indicated that chloroquine blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection with an EC50 value of 1.13 μM and CC50 higher than 100 μM (
 <xref rid="bib147" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020b</xref>). The EC50 values for chloroquine were 23.90 and 5.47 μM, respectively, at 24 h and 48 h against SARS-CoV-2 in another

Data from over 100 COVID-19 patients have shown that chloroquine phosphate is better when compared to control treatment by inhibiting pneumonia exacerbation, enhancing lung imaging tests, encouraging a virus-negative conversation, and reducing the disease course (
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2020</xref>). Any severe adverse reactions to chloroquine phosphate have not been reported in the treated patients (
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2020</xref>). Despite the promising effect, cardiovascular toxicity and supply problems in the United States restrict the use of chloroquine (
 <xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">McCreary and Pogue, 2020</xref>). Chloroquine's anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties may contribute to its efficient effectiveness in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia patients. However, more studies are required regarding the safety and efficacy of chloroquine.
