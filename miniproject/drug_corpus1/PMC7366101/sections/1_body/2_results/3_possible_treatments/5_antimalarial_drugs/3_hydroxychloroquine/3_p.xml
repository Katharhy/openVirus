<p id="p0080">Additionally, hydroxychloroquine is widely used for autoimmune diseases, including systematic rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus. Hydroxychloroquine was reported to have an

 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Biot et al., 2006</xref>). The clinical safety profile of hydroxychloroquine is higher than that of chloroquine (long-term use), which allows for a higher regular dose, with fewer questions regarding drug-drug interactions (
 <xref rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr">Marmor et al., 2016</xref>). Findings from the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study of hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 showed potent antiviral activity. It was able to minimize the concentration-dependent replication of the virus. Hydroxychloroquine was reported to have a more substantial effect than chloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 (
 <italic>in vitro</italic>) with EC50 values 0.72 μM vs. 5.47 μM, respectively at 48 h (

 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Gautret et al., 2020</xref>). In most cases, hydroxychloroquine was successful in eliminating nasopharyngeal carriage of SARS-COV-2 in patients infected with COVID-19 in just three to six days. There was a significant difference among hydroxychloroquine treated patients and controls even after the third day of post-inclusion (
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Gautret et al., 2020</xref>). The lower dose-dependent toxicity profile of hydroxychloroquine in humans relative to chloroquine (
 <xref rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr">Marmor et al., 2016</xref>), makes it possible to use even at higher doses than the observed 50% effective dose (ED50) (
