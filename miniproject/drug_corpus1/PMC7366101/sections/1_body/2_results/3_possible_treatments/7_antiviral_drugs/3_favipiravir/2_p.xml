<p id="p0110">Favipiravir (T-705; 6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazine carboxamide) is an anti-viral agent that efficiently inhibits RdRp from RNA viruses (
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Furuta et al., 2005</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). It has been explored by chemical modulation of a pyrazine analog, initially screened

 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Furuta et al., 2017</xref>). Following its role against anti-influenza viruses, favipiravir can inhibit the replication of alpha-, flavi-, filo-, arena-, bunya-, noro-, and other RNA viruses. Favipiravir can thus have significant antiviral activity on SARS-CoV-2 also (
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Delang et al., 2018</xref>). Favipiravir is a prodrug that undergoes intracellular phosphorylation and gets converted to its active form, favipiravir-ribofuranosyl-5â€²-triphosphate (favipiravir-RTP), which interacts with viral RNA polymerase and inhibits viral replication (
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Furuta et al., 2005</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Because RdRp's catalytic domain is conserved across different types of RNA viruses, this etiology validates a broader range of favipiravir's anti-viral activities. It is proposed that favipiravir may get integrated that into a nascent viral RNA, or it may function by binding to conserved polymerase domains, thereby preventing the incorporation of the nucleotide for replicating and transcribing viral RNA (
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Furuta et al., 2013</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Yet more work is required to explain the connection between favipiravirs anti-viral activity and suppression of the RdRp activities (
