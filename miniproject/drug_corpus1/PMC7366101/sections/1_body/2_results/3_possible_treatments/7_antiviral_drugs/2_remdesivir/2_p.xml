 <xref rid="bib147" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020b</xref>). It is an investigational analog of nucleoside and a monophosphoramidate prodrug of remdesivir-triphosphate (RDV-TP). RDV-TP is an analog of adenosine that acts as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Agostini et al., 2018</xref>). For incorporation into the nascent viral RNA chain, RDV-TP competes with adenosine-triphosphate. Once incorporated into the viral RNA, it terminates RNA synthesis, thus inhibiting the production of viral RNA. Since RDV-TP does not trigger immediate chain termination, the drug is presumed to evade proofreading by viral exo-ribonuclease activity (
