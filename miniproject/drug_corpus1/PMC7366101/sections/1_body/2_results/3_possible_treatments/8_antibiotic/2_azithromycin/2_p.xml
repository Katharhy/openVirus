<p id="p0130">Azithromycin, a member of macrolide antibiotics, is the semisynthetic derivatives of erythromycin. Azithromycin varies from erythromycin by a methyl-substituted nitrogen atom into the lactone ring. It is a bacteriostatic agent, which interrupts protein synthesis by reversibly binding to 50S ribosomal subunits of microorganisms (

Macrolides can reduce inflammatory activities and minimize elevated cytokine generation linked with pulmonary viral infections; however, they are unclear regarding their exact influence on viral clearance. Immunomodulatory pathways can include reducing neutrophil chemotaxis (NMPs) to the lungs, minimizing the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines, inhibiting mucus hypersecretion, decreasing the production of reactive oxygen species, promoting neutrophil apoptosis and disrupting the stimulation of nuclear transcription factors (

Azithromycin attenuated acute and chronic respiratory inflammation in a mouse model of viral bronchiolitis, illustrating the anti-inflammatory activity of azithromycin, explaining the rationale of prospective clinical studies, which will examine the efficacy of macrolides on acute viral bronchiolitis and its long-term impact (
