<p id="p0205">Transgenic mice that express human ACE2 are likely to be crucial COVID-19 animal models (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bao et al., 2020</xref>). Bao et al. reported the development of the clinical disease by transgenic hACE2 mice after infection with SARS-CoV-2, including interstitial pneumonia and weight loss (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bao et al., 2020</xref>). In another study, it has been shown that viral spike protein binding to ACE2 receptors in mice downregulates ACE2 expression, which is linked with extreme lung failure. Therefore ACE2 Knockout mice, which were used in ARDS and SARS studies, Can also be of interest to COVID-19 related ARDS studies (

 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Kuba et al., 2005</xref>). There is also the possibility of TMPRSS2 Knockout and STAT 1 Knockout mice as COVID-19 disease models. Since TMPRSS2 assists in the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cells, its inhibition may constitute a mechanism for treatment/prophylaxis of COVID-19. So TMPRSS2 knockout mice can aid in researching COVID-19 pathogenesis (
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Graham et al., 2012</xref>). STAT 1 Knockout mice support SARS-CoV replication in the lungs and the establishment of progressive lung disease. Such mice can also be beneficial to study the pathogenesis and antiviral treatments of COVID-19 disease (

 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Hogan et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib163" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020a</xref>). In standard mouse strains, the inbred mice were widely used in SARS-CoV studies, young inbred mice like C57BL/6, BALB/c, and 129S6 support viral replication of SARS-CoV and might be useful for the vaccine and antiviral research of COVID-19. They can also help study immune responses to the infection (
 <xref rid="bib136" ref-type="bibr">Subbarao and Roberts, 2006</xref>). A new study documented a ferret model of infection and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which sums up aspects of the human disease where ferrets infected with SARS-CoV-2 display elevated body temperature (
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). It was observed that SARS-CoV could also infect hamsters, Cynomolgus macaques, rhesus macaques and African green monkeys (
 <xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr">McAuliffe et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib120" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib121" ref-type="bibr">Rowe et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore it is pertinent to mention here that these animals might also be permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication.
