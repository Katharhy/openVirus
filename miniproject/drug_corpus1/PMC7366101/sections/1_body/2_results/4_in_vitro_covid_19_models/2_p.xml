<p id="p0195">To understand the mechanism of viral pathogenesis, antiviral drug action, and to treat viruses safely in the laboratory, we need cell lines in which SARS-CoV-2 can replicate successfully. Evaluation of antiviral activities of various compounds in different cell lines infected with SARS-CoV-2 can facilitate the treatment strategies (
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Kaye et al., 2006</xref>). Recent studies performed against SARS-CoV-2 have shown that the cell lines such as Vero (derived from the kidney of an African green monkey), Vero E6 (clone of Vero 76Â cell line) and Huh7 (Human hepatocytes cell line) have shown susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection (

The clinically isolated strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, C-Tan-nCoV Wuhan strain 01, was propagated in Vero cells and the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were also investigated using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells (
