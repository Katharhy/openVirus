<p id="p0200">A study from China reported that scientists successfully isolated SARS-CoV-2 from infected patients in Huh7 and Vero cell lines (

 <xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr">Matsuyama et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, it is evident from these studies that Vero, Vero E6, and Huh7 are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 replication. However, several other cell lines from different origin like Monkey (FRhK-4 cells, MA-104 cells, COS cells, and BGM) (

 <xref rid="bib112" ref-type="bibr">Peiris and Porterfield, 1979</xref>) have shown to be permissive to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication, which suggests that these cell lines can also be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
