<p id="p0040">SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus that uses its surface spike glycoproteins (S proteins) to invade target cells. S proteins bind with high affinity to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (
 <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Li, 2016</xref>). Viral S protein consists of two regions S1 and S2, S1 is used for the binding to host cell receptor, whereas S2 is used for membrane fusion. After binding with receptors, virus particles enter into cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis involving host cell receptors and endosomes (
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Gui et al., 2017</xref>). Once it comes inside the cell, it synthesizes viral polyproteins that encode for the replicase-transcriptase complex. After that, the virus synthesizes its RNA via RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Structural proteins are synthesized, which leads to the assembly and release of viral particles (

S protein binding to the ACE2 receptor in the case of SARS-CoV and likely SARS-CoV-2 has been documented to induce a negative feedback loop, which ultimately results in the downregulation of ACE2 expression. The drop in ACE2 then directs its substrate angiotensin I to increase its related enzyme, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (
