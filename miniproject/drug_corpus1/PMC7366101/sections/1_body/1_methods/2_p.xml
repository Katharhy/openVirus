<p id="p0035">We searched Google Scholar, Embase, and Pubmed for drugs and vaccines for COVID-19. Relevant articles from the search results were selected, including ‘associated articles’ and the cited references therein. We also accessed the World Health Organisation (WHO) situation reports and Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports.
