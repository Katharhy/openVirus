<p id="p0220">RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors inhibit viral replication by binding to conserved polymerase domains, thereby preventing the incorporation of the nucleotide for replicating and transcribing viral RNA (
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Furuta et al., 2013</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Remdesivir and favipiravir both were found effective against COVID-19. Remdesivir brought results that were remarkable in the care of a first COVID-19 patient in the United States (
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Holshue et al., 2020</xref>), whereas, in a study involving 240 COVID-19 patients, favipiravir was considered as preferred treatment compared to arbidol (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2020a</xref>). Arbidol, an antiviral, mainly functions by inhibiting the interaction between the virus and host cells, preventing viral invasion into host cells (

 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Kadam and Wilson, 2017</xref>). It also exhibits immunomodulatory function by inducing interferon production and macrophages activation (
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Glushkov et al., 1999</xref>). In a clinical study involving 111 patients, it was found that arbidol promotes and strengthens the cycle of viral clearance, enhances focal penetration on radiological images, and decreases demand for HFNC oxygen therapy in-hospital treatment (

 <xref rid="bib118" ref-type="bibr">Retallack et al., 2016</xref>). It is also known to suppress severe viral infections of the respiratory tract (
 <xref rid="bib161" ref-type="bibr">Zhan, 2016</xref>). In a clinical study, it was found that azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was substantially effective for SARS-CoV-2 removal (
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Gautret et al., 2020</xref>). Due to the high amount of cytokines produced by SARS-CoV (

 <xref rid="bib151" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2004</xref>), MERS-CoV (
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Falzarano et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Faure et al., 2014</xref>), and SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2020</xref>), corticosteroids are commonly used to treat patients with severe infection. Dexamethasone reduced the mortality by one-third in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and by one-fifth in patients receiving oxygen support without invasive mechanical ventilation. Whereas, no effect of the drug was noticed in patients in mild condition not requiring oxygen support (
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Horby et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Ledford, 2020</xref>). WHO also authorized the use of dexamethasone in severe to critical conditions only (WHO media briefing, 2020). However, it is supposed that a higher dose of corticosteroids can prolong the coronavirus elimination due to immunomodulatory effects (
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Commision, 2020</xref>); therefore, corticosteroids should not be administered routinely.
