<p id="p0215">Many possible therapies have been pre-clinically and clinically tested against the disease, and many more are in process; however, only a few were found to be effective. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine both show a similar mode of action by acting as a weak base that can increase the pH of endosomes preventing virus/cell fusion (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> and also successfully eliminated nasopharyngeal carriage of SARS-COV-2 in patients infected with COVID-19. However, recent data from large randomized controlled trials showed no evidence of benefit for viral clearance, mortality or other outcomes of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine treatment over standard care in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (
