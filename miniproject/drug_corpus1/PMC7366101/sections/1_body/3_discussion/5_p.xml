<p id="p0225">Biological agents like tocilizumab, a recombinant monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody against human interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor, may also be a possible treatment for severe and critical COVID-19 infections. A study involving 21 patients treated with tocilizumab in China demonstrated rapid improvement. Out of 21, 19 (90.5%) were discharged on an average of 13.5 days after the treatment, which shows a promising effect of tocilizumab (

In a recent case study, five critically ill patients with COVID-19 and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) received transfusion with convalescent plasma from 5 recovered COVID-19 patients between 10 and 22 days after admission (

Mesenchymal stem cells have immunomodulatory effects due to their ability to communicate directly with immune cells or to the paracrine secretion of several forms of cytokines (

 <sup>6</sup> cells per kilogram of weight, intravenously) resulted in improved functional outcomes and fast recovery (
