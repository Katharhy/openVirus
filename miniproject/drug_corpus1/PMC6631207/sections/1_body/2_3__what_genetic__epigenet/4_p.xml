<p>Variations on the hosts’ genetic background are determinant to an appropriate immune response, and may thus influence the occurrence of ZIKV-associated neurological complications. Experiments in animal models support this notion, since infection is associated to either mild or severe signs of disease, depending on the genetic characteristics of the host. For example, effective systemic infection in mice requires a limited interferon-mediated immune response, which is obtained either by knocking out specific components of interferon (IFN) pathway [

 <xref rid="B32-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], a stage where interferon-mediated immune response is lacking or insufficient. While type III IFN response is protective against ZIKV infection [
 <xref rid="B48-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], type I response is related to miscarriage and growth restriction, especially during mid-gestation [

Several signaling pathways were shown to modulate ZIKV infection and individual differences in their expression may confer variable risk to congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) and other neurological outcomes: TAM receptors (TYRO3, AXL, and MER) are important in mediating ZIKV persistence through type I IFN downregulation [

 <xref rid="B55-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]; toll-like receptors 3 (TLR3) increase viral replication and are important mediators of inflammatory responses [
 <xref rid="B50-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]; infection triggers autophagy pathways, but their effects on viral replication and immune response are still controversial [
