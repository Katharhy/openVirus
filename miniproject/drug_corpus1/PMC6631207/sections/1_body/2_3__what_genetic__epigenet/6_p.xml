<p>Concerning the development of CZS, it can also be speculated that a pregnant womanâ€™s individual response to infection influences the efficiency with which ZIKV crosses the placental barrier. Trophoblasts, placental barrier cells, are permissive to ZIKV only during a narrow time-frame, likely in the first trimester of gestation [

 <xref rid="B70-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. This is probably one of the reasons why infection during this stage of pregnancy is usually associated to the birth of babies with more severe neurological outcomes. Trophoblasts secrete type III IFN [

 <xref rid="B70-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], and the amount of type III IFN released could be related to the efficacy of ZIKV infection in these cells. In addition, other events known to limit IFN response, like concomitant viral infections, could enhance ZIKV infectivity. Accordingly, concomitant infection with Herpes Simplex 2 virus (HSV-2) increases susceptibility of trophoblasts to ZIKV [

Alternatively, to direct transport, it is possible that maternal antibody-mediated transcytosis drives ZIKV transportation across the placental barrier. Indeed, experimental evidence has shown that placental ZIKV replication is enhanced by previous infection with Dengue virus [

 <xref rid="B71-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. In addition to trophoblasts, placenta villous macrophages (Hofbauer cells) and fibroblasts are susceptible to ZIKV infection [

 <xref rid="B72-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. When exposed to ZIKV, Hofbauer cells become activated, but the extent of activation and cytokine production is highly variable between individuals. It is thus possible that the intensity of placental immune response influences how much ZIKV actually reach the fetus [
