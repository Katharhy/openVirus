<p>Mutations in ZIKV genome may also promote host immune system evasion and enhance infectivity of mosquito hosts [

 <xref rid="B43-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and it has been speculated that prior contact to the virus may provide protective immunity [
 <xref rid="B44-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that the sudden exposure of an immunologically na√Øve population, in the American continent, provided unseen absolute numbers of acutely ZIKV-infected patients, favoring the observation of long-term consequences.
