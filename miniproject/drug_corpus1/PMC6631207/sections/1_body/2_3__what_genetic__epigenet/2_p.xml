<p>ZIKV strains isolated from different geographical regions are derived from two main lineages: African and Southeast Asian [

 <xref rid="B34-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], the ZIKV strain responsible for the outbreak in the Americas is genetically closer to strains isolated in French Polynesia in 2013 and belongs to the Southeast Asian subclade [
 <xref rid="B35-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. One study has shown that the contemporary strain (isolated in 2015â€“2016) carries several nucleotide substitutions when compared to a strain isolated in 2010 in Cambodia. A serine-to-asparagine substitution (S139N) in the Pr domain of the viral precursor membrane protein (prM), was shown to be especially responsible for its increased neurovirulence [
