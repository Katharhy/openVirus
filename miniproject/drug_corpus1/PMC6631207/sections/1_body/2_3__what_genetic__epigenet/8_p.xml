<p>As recently reviewed by Barbeito-Andr√©s and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B74-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], environmental stresses emerging from adverse social-economic conditions or other geographical factors can contribute to neurological outcome of infection. In Brazil, although the incidence of ZIKV infection was similar in all regions in 2015, congenital ZIKV syndrome was significantly higher in the northeast region, a severely impoverished region [

When comparing different regions of the northeast of Brazil, epidemiological studies showed that higher incidence of microcephaly was observed in districts with lower developmental index, higher rates of mosquito larvae density, and more inefficient sewage and garbage collection systems [
 <xref rid="B76-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Impoverished populations are more frequently susceptible to mal-nutrition or inappropriate diet, degrading housing conditions which facilitates mosquito spreading and disease transmission, higher incidence of coinfections and poorer access to health system and family planning, among others. Additional population-based and experimental studies should be performed in order to determine whether and how any of these factors has contributed to determine the higher rate of neurological complications due to ZIKV infection in specific geographical regions.
