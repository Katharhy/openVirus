<p>In line with this, individual responses determined by either genetic or epigenetic backgrounds have been shown to modulate susceptibility of cells in the developing brain to ZIKV. In a recent study, neural stem cells (NSCs) derived from three independent donors were infected in vitro with ZIKV (Mexico isolate). The virus was shown to replicate and induce decreased cell proliferation in all NSCs strains. However, NSCs from one of these donors were resistant to ZIKV-induced decrease in neuronal differentiation. RNA expression patterns changed accordingly: ZIKV-sensitive strains showed pronounced reduction in pathways related to neurogenesis and higher expression in pathways responsible for innate immune response [

Even though the study was performed in a small cohort, both concordant (both fetuses showing CZS) and discordant (only one fetus with CZS) twins were analyzed. No unique genetic trait that could explain differential susceptibility of siblings to developing CZS was found, therefore, authors suggest there could be multifactorial inheritance or even epigenetic modifications linked to different responses to viral infection. In line with this, NPCs and neurospheres derived from CZS-fetuses produced more infectious particles when exposed to ZIKV in vitro than those from non-CZS infants. RNA sequencing performed in these cells reported changes in expression patterns, notably upregulation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt pathways, exclusively in affected twins [
