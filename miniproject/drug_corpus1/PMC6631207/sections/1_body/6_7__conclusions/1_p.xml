<p>The unprecedented high number of neurological symptoms associated to ZIKV infection after its landing in the Americas in 2015 has left severe economic and social consequences that cannot be fully estimated. The observation that ZIKV infection leads to late neurological burden both in congenitally-exposed infants and in adult patients has stimulated the international scientific community enormously. Researchers of different fields worldwide have gathered efforts in order to identify the mechanisms underlying ZIKV neurotoxicity and to search for drug candidates that can halt infection and neurological complications. In this sense, drug repurposing becomes an attractive alternative because several steps of drug approval by regulatory agencies can be surpassed. Drugs of different classes and mechanisms of action, including RNA polymerase inhibitors and several antimalarial quinines have been tested against ZIKV replication and its neurological damage. However, despite the promising in vitro and in vitro results, none of them has reached clinical trials for ZIKV infection yet. In silico drug design should also be employed to generate analogs with improved efficacy and pharmacokinetics.</p>
