<p>Similar to other mosquito-borne diseases, clinical management of patients with ZIKV infection is largely based on alleviating symptoms of the acute phase of infection. The American Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization recommend generic measures such as resting, drinking fluids, and using over-the-counter medication to alleviate pain and fever [

However, considering the serious long-term damages that have been associated to ZIKV, it is increasingly clear that these patients need closer follow-up. Experimental and clinical studies have focused on testing prophylactic drugs and creating vaccines to prevent new ZIKV epidemics. Nevertheless, some effort has also been directed to preventing development of ZIKV-associated late complications, especially due to intra-uterine exposure of the virus. In this sense, drug repurposing is an especially promising approach, since it surpasses several steps of pre-clinical drug development [

In this section, we review evidence of several antiviral and disease-modifying drugs, either repurposed or under development, which have shown promising results in different models of ZIKV infection. These substances act either during acute stages of infection by inhibiting cell invasion or viral replication, or have shown potential to prevent the late complications of ZIKV infection (
