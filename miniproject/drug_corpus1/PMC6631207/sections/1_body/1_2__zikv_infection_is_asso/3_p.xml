<p>Neurological complications following ZIKV infection are not limited to cases of congenital infection [

 <xref rid="B18-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. One study found that 40% of patients still showed some kind of neurological alteration after 1 year of symptom onset, and after two years some patients had not yet fully recovered [
 <xref rid="B25-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Collectively, these reports demonstrate that ZIKV infection is also detrimental to the mature nervous system and is associated with a spectrum of neurological syndromes that may culminate in long-term consequences and even mortality. Whether these neurological consequences are a direct effect of ZIKV replication or are secondary to the host immune response still need to be investigated; a question that could lead to important clues on how to prevent long-term consequences of infection. Different research groups have shown beneficial effects of both antiviral and anti-inflammatory strategies in preventing long-term behavioral consequences of infection. These findings are reviewed in the following sections.
