<p>Another matter of concern involves the ability of ZIKV to persist in certain organs and tissues, since the late consequences of viral persistence remain unknown. ZIKV usually reaches detectable levels in the serum of patients within 3â€“10 days after onset of symptoms, shortly returning to undetectable levels [

 <xref rid="B29-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. ZIKV RNA was found in brains of babies exposed in utero on average 163 days after infection, and one study described high viral loads after post-mortem analysis of the brain of a 5-month-old infected infant [

In adult non-human primates infected subcutaneously with ZIKV, virus remained in neuronal tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, and lymph-nodes, while in the serum levels were undetectable after only seven days post-infection [

 <xref rid="B31-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Further evidence of persistent replication in neuronal tissue were found in immunocompetent mice infected during the neonatal period, where ZIKV negative RNA strand was detectable in the brain into adulthood (100 dpi), an indicative of active viral replication [
 <xref rid="B32-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Altogether, these results provide evidence that ZIKV is capable of persisting in certain tissues long after resolution of symptoms and clearance of virus from blood. Factors that may contribute to viral persistence remain unknown, as well as if new rounds of active viral replication and reoccurrence of symptoms can occur at later stages of life, including moments of compromised immune response or as consequence of other viral infections.
