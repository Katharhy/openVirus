<p>Extensive research has focused on unraveling the mechanisms of congenital microcephaly induced by ZIKV [

 <xref rid="B8-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, increasing evidence from clinical and experimental studies suggest that even infants considered healthy at birth can develop severe long-term neurological complications as a consequence of exposure. According to US hospital records, 6% of children infected with ZIKV in uterus showed malformations detectable at birth. Importantly, the percentage of infants with ZIKV-associated neurological complications rose to 14% when babies considered normal at birth were followed-up after leaving hospital [

Among the most common symptoms reported were personal-social developmental delays, swallowing difficulties, and a myriad of motor dysfunctions including compromised mobility, muscular hypertonia, dystonic movement, and impaired fine motor skills [

 <xref rid="B11-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Post-natal onset microcephaly was also reported, and studies suggest that 60% of normocephalic babies exposed to ZIKV in uterus present seizures at some stage of development [
 <xref rid="B11-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Several alterations were also described in brains of normocephalic ZIKV-exposed babies assessed by neuroimaging tools, including subcortical calcifications, increased frontal cerebrospinal fluid space and ventricle enlargement [

Infants exposed to ZIKV during the epidemic in the American continent are still under their third year of life, making it impossible to predict which of these symptoms may persist and if others may emerge. Animal models are useful tools to investigate the mechanisms of infection and its complications, and whereas most studies have focused on unraveling the mechanisms of ZIKV-induced microcephaly, a few others have provided insight into the mechanisms underlying late ZIKV-induced neurological damage. Using a mouse model of ZIKV infection, our group was able to predict possible long-term alterations in children after a congenital infection. Since the stage of development of the mouse brain at early postnatal period resembles the events taking place in the human brain during the second and third trimester of pregnancy [

 <xref rid="B15-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], we performed ZIKV infection shortly after birth (post-natal day 3). Indeed, we found that infected pups presented neuropathological hallmarks that closely resembled those seen in brains of babies after ZIKV congenital infection. Over 90% of mice showed spontaneous seizures during childhood, and intensity of seizures decreased as animals grew into adulthood. Moreover, even though these episodes resolved when animals became adults, mice infected neonatally with ZIKV remained more susceptible to chemically-induced seizures. Besides, ZIKV-infected mice showed motor and cognitive disabilities in adulthood. Similar results were obtained in another study, in which authors demonstrated that early-life infection with an African ZIKV strain results in persistent memory impairments in mice [

 <xref rid="B17-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and neuropathological characterization of brains showed reduced white matter volume, ventriculomegaly, and decreased hippocampal growth in ZIKV-infected animals.
