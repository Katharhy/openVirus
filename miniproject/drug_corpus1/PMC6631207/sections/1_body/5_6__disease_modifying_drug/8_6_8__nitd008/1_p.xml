<p>Adenosine analogs share the same mechanism of action which consists of impairing the function of viral RNA polymerase of several viruses such as measles and rabies [

 <xref rid="B132-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. NITD008 was able to decrease viral plaque forming units and diminish genome replication in culture lysates when added to Vero cells infected separately with two different strains of ZIKV [

 <xref rid="B97-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Previous reports had already indicated that NITD008 has good oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetic profile as well as low in vitro and only short-term in vitro toxicity [
