<p>Emricasan is a pan-caspase inhibitor which was shown to increase viability of human astrocytes and hNPCs infected with several different ZIKV strains [
 <xref rid="B87-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. This strong neuroprotective effect was not due to inhibition of ZIKV, suggesting that its mechanism of action is independent of viral replication inhibition. Interestingly, an additive effect was found when emricasan was used in combination with the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor PHA, significantly improving cell viability of human astrocyte cultures exposed to ZIKV when compared to the effects of both isolated substances. Emricasan was well tolerated in phase 1 studies and recently entered phase 2 clinical trial against hepatic consequences of HCV infection [
