<p>The screening performed by Xu and colleagues also identified the anti-helmintic drug niclosamide as a powerful antiviral drug against ZIKV, being able to mitigate infection in a human glioblastoma cell line (SNB-19) and in human astrocytes (Xu et al., 2016). In another study, two doses of niclosamide (on embryonic days 3 and 5; 50 mg/kg) were tested in a chick embryo model of ZIKV-induced microcephaly. Niclosamide was able to partially rescue ZIKV-induced reductions in cranial size and significantly improved brain inflammatory profile [

 <xref rid="B122-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. However, time-of-addition experiments indicate that niclosamide is still effective even after viral cell invasion is finished, suggesting that there might be other mechanisms by which the drug mitigates ZIKV infection. Several groups have developed innovative formulations in order to bypass its poor oral bioavailability [

 <xref rid="B125-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. It also has good safety profile, being considered an FDA category B drug [

 <xref rid="B127-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. Therefore, niclosamide seems like a good candidate for management of infection in adult non-pregnant patients and its use in pregnant women must be weighed.
