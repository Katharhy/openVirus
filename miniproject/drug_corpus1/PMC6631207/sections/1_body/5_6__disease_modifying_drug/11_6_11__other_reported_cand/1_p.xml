<p>Z2 is a synthetic peptide derived from the stem region of ZIKV envelope protein which showed potent anti-ZIKV activity. Z2 was able to inhibit infection and diminish cytotoxic effects of ZIKV on Vero and BHK21 cells. In pregnant ICR mice, Z2 was able to penetrate the placental barrier and cause no visible birth defects or perinatal damage in doses up to 120 mg/kg. It also blocked vertical transmission of ZIKV in this same mouse model at 10 mg/kg i.v. In both A129 and AG6 mouse models, Z2-treated mice showed decreased ZIKV-induced mortality and smaller viremia [

Therefore, despite promising results, these drugs are poor candidates for future development. Finally, a single study proposed natural products as possible ZIKV inhibitors. The flavonoids Myricetin and Quercetin were able to inhibit the ZIKV NS2B-NS3 pro protein complex with sub- and micromolar concentrations [
