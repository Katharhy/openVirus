<p>Ribavirin (RIB) is a nucleoside analogue used for the treatment of hepatitis C. In an early report, RIB was able to inhibit replication of several different ZIKV strains in vitro [

 <xref rid="B135-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. Conflicting results were obtained when RIB was tested in stem cells: while no inhibition of viral replication was found in iPSC-derived cells [

Nevertheless, in immunocompromised mice where infection leads to 100% mortality, administration of high doses (15 mg/day) of RIB for 3 consecutive days post-infection was able to partially suppress viremia and prolong survival for a few days [
