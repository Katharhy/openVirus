<p>Excessive glutamate release from synaptic terminals causes an overactivation of the nearby neuronal network leading to neuronal damage and death. Such phenomenon, named excitotoxicity, is a common feature of several neurological diseases [
 <xref rid="B116-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. Considering the extensive cell death caused by ZIKV, it is reasonable to hypothesize that glutamate released from infected/dying neurons could cause excitotoxicity in the brain and contribute to further aggravate neurodegeneration [
 <xref rid="B94-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Based on such assumption, Costa and colleagues showed the neuroprotective effect of several N-methyl D-Aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor blockers, including MK-801, agmatine sulfate, ifenprodil, and memantine (ME), in models of ZIKV-induced neuronal damage both in vitro and in vitro. Interestingly, all substances were able to prevent glial and neuronal death in primary cell cultures, even though viral load were unchanged. ME’s beneficial effect was further evaluated in mice lacking interferon-mediated immune response (IFN-α/βR
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice) infected with the Brazilian ZIKV strain: daily oral treatment with 30 mg/kg of ME from days 3 to 6 post-infection prevented ZIKV-induced increase in intraocular pressure, ameliorated brain histopathological lesions and led to decreased microgliosis [
