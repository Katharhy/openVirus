<p>Another drug with similar mechanism of action is BCX4430 (Galidesivir), which showed strong antiviral activity against yellow fever and several others viruses in previous studies, and was recently tested against ZIKV [

Furthermore, in a model of lethal infection in adult immunodeficient mice, treatment with BCX4430 for 8 days, starting 4 h prior to infection was able to improve survival and prevent infection-induced weight loss. Similar results were obtained when the drug was given 1 or 3 days post-infection [
