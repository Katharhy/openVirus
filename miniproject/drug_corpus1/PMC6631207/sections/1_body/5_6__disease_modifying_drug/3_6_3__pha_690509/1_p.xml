<p>Xu and colleagues were one of the first groups to make a large drug repurposing screen for ZIKV, obtaining exciting results [

One of the most interesting substances identified in this study was PHA-690509 (PHA), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, a drug that blocks the activity of several kinases involved in cell cycle regulation that is currently considered a potential drug candidate to treat ZIKV infection. PHA showed antiviral activity against two different ZIKV strains in human astrocytes derived from iPSCs and human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs). Twenty-seven other structurally related cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors were also tested, nine of which presented submicromolar IC
 <sub>50</sub> concentrations against ZIKV replication in culture. These findings open new avenues for drug design and in silico optimization. However, because viruses do not present cyclin-dependent kinases, it is possible that the effect of such drugs rely on the regulation of the host cell differentiation machinery. Therefore, such compounds might not be indicated for pregnant women as fetus development might be affected [
