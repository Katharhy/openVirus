<p>Considering the extensive pro-inflammatory profile of brain tissue during and after ZIKV infection, anti-inflammatory therapy might be of help to alleviate further detrimental consequences. Our group has recently evaluated whether the TNF-α neutralizing antibody infliximab (IFX) (20 μg/day) is able to prevent long-term consequences of ZIKV infection in neonatal (post-natal day 3) Swiss mice [

IFX treatment induced a 50% decrease in spontaneous seizures induced by infection and rescued sensitivity to seizures induced by chemicals in adulthood. However, ZIKV-induced memory and motor impairments in adult mice were not prevented by the TNF-α blocking antibody. An important limitation to therapeutic use of IFX is the increased risk to develop malignancies, such as lymphoma, when used for long periods in pediatric patients [
