<p>Early reports using in silico and in vitro approaches suggested the potential of sofosbuvir (SFB), an antiviral prodrug clinically used against hepatitis C virus (HCV), to inhibit ZIKV replication [

 <xref rid="B101-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Later, two independent groups published experimental evidence of anti-ZIKV activity of this drug. In these studies, it was shown that SFB effectively inhibited infection and replication by both African and American ZIKV strains in different in vitro models: placental and neuroblastoma cell lines, human fetal-derived neuronal stem cells, induced-pluripotent neural stem cells, and brain organoids [

 <xref rid="B103-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. It is a consensus that SFB’s mechanism of action consists on blocking the highly conserved RNA polymerase of flaviviruses [
 <xref rid="B103-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. However, in vitro findings show that SFB increases the frequency of viral genetic mutations, indicating a possible secondary mechanism of ZIKV replication blockage. Experiments performed in animal models also showed promising results, since administration of SFB in drinking water (33 mg/kg/day) to 5 weeks-old C57BL/6 mice infected with the African viral strain prevented ZIKV-induced mortality and weight loss [

 <xref rid="B105-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>], proving that a combination strategy might be beneficial. SFB is also an FDA category B drug, being considered generally safe for use during pregnancy based on preclinical studies. A Phase 1 clinical trial is currently being performed in order to evaluate the safety of SFB administration during pregnancy, and is scheduled to end by 2020 [
 <xref rid="B106-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Although mathematical modeling indicated that the expected dose needed for ZIKV inhibition would be twice the therapeutic dose used for HCV infections, it would still be below its toxicity threshold [

 <xref rid="B108-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. However, its high price might be a limitation to allow its widespread use in low- and middle-income countries.
