<p>Another RNA polymerase inhibitor that has been proposed as ZIKV therapeutic is favipiravir (FAV; T-705). Early reports indicated its ability to inhibit seven different ZIKV strains in preliminary tests in vitro [

 <xref rid="B89-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Conflicting results, however, were found in studies designed to evaluate whether FAV inhibits ZIKV replication in more complex models. While one group reported no effect on viral replication in either cortical neurons, motor neurons or astrocytes derived from induced-pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) [
 <xref rid="B90-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>], another study showed that FAV induced efficient reduction in ZIKV protein expression in human neural progenitor cells derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) [
 <xref rid="B91-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. This is likely due to the different source and/or differentiation stage of the stem cells used and the specific protocols used for each derivation. FAV has been shown to cause significant mutation in ZIKV genome, indicating yet another possible mechanism for its antiviral activity [

 <xref rid="B110-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. In silico models of ZIKV infection using non-human primate pharmacokinetic parameters, indicate that 150 mg/kg of FAV given twice daily is enough to reduce viral load, efficiently shortening disease duration [
 <xref rid="B111-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Given its good tolerability in clinical trials [
 <xref rid="B112-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>], FAV is a strong candidate for further pre-clinical and clinical testing for ZIKV treatment. Furthermore, its analog, T-1105, has also presented antiviral activity against SZ01 ZIKV strain [
 <xref rid="B89-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>], indicating it might be a good scaffold for drug development.
