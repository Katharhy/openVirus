<p>Retallack and colleagues used a drug repurposing strategy to identify the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin (AZT) as a potential anti-ZIKV drug. AZT was found to be the most promising drug, out of 2177 clinically-approved compounds, in preventing infection of the glial cell lineage U87 by rescuing cell viability [

AZT (10 mg/kg i.p.)-treated mice showed decreased mortality, better clinical score, fewer viral RNA copies in the brain and reduced monocyte infiltration following ZIKV infection [

 <xref rid="B115-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. Finally, its widespread availability in several formulations and considerably low cost makes AZT an interesting candidate for post-exposure ZIKV treatment. No studies so far have investigated the precise mechanism of action of this drug against ZIKV.
