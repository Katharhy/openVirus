<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) has been known since 1947 [
 <xref rid="B1-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and was historically regarded as a geographically restricted virus causing minor symptoms in humans. In 2013, this view started to change when ZIKV occurrence in French Polynesia was associated to development of Guillain-Barre syndrome, a serious autoimmune condition affecting the peripheral nervous system. Only two years later, the virus landed in the Americas, where it was responsible for a major outbreak becoming a serious public health concern. It is predicted that over 800,000 people were infected by ZIKV in the American continent between 2015 and 2018 [
 <xref rid="B2-pharmaceuticals-12-00060" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Following this epidemic, several studies endorsed a causal relationship between ZIKV infection and neurological disorders, both in congenitally-exposed newborns and in adult patients. The development or severity of these conditions cannot be predicted based on genetic or environmental factors, which reinforces the importance of long-term clinical surveillance of individuals exposed to ZIKV. Here, we review the epidemiology of ZIKV-associated complications and discuss experimental and clinical evidence of potential therapeutic approaches.
