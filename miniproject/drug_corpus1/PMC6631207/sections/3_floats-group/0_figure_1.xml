  <p>Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is associated to late detrimental effects to the developing and mature nervous systems. ZIKV infection during the perinatal period (
   <bold>a</bold>) and in adult patients (
   <bold>b</bold>) may be associated to late neurological complications. Although studies have raised possible contribution of several factors, the development or severity of these conditions cannot be fully predicted based on genetic or environmental factors, which reinforces the importance of long-term clinical surveillance of individuals exposed to ZIKV.
