    "Influenza, which is an acute respiratory disease caused by the influenza virus, represents a worldwide public health and economic problem owing to the significant morbidity and mortality caused by its seasonal epidemics and pandemics. Sensitive and convenient methodologies for the detection of influenza viruses are important for clinical care and infection control as well as epidemiological investigations. Here, we developed a multiplex reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) with quencher/fluorescence oligonucleotides connected by a 5' backward loop (LF or LB) primer for the detection of two subtypes of influenza viruses: Influenza A (A/H1 and A/H3) and influenza B. The detection limits of the multiplex RT-LAMP assay were 103 copies and 102 copies of RNA for influenza A and influenza B, respectively. The sensitivities of the multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP assay were 94.62% and 97.50% for influenza A and influenza B clinical samples, respectively. The specificities of the multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP assay were 100% for influenza A, influenza B, and healthy clinical samples. In addition, the multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP assay had no cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses."
