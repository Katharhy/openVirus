<p>Influenza A and B LAMP primer sets were designed within conserved regions of segment 7 of influenza A and the nucleoprotein gene of influenza B. For internal control, actin beta LAMP primer set was newly designed within of conserved regions of human actin beta mRNA (NM_001101.5:c.287-c.498), which is commonly used as internal control [

All LAMP primers, including two outer primers (forward primer F3 and backward primer B3), two inner primers (forward inner primer FIP and backward inner primer BIP), and two loop primers (forward loop primer LF and backward loop primer LB), were designed using Primer Explorer software (Version 4; Eiken Chemical Co., Tokyo, Japan). For the multiplex LAMP assay, we designed the fluorophore probe oligomer (32 mer) at the 5â€² LF or LB primer and the quencher oligonucleotide (30 mer), which is the complementary sequence of the fluorophore probe oligomer, using Random DNA Sequence Generator (

All primers were assessed for specificity before use in the LAMP assays via a BLAST search of sequences in GenBank (National Center for Biotechnology Information [NCBI], Bethesda, MD). All LAMP primers and probes were synthesized by Macrogen, Inc. (Seoul, South Korea;
