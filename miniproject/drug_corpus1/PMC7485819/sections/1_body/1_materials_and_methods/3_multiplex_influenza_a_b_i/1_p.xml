<p>The influenza A/B/IC multiplex RT-LAMP assay was performed with a Mmiso RNA amplification kit (Mmonitor, South Korea). The RT-LAMP reaction was prepared with 12.5 μL of 2x reaction buffer, 1.25 μL of influenza A LAMP primer mix, 0.625 μL of influenza B LAMP primer mix, 0.625 μL of internal control LAMP primer mix, 720 nM quencher solution, 2 μL of enzyme mix, and 2.5 μL of sample RNA (final reaction volume: 25 μL). The composition of the LAMP primer mix (influenza A and influenza B) included 4 μM of two outer primers (F3 and B3), 32 μM of two inner primers (FIP and BIP), 10 μM of loopB primer, 4 μM of loopF primer, and 6 μM of loopF probe primer. The composition of the internal control LAMP primer mix included 4 μM of two outer primers (F3 and B3), 32 μM of two inner primers (FIP and BIP), 10 μM of loopF primer, 4 μM of loopB primer, and 6 μM of loopB probe primer. The RT-LAMP assay was run on the CFX 96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) at 60°C for 60 min. In LAMP assay, negative control (human serum RNA and distilled water) were used for setting baseline. Positive signal was determined by checking whether signal is steep or gradual considering the baseline, because baseline of LAMP assay is not stable compared to qPCR or RT-PCR. The FAM, HEX and Texas red fluorescence channels was used for detecting Influenza A, influenza B and internal control (actin beta), respectively.</p>
