<p>pTOP Blunt V2 plasmids, including the segment 7 partial sequences of Influenza A, were used to test the LOD of the influenza A LAMP assay. For the LOD of the influenza B LAMP assay, pTOP Blunt V2 plasmids, including the nucleoprotein gene partial sequences of influenza B, were used. pTOP Blunt V2 plasmids, including the beta actin partial sequences of human, were used to test the LOD of the Internal control LAMP assay. All plasmids were constructed by Macrogen, Inc. The plasmids were serially diluted 10-fold from 1.0 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> copies/μL to 1.0 × 10
 <sup>1</sup> copies/μL to determine the LOD of the multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP assay. In addition, the LOD of the multiplex influenza A/B/IC LAMP analysis was tested using clinical samples of influenza A/H1, A/H3, and B. Clinical specimens were diluted 10 times (as much as 10
 <sup>−1</sup> to 10
 <sup>−6</sup> times) based on the original samples. The LOD of the multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP analysis for clinical influenza samples was compared to those of the WHO influenza A/B primer set and RealStar® Influenza RT-PCR Kit 2.0.
