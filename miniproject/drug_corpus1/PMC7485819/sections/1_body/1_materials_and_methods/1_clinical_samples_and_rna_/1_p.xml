<p>Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were collected from patients presenting flu-like symptoms at Korea University Guro Hospital from January 2018 to December 2018. A total of 314 NP specimens were used in this study, including 100 negative and 214 positive specimens of the following viruses: 11 influenza A/H1, 82 influenza A/H3, 80 influenza B, 4 RSV A, 4 RSV B, 4 adenovirus, 4 parainfluenzavirus (PIV1-4), 9 coronavirus (OC43, NL63, and 229E), 4 human bocavirus (HBoV), 4 human enterovirus (HEV), 4 human rhinovirus (HRV), and 4 metapneumovirus (MPV). All virus specimens were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using an Anyplex II RV16 Detection Kit (Seegene, Inc., Seoul, South Korea). In addition, H5, H7 and H9 subtypes of avian influenza viruses were provided by Department of Veterinary Microbiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kangwon National University School of Medicine, Korea. RNA extraction was performed with a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's manual. RNA was extracted from 140 μL of samples and stored at -50°C. All LAMP assays were performed blindly with the operator unaware of any previous test results. This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Korea University Guro Hospital (2019GR0055).</p>
