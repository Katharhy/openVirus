<p>RT-LAMP analysis is one of the most promising diagnostic tools for use in the field since it does not require sophisticated and expensive equipment or skilled personnel [

In order to utilize the multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP assay in the field, it is necessary to use an isothermal amplification device that detects portable multiple fluorescence. Most of the field isothermal amplifiers currently available have been developed as single channel. However, two-channel isothermal amplifiers (Genie III; OptiGene, West Sussex, UK) have recently been developed and marketed by Chayon Laboratories, Inc. Since there are no field isothermal amplifiers with three channels yet, the influenza A/B and internal control LAMP kits cannot be used. However, by excluding the internal control, influenza A and B can now be diagnosed in the field using commercially available isothermal amplifiers. In addition, conventional RNA extraction methods, which extract RNA using centrifuges from NP swabs or aspirate samples collected from suspected influenza patients, are time-consuming and may be potentially contaminated. Therefore, it is expected that influenza field diagnosis can be performed more effectively by using an RNA extraction chip [
