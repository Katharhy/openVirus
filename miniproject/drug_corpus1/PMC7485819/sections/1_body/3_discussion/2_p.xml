<p>Our results showed that the multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP assay had 100% analytical specificity for the identification of influenza A/H1, A/H3, and B viruses, and there was no cross-reaction with other genetically or clinically related control viruses tested in this study. The multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP assay for influenza A clinical samples (n = 93) had a sensitivity and specificity of 94.62% and 100%, respectively. However, the multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP assay showed a 90% sensitivity for influenza A/H1 because out of the 11 specimens that were positive for influenza A/H1, only 10 were determined by the assay to be positive. Further testing with additional clinical specimens is needed to evaluate the clinical performance characteristics of the multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP assay to address the issue of the small sample size used (n = 10). In addition, the internal control signal showed in a very low sensitivity for influenza A clinical samples but not influenza B samples and negative clinical samples. This result might be that LAMP amplification reagents were consumed for the amplification of influenza A or influenza A amplification products interrupt the amplification of the internal control. Interestingly, the multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP assay had a lower detection sensitivity for diluted clinical samples than the RealStar® Influenza RT-PCR Kit 2.0 but higher sensitivity for original clinical samples. These results suggest that the multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP assay had a higher sensitivity for various influenza genetic sequences while the RealStar® Influenza RT-PCR Kit 2.0 had a higher sensitivity for specific influenza genetic sequences.</p>
