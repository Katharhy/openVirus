<p>Currently, diagnosis methods for influenza viruses include the antigen antibody test, the hemagglutination inhibition test, enzyme immunoassay, microscopic diagnosis, and molecular diagnosis [

 <xref rid="pone.0238615.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, serological tests have low sensitivity and specificity in comparison with PCR and PCR-based assays requiring expensive instruments, specialized technicians, and complicated procedures; thus, all these methods are unsuitable for rapid diagnosis in field situations [

The LAMP assay is a rapid, highly sensitive isothermal nucleic acid amplification through chain substitution reaction. LAMP amplifies the target gene at 60–65°C with six primers, including four primers selected by combining six parts of a target DNA strand and two additional loop primers. Bst DNA polymerase, which is a strand displacement DNA polymerase, is used in the LAMP assay to enable loop structure formation of the inner primers, producing LAMP’s unique rapid self-priming amplification [
