<p>For multiple detection using the LAMP assay, an assimilating probe consisting of the fluorescently tagged probe and its complementary sequence probe tagged with quencher was developed. This probe works by separating fluorescently-tagged oligonucleotides from the quencher-tagged probe. As a result, fluorescence is observed in real-time and measured from the fluorescently-tagged probe that has been incorporated into RT-LAMP products [
