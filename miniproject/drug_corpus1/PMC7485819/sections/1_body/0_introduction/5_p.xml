<p>In this study, we present a rapid multiplex RT-LAMP diagnosis method for influenza A, influenza B, and an internal control using a newly designed target-specific assimilating probe and fluorescently-tagged strand displaceable probes. This multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP assay had high sensitivities for influenza A and influenza B without interference from one another. Moreover, the assay showed no cross-reactivity against other respiratory and hemorrhagic fever viruses.</p>
