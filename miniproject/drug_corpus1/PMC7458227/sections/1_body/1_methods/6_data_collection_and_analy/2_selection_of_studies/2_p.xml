<p>We chose the the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses flow chart to show the process of selecting literature for the entire study (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Before searching the literature, all reviewers will discuss and determine the screening criteria. After the screening requirements are clearly defined, the 2 reviewers will independently review and screen the literature. They screened the titles and abstracts of the literature, in order to get qualified studies, and then excluded some duplicate studies or studies with incomplete information. We will also try to obtain the full text, and the obtained literature will be managed by using EndNote software, V.X8 (United States). In case of disagreement between the 2 reviewers, discussions will be held with the third author for arbitration.
