<p>The spread of infection is through droplets from respiratory tract secretions and possibly a fecal–oral route. Once the pandemic subsides, it needs to be seen whether the disease would become an endemic or vanishes rapidly. The reproductive number (R
 <sub>0</sub>) for SARS-CoV-2 is around 3, which means each case infects three new cases.[

 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] This is much higher than H1N1 influenza which is 1.4–1.6. Although the virus has been isolated from conjunctival secretions, tears, and stools, it is unclear whether these may be a source of infection.[
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The CoV-2 is apparently quite sturdy with a recent study reporting that the virus can survive on steel and plastic for up to 4 days similar to the CoV-1.[
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] SARS-CoV-1 epidemic also had previously reported in patients, family members, and hospital staff indicating a nosocomial spread.[
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The incubation period varies but is usually within 14 days.[
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The case fatality rate is 2%–4%, compared to 10% and 35% for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS, respectively.
