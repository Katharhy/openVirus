<p>In case of no lower respiratory tract involvement, isolation is advised. Once patient develops lower respiratory tract infection, supplemental oxygen, high-flow nasal cannula, or noninvasive ventilation (NIV) may be attempted. A full face mask or helmet mask may be tried. However, close watch should be kept on the patient's condition; in case of deterioration or NIV failure, prompt intubation should be done. Mechanical ventilation should be initiated as per the acute respiratory distress syndrome net protocol. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be needed in severe cases. Elderly patients, comorbid conditions, high d-dimer levels, or higher sequential organ failure assessment score have been associated with worse survival.[
