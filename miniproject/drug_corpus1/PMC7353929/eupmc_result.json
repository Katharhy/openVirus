    "COVID-19 has emerged as one of the most significant illnesses of the current century. It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The world was initially viewing it as a localized outbreak in Wuhan city of China; however, it started spreading quickly to other parts of the world. Globally, half-hearted containment measures and a false sense of safety against this novel coronavirus led to the dissemination of disease. Currently, no effective therapy or vaccine is available to manage this illness. After learning a huge lesson, global efforts would hopefully lead to effective control of this pandemic."
