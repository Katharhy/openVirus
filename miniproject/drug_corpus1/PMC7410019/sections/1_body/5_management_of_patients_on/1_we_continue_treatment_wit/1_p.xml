<p>We do not apply prophylactic interruption or dose reductions of ibrutinib, acalabrutinib or venetoclax based on the reasoning that once treatment has started, the dose intensity should be preserved to grant the maximum benefit. This is illustrated by the evidence that temporary ibrutinib dose interruptions associate with shorter progression free survival, suggesting that patients who are able to better adhere to treatment may derive more benefit.
