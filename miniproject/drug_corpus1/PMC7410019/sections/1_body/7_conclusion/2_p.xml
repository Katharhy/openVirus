<p>We hope that the comments and recommendations made in this paper are useful to the global medical community, patients with CLL and physicians looking after them. Also, that they serve as background for further refinement as our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 infection unfolds, a process which requires a continued multidisciplinary and international collaboration.</p>
