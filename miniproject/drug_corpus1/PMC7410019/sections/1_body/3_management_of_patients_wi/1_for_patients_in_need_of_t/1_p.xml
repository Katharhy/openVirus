<p>CLL is a chronic disease that very rarely poses an imminent risk of death even when it is in advanced stage. The risk of death from COVID-19 in patients with CLL has not yet been established, making it difficult to balance the risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection and those of starting, deferring, or halting treatment on life expectancy. Nevertheless, under an epidemic scenario, we estimate the risks of community and nosocomial infection by SARS-CoV-2 and of complicated COVID-19 higher than the risk of delaying CLL treatment. Under an endemic scenario (ie, Rτ &lt;1, where Rτ is the average number of secondary infections produced when one infected individual is introduced into a host population where everyone is susceptible, Rτ &gt;1 indicates that outbreak will lead to an epidemic, and Rτ &lt;1 that the outbreak will become extinct),

 </sup> we estimate the benefit of a treatment known to prolong the survival of patients with CLL higher than the risks of community and nosocomial infection by SARS-CoV-2 and symptomatic COVID-19.
