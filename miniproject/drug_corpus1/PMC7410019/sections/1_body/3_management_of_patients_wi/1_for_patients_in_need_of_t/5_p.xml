<p>The iwCLL recommends starting therapy when the Hb level is &lt;10â€Šg/dL, as a proxy of lower quality of life and cardiovascular risk; in other conditions, symptomatic anemia rather than a defined cut-off is used to trigger intervention. Iron deficiency with or without anemia is a frequent complication in lymphoid malignancies and more in general in cancer, occurring in approximately 40% of cases and must be considered in the differential diagnosis of anemia.
