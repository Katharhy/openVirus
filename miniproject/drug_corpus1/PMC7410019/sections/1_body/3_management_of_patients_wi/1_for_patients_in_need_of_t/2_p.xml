<p>This reasoning is based on the following indirect evidence. First, in cancer patients, the COVID-19 case fatality rate is estimated to be 6% to 7%.

 </sup> Unadjusted statistics point to a higher mortality by COVID-19 among cancer patients than in the general population.

 </sup> Likewise, in a retrospective study during the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus pandemic, cancer patients had a higher incidence of 30-day mortality (18%) compared with the general population.

 </sup> Second, a pattern of decreasing risk of death was reported for the Middle East respiratory syndrome as the infection reproduction number declined toward a more endemic level (Rτ &lt;1).

 </sup> Third, the introduction of chemo(immuno)therapy and targeted agents in the treatment of CLL led to a 6% relative survival improvement and to a 10% decrease of deaths per 100-patient/year compared to palliative therapies used in the 1980s.
