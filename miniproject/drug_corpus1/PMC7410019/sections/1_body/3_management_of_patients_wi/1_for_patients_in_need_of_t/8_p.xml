<p>Disease-related symptoms (ie, extreme fatigue; unintentional weight loss ≥10% within the previous 6 months; fever &gt; 38.0°C for 2 or more weeks without evidence of infection; drenching night sweats for ≥1 month without evidence of infection) or short lymphocyte doubling time (LDT) are very infrequently (∼5%) the only reason to start therapy and we emphasize carefully excluding causes other than CLL.
