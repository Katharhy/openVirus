 </sup> For patients enrolled in clinical trials, the patient's safety remains a priority and it is better to avoid all unnecessary visits, CT scans and lab tests requested per protocol, following regulatory agencies and/or sponsor ad hoc guidelines. Only those exams that will have a direct impact on the clinical management of patients should be performed and in-hospital visits should be replaced with remote consultations.
