<title>We limit patientsâ€™ exposure to potential nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection by minimizing the number of visits, postponing in-hospital routine follow-up appointments, and substituting them with remote check-ins. Routine lab samples are often omitted in the absence of new or increasing symptoms and, in case they are needed, local/home collection is a viable option</title>
