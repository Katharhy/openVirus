<p>Typical of respiratory viruses like influenza virus, SARS‐CoV‐2019 can spread through large droplets (with a transmission risk restricted to ~6 ft from the patient).

  <sup>26</sup>
 </xref> The droplet containing viral particles (saliva or mucous droplets) can be ejected during coughing, sneezing, laughing, singing, breathing, and talking. If these droplets do not encounter anything along the way, they typically land on the ground or the floor. This transmission via large droplet can be reduced by using a normal surgical‐style mask.
