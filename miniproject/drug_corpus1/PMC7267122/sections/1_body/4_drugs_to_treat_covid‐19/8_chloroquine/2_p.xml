<p>Chloroquine, generally used for amebiasis and malaria, is currently being considered for treating COVID‐19 in view of its ability to interfere with the cellular receptor ACE2. It also impairs the acidification of endosomes, thereby impeding virus trafficking inside cells. Although chloroquine has been unsuccessful in treatment of SARS‐infected mice,
