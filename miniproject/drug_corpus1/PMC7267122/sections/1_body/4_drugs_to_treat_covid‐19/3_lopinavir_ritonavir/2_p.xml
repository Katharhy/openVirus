<p>Lopinavir and ritonavir are protease inhibitors that work in conjunction to block viral replication. Ritonavir, being a CYP3A inhibitor, reduces the metabolism of lopinavir, thus boosting its levels. A 4 ug/mL concentration of lopinavir was required for in vitro antiviral activity against SARS while 1ug/mg of lopinavir was enough when used in combination with ribavirin.

 </xref> Both protease inhibitors appear to function synergistically with ribavirin. Combination of all three drugs has been used previously on SARS and MERS.

 </xref> Recently, the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir has not proven impressive, suggesting that a cocktail of ribavirin/lopinavir/ritonavir might be required for efficacy.

 </xref> Nevertheless, lopinavir/ritonavir is advantageous over ribavirin because of its wide availability and an established toxicity profile.
