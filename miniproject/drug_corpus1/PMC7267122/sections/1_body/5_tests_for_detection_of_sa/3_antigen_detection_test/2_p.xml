<p>The presence of SARS‐CoV‐2 viral proteins (antigens) in a sample from the respiratory tract of a person can also be detected within 30 minutes by rapid antigen detection test. If the sample contains a sufficient concentration (actively replicating titre) of viral proteins (target antigens), it will produce a visually detectable signal by binding to the specific antibodies immobilized on a paper strip. However, the sensitivity of the test varies between 34% and 80%, as it depends on the concentration of virus in the specimen, the time from onset of illness, and the quality of the specimen.
