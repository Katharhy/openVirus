Till then, the opportunities of disruption of disease transmission and clinical interventions might have already passed. Also, it suffers from drawbacks of cross reactivity with other pathogens and provides false‐positive results. Till date, there is no evidence of prediction of patient's immunity for reinfection by antibody detection. WHO also does not recommend this diagnostic test for patient care.
