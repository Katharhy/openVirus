<p>The primary pathology of COVID‐19 is ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), characterized by diffuse damage of alveolar cells and hyaline membranes. Direct invasion of the virus causes cytopathogenic changes in pneumocytes instead of a purely hyperinflammatory injury.

 </xref> Recent studies suggest that patients with severe conditions respond to COVID‐19 with an exuberant “cytokine release storm” (that shows characteristics of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or bacterial sepsis). The condition may show clinical markers of enhanced levels of ferritin and C‐reactive protein that may correspond with disease mortality and severity.
