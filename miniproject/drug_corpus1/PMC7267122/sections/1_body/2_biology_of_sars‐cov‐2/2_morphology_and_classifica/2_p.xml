<p>Coronaviruses (Latin: corona = crown) are positive sense single‐stranded, segmented, enveloped large RNA viruses that infect a wide range of animals, including humans. Morphologically spherical virions, they bear a core shell with surface projections that make them resemble a crown. They were first described by Tyrell and Bynoe in 1966, from patients with the common cold.
