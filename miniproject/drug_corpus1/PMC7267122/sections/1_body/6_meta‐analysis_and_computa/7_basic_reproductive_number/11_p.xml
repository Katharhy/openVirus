   <p>The authors in this study proposed a SEIR compartmental model to account for individual behavioral reaction (represented by 
    <inline-formula>
     <italic>α</italic>
    </inline-formula>) and the governmental action (represented by 
    <inline-formula>
     <italic>κ</italic>
    </inline-formula>) (eg, hospitalization, quarantine holiday extension, and travel restriction) in Wuhan, China. The estimates of these two key components were taken from the 1918 influenza pandemic that emerged in London, United Kingdom.

   <p>The study involved simulating three different cases: i) a naive scenario (no individual reaction or governmental action) ii) with only individual reaction, and iii) with both individual reaction and governmental actions. The simulation results showed that the daily new infections fell dramatically as the governmental actions and individual reactions were increased. Furthermore, it has been specifically shown that for 
    <inline-formula>
     <italic>α</italic> = 0.9
    </inline-formula> and 
    <inline-formula>
     <italic>κ</italic> &gt; 110
    </inline-formula>, the simulated data largely match the observed data. This model accurately fits the officially reported data from Wuhan, China, and can be used as starting point to carry forward numerical simulations of the disease spread to other countries.
