<p>Pairwise transmission models have a long history and are well-liked in the community, but I have always wondered what the independence assumption means. Clearly if some individual A is in the dataset, then someone infected A (or A is the index case). If J infected A, then B did not infect A, nor C, D, â€¦, because A can only have one infector. When we assume independence of all the transmission events, we cannot take these constraints into account.</p>
