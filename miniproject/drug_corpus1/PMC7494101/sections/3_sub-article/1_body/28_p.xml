<p>Reviewer #1: This manuscript describes a new method to detect variation in transmission rates from the shape of the phylogenetic tree reconstructed from pathogen sequences. This quantity has public health relevance because it may enable one to optimize the allocation of prevention resources by focusing on those individuals with the highest probability of onward transmission, based on past dynamics.</p>
