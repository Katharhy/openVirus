<p>- Text S4: “During this simulation, when there is a newly diagnosed individual, the corresponding NCE value is calculated and the decision of contact tracing has been made based on the NCE value.” Is there a delay in this simulation for the time between diagnosis and sampling (sequencing), which would be required to compute the NCE value associated with that individual?</p>
