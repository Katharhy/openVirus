<p>I think the main text should state more about the simulation method, as it is inconvenient to have to go and dig it out of a supplement; in particular, the fact that you simulate trees rather than sequences is quite important as it means that you cannot see how robust the method is to tree uncertainty; given that you required timed trees, there is also the potential for the nuances of timed tree reconstruction to contribute to bias or noise in the estimates.</p>
