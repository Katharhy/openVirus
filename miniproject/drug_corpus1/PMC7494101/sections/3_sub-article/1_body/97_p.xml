<p>There are various plots with “coefficient of variation” as the title and throughout there are plot titles but no y axis labels, which left me confused. Fig 6 - CV_lambda is on the x axis; what is y. I can’t tell from the caption what the vertical axis is showing. In Fig 3, CV_\\lambda is defined as “levels of heterogeneity” - what is it, in terms of the parameters of the simulation model?</p>
