<p>An important starting assumption of the model is that transmission unfolds in an infinite population of susceptible hosts, which supports the approximation that “transmission events occur independently” (line 164), for instance. The authors evaluate their model when this assumption is relaxed - however, this was carried out in the initial exponential growth phase of the epidemic (starting from a single infected individual to an average of 120 infections in a total population of 1000 hosts). This minimizes the effect of limited susceptibles, i.e., the “collision” of infected lineages, and it would be helpful to see the robustness of the model when the epidemic is at a more intermediate stage.</p>
