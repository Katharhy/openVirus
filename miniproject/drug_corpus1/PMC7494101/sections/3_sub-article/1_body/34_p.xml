<p>The GitHub repository should incorporate the documentation in the Word document (which is a binary file) into the README in the conventional Markdown format. In addition, I found that the Python scripts do not adhere to PEP8 (e.g., lack of whitespace separating arguments) and there is a general lack of inline or block comments that would make it easier to review the code. Variables such as “mu_RecEst” need to be defined within the source code. There are multiple uses of undocumented magic numbers (e.g., 9999) where it is more conventional to use the Python Nonetype or 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://math.inf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">math.inf</ext-link>. The module documentation needs to provide installation instructions, including module dependencies such as matplotlib and scipy. The tutorial is incomplete and should provide instructions for loading the module prior to calling functions such as “singleSimu”.
