<p>Overall, I found this an interesting manuscript. It is written well and I found the model description mostly straight-forward. As discussed above, there are a number of potentially (or almost certainly) problematic model assumptions that need to be explored further, and the authors should address other work in this area and perform some comparison of methods.</p>
