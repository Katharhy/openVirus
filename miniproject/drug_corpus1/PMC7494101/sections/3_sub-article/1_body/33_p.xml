<p>While the authors evaluated the assumption of incomplete sampling by allowing for transmission to unsampled individuals, they also assume that there is no onward transmission from unsampled to sampled individuals - viz., from the Supplementary Text S1: “Furthermore, we assume that the unsampled individuals have small level of transmissibility rates and that they caused no infection before being diagnosed.” This is an unrealistic assumption and especially problematic in the case of targeting specific individuals for public health intervention – to say nothing of the potential exposure of individuals to stigma and criminalization – and it should be described more transparently in the manuscript (for instance, around lines 221-223) and rationale given.</p>
