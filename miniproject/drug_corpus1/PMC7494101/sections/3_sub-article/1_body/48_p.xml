<p>Reviewer #2: With this manuscript the authors propose a method to estimate the amount of transmission heterogeneity based on virus sequence data in a sampled epidemic and suggest useful applications for the method. While the method is very interesting and the implementation of heterogeneity is simple but novel, the range of simulated situations is rather limited, e.g. it was only tested for a single R0 value (2.5). Hence, I suggest to ensure the method is indeed applicable to a wide range of situations.</p>
