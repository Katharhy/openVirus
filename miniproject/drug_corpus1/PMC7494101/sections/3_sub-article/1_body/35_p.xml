<p>In my small experiments with these scripts, I found that mean $\\lambda$ was substantially underestimated when setting $\\mu$ to 3.0 - the average estimate of 5 trials was 1.57 ($\\gamma$ set to 0.3). This may be masked by reporting accuracy for CV and not the mean, particularly when the variation parameter is underestimated the same way. Please provide results for these parameters individually. There also seems to be some interaction with $\\gamma$; if I set this parameter to 0.7 then the mean estimate of $\\mu$ increased to 1.99. This effect on parameter identifiability should be explored.</p>
