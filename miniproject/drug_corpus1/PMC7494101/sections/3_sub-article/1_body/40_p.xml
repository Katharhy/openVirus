<p>- Minor point (line 94): I prefer to reserve the term “genealogy” for describing the ancestral relationships among individuals in a population, and “phylogeny” for the ancestral relationships among populations. Thus the variable G represents a phylogeny relating infections sampled from different hosts. However, I also recognize that others refer to this tree as a “genealogy” or use these terms interchangeably.</p>
