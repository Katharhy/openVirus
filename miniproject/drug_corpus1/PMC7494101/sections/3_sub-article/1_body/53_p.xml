<p>ll 282ff &amp; Fig 3: the upward vs downward bias changes at CV~SQRT(2) for the 3 parameters R0, mu, gamma. and the same is seen in Fig 5. I doubt this is a coincidence, but that it has to do with the characteristics of the gamma function employed to model heterogeneity (if I understand correctly CV_lambda is the inverse squareroot of the shape parameter, is that right?). the authors should explore this and discuss how this may be used to assess in which direction they expect bias to occur.Â </p>
