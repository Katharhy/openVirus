<p>As developers and users of phylogenetic methods in the context of HIV-1, we are obligated to discuss the ethical implications of work that can be potentially used for source attribution (i.e., “who infected whom”). Specifically, this study proposes to identify individuals who are associated with higher numbers of coalescent events, which can be loosely interpreted as transmission events, as targets for public health intervention. In light of ongoing criminalization of HIV in many countries worldwide, and where punishments are often disproportionately severe, it is inevitable that methods such as the one presented by the authors here will also be used in the prosecution of individuals for transmission without disclosure. The authors should address this problem in the discussion section of their revised manuscript.</p>
