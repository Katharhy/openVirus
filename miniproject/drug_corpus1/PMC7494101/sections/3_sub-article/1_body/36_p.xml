<p>I could not find details on run times of the analysis or estimates of time complexity. It took roughly 10 seconds to simulate and analyze a single tree with sample size 100 (default setting) on a rather outdated iMac (late 2013), and about 1 minute for a sample of 200, so I suspect that the complexity will be quadratic or more with sample size. An assessment of computing time should be incorporated into the revision.</p>
