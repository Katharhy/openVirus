<p>A birth-death model with constant rates (even rates that vary between individuals) is a very poor match for the within-host natural history of HIV infection, which has an early high-transmission phase, followed by a long chronic infection phase, and then followed by progression to AIDS (in the absence of treatment). With treatment, the assumption that transmission ceases is good in some settings (with great treatment adherence and little resistance, for example), and poorer in others. But in pretty much all settings, assuming a constant infectivity for 2.5 years is not a great model; this needs to be discussed.</p>
