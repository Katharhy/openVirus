<p>Another, more problematic assumption of this model is that the expected time to diagnosis is the same across all individuals. Incomplete and inevitably biased sampling (diagnosis) is widely recognized as a severe confounding problem in measuring variation in transmission rates. For example, if individuals with higher transmission rates are also more likely to be lost to follow-up for sampling (sequencing after diagnosis), then the model (and most other models as well) will suffer from a systematic loss of sensitivity. This limitation should be addressed in the Discussion section.</p>
