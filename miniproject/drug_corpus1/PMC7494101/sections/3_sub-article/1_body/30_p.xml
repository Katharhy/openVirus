<p>Furthermore, the rates in the heterogeneous model are distributed among individuals in an uncorrelated fashion with respect to the transmission history, whereas the rates are autocorrelated in the two-type and multi-state models. This difference highlights the focus of this manuscript on the individual host, rather than groups in a risk-structured population. The assumption of uncorrelated transmission rates (absence of homophily by risk) needs to be justified (e.g., is it appropriate for HIV-1), as it is a distinctive feature of this model. The authors should also evaluate the impact of variation in diagnosis rates among individuals (rate parameter $\\gamma$) on their power to detect heterogeneity in transmission rates (more below).</p>
