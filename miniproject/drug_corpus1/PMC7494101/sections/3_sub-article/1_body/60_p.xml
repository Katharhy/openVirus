<p>- I would guess that the low gamma estimate in IDU_B is an artefact of the root of the tree ranging much further back than the oldest sample. this translates to a very long infectious period for the first cases, but is more likely a bias in the sampling process. can the model account for that by letting the sampling process start later? </p>
