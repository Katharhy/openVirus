<p>I really donâ€™t see why the sampling ratio of the G(s) (t-Lp) is rho_SD *p . You have *set* p, so p could be whatever you choose. How does Lp provide an estimation about the p percentile for the distribution of infectious periods, and how does this mean that you know the sampling ratio of G(s)(t-Lp)?</p>
