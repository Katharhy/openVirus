<p>More specifically, the "heterogeneous birth-death" model presented by the authors is an extension of the standard birth-death model to accommodate variation in transmission rates among individuals through a random-effects approach, where these rates are drawn from a gamma distribution to be parameterized from the data. This random-effects approach is distinct from that of otherwise similar models, such as Kuhnert’s two-type birth-death model (PLOS Pathog 14(2): e1006895), Barido-Sottani’s multi-state birth-death model (J R Soc Interface 15(146)) or McCloskey’s pure-birth model (PLOS Comput Biol 13(11): e1005868), where lineages “evolve” between latent discrete branching rate states. Notably, none of these publications are cited by the authors. (See also a preprint from Volz et al.; bioRxiv,

Since the authors are presenting a new method, they should also evaluate their method alongside at least one of these other approaches that are generally designed to accomplish the same objective.
