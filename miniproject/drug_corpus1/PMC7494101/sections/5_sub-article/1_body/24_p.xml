<p>Results, lines 364-384: Your comparison of the uncorrelated model to the MMPP model is problematic because you have simulated transmission rates as being drawn individually (in an uncorrelated fashion) from a gamma distribution. This violates a central assumption of the MMPP, which is premised on the existence of correlated rates (which is how clusters are identified). It is therefore not at all surprising that your model performs well on data simulated under the same model, and MMPP performs poorly when its core assumption is broken. The honest approach would be to evaluate the methods under both uncorrelated and correlated scenarios, recognizing that MMPP should be unable to detect variation in transmission rates in the uncorrelated scenario. In addition, MMPP does not attempt to estimate R0 â€” it is misleading to present results (Figure S9) that indicate otherwise.</p>
