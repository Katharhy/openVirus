<p>Introduction, lines 45-52: The addition of this text helps clarify that the authors’ model assumes that variation in transmission rates are uncorrelated (independent draws from some parametric distribution). However, the rationale provided by the authors — “varying degrees of social activity” — implies auto-correlation in transmission rates, since risk behaviours exhibit a high degree of homophily. Varying viral loads is time-heterogeneous within individuals, whereas your model assumes rates are time-invariant at the level of individuals. Thus, the rationale for your model remains unclear.</p>
