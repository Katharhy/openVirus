<p>For equation (9), I can see that the authors intend to scale the constant transmission rate for unsampled individuals from \\mu_lambda^0 at CV=0 to \\gamma as CV\\leftarrow\\infty. I cannot reconcile this with the statement at the top of this paragraph that \\lambda _{us} = \\mu_lambda^0 / \\rho. It is also important to clarify for the reader that there is no variation in transmission rates among unsampled individuals under any level of CV in this model.</p>
