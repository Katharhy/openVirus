<p>Methods, lines 261-280: The addition of this section helps clarify the core assumptions of the authors’ model. Another way to put this is that the authors assume that, in the setting of high variation in transmission rates, all “superspreader” individuals have been sampled and diagnosed. The authors need to reconcile this assumption with another central assumption of their model, that the sampling and diagnosis of cases from the epidemic is occurring at an early exponential phase of the epidemic. (This would involve a tremendous sampling effort because most individuals will be uninfected when sampled.)</p>
