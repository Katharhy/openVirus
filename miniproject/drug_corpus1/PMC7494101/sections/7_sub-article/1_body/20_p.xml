<p>Regarding the authors' assertion that "When A was unsampled while B and C were sampled, the coalescent event of B and C in the sampled tree (with tips B and C) is coincide with that of A and B in the full tree (with tips A~C)." -- I think this requires a strong assumption about the coalescence of lineages within hosts. While I agree that lineages are more likely to be traced back to a "superspreader" host, there is no guarantee that the coalescent events involving different sampled hosts will coincide (especially if the transmission bottleneck is incomplete). This is a minor point, however.</p>
