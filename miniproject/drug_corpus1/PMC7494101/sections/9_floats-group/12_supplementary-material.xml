  <title>Inference of heterogeneity under various lengths of mean infectious period

  <p>In each panel, the black line denotes the true value that was used to generate the simulated data. The colored curves are the means of the estimates under different levels of 
   <italic>γ</italic>
   <sup>−1</sup>. The shaded area denotes 95% confidence interval estimated when 
   <italic>γ</italic>
   <sup>−1</sup> = 2.5. These results are obtained from 100 simulation replicates where the average transmissibility rate 
   <italic>μ</italic>
   <sub>λ</sub> was fixed as 1, the sequencing ratio 
   <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.9, and the simulation stopped when there were 100 diagnosed individuals. The panel A is coefficient of variation (
   <italic>CV</italic>
   <sub>λ</sub>) and the panel B is standard deviation of infectivity rate (
   <italic>σ</italic>
   <sub>λ</sub>).
