  <title>Comparison of parameter estimation under constant/time-varying transmissibility.</title>
  <p>The lines with circles “○” are the estimate under the situation of constant transmissibility, and the shaded area denote the 95% confidence interval from 100 simulations. The lines with triangles “▽” are the estimates under the situation with time-varying transmissibility (TVT). The comparison is performed under the situation of 
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sub>0</sub> = 2.5 and the heterogeneity (
   <italic>CV</italic>
   <sub>λ</sub>) varies from 0 to 5. Sample size n = 100 and simulation runs = 100.
