  <title>Average branch length of the simulated tree under different conditions.</title>
  <p>Average branch length of the simulated tree under varied basic reproduction number (x-axis) and varied levels of heterogeneity (y-axis). Under each condition, the simulation started from one infection and stopped when there were 100 recovered individuals. The average branch length was calculated as the total branch length of the reconstructed tree over the number of tips. The results were the average over 1000 simulations.</p>
