  <title>Comparison of power of detecting heterogeneity under different sample sizes.</title>
  <p>Here #(
   <italic>D</italic>) denotes the number of diagnosed individuals. A. The sequencing ratio is fixed as 1, while the simulation stopped when there were different number of diagnosed individuals. B. The simulation was stopped when there were 100 diagnosed individuals (#(
   <italic>D</italic>) = 100), while the sequencing ratio increases from 
   <italic>œÅ</italic>
   <sub>
    <italic>SD</italic>
   </sub> = 0.2 to 1, corresponding to a sample size going from 20 to 100 (colored curves). The power is estimated based on 200 simulations.
