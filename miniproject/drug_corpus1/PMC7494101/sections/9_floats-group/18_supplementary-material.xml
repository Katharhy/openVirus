  <title>Computing times required for inferring heterogeneity from trees with varying numbers of tips.</title>
  <p>Computing times (y-axis) required for processing trees with varying numbers of tips (each tip represents a diagnosed individual). For each number of tips (x-axis), we simulated trees with different levels of heterogeneity (i.e., 
   <italic>CV</italic>
   <sub>λ</sub> = 1, 2, ⋯, 5). Each point represents the average computing time based on 10 simulations with given heterogeneity level and the size of tree. The number of tips was varied along the following sequence: 100, 200, 400, 1000, 2000, 4000. The dashed line represents the average computing time over all levels of heterogeneity. All runs were executed on an Intel Core i7 processor (Mac mini 2018).
