 <p>Detecting and preventing pathogen outbreaks in the background of steady and slow spread is difficult, yet highly desirable, because such transmission heterogeneity can be a main driver of an epidemic. Hence, detection of transmission heterogeneity may direct prevention efforts and reduce future infections. While incidence and prevalence estimates may give overall indications of an epidemic’s progression, they typically cannot indicate episodic outbreaks or rapid spreads in subpopulations. Likewise, detailed and reliable information about dynamic social networks is rare and not generalizable to detect local outbreaks. HIV sequence data can be used to reconstruct HIV phylogenies, which due to HIV’s high evolutionary rate contain information about both transmission networks and rates of spread. Here, we use HIV phylogenies to first design a general heterogeneity detection method that can signal that there is high-level spreading present. Secondly, we develop a phylogenetic method to pinpoint which individuals that may have been infected by a super-spreader or have been involved in an outbreak. We show that using such phylogeny-guided information to prevent future HIV spread is highly efficient under many epidemiological situations, especially in typical public health situations where samples are collected through time.</p>
