<p>In this study, we propose a heterogeneous birth-death model to describe the variation of the individual-level transmissibility, with birth rates corresponding to transmissibility (or transmission rates) and death rates to diagnosis rates (or removal rates). We model the transmission heterogeneity by letting each individual draw an independent random transmission rate from a continuous distribution, so the transmission heterogeneity is captured in a parameter quantifying the amount of variation in this distribution. Transmission heterogeneity may exist due to varying degrees of social activity as wells varying transmission risk upon contact, e.g., due to varying viral load in different disease stages. We then develop a general inference procedure to estimate model parameters and to test whether or not there is significant transmission heterogeneity, and thereafter we develop a method that identifies evolutionary lineages that likely have been involved in many transmission events of the epidemic. We use the second method to direct targeted prevention efforts, by means of (additional) contact tracing, towards individuals that have been involved in elevated spread as compared to random intervention. To address the realistic situation where not all persons have been sampled in an epidemic, we investigate the effects of sampling fractions, situations where samples are taken cross-sectionally and when samples are gathered in an ongoing surveillance system. We investigate the effects of within-host diversity in simulations on both the general heterogeneity test as well as the targeted prevention. We also test our estimate of transmission heterogeneity in facing of realistic complexities such as autocorrelation in transmission rates and varying transmission rate through time. We apply the heterogeneity model and estimate parameters on 3 real datasets sampled from different HIV-1 epidemics.</p>
