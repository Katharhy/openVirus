<p>In addition, because both incidence and pathogen phylogenies carry information about the epidemic, several efforts have been made to combine these data into comprehensive heterogeneity inference [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1008122.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] recently showed that quantification of transmission heterogeneity was more accurately estimated using the pathogen phylogeny alone rather than in combination with incidence data. They describe the transmission heterogeneity as the variation among the offspring distributions, i.e., the number of secondary cases caused by each infected individual. The offspring distribution, however, is not only affected by the individual-level transmissibility but also by the length of the infectious period of each infected individual.
