<p>While epidemiological methods using incidence data can pick up the signal of increased number of cases, which may indicate an outbreak or be the result of increased surveillance, they can not identify individual-level transmission heterogeneity. To assess transmission heterogeneity on the individual-level transmissibility, contact tracing based on interviews, reviews of clinical records, and partner follow-up have traditionally been used. Such follow-up may be slow, expensive and inaccurate, however. Several studies have reported that interview-based information about sexual contacts where HIV-1 transmission might have taken place often was not in agreement with the phylogenetic history of the transmitted virus [
