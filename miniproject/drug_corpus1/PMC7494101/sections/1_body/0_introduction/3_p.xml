<p>The Multi-state birth-death (MSBD) models have been used to model population structure and infer the related transmission heterogeneity [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1008122.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The rationale of these models is to associate each cluster (or subpopulation) to a state in the MSBD model, with clusters differing in their transmission dynamics through time. An important limitation of the MSBD models is either requiring the correspondence between the tips and the states is known in advance [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1008122.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] or using fixed positions of state changes [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1008122.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. An efficient method of model-based genetic clustering has recently been proposed in [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1008122.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which is based on fitting a Markov-modulated Poisson process representing the evolution of transmission rates along the tree relating different infections. Though it performs well in clustering lineages of different risky groups, the method is not designed to infer basic reproduction number which is also of certain interest in epidemiloigcal practice.
