<p>Allocation of prevention resources to where they are needed most is important for effective disease control. Thus, identifying where disease spread has its highest intensity would allow for efficient resource allocation. The intensity of the spread is typically uneven in time and space, causing episodic and local outbreaks. One type of spread-heterogeneity comes from the situation when some individuals spread at a much higher rate than others, causing superspreading [
