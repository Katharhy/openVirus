<p>The power to detect transmission heterogeneity depends on the sample size and true level of transmission heterogeneity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1008122.g006">Fig 6</xref>). We investigated two different sampling size effects; 1) the sequencing ratio at the time of stopping simulation (when 100 persons have been diagnosed), and 2) with a fixed sequencing ratio

 </sub> at a time when a certain number of persons have been diagnosed (from 20 to 100 persons). The effects on detection power of these two sampling scenarios were similar. For a given sample size (i.e. a particular colored line in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1008122.g006">Fig 6</xref>), the power naturally increased with the level of heterogeneity. From a public health action point of view, this is again encouraging as higher heterogeneity levels suggest that intervention may be more beneficial, which we address further below. Naturally, the power also increased with larger sample size (#(
