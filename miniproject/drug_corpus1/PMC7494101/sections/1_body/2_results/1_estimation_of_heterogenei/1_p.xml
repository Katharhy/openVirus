<p>The epidemic parameters describing the recovery rate (
 <italic>γ</italic>), average infectivity rate (
 <italic>μ</italic>
 <sub>λ</sub>), and the transmission heterogeneity (
 <italic>σ</italic>
 <sub>λ</sub> and 
 <italic>CV</italic>
 <sub>λ</sub> = 
 <italic>σ</italic>
 <sub>λ</sub>/
 <italic>μ</italic>
 <sub>λ</sub>) were estimated from our heterogeneous birth-death model and the described inference methodology (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1008122.g003">Fig 3A, 3B, 3D and 3E</xref>). While there was a slight bias trend over 
 <italic>CV</italic>
 <sub>λ</sub> = 
 <italic>σ</italic>
 <sub>λ</sub>/
 <italic>μ</italic>
 <sub>λ</sub>, the bias was well within the corresponding 95% confidence interval in each case. Hence, under a wide range of epidemic situations with different levels of heterogeneity (
 <italic>CV</italic>
 <sub>λ</sub>) the means of the epidemic parameter estimates were close to the corresponding true values. The inference of the basic reproduction number (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>), showed slight upward biases under low level of heterogeneity and slight downward biases under high level of heterogeneity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1008122.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). However, these biases were also covered by the 95% confidence intervals.
