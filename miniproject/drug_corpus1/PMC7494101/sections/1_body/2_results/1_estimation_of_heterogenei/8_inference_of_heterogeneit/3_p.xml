<p>Relevant to the estimate of

 <sub>λ</sub> (i.e. heterogeneity of individual-level transmissibility) which was shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1008122.s004">S4B Fig</xref>, we found that adding transmission-risk heterogeneity due to disease progression leads to a small overestimation when the true level of 
 <italic>CV</italic>
 <sub>λ</sub> was low (
 <italic>CV</italic>
 <sub>λ</sub> &lt; 1.5) and a slight underestimation when 
 <italic>CV</italic>
 <sub>λ</sub> &gt; 1.5. These effects, however, were not significant as they were covered by the 95% confidence interval. In addition, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1008122.s004">S4A Fig</xref>, adding heterogeneity through time tended to underestimate 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, and the bias became significant under lower level of heterogeneity (
 <italic>CV</italic>
 <sub>λ</sub> &lt; 1.0). This makes sense because adding heterogeneity through time reduced the average transmission rate over the whole infectious period for each individual, and hence resulted in a drop of the estimate of basic reproduction number.
