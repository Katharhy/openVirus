<p>In the above simulations, a constant transmissibility rate for each infected individual was assumed. However, it is well known that for HIV, infected individuals initially have a short high-transmission-risk phase (the acute infection phase when viral load is very high), followed by a much longer low-transmission-risk phase (the chronic phase during which viral load is relatively low), which, in the absence of treatment, is followed by another high-transmission-risk phase (progression to AIDS) [
