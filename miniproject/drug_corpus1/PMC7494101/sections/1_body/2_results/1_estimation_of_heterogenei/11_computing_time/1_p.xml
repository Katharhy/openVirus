<p>There is a growing demand of analyzing large sequence databases where transmission heterogeneity may exists and be desirable to detect [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1008122.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Hence, we evaluated the computing time required to process trees with the number of tips (individuals) varied from 100 to 4,000. These results are summarized in supplementary 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1008122.s008">S8 Fig</xref>. Our result indicated that the average computing time (over heterogeneity level

 <sub>λ</sub> varying from 1 to 5) scales linearly with the size of the tree. For instance, it required about 54.8 minutes (averaging over heterogeneity levels from 1 to 5) to process a tree with 4,000 tips. We also observed that the computing time for a tree with low level of heterogeneity (i.e. 
 <italic>CV</italic>
 <sub>λ</sub> = 1) is much longer than that of analyzing a tree with high level of heterogeneity (i.e. 
 <italic>CV</italic>
 <sub>λ</sub> ≥ 3). And the difference between these two computing times increases with the size of the tree. This is due to the fact that the proposed algorithm needs to reconstruct the transmission history while estimating the model parameters. This reconstruction is easier to proceed under the situation with high level of heterogeneity where few super-spreaders contribute to most of the transmission events. Hence, we expect that more computing time is needed to process a tree with heterogeneity smaller than 1 (
 <italic>CV</italic>
 <sub>λ</sub> &lt; 1).
