<p>To investigate if the susceptible population size and biased

 </sub> both upwards and downwards. As before we began with one infection and stopped when there were 100 diagnosed individuals. When the simulations were stopped, the average number of infected but not yet diagnosed was 120, that is, the average prevalence was 220/1000 = 22% which is a relatively higher level in reality [
