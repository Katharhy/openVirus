<p>The above results show good performance of the proposed inference method under the heterogeneous birth-death model assuming that there is no depletion of susceptibles (corresponding to an infinite population) and that the sequencing ratio

 <sub>
  <italic>SD</italic>
 </sub> was known (but the sampling ratio is unknown). In real applications, however, these two assumptions do not hold. While the size of the susceptible population at risk is very difficult to know in real epidemics, it is never infinite. The sequencing ratio

 <sub>
  <italic>SD</italic>
 </sub> is often known to some extent, but there can be uncertainty in the number of diagnosed but not sequenced, leading to uncertainty in

 </sub>.
