<p>We adopted the simulation scenario in [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1008122.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] to divide the whole susceptible population into two subpopulations with different transmission rates (λ
 <sub>1</sub> and λ
 <sub>2</sub> respectively) and simulated the outbreak in two ways, that is, with and without autocorrelation of transmission rates. In the former case, each newly infected individual has the same transmission rate as its infectee with the probability 1 − 
 <italic>π</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>s</italic>
 </sub> and switch to another transmission rate with the probability 
 <italic>π</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>s</italic>
 </sub>. Here we set the transmission rates as λ
 <sub>1</sub> = 0.9 and λ
 <sub>2</sub> = 8.1 (9-fold faster than the other as in [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1008122.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]). The switching probability is 
 <italic>π</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>s</italic>
 </sub> = 0.2 or 
 <italic>π</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>s</italic>
 </sub> = 0.8, corresponding to high level of autocorrelation with low heterogeneity (
 <italic>CV</italic>
 <sub>λ</sub> = 0.46) and low level of autocorrelation with high heterogeneity (
 <italic>CV</italic>
 <sub>λ</sub> = 1.05) respectively. The evaluation under each condition is performed based on 100 simulated replicates.
