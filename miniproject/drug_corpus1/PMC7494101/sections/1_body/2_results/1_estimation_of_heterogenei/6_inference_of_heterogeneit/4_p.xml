<p>Under the situation of no autocorrelation of transmission rates, it is clear that the new method generates more accurate estimates of the mean (

 <sub>λ</sub> are 2.32 and 0.7 from our new method and are 4.65 and 0.74 from the MMPP respectively. For the high heterogeneity condition with true values of

 <sub>λ</sub> = 1.75 (
