<p>Our new method was developed under the assumption that each infected individual has an independent transmission rate. In reality, however, risk factors of transmissibility such as behavior often exhibit a high degree of homophily, such that the transmission rate of a newly infected individual may be similar to that of the donor. We therefore evaluated our method when transmission rates are autocorrelated and made a comparison with the previously developed Markov-Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP) method [
