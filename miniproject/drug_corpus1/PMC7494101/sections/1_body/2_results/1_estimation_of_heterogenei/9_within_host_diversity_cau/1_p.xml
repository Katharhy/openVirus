<p>Because HIV, and many other rapidly evolving pathogens, accumulate significant levels of within-host diversity, pathogen phylogenies may differ from the transmission history [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1008122.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Using a coalescent-based framework that allows for within-host pathogen diversification over time [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1008122.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1008122.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1008122.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], we investigated the effect of different diversification rates on the ability to detect transmission heterogeneity (please see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1008122.s010">S1 Text</xref> for details of simulation). We found that within-host diversity leads to underestimation of the level of transmission heterogeneity (

Within-host diversity adds an additional source of phylogenetic variation, and this variation partially overshadows the heterogeneity resulting from differences in transmission contacts. Nevertheless, even with within-host diversity, the trend of the inferred heterogeneity is monotonically increasing as the true level of heterogeneity increases, leading to a positive response of the inferred level of heterogeneity. Hence, when a pathogen generates significant levels of within-host diversity, we still detect increased levels of transmission heterogeneity if it occurs, but the true level of transmission heterogeneity may become underestimated.
