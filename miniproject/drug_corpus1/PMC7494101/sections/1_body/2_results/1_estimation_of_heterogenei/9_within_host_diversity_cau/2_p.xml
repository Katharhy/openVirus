 <italic>r</italic> = 1) did the overestimation become significantly higher than under no diversification. As within-host diversity pushes the phylogenetic node heights backwards in time, known as the pre-transmission interval [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1008122.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], the mean infectious period (
 <italic>γ</italic>

 <sub>0</sub> = 
 <italic>μ</italic>
 <sub>λ</sub>/
