<p>We investigate HIV-1 DNA sequences from three local epidemics in Sweden ranging from fast explosive outbreak to more slow spread over longer time periods (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1008122.g007">Fig 7</xref>). The three corresponding genealogies were selected from a recent publication on HIV-1 spread in Sweden and neighboring Scandinavian countries [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1008122.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], but the datasets used here contain only Swedish sequences. The first genealogy, denoted IDU_AE, represents a rapid outbreak of CRF01_AE (circulating recombinant form number 1 of subtype A and E viruses) infections among intravenous drug users (IDUs) in Stockholm in 2006 and 2007 [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1008122.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The genealogy contains 83 taxa which were sampled from 2003 to 2010. The second genealogy, denoted IDU_B, represents slower local spread of subtype B infections among IDUs in Stockholm with sampling dates ranging from 2003 to 2010 [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1008122.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This genealogy contains 51 taxa which were sampled from 2002 to 2009. The last genealogy, denoted MSM_B, represents longstanding local spread of subtype B virus among men who have sex with men (MSM) with sampling dates ranging from 1994 to 2010. This genealogy contains 18 taxa which were sampled from 1994 to 2010. All genealogies were monophyletic relative to other sequences in the Swedish-Scandinavian study and BLASTâ€™ed international sequences [
