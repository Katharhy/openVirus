<p>For each data set, we analyzed a random sample of 10000 genealogies from the posterior distribution (generated using BEAST [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1008122.g007">Fig 7</xref> summarizes the results of the parameter estimates. Overall, the IDU_B data showed the lowest diagnosis rate (

 <sub>0</sub> did not seem directly linked to transmission heterogeneity, however. Similarly, Sackin’s index, which measures tree balance (high values indicate unbalanced trees where one side of a split carries more taxa than the other side), did not find any significant differences between the data that contained an outbreak (IDU_AE) and the data from more even spread (IDU_B). Instead, as one might have expected,

 </inline-formula> correlates with the speed of the different outbreaks, i.e. the highest heterogeneity was inferred in the data that contained the fast outbreak, which occurred in the IDU_AE epidemic, and the lowest heterogeneity was inferred in the slowest spreading epidemic (MSM_B). These observations agree with previous analyses of these local epidemics, where it was reported that there was a rapid outbreak, during a limited time period, among IDU infected with CRF01_AE in Sweden following a similar outbreak in Finland [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1008122.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This suggests that it took some time for HIV-1 CRF01_AE to reach one or several individuals with high contact numbers after it had entered the Swedish IDU community. Once the individuals with high contact rates were reached, a rapid outbreak followed, infecting many susceptibles. Finally, as shown in [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1008122.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], the outbreak subsequently slowed down to pre-outbreak levels, presumably because the recipients of the high-contact persons had been exhausted. Lower levels of transmission heterogeneity was observed in the slower spread that took place in the IDU_B community [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1008122.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], suggesting that the contact patterns in this community were more even among members.
