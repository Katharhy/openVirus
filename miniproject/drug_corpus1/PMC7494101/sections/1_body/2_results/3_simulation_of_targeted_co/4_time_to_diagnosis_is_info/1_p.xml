<p>When cross-sectional samples have been collected, phylogeny-guided prevention has no advantage over a random prevention strategy (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1008122.g011">Fig 11</xref>). Thus, to take advantage of the epidemic information captured by the pathogen phylogeny, continuous monitoring provides better public health prevention capacity. If only a cross-sectional sample is available, however, we find that targeting the most recently diagnosed individuals (
 <italic>MRD</italic>) for additional contact tracing performs better in preventing future spread than a random selection of the same number of individuals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1008122.g011">Fig 11</xref>) or by selecting individuals to contact trace based on the 
 <italic>NCE</italic>-value. At prevention fractions 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.2 and 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.5 (20% and 50% being contact traced, respectively), the relative effect of the 
 <italic>MRD</italic>-strategy was constantly larger than random selection (of which the relative effect was set to 1) as well as that of the 
 <italic>NCE</italic>-based strategy.
