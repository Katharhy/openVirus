<p>For pathogens that accumulate within-host diversity, such as HIV-1, we also evaluated the phylogeny-guided prevention strategy when significant within-host diversity accumulates. The effect of a 
 <italic>NCE</italic>-strategy was, in fact, higher in the presence of within-host diversity (
 <italic>r</italic> = 1) than when no within-host diversity accumulated (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1008122.g009">Fig 9</xref>). This happens because large 
 <italic>NCE</italic> values are associated with short branches, and the effect of within host diversity is to make short branches only slightly longer whereas longer branches are increased more due to within host diversity. As a consequence, within-host diversity has the effect of accentuating the difference between short and long branches thus leading to a better distinction between subtrees with a relatively large number of coalescent events (large 
 <italic>NCE</italic>) compared to subtrees with lower number of coalescent events.
