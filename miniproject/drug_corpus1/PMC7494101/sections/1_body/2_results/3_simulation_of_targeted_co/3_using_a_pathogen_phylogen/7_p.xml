<p>As somewhat surprizing observation was that the fraction of contact traced under iterative contact tracing was actually found to besmaller than under the single-step contact tracing (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1008122.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). For each selected individual to contact trace there will of course be more (or at least not fewer) to contact trace under iterative contact tracing. However, iterative contact tracing has an even bigger negative effect on the spreading, such that the overall fraction (or number) being contact traced in the iterative setting is smaller than when applying single-step contact tracing.
