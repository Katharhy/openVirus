<p>When no transmission heterogeneity is present (
 <italic>CV</italic>
 <sub>λ</sub> = 0), targeting individuals with higher than average 
 <italic>NCE</italic> for contact tracing has no effect on the resulting epidemic size (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1008122.g008">Fig 8A</xref>), i.e. randomly selecting the same number of persons for contact tracing has the same effect as a phylogenetically informed strategy (the dashed and solid lines are on top of each other in this case). The reason why preventing (i.e. contact tracing) persons with 
 <italic>NCE</italic> ⩾ 1 has higher effect than 
 <italic>NCE</italic> ⩾ 2 is simply because 
 <italic>NCE</italic> ⩾ 1 involves a larger number of persons that are contact traced, shown in the sidebar ‘Fraction of contact traced’. The ‘no prevention’ line shows the epidemic growth when no prevention (i.e. no additional contact tracing) was administered and is thus the maximum size of the simulated epidemic at any time point. Reduction from this level indicates the prevention effect.
