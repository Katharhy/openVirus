<p>Within-host diversity also has the effect of reducing the fraction of contact traced for given threshold

 <italic>NCE</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1008122.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Because within-host diversity pushes the phylogenetic node heights backwards in time, known as the pre-transmission interval [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1008122.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], there will be fewer nodes at any given time-distance into the tree from the tips. Within-host diversity therefore reduces the 
 <italic>NCE</italic>-count on all lineages, leading to a reduction in the fraction of contact traced. Hence, one may adjust the depth
