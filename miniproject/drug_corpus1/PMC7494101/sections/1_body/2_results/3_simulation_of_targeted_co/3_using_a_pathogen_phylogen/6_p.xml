<p>Finally, we evaluated the phylogeny-guided prevention under two different models of contact tracing: single-step tracing (where only direct recent contacts of the diagnosed are tested and prevented from further spread) or iterative tracing (where new cases from the single-step tracing are also contact traced, and so on) [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1008122.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The relative effect of phylogeny-guided iterative contact tracing was more effective than single-step contact tracing at higher levels of the 
 <italic>NCE</italic>-threshold (
 <italic>m</italic> = 2 and 3) in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1008122.g010">Fig 10</xref>. Contrary, at 
 <italic>NCE</italic> ⩾ 1, single-step contact tracing did better at lower levels of transmission heterogeneity. Hence, iterative contact tracing is more advantageous when medium to high levels of transmission heterogeneity exist, where higher 
 <italic>NCE</italic>-thresholds can pick up transmission chains where a super-spreader exists. At very high heterogeneity levels (
 <italic>CV</italic>
 <sub>λ</sub> ⩾ 3), the iterative contact tracing advantage gradually diminishes because the probability to find the super-spreaders increases after just a single-step contact tracing.
