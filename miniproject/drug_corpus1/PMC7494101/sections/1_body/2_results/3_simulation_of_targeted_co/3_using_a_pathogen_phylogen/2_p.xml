<p>When transmission heterogeneity was present (i.e. 
 <italic>CV</italic>
 <sub>λ</sub> &gt; 0), the relative epidemic size under a phylogeny-guided prevention (based on 
 <italic>NCE</italic>) was always smaller than that of random prevention at the same proportion of persons (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1008122.g008">Fig 8B–8D</xref>). At very high level of heterogeneity 
 <italic>CV</italic>
 <sub>λ</sub> = 3, phylogeny-guided prevention typically reduced the epidemic by an additional 10% over random prevention at 2.5 years out, and approximately an additional 10% for each 
 <italic>NCE</italic> step. Moreover, the advantage of a 
 <italic>NCE</italic> ⩾ 
 <italic>m</italic> strategy over the corresponding random prevention strategy increased with the level of heterogeneity. For instance, if extremely high heterogeneity occurred (
 <italic>CV</italic>
 <sub>λ</sub> = 5), by preventing spread at 
 <italic>NCE</italic> ⩾ 4 one would only need to contact trace 20% of the population to get about 75% reduction in total number of infections 2.5 years later. This means that a phylogenetically informed prevention strategy (using the 
 <italic>NCE</italic> concept) becomes more valuable the more heterogeneous transmission rates are.
