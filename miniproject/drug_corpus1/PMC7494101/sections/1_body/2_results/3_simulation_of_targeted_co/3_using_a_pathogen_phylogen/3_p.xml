<p>From a public health point of view, where resources always are limited, using the pathogen phylogeny to allocate resources becomes more efficient the more heterogeneity that exists in the epidemic, and the 
 <italic>NCE</italic> guided prevention can pinpoint where contact tracing and prevention would make the largest impact in reducing future infections. This becomes clear when comparing the fraction of contact traced and the relative effect of 
 <italic>NCE</italic>-guided prevention in the different 
 <italic>CV</italic>
 <sub>λ</sub> and 
 <italic>NCE</italic> cases, i.e. the fraction of contact traced in the 
 <italic>NCE</italic> ⩾ 
 <italic>m</italic> strategies decreased as the threshold value 
 <italic>m</italic> increased while the relative effect over random prevention in the 
 <italic>NCE</italic> ⩾ 
 <italic>m</italic> strategies increased as the threshold value 
 <italic>m</italic> increased (see the supplementary 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1008122.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Therefore, under low levels of heterogeneity (estimated using our general heterogeneity detection method), one may choose a small threshold 
 <italic>m</italic> to gain more effect on reducing the epidemic size, while under high levels of heterogeneity, one may instead choose a high threshold 
 <italic>m</italic>, involving less resources, to invoke efficient control.
