<p>We define ‘continuous monitoring’ as the typical public health situation where samples (sequences of diagnosed cases) are continuously collected throughout an epidemic and where for each collected sample it is decided to perform (additional) contact tracing or not. The second situation is denoted ‘cross-sectional sampling’ which is the situation where all samples are collected (or re-analyzed) at some common time 
 <italic>t</italic>, for instance when the epidemiological status is investigated in an otherwise unmonitored population or when additional preventive measures are decided upon or in retrospective contact tracing.
