<p>When applying our method for detecting possible spread heterogeneity to three separate sub-epidemics from the larger Swedish HIV-1 epidemic it was found that the highest heterogeneity was inferred from the data that included the episodic IDU_AE outbreak. Interestingly, this outbreak did not show significant differences from the other sub-epidemics when analyzing Sackin’s index or
