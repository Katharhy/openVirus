<p>In this study we have shown that when transmission heterogeneity exists, a phylogeny-guided prevention strategy is more efficient than randomly selecting cases for contact tracing in order to reduce the number of future infections. We first developed a general method to identify the level of transmission heterogeneity in a population, i.e. how much variation in the rate of transmission contacts that exist in a human population where a pathogen spreads. We then developed a phylogenetic measure, the 
 <italic>NCE</italic>—the Number of Coalescent Events over a fixed time-interval ending at time of diagnosis—to identify which infected individuals to target for (additional) contact tracing. It was shown that, under the typical situation where pathogen samples are continuously collected (continuous monitoring), a phylogeny-guided prevention approach was clearly superior in effectively allocating public health resources to reduce future disease spread.
