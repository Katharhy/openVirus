<p>Our model treats heterogeneity as a single feature, while in real life there are several factors that may contribute to heterogeneous spread rates. It is possible that modeling one or several of these factors separately may be valuable. One such factor relates to social network structure, modeling heterogeneities in terms of contacts. Secondly, the current model assumes that the transmissibility of different individuals are independent. A (more complicated) alternative could be to assume that transmissibility of infectors and their cases are positively correlated, which would imply assortativity in sexual activity between sex-partners. Finally, individuals may also differ in terms of testing (i.e. diagnosis) rates; in our model all individuals were assumed to have equal rates of testing. For example, among MSM, individuals with risky behavior (high contact rates) may also test themselves more often. This simplifying assumption may lead to a systematic loss of sensitivity as sampling may not be complete and be biased towards some group of infected persons. Again, the heterogeneity in our model may be interpreted as a combination of all these and other aspects.</p>
