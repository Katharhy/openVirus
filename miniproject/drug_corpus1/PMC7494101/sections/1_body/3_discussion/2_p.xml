<p>We show that our heterogeneity detection method and phylogeny-guided approach work under a variety of realistic conditions. The estimates of heterogeneity and basic reproduction number are robust to assumptions about the susceptible population size and exact sampling fraction (the fraction of diagnosed individuals that are sequenced), both of which may be difficult to know exactly in a real epidemic. Also when changing the recovery rate of the infected individual, allowing autocorrelation in transmission rates, or adding heterogeneity through time to individual-level transmissibility, the estimate of heterogeneity is still less affected. Of particular importance is that our method also works when a pathogen accumulates genetic variation within each host. Such within-host diversity is significant in e.g. HIV infections. If not taken into account, tree measurements may significantly mislead epidemiological estimates by implicitly assuming identity between transmission history and pathogen phylogeny. It is well established that the between-host pathogen phylogeny will display nodes corresponding to the transmitted lineages biased backwards in time, as described by the pre-transmission interval [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1008122.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. While previously often ignored, the within-host diversity has recently been shown to have significant impact on inferences about pathogen epidemics, sometimes rendering results completely as compared to when within-host diversity was ignored [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1008122.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Here, we show that taking within-host diversity into account may, in fact, improve the prevention effect (
