<p>In conclusion, with the increase of pathogen genetic data in public health databases, phylogeny-guided prevention will benefit public health efforts. As relevant epidemic information about differences in number of contacts is effectively “recorded” in a phylogeny by the evolutionary process of the pathogen, it only makes sense to use this information to the public health benefit. Hence, phylogeny-guided prevention results in more efficient epidemic control, which should reduce disease burden and costs to society.</p>
