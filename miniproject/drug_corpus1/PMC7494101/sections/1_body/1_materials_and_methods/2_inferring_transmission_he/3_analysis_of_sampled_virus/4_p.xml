<p>Last, we study the correction of the raw estimates by considering the unsampled individuals. This correction is performed on the basis of data imputation. For the sampled individuals, their estimated transmissibility rates shall be upscaled based on the sampling ratio by allowing for partial sampling. For the unsampled individuals, we assume that they have the same infectious period and the same transmissibility rate because of no further information about their difference. The corrected values for the sampled individuals together with the substituted values for the unsampled individuals are combined to yield the corrected estimation of model parameters as follows (Please see
