 </inline-formula>, we calculate the 
 <italic>NCE</italic> within a fixed time-period 
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub> prior to the time of sampling of the individual. The taxa (diagnosed individuals) with higher 
 <italic>NCE</italic>-values are more likely to be phylogenetically linked with unsampled highly infectious individuals. Thus, performing contact tracing on the individuals with high 
 <italic>NCE</italic>-values should identify undiagnosed and highly infectious individuals and/or their undiagnosed descendants, and therefore efficiently reduce further disease spread. We refer to contact tracing based on 
 <italic>NCE</italic>-value as phylogeny-guided contact tracing. We evaluate different threshold values 
 <italic>m</italic>, i.e. where individuals who have 
 <italic>NCE</italic> â©¾ 
 <italic>m</italic> within 
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub> prior to being sampled are selected for contact tracing. We also evaluate both single-step and iterative contact tracing schemes [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1008122.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] to show the full beneficial effects of phylogeny-guided contact tracing policies.
