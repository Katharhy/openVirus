<p>An important application for heterogeneity detection is to optimize the epidemic control policy when transmission heterogeneity exists. As pointed out in [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1008122.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], focusing on the highly infectious individuals will greatly increase the efficiency of disease control policy. To facilitate such an application, we propose a phylogenetic indexâ€”the Number of Coalescent Events (NCE) which helps to identify potentially highly infectious individuals. We investigate the effectiveness of using this index with the intention of controlling the spread of disease in our heterogeneous birth-death model.
