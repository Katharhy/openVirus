<p>In our model, a transmission history is generated with our heterogeneous birth-death transmission model under a given set of parameters (Θ = (

If within-host diversity is taken into account (while still assuming only one strain is transferred at transmission), then the coalescence times of the sampled virus sequences may coalesce further back in time than the time of infection, with the effect that branch lengths and even tree topologies may differ from the underlying transmission tree [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1008122.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The estimation method in this study was first developed under the former situation (i.e. without within-host diversity), and was extended to the latter case in the simulation.
