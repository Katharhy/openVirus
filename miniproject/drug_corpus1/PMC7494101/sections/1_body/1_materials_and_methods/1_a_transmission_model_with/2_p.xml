<p>Specifically, in our model each infected individual 
 <italic>i</italic> gets assigned a transmissibility rate λ
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> by randomly drawing the rate from a 
 <italic>Gamma</italic> distribution with mean 
 <italic>μ</italic>
 <sub>λ</sub> and standard deviation 
 <italic>σ</italic>
 <sub>λ</sub>. The gamma distribution is a common choice when modeling individual heterogeneity for a parameter. While infectious, this individual infects new individuals randomly in time, with rate λ
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> per unit of time. Also we assume that the transmission rates of the infector and the infectee in a transmission event are independent. Later we will evaluate our model under the condition with autocorrelation of transmission rates.
