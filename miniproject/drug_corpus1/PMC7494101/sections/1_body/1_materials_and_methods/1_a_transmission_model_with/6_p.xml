<p>Our transmission model is an extension of the homogeneous birth-death model in [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1008122.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] explicitly take the finite population into account by considering depletion of susceptible. Here, we neglect this depletion but investigate this simplification in the sensitivity analysis. Recently, Li et al [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1008122.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] studied a related model where heterogeneity in the number of infections was described in a generation sense; while they assumed that all infections happen at the end of the infectious period, in our model infectious individuals infect new individuals at rate Î»
