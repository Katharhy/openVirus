<p>Infected individuals remain infectious until they are diagnosed—it is then assumed that individuals are immediately treated such that they no longer are infectious and instead immune [

 <italic>γ</italic> common for all individuals (hence random and with no systematic heterogeneity). The diagnosed individuals are sampled for virus sequencing with probability

  <italic>SD</italic>
 </sub> (referred to as the 
 <italic>sequencing ratio</italic>). Consequently, there are three categories of infected people: a) the undiagnosed (who continue to spread the disease), b) the diagnosed/treated who have not been sampled for sequencing, and c) the sequenced diagnosed/treated individuals. The ratio of the sequenced diagnosed over all the infected (i.e. c/(a + b + c)) is referred to as the 
 <italic>sampling ratio</italic> in this study. In contrast with the sequencing ratio (i.e. c/(b + c)) which is usually assumed to be known in advance, the sampling ratio is unknown in the analysis of virus sequence data.
