<p>In order to estimate transmission heterogeneity in a population and, further, the effect of targeted prevention on individuals associated with high transmissibility, we develop a new transmission model, referred to as the heterogeneous birth-death (HBD) model, in which individuals in a community may have different rates of infecting new individuals. The difference in transmissibility could be caused by variable virus load leading to variable infection probability upon contact, and/or variable social contact rate. Here, we refer to any combination of these concepts as transmissibility.</p>
