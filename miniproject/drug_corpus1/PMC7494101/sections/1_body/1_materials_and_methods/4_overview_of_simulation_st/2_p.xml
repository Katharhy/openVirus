<p>Unless otherwise stated, each simulation began with one infection and was stopped when there were 100 diagnosed individuals (the average number of infected but not yet diagnosed were 130). Among these 100 diagnosed individuals, 90 diagnosed individuals were sampled for sequencing to reconstruct the viral genealogy, that is, the sequencing ratio was set to

 </sub> = 0.9. In all, the average sampling ratio in our simulations was 90/230 ≈ 0.39. We assume that there was no delay between the time of diagnosis and sampling. Please see
