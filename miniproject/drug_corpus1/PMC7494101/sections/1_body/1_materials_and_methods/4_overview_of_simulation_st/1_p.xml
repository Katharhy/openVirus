<p>To validate our general transmission heterogeneity detection method, we tested the performance of the inference algorithm on simulated data. As reported the average time between infection and diagnosis/treatment for HIV-1 in Sweden is around 2.5 years [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1008122.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1008122.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1008122.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], so we set the rate of diagnosis at 
 <italic>γ</italic> = 1/2.5 with year being our unit of time. We set 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> = 2.5 (implying that 
 <italic>μ</italic>
 <sub>λ</sub> = 1) which is in agreement with the previous study on the transmission of HIV in Switzerland [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1008122.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We varied the level of transmission heterogeneity (i.e. 
 <italic>CV</italic> = 
 <italic>σ</italic>
 <sub>λ</sub>/
 <italic>μ</italic>
 <sub>λ</sub>) from 0 (no heterogeneity) to 5 (extremely high heterogeneity).
