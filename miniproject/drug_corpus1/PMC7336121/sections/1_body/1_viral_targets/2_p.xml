<p id="p0065">Monoclonal antibodies (as highly specific agents), could be used to effectively target pathogens, without disturbing the normal microbiota. Pathogen-specific antibodies that disturb the interaction between a pathogenic protein and the specific host surface receptor (or coreceptor) have shown success in both research and clinic. There are many different viral antigens that due to unique properties can be as potential targets of antibodies. 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> represents a summary of the most important viral targets studied.
