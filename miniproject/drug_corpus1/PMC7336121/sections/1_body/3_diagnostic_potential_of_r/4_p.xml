<p id="p0105">Other antibody derivatives have been considered as potential candidates for success detection of viruses. Doerflinger SY 
 <italic>et al.</italic> established a fast Nanobody-based lateral flow immunoassay (Nano-immunochromatography [Nano-IC]) for the detection of human norovirus in clinical specimens. The Nano-IC technique had 80% and 86% for sensitivity and specificity respectively for outbreak specimens. However, additional adjustments to the Nano-IC technique are needed to enhance this sensitivity, which might also be done via the addition of different widely reactive Nanobodies to the device

 <italic>et al.</italic> made a single domain fragment antibody for Ebola virus envelope glycoprotein (GP) and enhanced its solidity to extend its efficiency to use in austere locals. A llama was immunized with killed Ebola virus and GP recombinant protein and an immune phage library containing greater than 10
 <sup>7</sup> special clones was developed. They isolated three GP binders with a dissociation constants ranging between ~2 to 20 nM and melting temperatures between ~57 to 72 °C. They suggest that future efforts can elucidate the potential of these isolated single domain antibodies as candidates for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes for Ebola 
 <xref rid="b0255" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Zhu M. 
 <italic>et al.</italic> have been proposed a sandwich ELISA based on two nanobodies derived from a camel that had been immunized with inactivated semi-purified A/Texas/1/1977 H3N2 virus. These nanobodies had distinctive ability to identify the hemagglutinin of an H3N2 virus. In a sandwich ELISA, in which one of the nanobodies was used to be bound to magnetic beads and the another one was coupled with a reporter enzyme, the semi-purified H3N2 virus was detectable up to a least concentration of 50 ng/mL

 <italic>E. coli</italic> and a naive scFv library was constructed. These recombinant scFv antibodies may be a precious device for further study of GBV-C and contribute to the progress of a rapid and precise test for identification of GBV-C infection
