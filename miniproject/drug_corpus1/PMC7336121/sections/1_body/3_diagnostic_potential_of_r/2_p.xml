<p id="p0095">Monoclonal antibodies have gotten progressively acknowledged as diagnostics for different human infections because of their high affinity and specificity 
 <xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0235" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. With the using of DNA recombinant technology and the development of antibody engendering methods, numerous recombinant antibodies such as Fabs, scFvs, diabodies and single domain antibodies (sdAbs), like VHHs, Shark Variable New Antigen Receptors (V
 <sub>NARs</sub>) and variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) that include amazing organic exercises were found in camelids, cartilaginous fish and lampreys. These fragments have separately developed. They not only hold the specificity of the entire monoclonal antibodies, but also can be expressed more easily in prokaryotic expression systems 
 <xref rid="b0240" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. These useful research tools that have revolutionized medicine science are used extensively in diagnosis assays for the detection of various pathogens. They have shown good results in the diagnosis of harmful human viruses.
