<p id="p0070">Antibodies are the largest class of bio therapeutics, and five monoclonal antibodies are ranked among the top 10 blockbuster drugs. However, their therapeutical usages have faced with some barriers including their complex nature, large size, interaction with the patient immune system, and inadequate pharmacokinetics 
 <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The reduction of size to be easily selected and manipulated is the main aim in the production of antibodies. Improving antibody affinity and stability, has been gained through in vitro and in vivo mutagenesis approaches 
 <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Antibody engineering aims to produce desirable antibodies through some techniques such as site-directed mutagenesis and random mutagenesis

 <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Having simplicity, versatility, rapidness, and cheapness, the error-prone PCR, random mutagenesis methods based on the inaccurate amplification of genes, has been the most common approach for generating libraries. Random mutagenesis and selected mutant library by panning are the parts of this method. To select recombinant antibodies and antibody fragments, with different specificities and affinities from antibody libraries, phage display has been known to be of a great value
