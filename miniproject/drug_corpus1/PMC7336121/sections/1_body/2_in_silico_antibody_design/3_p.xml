<p id="p0075">Phage display is a potent molecular technique by which peptide or protein of interest is fused to bacteriophage coat proteins and displaying it to the external milieu. It is a reliable source to study protein interactions such as antibody to any antigens and selection the proteins with high affinity for specific targets. There are other display techniques such as ribosome display and mRNA display based on linkage between the gene and the displayed protein by ribosome itself and the physical linkage of a protein to a nucleic acid tag via puromycin, respectively. They all are used to the evolution of proteins to create best ligands with desired properties for binding to the targets. Moreover, as in vitro methods and the high-throughput nature, the conditions of the binding selection are tightly controlled and therefore they are the excellent technological platform to create the antibodies or antibody fragments with enhanced properties by engineering antibody
