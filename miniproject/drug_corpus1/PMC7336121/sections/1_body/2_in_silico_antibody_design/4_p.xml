<p id="p0080">Human IgG1 is the most effective antibody in both CDC and ADCC function and therefore for applications. It is the most appropriate treatment for pathogens or tumor cells. On the other hand, human IgG4 in these two functions is not active and can be used for imaging or blocking molecular intracranial. The Fc region is also associated with the serum half-life of antibodies, and it can be engineered it to reduce or increase the antibody half-life depending on its application

In addition, in humanized antibodies, only the CDR loops (six loops from the original antibody; three of the heavy chain variables and three of the second light chain variables) are responsible for detecting and binding to the antigen are linked to the second human variable, known as the “graft CDR.” To restore the initial affinity of the primary mouse mAbs, the key amino acids of the framework, which maintain the conformation of the CDR loops in the mouse antibody, are also transplanted into the human antibody. Since the first human antibody, Zenapax in 1997 entered the market, seven other humanized antibodies have been used for treatment
