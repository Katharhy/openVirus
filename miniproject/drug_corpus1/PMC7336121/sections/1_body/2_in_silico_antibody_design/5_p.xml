<p id="p0085">Antibody engineering is a very active area for increasing the tendency for binding to the antigens. Regardless of whether an antibody is made by a hybridoma, a phage library, or other technologies, antibodies need to be improved for their affinity to specific antigen. Affinity is not only mechanically important, but also increasing the affinity of an antibody increases its biological activity and improves treatment. It also reduces the dose of antibody therapy and thus reduces toxicity
