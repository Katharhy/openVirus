<p id="p0050">There are few approved therapeutic mAbs for viral infections. Palivizumab and Ibalizumab are two approved monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of human viral infections. However, more therapeutic mAbs are testing in the clinical phases. An antibody-based product, RMAB (Rabishield) that is a single human IgG1 type mAb has been evaluated in a phase II/III clinical trial in India against rabies G glycoprotein. This product was developed for a conformational epitope and could be served as a learning process in designing mAb-based products

 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The mixture of mAbs with different binding potential is also a robust approach for fighting infections in which they have been also developed against viral targets. ZMapp is an antibody mixture (cosfroviximab, larcaviximab, porgaviximab) developed by Mapp Biopharmaceutical, Inc., designed against the Ebola virus glycoprotein in phase II/III clinical trials
