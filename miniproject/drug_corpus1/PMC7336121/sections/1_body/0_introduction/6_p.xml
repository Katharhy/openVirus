<p id="p0055">Because of highlight in successful targeting and being as inspiring medications, there have been many attempts in recent years to reduce their limitations. These strategies contain engineered antibodies, minimizing strategies and the development of smaller recombinant antibody fragments retaining the targeting specificity of whole mAbs 
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Although several whole monoclonal antibodies have been approved or are in clinical phases, the use of antibody fragments against viral infections has not yet been approved or entered the clinic. By designing and discovering approaches, maneuvering on the engineering methods and the development of ideal antibody derivatives like single chain variable fragment (scFv), fragment antigen binding (Fab), nanobody or variants like diabody and bispecific antibodies, credible antibody-based biopharmaceutical tools are being developed against the viral targets for diagnosis and treatment applications. More recently, research groups are working to isolate and develop single-domain antibodies (VHHs) from a llama against coronavirus spike. The new coronavirus that currently cause a problematic pandemic named COVID-19 has a large envelope protein called spike for interaction with the host cell. Llama is immunized with this vulnerable target and VHHs are isolated. This VHH-base technology is being used as a rapid detection and treatment of COVID-19 infection
