<p id="p0175">Bispecific antibodies are demonstrated that protect human and even animal models from HIV infection. Khan 
 <italic>et al.</italic> designed molecules that cross target both the main HIV co-receptors, CCR5, and Env. These molecules neutralized 98 to 100% of a 109-virus panel. It was designed as tandem single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) (10E8fv-N6fv and m36.4-PRO 140fv), displayed median 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50s) of 0.0685 and 0.0131. A trispecific antibody was also designed contains 10E8-PGT121-PGDM1400 Env-specific binding sites. It has the same potential as the former one (median IC50 of 0.0135Â g/ml), while a trispecific molecule 10E8Fab-PGDM1400fv-PRO 140fv can simultaneously target Env and CCR5 with greater potency. They also constructed a trispecific prototype containing reconstituted CH2-CH3 domains restoring Fc receptor binding capacity. All three designed antibodies have shown as efficient tools nad prophylactic and therapeutic agents against HIV

 <italic>et al.</italic> constructed bispecific antibodies (biAbs) using single-chain variable fragments of anti-gp120 bNAbs fused to ibalizumab (iMab), a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds human CD4, the primary receptor for HIV-1. Results showed an improvement of 100% breath
