<p id="p0130">Human viruses generate potent, neutralizing antibody responses that can be potent modalities for inhibiting virus infections 
 <xref rid="b0335" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. Currently, because of discussed challenges in the whole mAb such as large size, high cost of production, low yield, mispairing and complexity in production, antibody fragments have been considered as next generation mAb 
 <xref rid="b0340" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. Accessibility to viral epitopes is a bottle neck point in the development of antiviral mAb. scFv, Fab, single domain antibody (sdAb) such as camelid VHH are more interesting in antibody engineering for the treatment of viral infections. Phage display is a robust technology for isolation the antibody fragments such as scFv, VHH or other binding oligo peptides. In this way, for a better and more successful treatment, library construction from the infected patient or
