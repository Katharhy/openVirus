<p id="p0150">Fragment domain–modified antibodies was developed via insertion two substitution mutations in domains of the highly potent HIV-specific 3BNC117 and 10-1074 bNAbs (broadly neutralizing antibodies) to enhancement half-lives and efficacy for blocking infection following repeated mucosal challenges of rhesus macaques with the simian–HIV

In other study, scFvs of HIV bNAbs designated for clinical testing that target four regions, V2-apex, V3-glycan supersite, CD4 binding site, and MPER (the membrane-proximal external region in the HIV-1 Env gp41 subunit) were expressed. With a variable loss of function compared to IgG but all scFs showed good neutralizing activity indicating antibody fragments suitable for passive immunization to prevent HIV-1 infection
