<p>Japanese encephalitis (JE), a mosquito-borne flavivirus infection, is the leading cause of severe viral infection of the central nervous system in Asian children [
 <xref rid="B1-vaccines-08-00328" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. JE viruses are transmitted by bird-biting mosquitoes, especially mosquitoes from the 
 <italic>Culex</italic> genus. There is no specific antiviral treatment for JE, and vaccination is the single most important control measure [
 <xref rid="B2-vaccines-08-00328" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. JE spread throughout Asia, but national immunization programs and urban development in the 1960s led to the near elimination of JE in Japan, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan. However, JE remains endemic in much of the rest of Asia [
 <xref rid="B3-vaccines-08-00328" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The virus was isolated in the 1930s, and the first inactivated mouse brain-derived vaccines were produced in the same decade [
 <xref rid="B4-vaccines-08-00328" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. For many years, only the inactivated JE vaccine produced in mouse brain was available in developed countries. Although at least eight types of JE vaccines are produced and used in several countries currently, the inactivated mouse brain vaccine still remains one of the principal vaccines. The immunization schedule for JE varies by nations. Primary vaccination is recommended at 18 months of age in Thailand, 15 months in Taiwan, 36 months in Japan, and 12 to 23 months in Korea [
