<p>In our study, NTAb titers differed by region. Seoul (a metropolitan city) showed the highest titer among all age groups, which is consistent with the previous study [

Although specific information on vaccine coverage was not obtained in this study, the high vaccination rate in Seoul compared to other provinces may have caused this result. In contrast, the lowest titer was observed in Incheon for the age group of 15 to 44 years and Jeonju for the age group above 45 years (
