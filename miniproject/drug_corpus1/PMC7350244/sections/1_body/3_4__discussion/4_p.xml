<p>In our study, a gradual decrease in JE seroprevalence was observed in the 30–59 age groups, but there was no age group with a seropositive rate below 50%. The other Korean study also presented the overall seropositive rate of 98% in the adult population aged 30–69 years [
 <xref rid="B6-vaccines-08-00328" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The high prevalence in Korea may be explained by the comparative magnitude of the JE epidemics and extensive vaccination program. In Korea, three large epidemics with 1000–3500 cases were reported in 1961–1968, and the latest epidemic in 1983 involved 139 reported cases [

The repeated and large JE epidemics within a short period may have resulted in the long-term maintenance of neutralizing antibodies in a high percentage of the elderly unvaccinated population in Korea. In addition, the mandatory vaccination program for all children aged 3–15 years annually was introduced in the 1980s, and it could have contributed to the high positive rates of neutralizing antibodies in the Korean population [

In Taiwan, a two-dose primary vaccination is administered at 15 months old, and two booster doses are administered at 27 months old and in first grade of elementary school [
 <xref rid="B10-vaccines-08-00328" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Based on the high seropositivity in our study compared to those of Japan and Taiwan, a final booster immunization at 12 years of age is not strongly recommended in Korea. Continuous surveillance on the seroprevalence of JE and JE cases is required to establish a proper immunization schedule in Korea.
