<p>Our results differ from previous studies conducted in Japan [

 <xref rid="B11-vaccines-08-00328" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], where the vaccination policy spanned 40 years. In Japan in 2004, those aged 25–64 years and 70 years or more had a seropositive rate of between 20% and 70%, and the rate was lowest in the population 45–49 years of age [
 <xref rid="B9-vaccines-08-00328" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This population was not vaccinated against JEV, nor naturally infected at a high rate as in the elderly population. In Taiwan, a similar pattern of the lowest JE-NTAb-seropositive rate (54%) was observed among adults born between 1963 and 1975, who generally received two or three doses of the vaccine and were administered the last booster dose more than 20 years ago [
 <xref rid="B10-vaccines-08-00328" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The high JE-NTAb seropositive rates were observed in the oldest unvaccinated population (86%) and in the youngest population born between 1981–1986, who received four doses 10–15 years ago (74%). In both of these countries, a relatively low JE seroprevalence (NTAb seropositive rate of &lt;50%) was observed in at least one age group—those aged 30–59 years in Japan in 2004 [
 <xref rid="B9-vaccines-08-00328" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and those aged 27–39 years in Taiwan in 2002 [
 <xref rid="B10-vaccines-08-00328" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].
