<p>The strengths of this study include the fact that we prospectively investigated the seropositive rates and NTAb titers of JEV in more than 1600 samples collected from the general population above 15 years old in various provinces in Korea. Moreover, we evaluated the correlation between the PV assay and PRNT and validated the PV assay as an alternative method for measuring JE-NTAb titers. Our study has some limitations. First, information on the individual vaccination status, location of residence, occupation, and travel history was not available, and we could not determine other factors which may have influenced the seropositive rates. Second, we did not trace the kinetic waning of anti-JEV antibodies in each subject, but instead compared the seroprevalence by age group. Third, the study site was limited to Seoul, Wonju, Incheon, Jeonju, and Daejeon, and thus the results cannot be representative of the entire country. However, we included various provinces in Korea and our results were consistent with those of previous studies [
