<p>There have been noticeable changes in the age-specific JEV seroprevalence over time in Korea [
 <xref rid="B14-vaccines-08-00328" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In 1946, seropositivity was 51% in the 1–10 years age group, 79% in those aged 11–20 years, and 94% in those over 61 years of age [
 <xref rid="B16-vaccines-08-00328" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In the 1970s, the seropositivity in children and adolescents was low (10–59%) [

 <xref rid="B18-vaccines-08-00328" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-vaccines-08-00328" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-vaccines-08-00328" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-vaccines-08-00328" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-vaccines-08-00328" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The seropositivity in this group increased to 90–92% in 1984–1985 [
 <xref rid="B23-vaccines-08-00328" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and increased further to 98% in our study conducted in 2012. On the other hand, the seroprevalence among adults has been maintained at a high level. In another Korean study, conducted in 2010 using 945 samples from adults aged 30–69 years in 10 provinces, the overall seropositive rate was 98.1%, and no age-specific difference was found [
 <xref rid="B6-vaccines-08-00328" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In our study, the seropositive rates among adults aged 30–49 years and 50–69 years were between 81% and 89% and 75% and 81%, respectively. PRNT was used to measure NTAbs to JEV in the previous study, and differences in assays with differing cut-off thresholds may have affected the results. Moreover, environmental factors including residences, sanitary conditions, occupations, and vaccination statuses may have contributed to the differences between the two studies.
