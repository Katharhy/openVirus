<p>Estimating the regression coefficients using 100,000 bootstrapping for 40 samples resulted in a higher mean value of the determinant, with 24 samples at 0.6058. Calculating the confidence intervals of 95% of the estimated coefficients, log
 <sub>10</sub>(PRNT) included 1 with 0.6267 to 1.0737 and the intercept included 0 with âˆ’0.3531 to 0.9133. According to the simple regression model analysis of this study, the r value was 0.778 for R
