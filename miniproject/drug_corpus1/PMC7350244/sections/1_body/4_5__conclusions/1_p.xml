<p>In conclusion, NTAbs to JEV has been maintained at appropriate levels among the general population in Korea. As a result of the study, we propose that adult immunization and a third booster vaccination against JEV are not strongly recommended. Periodic nationwide surveillance on the prevalence of JE NTAb and continuous monitoring for JE cases is required to understand the population-level immunity to JE and determine a proper immunization schedule in Korea.</p>
