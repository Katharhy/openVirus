<p>Serum was obtained from each subject and stored at −20 °C to −70 °C in a freezer until the measurement of the JE-NTAb titers. All the serum samples were sent to KR Biotech Co., Korea, and the NTAbs were measured using a pseudotyped virus (PV) assay. Although the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) has been known as the standard method for detecting and quantifying NTAbs against the JE virus [
 <xref rid="B14-vaccines-08-00328" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], in this study, a PV assay was used to measure NTAb titers due to limited expertise in growing and titrating JE virus plaques for investigating a large number of samples. The method of PV assay was described in a previous study [

Virus titers were determined in the Vero cells by infecting with the virus and staining with X-Gal solution. The X-Gal-stained blue cells were manually counted using an inverted microscope. For the neutralization assay, the Vero cells were dispensed into 96-well plates and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. Equal amounts of the diluted serum sample and diluted JEV-PV were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Thereafter, 100 mL of the neutralized liquid was inoculated into three wells per dilution and allowed to adsorb for 36 h at 37 °C/% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, and then X-gal staining was performed. The neutralizing titer was determined by testing serially diluted sera relative to the concurrently tested control serum prepared from normal mice. The neutralization titer was expressed as the maximum serum dilution yielding a 50% reduction in virus (PV
 <sub>50</sub>), and a titer equal or greater than 1:50 was considered to be seropositive. The comparison of the PV assay against the conventional PRNT has been performed and published previously [
