<p>All of the statistical data were calculated by using SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The seropositive rates and titers of JE-NTAbs were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). An ANOVA and the Holmâ€“Bonferroni method were used to compare geographical differences in the NTAb titers. To verify that the PV assay and PRNT were associated, we performed a linear regression analysis using bootstrapping. A
