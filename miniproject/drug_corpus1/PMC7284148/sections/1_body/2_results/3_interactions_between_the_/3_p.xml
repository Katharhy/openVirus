<p>A good number of amino acids are found to appear in the hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding. Moreover, the active site of the NSP10/NSP16 methyltransferase and main protease have mostly hydrophobic interactions with the ligands. Hydrophobic interaction successfully delineates specific functional groups that may be responsible for the hydrophobic generating effect of these compounds with strong binding affinity against target proteins and may play a highly influencing against SARS-CoV-2 infection</p>
