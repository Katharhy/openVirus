<p>ADME/T properties of the lead compounds (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>) were appraised by using the Qikprop application of Maestro 12.0). The most attractive aspect of compounds is their admirable QPlogo/w, QPlogS [
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] molecular weight, H-bond donor and acceptor, QplogBB, and percentage of human oral value which satisfy the Lipinski rule of five [
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] (
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Moreover, polar surface area, high oral bioavailability, H-bond donors, and acceptors are being important criteria for the development of therapeutic agents. All these models unscrew the qualitative prediction and ranking of absorption, formulation effects on drug permeability, determining the mechanism(s) of permeability, and the potential for transporter-mediated drug-drug interactions. All the good scoring ligand has drug-likeness properties by Lipinskiâ€™s rule. It may also be predictable that the combination of these drugs/s may be a good idea to prevent COVID-19 infection.
