<p>Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion/toxicity (ADME/T) properties are used to eliminate inappropriate compounds before invested inappropriate compounds, time, and money. QuikProp module in VSW (Maestro 12.0) calculated the ADME information of ligands. QikProp module calculates various properties and provides values for descriptors, which predict drug-likeness of ligands and generated functional groups, rings, and a number of elements used for the prediction of descriptors of the ligand/s.</p>
