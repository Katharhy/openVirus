LigPrep module of Maestro12.0 (Schrodinger) was used to prepare the ligand library for the Docking purpose. Ionization of ligands was retained in actual states with the realistic length of bonds as well as bond angles, ring conformation and tautomers were generated, using the OPLS-2005 force field.
