<p>The high-resolution structure of SARS-CoV2 main Protease (PDB ID: 6lu7) and NSP10/NSP16 Methyltransferase (PDB ID: 6w61) were downloaded online from the protein data bank (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.rcsb.org/</ext-link>). The protein preparation wizard of Maestro 12.0 was used for the preparation of the protein structure. The selected structure was processed for creating disulfide bonds, assigning proper bond orders, and the addition of missing hydrogens in the raw structure. Hydrogen bonds optimization was assigned using non-hydrogen atoms of protein, and the structure was energy minimized until the RMSD (root mean square deviation) reaches the value of 0.3 Å.
