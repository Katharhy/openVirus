<p>Various forms of the viruses are found to perform replication in the cytoplasm of eukaryotes through evolving 2′-
 <italic>O</italic>-methyltransferases (2′-
 <italic>O</italic>-MTase) for modification of their mRNAs and carry a Cap-1 structure such as, m7GpppNm at the 5′ end, which facilitate viral duplication and help to escape recognition against innate immune responses done by some immune cells in the hosts [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The stimulatory factor NSP10, along with NSP16, stabilizes the pocket of SAM-binding and continuing the RNA-binding groove of the substrate of NSP16, which is observed by crystallographic and biochemical analysis [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It has been observed that interference in the interaction between NSP16 and NSP10 of SARS-CoV by short peptides can inhibit the activity of 2′-O-MTase [
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. 2′-O-MTase was also found to catalyze the transfer of methyl group SAM or AdoMet to RNA substrate and produce S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine as a byproduct [
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It was evidenced that the stimulation of NSP16 methyltransferase activity by NSP10 is a common and primary mechanism for the coronaviruses. It has been further demonstrated that NSP10 is synonymou
 <bold>s</bold> in the stimulatory function among distinct coronaviruses, and the peptide, which is derived from the conserved domain of MHV NSP10, shows an inhibitory effect on 2′-
 <italic>O</italic>-methyltransferase activity during virus duplication. These results might use to find out specific anti-COVID-19 drugs to control infection [
