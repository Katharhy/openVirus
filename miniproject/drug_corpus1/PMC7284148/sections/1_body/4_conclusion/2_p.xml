<p>In this study, it has been shown that selected screened compounds have good docking score, high DG binding free energy as well as strong hydrophobic interactions, and follows the Lipinski rule of five. Thus, these compounds might have the potential to be utilized against the NSP10/NSP16 methyltransferase and main protease complexes. Here, in this study, we can conclude that the obtained compounds from this 
 <italic>in silico</italic> study may be an excellent agent to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection either alone or in combination. However, it warrants further experimental investigations.
