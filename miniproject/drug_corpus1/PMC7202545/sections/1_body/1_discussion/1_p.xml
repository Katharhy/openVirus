<p>SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus that causes respiratory illness, and is genetically most similar to SARS-CoV, the betacoronavirus that caused the SARS epidemic of 2003. The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemic was also caused by a betacoronavirus that induces severe respiratory illness. Both SARS and MERS were contained before they became pandemics, and much of what we predict about the trajectory of COVID-19 comes from what we learned about SARS and MERS [
