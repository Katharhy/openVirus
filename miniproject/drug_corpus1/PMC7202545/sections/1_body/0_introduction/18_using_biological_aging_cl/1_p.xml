<p>Since senescence varies among individuals, a person’s chronological age is not as important as their biological age. For several years, scientists have sought accurate aging biomarkers that may predict an individuals’ biological age and, independently of immunosenescence, their risk of morbidity and mortality. These biomarkers, or “clocks”, could then be used to test for the effectiveness of proposed geroprotective treatments and as surrogate markers in anti-aging clinical trials. While there are no reliable aging clocks to evaluate immunosenescence and inflamaging [

 <xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>], microbiomic clocks [
 <xref rid="r117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>] and other clocks have been described. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have enabled the development of multi-modal multi-omics age-predictors, able to learn complex non-linear patterns and extract the most important features [
 <xref rid="r113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. None of these currently have robust clinical validation and cannot yet serve as companion biomarkers for geroprotective and anti-aging interventions intended to ameliorate the population-level effects of infectious diseases during flu seasons and pandemics. We call for rigorous clinical validation and further development of biological aging clocks that could, in the future, allow us to measure the effectiveness of the numerous speculative geroprotective and senoremediative interventions described herein.
