<p>There are multiple strategies proposed to restore immune function in the elderly [
 <xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], and multiple databases of geroprotectors exist [
 <xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. However, to date the only known geroprotectors backed by promising clinical evidence of improved immune response to viral infection in the elderly, although still limited by a lack of large clinical trials, are sirolimus (rapamycin) and everolimus. These may be used as single agents in combination with other treatments (
