<p>There are multiple interventions proposed in the academic literature to remedy age-associated increases in infection rates, severity, and lethality for a variety of infections. For example, regular increased physical activity has been proposed to reduce immunosenescence [

 <xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and Horvath [
 <xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] have suggested that a combination of the potentially geroprotective compound metformin, recombinant human Growth Hormone (rhGH), and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) may reverse biological age, as measured using the methylation aging clock, and immunosenescence [

 <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. While there is no clinical evidence yet suggesting age reversal or improved immune function in the elderly, efforts are being made to identify new geroprotectors using human data and artificial intelligence [
 <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Further, the use of natural compounds that mimic the effects of known geroprotectors is generally recognized as safe [
