<p>Aging is a complex, multifactorial process [
 <xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] that leads to loss of function and is the primary risk factor for major human pathologies including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases [
 <xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although there is still much debate in the scientific community, proposals have been made to classify aging as a disease in order to develop therapeutic strategies to prevent or delay the onset of age-related illnessess [
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–
 <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Increasing frailty with age leads to an increased risk of many diseases. These diseases are commonly referred to as age-related [
 <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Many pathogens are more infectious and prevalent in the elderly, [
 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–
 <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and may be referred to as gerophilic (from Greek, 
 <italic>géros</italic> “old man” and 
 <italic>philia</italic>, “love”). Some infections, including COVID-19, are not exclusively gerophilic, as younger people may also become infected. However, these individuals have mild symptoms or remain asymptomatic, while the elderly experience substantially more severe symptoms and lethality. The term gerolavic (from Greek, 
 <italic>géros</italic> “old man”, and 
 <italic>epilavís</italic>, “harmful”) may more appropriately describe infections that cause the most harm in the elderly.
