<p>According to the recent COVID-19 treatment guidelines in China [
 <xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], symptomatic treatment for COVID-19 patients is recommended for mild cases and consists of rest, isolation, adequate hydration, analgesia, and antipyretic medication. Moderate and severe cases (mostly hospitalized) require additional measures, such as careful fluid balance, intravenous antibiotics for superinfections, oxygen supplementation, non-invasive ventilation with or without positive pulmonary pressure, and in some cases intubation and mechanical ventilation. Although the projected global infection rates are variable, we share a common concern that outside of China there may be an insufficient number of beds for hospitalization and ventilation units if the disease spread does not slow down.
