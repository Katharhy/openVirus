   <bold>The vicious circle of aging and infection, where age-associated immunosenescence leads to reduced ability to resist infection; infection leads to increased damage, loss of homeostasis, and accelerated aging; which in turn leads to age-related diseases, further accelerating immunosenescence.</bold> Infections and other age-related diseases are among the main causes of death in the developed world and developing countries.
