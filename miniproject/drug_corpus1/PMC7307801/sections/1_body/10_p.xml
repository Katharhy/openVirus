<p>To date, only a few drugs are potential candidates for meeting all the requirements above: Chloroquine (CH), its analogue Hydroxychloroquine (HCH), and the combination Lopinavir (LPV) / Ritonavir (RTV). These drugs have been shown to have good antiviral activity on CoVs, especially during in vitro studies [

 <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Unfortunately, there are only a few clinical studies [

 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], which – although encouraging – provide a sufficient grade of recommendation only if considered within the context of a serious emergency such as the current pandemic. A multinational hospital registry analysis recently highlighted the potential cardiologic risks of CH/HCH used to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients [
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In order to mitigate risks for patients, early home therapy would be conditional to a clinical evaluation of possible effects on pre-existing pathologies and of possible interactions with other drugs. For patients with macular degeneration, for example, it would be preferable to use LPV/RTV rather than CH/HCH even if the risk of worsening retinal disease in short-term treatments with HCH is low [
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. CH/HCH should not be prescribed at home if patients have QT prolongation or a predisposition to this condition [
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Any other antiviral drug that will be proven to be effective for treatment of COVID-19, while maintaining the aforementioned characteristics of availability, safety, and ease of handling, could be considered for early treatment of patients at risk.
