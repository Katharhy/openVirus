<p>In most cases COVID-19 presents mild symptoms, and 50% of infected individuals are asymptomatic [
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, in about 20% of patients the disease causes severe clinical consequences that require hospitalization and, in some cases, intensive care [
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The average time between the onset of symptoms and hospitalization is seven days [
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These data confirm the clinical observation that patients with severe forms worsen to clinical conditions one week after the onset of symptoms, on average [
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Individual factors influencing the natural history of the disease could cause such dissimilar clinical outcomes.
