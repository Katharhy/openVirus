<p>COVID-19 appears to share several pathophysiological mechanisms with previous epidemics caused by SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV. As with SARS and MERS, the course of COVID-19 presents two phases: a first “viral” phase when cells are infected by the virus, the viral load increases rapidly and the host's immune response is triggered; and a second “immune” phase, which occurs in some patients only, when the immune system loses control of the inflammatory response, therefore causing serious damage to the lungs, kidneys and heart [

 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are able to evade the host's initial immune response by interfering with the synthesis of interferon (INF) I and by inducing apoptosis of T lymphocytes [

 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. T lymphocytes play a fundamental role in generating an immune response to the virus and in modulating the inflammatory response of monocytes-macrophages [
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Studies in animal models of SARS-CoV infection have shown that intense virus replication associated with reduced production of INF I during early stages of infection are associated with subsequent development of lung damage and with increased lethality [
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The host's delayed immune response associated with increased viral replication promotes a progressive accumulation of inflammatory cells such as monocyte-macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils [
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] in the lung tissue. When these cells are not appropriately modulated, the “immune” phase of the disease is triggered and a “cytokine storm” is generated [
