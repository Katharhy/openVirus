<p>The disproportionate burden of COVID-19 among Blacks/AA had been demonstrated in these findings. Besides this, SARS-COV-2 pathogen in COVID-19, previous pandemics had observed similar burden as in the flu pandemic of 1918 [

The observed disparities and the disproportionate burden among Blacks/AA is explained in part by neighborhood-level social determinants, such as unemployment, educational level, housing and living conditions and population density [

The epidemiologic modeling of these factors provides reliable data in modulating these effects in anticipation of another pandemic, such as COVID-19-2. The social determinants of health as an exposure function of social and health inequities has been shown in the disproportionate burden in infant mortality, cancer, cardiovascular disease, stroke and diabetes among Blacks/AA. These differentials, where Blacks/AA are at a higher risk of diseases, reflect the unfair, unjust and inequitable distribution or allocation of social, economic and environmental conditions related to health. Additionally, the disproportionate burden of disease as observed among the socially disadvantaged populations, namely Blacks/AA and Hispanics, reflects structural racism, which is different from interpersonal racism.
