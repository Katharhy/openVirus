<p>Despite the appropriate epidemiologic model used in this preliminary study to determine the Black–White mortality risk differentials in COVID-19, there are some limitations. First, this study used the only available data at this point, which is the aggregate data from the departments of public health, which has a tendency for ecological fallacies. Secondly, there is a tendency for confoundability, since data were not available to assess and control for the confounding in the risk estimation. Thirdly, despite the sources of these data, complete race/ethnicity data were not available in these states and cities utilized in this risk estimation. However, the interpretation of these data remains accurate since an estimated &gt;80% of the race/ethnicity data were available for this modeling. This preliminary study strongly recommends the collection and availability of race/ethnicity data from all states and US territories for the understanding of COVID-19 population dynamics for racial/ethnic minority populations’ engagement and preparedness in the future, for health equity transformation in epidemics and pandemics.</p>
