 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-04322-f003">Figure 3</xref> examines the excess ratio of death based on the population size of Blacks/AA. For example, in IL, Blacks/AA represent 14% of the total state population but the COVID-19 mortality was 46% in this population, indicative of the disproportionate share of the burden of this pathogenic microbe in this community of color.
