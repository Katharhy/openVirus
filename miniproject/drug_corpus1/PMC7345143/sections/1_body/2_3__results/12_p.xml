 <xref rid="ijerph-17-04322-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> demonstrates the Black–White risk differentials in case fatality with binomial regression models in MI, MD, IL, WI and the city of Chicago. The cumulative incidence risk of dying reflects the exposure function of race in COVID-19 mortality in these states and Chicago. There was a survival disadvantage for Blacks/AA with COVID-19 during the month of April 2020 in Michigan, with a significant 15% increased risk of dying relative to Whites, CmI risk ratio (RR) = 1.15, 95% CI, 1.01–1.32. Relative to Whites in Maryland, there was a 5% increased risk of dying from COVID-19 among Black residents compared to Whites, RR = 1.05, 95% CI, 0.70–1.39. The state of Illinois observed a 13% increased risk of dying for Blacks/AA compared to Whites, RR, 1.13, 95% CI, 0.93–1.39. A 51% increased risk of dying was observed among Blacks relative to Whites in the state of Wisconsin, with most data from Milwaukee city and Milwaukee County, RR = 1.51, 95% CI, 1.10–2.10. In the city of Chicago, Blacks/AA were more than two times as likely to die from COVID-19 relative to Whites, implying that for everyone White death from COVID-19, more than two Blacks/AA will die, RR = 2.24, 95% CI, 1.35–3.88.
