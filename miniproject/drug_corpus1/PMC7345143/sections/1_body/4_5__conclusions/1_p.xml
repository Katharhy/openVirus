<p>In summary, racial disparities in COVID-19 case fatality exist and persisted and will continue to persist unless data-driven scientific measures are implemented for racial/ethnic gap narrowing, thus reducing the probability and likelihood of COVID-19-2. Additionally, Blacks/AA have a disproportionate burden and increased risk of COVID-19 mortality compared to their White counterparts. The observed racial disparities is explained by social determinants of health, where Black individuals are exposed to environmental pollutants, social inequity, structural racism, food insecurity, poor housing and living conditions, illiteracy, low SES, and a lack of healthcare resources.</p>
