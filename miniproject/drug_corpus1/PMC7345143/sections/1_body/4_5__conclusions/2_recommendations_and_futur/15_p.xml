<p>As emergency preparedness, health equity resources are required through disproportionate universalism, which is the public health lens in the provision of health services more to the racial/ethnic minorities prior to the non-vulnerable populations. The failure to address the socially disadvantaged individuals and populationsâ€™ needs in our society, by educational opportunity, equitable employment opportunity and the departure from structural racism, will render the US population more vulnerable to public health and healthcare crises in COVID-19-2. In effect, as clinicians, researchers, health officers, epidemiologist, infectious disease specialist, and public health experts, it is our moral responsibility regardless of our race/ethnicity, gender or age, to rapidly respond to the disproportionate mortality burden of this pandemic in the communities of color, especially Blacks/AA, since human life remains a primary value.</p>
