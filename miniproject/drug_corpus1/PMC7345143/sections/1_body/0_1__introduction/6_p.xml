<p>The pathogenicity and virulence of a microbe depends on its ability to bridge the innate and adaptive immune response. The subpopulations with exposure to circumstance, such as food insecurity, psychosocial stressors and chronic morbidity have an increased propensity for viral transmission and infectivity complication, resulting in increased mortality and case fatality. Within the Black/AA communities, these exposures, in addition to the lack of health insurance, render the immune system incompetent through several mechanisms. One such mechanism refers to the propagation of the conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA) gene, resulting in an adverse consequence on interferon system elaboration during viral infection and decreased antibodies such as immunoglobulin G (IgG) synthesis. In addition, patientsâ€™ response to therapeutic agents, such as monoclonal antibodies, anti-inflammatory and antiviral drugs, depend on transcriptomes, which serve as receptors to drugs or medications, or a lack thereof, which implies a decreased response to therapeutic agents. This current study aimed to assess the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 on Blacks/AA relative to Whites, explain the root causes, implying the social gradient and propose scientific and data-driven recommendations in narrowing the gap in case fatality between Whites and Blacks/AA. Specifically, we sought to: (a) examine the frequency of confirmed cases in the United States and, by region and states, namely Illinois, Michigan, Louisiana, Wisconsin, Maryland, New York and California, (b) assess the cumulative incidence (CmI) of COVID-19 mortality by race, and (c) determine the case fatality differentials between Blacks/AA and Whites.</p>
