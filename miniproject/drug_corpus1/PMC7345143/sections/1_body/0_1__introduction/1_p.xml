<p>The understanding of the social gradient, implying the social determinants of health and health-related events is essential in transforming health equity in epidemics and pandemics. Health distributions and determinants reflect social inequity, which is the unfair and unjust distribution of social, economic and environment conditions associated with health [

 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-17-04322" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], the understanding of these determinants in infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, is relevant in epidemic curve flattening and case fatality mitigation. Epidemiologic data clearly implicate the sub-populations characterized by low education, low socio-economic status, disadvantaged or deprived neighborhoods with excess morbidity and mortality in any epidemic and pandemic [

 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-17-04322" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], relative to socio-economically advantaged [
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-17-04322" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-17-04322" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Translational epidemiology that involves research at biologic, clinical correlates and population-based levels provides the perspective and challenges in addressing and transforming health equity during pandemics such as COVID-19.
