<p>Data simulation involved the use of an immediate risk ratio to assess the 2009 N1H1 2009 influenza pandemic data. This was performed by cumulative incidence risk. The ecologic or aggregate data on COVID-19 from the states’ public access data was used to determine racial variances or differences in confirmed cases and mortality. The case fatality was performed using the formula:
 <disp-formula>COVID-19 deaths/COVID-19 frequency or confirmed cases × 100.
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula>
