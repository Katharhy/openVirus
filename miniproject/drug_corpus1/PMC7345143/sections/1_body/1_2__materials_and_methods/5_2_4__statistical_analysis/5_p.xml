<p>The binomial regression model (BRM) was used to determine the risk of dying from COVID-19 by specific populations in the race category. This model is adequate in predicting the risk of dying from COVID-19 and by race stratification. The BRM is based on the probability of dying in the populations of interest, namely Whites and Blacks/AA, and with Whites as the selected population in the referenced group for the relative risk assessment, as the risk ratio point estimate or magnitude of effect. In this model, we predicted the risk of dying, given the race of the confirmed COVID-19 case. The response or dependent variable ‘y’ (COVID-19 deaths), with each value in the independent variable (race/ethnicity) representing the number of success (k-deaths) observed in ‘m’ trials. Assuming the probability of success (death) = π, and the probability of failure (alive) = 1 − π. We used the link function to relate the risk of dying to a linear combination of the regression variable, including the constant or intercept on the y axis:
 <disp-formula>ln (pr (success (death) = 1/pr (success (death) = 0) = β0 (constant/intercept) + β1(race).
  <label>(4)</label>
 </disp-formula>
