<p>For example, the risk of dying from COVID-19 among Blacks/AA was compared to the risk of dying among Whites for the risk ratio estimation using 2 Ã— 2 tabulation (A/AB)/(D/CD), A = Confirmed cases and COVID-19 mortality among blacks, B = Confirmed cases with recovery/survival among blacks, C = conformed cases and COVID mortality among whites, while D is confirmed cases with recovery/survival among whites. A/AB is the risk in the exposed, Blacks/AA, divided by the risk in the unexposed, Whites, D/CD. In terms of the interpretation, if the two populations are comparable with respect to the mortality risk, the risk ratio (RR) = 1.00, and if the risk is higher among Blacks/AA, the RR is &gt;1.0, but if the risk of COVID-19 is lower among Blacks/AA, the RR is &lt;1.0
