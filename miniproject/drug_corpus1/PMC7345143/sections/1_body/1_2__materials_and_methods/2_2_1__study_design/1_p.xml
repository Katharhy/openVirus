<p>Data simulation and cross-sectional ecologic design was used to assess aggregate data on COVID-19 in selected states (WI, MI, LU, IL, MD, NC, NJ, NY, CA) by race. This design allows for an assessment on the correlation between the frequency of COVID-19 confirmed cases, mortality, case fatality and race. The data simulation was performed using data from the 2009 H1N1 with signal amplification and specific risk stratification by race. The data on risk modeling were available on the following states namely WI, MI, LU, IL, MD.</p>
