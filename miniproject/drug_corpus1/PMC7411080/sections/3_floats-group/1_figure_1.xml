  <p>Schematic representation outlining the oral-lung-axis mechanism of viral-bacterial lung co-infection during respiratory viral infections and effect of the oral care interventions for patients. Risk factors such as poor oral hygiene, cough, increased inhalation and mechanical ventilation provide a pathway for oral microorganisms to enter the lower respiratory tract and thus cause co-infection to aggravate respiratory disease via mechanisms involving changes in cytokines, T cell responses, and the effects of host conditions such as aging and the oral microbiome changes due to systemic diseases. Improving oral hygiene care by either mechanical or chemical control of dental plaque biofilm formation would reduce the number of potential respiratory pathogens and inhibit droplet-borne virus route through oral cavity, and hence consequently reduce the risk and mortality risk of aspiration pneumonia.</p>
