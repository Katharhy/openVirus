<p>In this review, we described the co-infections in viral disease. The mechanism of viral-bacterial lung co-infections during respiratory viral infections and effect of the oral care interventions for patients are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. During the SARS-CoV-2 global outbreak, numerous cases are coinfected with other pathogens, some of which originate from the oral cavity. Until now, little work had been done on the coronaviruses and oral microbiomes, and much remains for future study. While previous research has linked lung regional immunity with stable state maintenance or imbalance, current research has only preliminarily explored the influence of oral bacteria in the respiratory system, or the influence of oral bacteria-virus interactions on respiratory diseases. The scientific community must help the world to prepare for the next pandemic and thus to avoid massive loss of life. Drawing on the experiences of SARS in 2003 and influenza outbreaks, we recommend that oral hygiene in COVID 19 patients be a concern as co-infection is critical to prognosis.
