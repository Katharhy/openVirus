<p>Following several influenza virus pandemics and the maturation of genome sequencing in recent years, studies on the co-infections caused by viruses, bacteria, or fungi have increased. Epidemiological data indicated that bacterial complications further increased morbidity and mortality of influenza infection. The “Spanish flu” of 1918 was the most severe influenza pandemic on record, 95% of the mortality due to bacterial infection (

These studies suggested that keen vigilance should be maintained against infections derived from the oral microbiome during infection by respiratory viruses and have uncovered risk factors such as increased inhalation, poor oral hygiene, and viral infection are related to the occurrence of respiratory infection (
