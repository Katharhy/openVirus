However, the mechanism involving virus proliferation and how the virus interacts with other microorganisms in the lung is still unclear. The development of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) technique allows for the investigation of novel or mixed pathogens (i.e., RNA viruses, DNA viruses, bacteria, and fungi) directly from original clinical samples (
