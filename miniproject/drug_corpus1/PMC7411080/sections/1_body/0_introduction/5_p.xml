<p>Considering the presented discussion, microbial co-infection increases the risk of disease severity in humans, while the mechanism is still unclear. Therefore, it is crucial to study the source and mechanism of co-infectious pathogens. In this review, we described the pathogens, i.e., viruses, bacteria and fungi, involved in co-infections in COVID-19 patients and summarized previous studies on the SARS-CoV and the influenza virus. We also discussed the possible disruptive factors contributing to co-infection and emphasized the potential role of the oral microbiome in the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Understanding that the microbiome correlates with co-infections or affects the mucosal immune system helps to better predict the clinical outcomes and prevent complications.</p>
