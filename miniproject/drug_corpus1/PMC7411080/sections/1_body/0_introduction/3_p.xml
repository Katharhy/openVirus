<p>SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA Î²-coronavirus and a member of the subgenus Sarbecovirus (beta-CoV lineage B). It is the seventh member of the 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> known to infect humans so far, two of which, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, caused global health threats previously (

 <xref rid="B148" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>), which is composed of single-stranded RNA with possible variations like those of the influenza virus. Other research has indicated a higher viral load in the nose than in the throat, viral nucleic acid change model in the patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were similar to those in the patients with influenza viruses but different from that of SARS-CoV (
