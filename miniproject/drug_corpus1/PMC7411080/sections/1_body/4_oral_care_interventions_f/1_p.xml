<p>Once infected by a virus such as SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2, patients are vulnerable to dyspnea, hypoxemia, and even acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and thus mechanical ventilation becomes a common life-saving intervention. Given the fact that oral microbiota is prone to entering the lower respiratory tract due to increased aspiration and the presence of mechanical ventilation, the prevalence of fatal VAP may increase. However, current guidelines for the management of COVID-19 scarcely emphasize oral care. As discussed above, poor oral hygiene can lead to a large accumulation of pathogens in the oral cavity and immune disorders caused by viral infection can promote additional bacterial/fungal infections, hence increase the risk of secondary pneumonia. Therefore, it is necessary for the clinician to strengthen oral hygiene care for COVID-19 patients.</p>
