<p>Povidone iodine (PV-I, 0.23∼1%), cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC, 0.05∼0.10%), and hydrogen peroxide (0.5∼1.5%) all effectively reduce the number of oral microbiota (

Since SARS-CoV-2 is vulnerable to oxidation, antiseptic mouthwash or gel containing broad spectrum oxidative agents, such as hydrogen peroxide or PV-I, is recommended to reduce the oral microbiota and potentially SARS-CoV-2 as well. 0.02% of CHX is ineffective against coronaviruses as a surface disinfectant, it works as good as 7.5% povidone-iodine or 70% ethyl alcohol when the concentration was increased to 0.05% (
