<p>At present, the impact of coronavirus on the oral, lung, and gut microbiomes has not been well-researched. However, we found a study on the changes in gut microbiota of swine infected by porcine epidemic virus (a member of the family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>). Interestingly, 
 <italic>Fusobacteria</italic>, a typically dominant taxa in the oral cavity, was found to predominate in the infected group (approximately 32%, 0.1% in the normal group) (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Koh et al., 2015</xref>). Due to the limited amount of data available to date, we would like to focus on the influenza virus and discuss the relationship between influenza viruses and the oral microbiome. It was found that over-expressed 
 <italic>Prevotella</italic> proteins can promote viral infection. As per the results, 
 <italic>Prevotella</italic> proteins, rather than viral proteins, are involved in increasing clinical severity of COVID-2019, i.e., 
 <italic>Prevotella</italic> plays role in COVID- 2019 outbreak and attention should be paid to understanding disease mechanisms and improving treatment outcomes (
