<p>SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from different body fluids and the rate of positive test results vary depending on the sample size, days after illness onset, and severity of illness. According to a study on 213 confirmed COVID-19 patients, viral RNA could be detected in all BALF samples of severe cases, but not from mild cases. Sputum appeared to be a good clinical sample with a high positive rate (74.4∼88.9%), followed by nasal swabs (53.6∼73.3%) and throat swabs (50∼ 61.3%). When the onset time was greater than 14 days, the positive rate of BALF, sputum, and nasal swabs showed similar results, and were still much higher than throat swabs (

 <sup>7</sup> copies/ml (

 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">To et al., 2020a</xref>) reported that the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples was highest during the first week of symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2 show high affinity with ACE2, which are higher in tongue, than in buccal or gingival, tissues (
