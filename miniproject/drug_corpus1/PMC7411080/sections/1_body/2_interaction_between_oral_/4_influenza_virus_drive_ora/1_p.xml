<p>Previous research has shown that viruses can drive changes in both local microbial composition and quantity in the lungs. 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Leung et al. (2013)</xref> conducted an unbiased high-throughput sequencing method to analyze the oropharyngeal microorganisms of pneumonia patients with or without influenza virus infection, and found that the number of 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> in the oropharynx increased significantly after influenza virus infection, whereas the number of 
 <italic>Prevotella, Veillonella</italic>, and 
 <italic>Neisseria</italic> decreased significantly. A clinical study (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2017</xref>) showed a large number of 
 <italic>Streptococcus, Actinomyces</italic> and 
 <italic>Rothia</italic> colonizing the oropharynx of flu patients suffering from bacterial complications. Whatâ€™s more, the imbalance of microbiota was also found in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2, 
 <italic>Fusobacterium periodonticum</italic> significantly decreased in the nasopharynx (

 <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>, 
 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Eubacterium</italic>) was significantly reduced, and the proportion of conditioned pathogenic bacteria was significantly increased, such as 
 <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> and 
 <italic>Ruthenibacterium</italic> (
