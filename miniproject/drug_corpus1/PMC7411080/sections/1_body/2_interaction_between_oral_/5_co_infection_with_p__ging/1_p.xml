<p>As an opportunistic pathogen, 
 <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> cannot be completely eliminated by host cells. An 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study suggested that during co-infection of 
 <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> and influenza virus, significant apoptosis and necrosis can be observed in lung epithelial cells within a short timeframe (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Connolly et al., 2017</xref>) as the Bcl2/Bax/Caspase3 signaling pathway was activated (

 <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> (e.g., lipopolysaccharide) can induce host cells release of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 (
