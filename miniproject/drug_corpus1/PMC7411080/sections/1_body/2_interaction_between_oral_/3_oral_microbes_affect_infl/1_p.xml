<p>Influenza viruses rely on neuraminidase (NA) activity to release progeny viruses from infected cells and spread the infection. NA is, therefore, an important target of anti-influenza drugs. It was known that the culture supernatants of NA-producing oral bacteria, like 
 <italic>Streptococcus oralis</italic> and 
 <italic>Streptococcus mitis</italic>, can promote the release of influenza virus and cell-to-cell spread of the infection, and also help to increase viral M1 protein expression levels and activation of cellular ERK. These effects were not observed with culture supernatants of 
 <italic>Streptococcus sanguinis</italic> which cannot produce NA (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Kamio et al., 2015</xref>). These findings suggest that an increase in the number of NA-producing oral bacteria could elevate the risk of and exacerbate the influenza infection. Considering the tendency of the virus to accelerate the progression of respiratory disease, it is worth noticing the potential impact of oral microbiota on respiratory viral infections. However, the mechanism of interaction between oral bacteria and respiratory viruses to promote lung infection has not been studied in depth, and further attention is urgently needed in this field.
