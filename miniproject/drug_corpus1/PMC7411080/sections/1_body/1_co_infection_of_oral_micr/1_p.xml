<p>Itâ€™s reported that 1450/2010 (72%) of COVID-19 patients received antimicrobial therapy (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Rawson et al., 2020</xref>). The prevention and treatment of bacterial and fungal co-infections by antimicrobial prescribing in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is necessary (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Rawson et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">Verweij et al., 2020</xref>). There have been some reports on the microorganisms associated with infection, but the pathogenesis and effects are not fully understood. 
 <italic>Capnocytophaga</italic>, 
 <italic>Veillonella</italic>, and other oral opportunists have been found in the BALF of the COVID-19 patients by mNGS (
 <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2020</xref>), indicating the oral cavity is likely to be a natural reservoir for pathogens inducing those found in COVID-19 patients with co-infections. Metagenomic sequencing has found that the nasopharyngeal bacterial population of COVID-19 patients varied with the length of viral infection. For example, 
 <italic>Fusobacterium periodonticum</italic> significantly decreased 3 days after infection (
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2020</xref>). As shown in the gut microbiota of patients with COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="B152" ref-type="bibr">Zuo et al., 2020</xref>), specific intestinal microbes that can downregulate the expression of ACE2 correlated inversely with SARS-CoV-2 load. Whether 
 <italic>Fusobacterium periodonticum</italic> has the same function, further research should be done.
