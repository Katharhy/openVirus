<p>Influenza is the most common type of acute respiratory infection (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Hanada et al., 2018</xref>) and bacterial complications were an important complication of the 2009 influenza pandemic (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">MacIntyre et al., 2018</xref>). Similar to SARS, conditional pathogens were the most common infectious microbes (

 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Dela Cruz and Wunderink, 2017</xref>), from the upper respiratory tract are also associated with influenza co-infection. Furthermore, comprehensive detection of potential pathogens was performed using next-generation DNA sequencing of total RNAs extracted from an autopsied lung of a patient died of A/H1N1/2009. 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> were detected, though in small quantities. 
 <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> is the most important periodontitis pathogen, while 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> sp., in general, constitute the main component of oral flora (
