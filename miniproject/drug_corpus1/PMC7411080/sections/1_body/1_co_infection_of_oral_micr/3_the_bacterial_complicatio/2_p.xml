<p>Studies on confirmed SARS cases showed that co-infection was one of the major complications, especially in those who underwent extended hospitalization and long-term mechanical ventilation. Some conditional pathogens such as

 <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic>, 
 <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>, 
 <italic>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</italic>, and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> could come from hospital environment, nosocomial infection, but the majority inhabit the oral cavity (

Even though NGS technology was just coming into use during the SARS outbreak, it was difficult to identify the total microbial composition in clinical samples, therefore microorganisms from clinical specimens, such as blood, urine, sputum and BALF, of SARS patients were collected with conventional culture, and then underwent sensitivity testing and drug resistance testing (
