<p>In fact, bacteria are known to participate in interactions between host cells and viruses. Although bacteria are typically secondary invaders during influenza infections, they express virulence factors that promote viral pathogenesis. As a result, viral load increases and clearance rates decline (

Long-term bed rest people cannot cough as easily or as well, which allows pooled mucus to stagnate and reduces the clearance of potentially pathogenic material and irritants (
