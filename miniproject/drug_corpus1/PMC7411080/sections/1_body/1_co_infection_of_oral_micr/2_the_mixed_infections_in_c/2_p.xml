<p>During a multi-center study in Eastern China (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Ai et al., 2020</xref>), nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected for total RNA extraction, followed by multiplex PCR and mNGS analysis. According to the results, 11 of 20 co-infections were identified in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and included regular respiratory viruses, fungi and bacteria. The most common pathogens detected were 
 <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic>, 
 <italic>Candida glabrata</italic>, and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. In addition, 5 co-infection cases were found coinfected with a virus, including rhinovirus/enterovirus, H3N2, influenza B and respiratory syncytial virus, suggesting that virus co-infection were not uncommon in winter pneumonia patients. The sequencing revealed that 
 <italic>Leptotrichia buccalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Veillonella parvula</italic>, 
 <italic>Capnocytophaga gingivalis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Prevotella melaninogenica</italic> were overrepresented in the BALF of a COVID-19 patient (

 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Ren et al., 2020</xref>), nucleic acid from the BALF of 5 hospitalized patients was extracted for deep sequencing. Those results showed that apart from SARS-CoVs, some bacterial pathogens could also be detected, including 
 <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Lactococcus</italic>. 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Chen L. et al. (2020)</xref> reported that 
 <italic>Capnocytophaga</italic> and 
 <italic>Veillonella</italic> were found in the BALF of COVID-19 patients by mNGS. A recent study revealed coinfection with 
 <italic>Moraxella catarrhalis</italic> in laboratory-proven cases of SARS-CoV-2, and quantified increased bacterial burden in some patients over others (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">Peddu et al., 2020</xref>). Most of above mentioned microbiota can be found in human oral cavity (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Dewhirst et al., 2010</xref>), with the elevated level of oral commensal bacteria were found from the BALF of COVID-19 patients (
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2020</xref>), it’s worth noting the co-infection occurs between oral microbiota and SARS-CoV-2 in the patients’ lungs.
