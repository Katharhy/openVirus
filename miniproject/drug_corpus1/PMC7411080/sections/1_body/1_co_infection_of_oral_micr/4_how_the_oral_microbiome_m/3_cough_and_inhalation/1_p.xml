<p>Because the dominant bacteria in various ecological niches of the body are different, microaspiration and transcolonization can result in systemic dysbiosis and disorders. Oral microorganisms reach the lower respiratory tract primarily through these mechanisms (

 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">Man et al., 2019</xref>) showed that nasopharyngeal microecological imbalance was caused by transcolonization of oral microbiota, leading to upper respiratory tract infections. It is speculated that aspiration pneumonia is also closely related to oral microorganisms due to the aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions (
