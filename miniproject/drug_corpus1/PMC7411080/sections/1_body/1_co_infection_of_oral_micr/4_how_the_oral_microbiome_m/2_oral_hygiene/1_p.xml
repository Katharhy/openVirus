<p>An increasing number of research projects aim to assess oral health and the prevalence of pre-existing oral colonization by respiratory pathogens in the elderly, and to verify whether these factors could influence pneumonia progression. Various types of oral microorganisms can be detected from the lungs due to different risk factors. Periodontal pathogens such as 
 <italic>Treponema denticola, P. gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans</italic> and 
 <italic>Veillonella parvula</italic>, have been detected in the lungs of ICU patients (

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">de Carvalho Baptista et al., 2018</xref>). The tongue dorsum is one habitat niche of oral microbes, there the dominant microflora are 
 <italic>Prevotella</italic> and 
 <italic>Veillonella</italic>, which are associated with an increased risk of death due to pneumonia in older, frail patients (

 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Kageyama et al., 2018</xref>). Dental plaques contain pathogens which could aggravate the state of pneumonia (
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">Olsen, 2015</xref>), including 
 <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>, which can synergistically enhance pathogenicity (
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">Miller et al., 2018</xref>). Poor oral hygiene habits can lead to the accumulation of many periodontal microorganisms in the oral cavity, and oral dysbiosis can accelerate lung function decline (
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">Takeuchi et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">Winning et al., 2019</xref>), which in turn can increase the incidence of pneumonia (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Kumar, 2017</xref>). A one-year longitudinal study of 60 dependent elderly showed that the amount of respiratory pathogens colonizing the tongue and calculus, e.g., 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>H. influenzae</italic>, were high risk factors for pneumonia progression, while oral hygiene measures, such as removal of calculus and tongue biofilm, helped to reduce this (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Hong et al., 2018</xref>). In conclusion, oral hygiene measures are necessary to protect people who are vulnerable to respiratory infections.
