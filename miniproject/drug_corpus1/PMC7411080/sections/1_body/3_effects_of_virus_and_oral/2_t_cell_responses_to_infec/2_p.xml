<p>A study including 1,099 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 found that the peripheral blood lymphocyte count in severe patients was 95.5% (147/154), which was significantly higher than that of mild cases (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Guan et al., 2020b</xref>). It confirmed that the cellular immunity is closely related to the state of illness. In severe patients, CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T levels presented as low, indicating that T cell subsets can be used as one of the bases to predict the transition from mild to severe (
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">Wan et al., 2020</xref>). Based on anatomic reports (
 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">Xu Z. et al., 2020</xref>), found that both the peripheral CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T counts of the COVID-19 patients were significantly reduced, but hyperactivated. Additionally, there was an increase in highly pro-inflammatory CCR6
 <sup>+</sup> Th17 in CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells and a high concentration of cytotoxic granules in CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells. These results imply that hyperactivation of T cells, manifesting as the increase of Th17 and high cytotoxicity of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, led to the severe immune injury of the patient to some extent.
