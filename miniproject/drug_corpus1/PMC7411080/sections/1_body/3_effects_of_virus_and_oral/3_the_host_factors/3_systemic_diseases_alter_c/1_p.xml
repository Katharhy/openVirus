<p>Compared with healthy individuals, those with chronic diseases have a certain degree of microecological disorder. Here, we will review several comorbidities closely related to COVID-19 as examples to illustrate that changes in composition, quantity, and colonization sites may have potential effects on prognosis. Mounting evidence suggests that oral streptococci can be detected from the lungs of COPD patients (

 <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> detected in the subgingival plaque (

 <italic>Veillonella</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, 
 <italic>Rothia</italic> and 
 <italic>Aggregatibacter</italic> were dramatically increased in non-small cell lung cancer patients (

 <italic>Prevotella</italic>, several common oral genera (i.e., 
 <italic>Haemophilus, Neisseria</italic> and 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic>) decreased in individuals with colitis-associated cancer (

 <italic>Capnocytophaga, Porphyromonas</italic>, and
