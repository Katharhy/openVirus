<p>Just like other chronic inflammatory conditions, it is crucial to bear in mind that the elderly, though perhaps seemingly healthy, might respond differently to infectious and inflammatory factors. Apart from the increased risk of severe disease, recovery could also be slower and poor, thus increasing the possibility of recrudescence or aggravation as time passes (

 <italic>Streptococcus pneumonia (S. pneumoniae)</italic> inhabit might change, resulting in a weakening of microbiome resiliency. This is related to the result of the degeneration of the immune system or a low-grade chronic inflammation (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Krone et al., 2014</xref>). The phenomenon of decreased microbial diversity, in conjunction with the presence in the oral cavity of various groups of anaerobic commensals negatively related to the overgrowth of potential lung infection pathogens, was also observed among adults (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">de Steenhuijsen Piters et al., 2016</xref>). This not only suggest that these anaerobic commensals play an important role in the level of resilience against pathogen overgrowth and disease, but also emphasizes that the chronic inflammatory process contributes to the changes in microbiota composition, potentially making it harder to intervene.
