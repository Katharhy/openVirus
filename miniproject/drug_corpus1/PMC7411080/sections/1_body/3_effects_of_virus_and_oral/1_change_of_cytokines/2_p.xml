<p>The presence of oral microbes such as 
 <italic>Streptococcus, Prevotella</italic> and 
 <italic>Porphyromonas</italic> can not only change the microbial composition of the respiratory system, but also promote a series of cytokine responses and affect the immune homeostasis of the lungs. The levels of serum IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly increased in patients with lung dysfunction, and local inflammatory factors spread into systemic circulation (
 <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). Under certain conditions, 
 <italic>Streptococcus gordonii</italic> can attack host fibronectin, and subsequent cytokine production can induce inflammatory responses (

 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). The cell-wall-anchored protein Staphylococcal surface protein A (SspA), a key factor in regulating the host innate immunity, is an immunostimulatory component of 
 <italic>S. gordonii</italic> that promotes bacterial adhesion, and purified SspA can induce IL-6 and monocyte chemotatic protein-1 production from human lung epithelial cells (
