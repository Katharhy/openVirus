<p>Additional research has shown that 
 <italic>Porphyromonas</italic> is likely to affect the immune response as well. Animal experiments (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Benedyk et al., 2016</xref>) suggested that 
 <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> can produce Gingipain, which then affect the innate immune response and promote chronic inflammation. Pathological manifestations such as intrapulmonary hemorrhage, necrosis, and neutrophil infiltration occur after infection with 
 <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>. Lung tissue damage is associated with systemic inflammatory response, manifested by elevated levels of TNF, IL-6, IL-17, and C-reactive protein, and these pathological lesions are significantly dependent on the activity of 
 <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>. Besides colonizing the lungs themselves, DNA from oral microbes can be transmited from the gingival tissue to the pulmonary vasculature (
