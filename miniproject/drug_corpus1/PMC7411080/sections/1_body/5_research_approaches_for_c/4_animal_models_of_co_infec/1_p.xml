<p>According to the mouse construction strategies and methods, the current SARS-CoV-2 infected mouse model is divided into three types: (1) Using mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a murine coronavirus, as model virus to study its genetic and biological mechanisms in mouse (

Based on the establishment of SARS-CoV-2 single infected mouse model, a co-infection model could be explored by following inoculation of other pathogens, given the fact of viral-bacterial situation during COVID-19 pandemic (
