<p>Over the past decade, stem cell-derived, three-dimensional, self-organizing organoids have emerged as a new way to simulate respiratory diseases

 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">Williamson et al., 2018</xref>), microinjection of microorganisms into the organoid lumen can be realized to facilitate the study of host-microbial interaction in 3D structures (

 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Quantius et al., 2016</xref>), and to study the cytokine profile release when stimulated by 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2017</xref>). The most difficult obstacle to overcome at present is the complete differentiation of hPSCs cultures into specialized lung cell types, especially AEC1 cells and alveolar-like cells. Efforts are needed to explore new classes of stem cells and support cells, quantify using organoid culture, and compare them with known populations to find better seed cells.
