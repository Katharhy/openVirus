<p>Due to the short-term organoids culture time (several weeks), lung organoids can be applied to studying the pathogenesis and mechanism of viral-bacterial co-infection or making medication guidelines. And a precise diagnostic platform can be developed based on organoids (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Lamers et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, patient-derived organoids (PDO) has high predictive ability for co-infection drug candidates, and is suitable for high-throughput cultivation, and thus can be used as an effective drug screening platform (
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">Vlachogiannis et al., 2018</xref>). Take full advantage of the powerful genomic editing technology of CRISPR/Cas9, especially to study the role of specific genes in the self-renewal and differentiation of human lung stem cells and the generation of human respiratory disease models. Organoids which can be modified by various genome-editing techniques and thus different genes can be constructed to express human ACE2 protein to study the pathogenesis of co-infection in COVID-19.
