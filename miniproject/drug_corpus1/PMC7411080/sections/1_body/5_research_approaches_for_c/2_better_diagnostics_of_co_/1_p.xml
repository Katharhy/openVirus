<p>A variety of detection methods are designed to analyze the co-infection of new coronavirus and other microorganisms (
 <xref rid="B143" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) detection of viral nucleic acid is the main method of identification (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Hashemzadeh et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">Noh et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B142" ref-type="bibr">Zhang H. et al., 2019</xref>). Of course, specific primers based on known bacterial/fungal sequences can be designed to detect co-infected species and multiplex RT-PCR was applied to seven family members for differential diagnosis of 18 types of viruses and 4 types of bacteria (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2020</xref>). Digital loop-mediated DNA amplification (LAMP) based on micro-nanofluidic chip (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Gansen et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">Rems et al., 2016</xref>) can simultaneously detect several common viruses (
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">Shirato et al., 2018</xref>). By collecting deep expectoration or BALF, mNGS can identify the main pathogen SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Chen L. et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Ren et al., 2020</xref>). It has also a high clinical value for the identification of the combined or secondary bacteria, especially for Critical Care patients with sepsis, immunosuppressive host complicate with severe infection, severe pulmonary infection, etc (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">McArdle et al., 2018</xref>). Multiple studies sequenced samples of COVID-19 suspected or confirmed patients found the presence of co-infection, such as oral bacteria, fungi, viruses, etc (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Cox et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Lansbury et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">Tadolini et al., 2020</xref>), which may come from the environment or colonize the mouth. As a result, once the doctors quickly and accurately find the main and sub-pathogen. They can develop drug treatment protocols targeting the pathogens and evaluate treatment effectiveness, and adjust treatment means for severe patients as early as possible.
