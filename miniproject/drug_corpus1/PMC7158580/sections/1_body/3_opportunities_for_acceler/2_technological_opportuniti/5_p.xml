<p id="para200">Although diagnostic assays during an epidemic are most likely to be based on nucleic acids, it will be important to co-develop antibody tests. Lateral flow assays are often inexpensive and easy to distribute and administer, which can be important for point-of-care use in remote areas.

 </xref> Additionally, the evolution of more complex assays that can discriminate between the immune response to active infections or past exposure will also be important. These antibody-dependent tests can benefit from antibody discovery platforms that identify candidate reagents necessary for diagnostic platforms.
