 </xref> Ideally, these systems would be designed with prequalified reagents that are readily available for assay development. These systems require minimal customisation and can be quickly validated to develop and manufacture point-of-care diagnostics that are easy to use. Prevalidated components can also enable stockpiling of common reagents, which reduces the burden to coordinate the supply chain and distribution of multiple assay components during an emergency.
