<p id="para210">Manufacturing of medical countermeasures remains a highly specialised pursuit, for which biotechnology companies and large pharmaceutical corporations have core competencies. Cell-based manufacturing requires the use of complex optimisation combined with time-consuming iterative regulatory approval. Expanding an open access library of approved substrates could reduce the time required to develop stable cell lines and achieve better yield, capacity, and costs. Furthermore, developing universal cell substrates through genetic engineering that can serve as hosts for all viruses could simplify and accelerate this process. It is still probable that most manufacturing substrates will require time-consuming optimisation; the complexity of these processes can be addressed with modular manufacturing approaches
