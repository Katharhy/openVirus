<p id="para220">The development of small molecule therapeutics poses specific issues related to off-target toxicities and meeting the existing safety specifications. A way to overcome this challenge is to establish libraries of compounds that can be drawn on in emergency situations: these libraries might contain all known and approved compounds (including those out of production), or candidates with some toxicology data that might have not been efficacious for their original indication.
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> These compounds can progress faster through the development pipeline than a de novo lead. Several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have large compound libraries that could be indexed and used for these efforts.
