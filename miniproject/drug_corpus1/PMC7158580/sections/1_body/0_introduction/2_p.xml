<p id="para20">In this Personal View, we discuss the rapid development of medical countermeasures for Pathogen X, an infectious agent currently unknown to cause human disease, but with epidemic or pandemic potential. Although this Personal View is based on our 2018 convening, we believe that the recommendations continue to be valid. The goal of the convening was to focus the few resources in pandemic preparedness on the crucial and persistent barriers that remain across research, clinical trials, and manufacturing before and during an epidemic. We attempt to define Pathogen X and present the challenges, opportunities, and priorities in the acceleration of diagnostic, vaccine, and small molecule development in preparation for an epidemic. Also, we present coordination guides that have been shown to be successful in planning and prioritising development activities. We hope that this content will enable funders, academia, and product developers (ie, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies) to better navigate the epidemic medical countermeasure space. The content should also support stakeholders in coordinating and engaging with developers of medical countermeasures, regulators, and government officials. Additionally, we recognise that accelerated manufacturing platforms and regulatory procedures are key drivers of epidemic medical countermeasure development, and they will be covered in future publications elsewhere.</p>
