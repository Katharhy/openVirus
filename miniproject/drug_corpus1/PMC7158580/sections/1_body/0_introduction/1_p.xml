<p id="para10">The 2014â€“16 Ebola epidemic had mostly waned before successful medical countermeasures were deployed.

 </xref> Arguably, many lives could have been saved if these countermeasures had arrived sooner. In 2016, WHO's Research and Development Blueprint was launched to decrease the time for development, assessment, and authorisation of medical countermeasures for the world's most dangerous pathogens. Although this effort has provided unprecedented coordination, past epidemics have revealed many scientific and technical issues that remain unresolved. The rapid development of diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics in the wake of an epidemic involves a complex and interdependent stakeholder ecosystem: these stakeholders might have different priorities, interests, and activities resulting in misaligned goals and delays. Additionally, uncertainty remains as to who will pay the costs, offset the risk, and accelerate research, clinical trials, and product development for medical countermeasures. The global community has an opportunity to align and coordinate these efforts across stakeholder groups.
