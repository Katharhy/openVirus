<p id="para290">We additionally provide a catalogue of these decisions (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref> ) along with key considerations for each of the decisions. Together with an iTPP, these decisions can guide medical countermeasure product development. During a pandemic, rapid and effective decision making is of upmost importance. However, decisions made early in the medical countermeasure development process can result in downstream ramifications that can slow down development or even require restarting at an earlier development stage. By laying out the decisions and choices up front, unintended consequences can become evident earlier and medical countermeasure developers can potentially avoid non-productive pathways. Although this example is not exhaustive, it represents a sample of some of the essential decisions that are related to an instance of medical countermeasure development.
