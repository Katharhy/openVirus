<p id="para130">One of the most important barriers to the development of diagnostics is the paucity of serum and blood samples available to validate clinical assays. Challenges to the availability of such samples include logistical difficulties in storing and transporting biohazardous samples from remote areas, obtaining sufficient informed consent from patients, and political complications from countries that refuse to transit or accept hazardous specimens.
