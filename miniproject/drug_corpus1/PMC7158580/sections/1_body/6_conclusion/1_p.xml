<p id="para310">Our intent for this Personal View is to provide a high-level overview of opportunities that can shorten the time to development of medical countermeasures, discussing technological, process, planning, and coordination activities that could be beneficial. We have taken a somewhat unorthodox approach: although we believe that Pathogen X is likely to be a highly virulent RNA virus, we discuss only the aspects of product development that are largely conserved across pathogens. We believe that these high-impact, pathogen-agnostic, and low-risk opportunities enable the best near-term preparedness for Disease X. We also advocate for the use of iTPPs that outline the full characteristics required for developing de novo medical countermeasures. We described an array of variables that could be considered up front: early consideration might avoid unintended delays and unproductive avenues. This content can be used by global academic and product development partners to accelerate the provision of medical countermeasures during an outbreak.</p>
