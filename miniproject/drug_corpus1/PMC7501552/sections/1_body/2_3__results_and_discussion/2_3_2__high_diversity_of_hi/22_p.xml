<p>Additional sequencing and analysis of 
 <italic>gag</italic> gene for HIV-1 URFA/B made it possible to conclude that those virus variants differed from previously described HIV-1 CRF03_AB [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] since, unlike CRF03_AB viruses, they have an additional insertion of subtype B sequence similar to HIV-1 subtype A 
 <italic>gag</italic> region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). All HIV-1 URFA/B demonstrate a similar structure of 
 <italic>gag-pol</italic> region (PR-RT) but differ in IN and 
 <italic>env</italic> sequences: phylogenetic analysis showed that 6 of 7 samples grouped with HIV-1 subtype A (A6) by corresponding genome regions, while Krasnoyarsk 100 sample belonged to URF63/A according to the IN region structure (nucleotide sequence is partly identical to СRF63_02А1 sequence and partly to A6 subtype), and phylogenetic analysis of 
 <italic>env</italic> region of Krasnoyarsk 100 showed that it belongs to HIV-1 CRF63_02A1 phylogenetic cluster (Figures
