<p>In most cases, PR-RT regions of HIV-1 URF63/А demonstrated the mosaic structure of genome with significantly differed length and location of interchanged regions identical with HIV-1 subtype A6 and CRF63_02A1 sequences. These data indicate that the origin of HIV-1 URF63/А genetic variants is the result of separate recombination events (
