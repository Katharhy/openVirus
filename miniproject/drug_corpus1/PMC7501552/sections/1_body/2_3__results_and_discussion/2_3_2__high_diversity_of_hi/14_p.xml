<p>In some cases, we observed a combination of HIV-1 URF63/A in separate subbranches with a high bootstrap, for instance, HIV-1 samples Krasnoyarsk 54 and 56. However, the recombination analysis of HIV variants in the PR-RT region showed differences in the recombination model, and in the phylogenetic analysis carried out for the virus IN region HIV-1, Krasnoyarsk 54 grouped with HIV-1 CRF63_02A1, and Krasnoyarsk 56 grouped with viruses of subtype A6 (Figures
