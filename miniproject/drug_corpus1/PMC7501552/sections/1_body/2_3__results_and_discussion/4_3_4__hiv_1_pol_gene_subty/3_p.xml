<p>Mutation V77I in protease common for HIV-1 subtype A in a number of Russian regions was detected only among HIV-1 subtype A in 60.8%. Substitution A62V is specific for reverse transcriptase of HIV subtype A, in the countries of the former Soviet Union. In the studied sample, A62V was registered in 69.1% of HIV subtype A [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In 100% of studied sequences of reverse transcriptase CRF63_02A1, V60I and D121Y polymorphisms were found that were not associated with the resistance and did not occur among viruses of subtype A.
