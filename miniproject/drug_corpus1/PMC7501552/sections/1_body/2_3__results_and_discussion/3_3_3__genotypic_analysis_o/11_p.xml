<p>We analyzed primary or transmitted HIV-1 drug resistance for 122 ARVT-na√Øve patients. In this sample of patients, we detected mutations resulting in the development of different-level HIV-1 resistance in 8.2% (10/122) (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Transmitted drug resistance was detected in 4 patients infected via HS and 6 PWID patients. As for the virus protease inhibitors, in one case, mutation L76V (0.8%) was found to belong to main PI-resistance mutations. L76V is a nonpolymorphic mutation, which reduces sensitivity to PIs and FPV and NFV; it increases sensitivity to ATV, SQV, and TPV. In the other case, we detected relatively nonpolymorphic mutation M46I. M46I in combination with other PI resistance mutations is associated with reduced sensitivity to each of the PIs except for DRV. Among mutations associated with the resistance to NNRTIs, there were mutations causing significant HIV sensitivity reduction to the following drugs: K103N causing high-level resistance to NVP and EFV (3/122, 2.5%); K101E (1/122, 0.8%) associated with intermediate resistance to NVP and RPV and low-level resistance to EFV and ETR; M230L (0.8%) causing intermediate to high-level resistance to each of the NNRTIs; and V108I (1.6%) resulting in low-level resistance to NVP and potentially low-level resistance to EFV. K103N was found in three women infected via HS with HIV detected from July to November 2017.
