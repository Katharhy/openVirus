<p>In the case of one PWID man with HIV detected in 2016, Major Resistance Mutation associated with the resistance to INSTI (integrase strand transfer inhibitors) E138K (1/122, 0.8%) was found. Alone it does not reduce INSTI sensitivity. When E138K occurs in combination with Q148 mutations, they are associated with high-level resistance to RAL and EVG and moderate reductions in DTG and BIC sensitivity.</p>
