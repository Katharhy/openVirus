<p>Women accounted for 47.2% (75/159) with median value of age 35.5 years (range, 21–58); 58.7% (44/75) of them were infected via HS, 13.3% (10/75) via HS with PWID, one woman (1.3%) was infected via homosexual contacts with PWID, 18.7% (14/75) were PWID themselves, and in 8.0% the infection route was not determined. Men accounted for 52.8% (84/159) with the median value of age 38 years (range, 21–51); 27.4% (23/84) were infected via HS and 72.6% (61/84) were PWID. Because of the high stigma in the society, the analyzed sample virtually lacks males with homosexual contacts. Usually, when HIV infection is detected in males with homosexual contacts, they prefer to report the possibility of having been infected with HIV via heterosexual contact. Therefore, the majority of HIV-infected males with homosexual contacts were included in the group of people infected via heterosexual contacts. The date of the last negative and the first positive HIV test of the studied patients was used to estimate a potential period of infection: in case of 63.5% (101/159) the potential period of infection varied from 2015 to 2017, for 25.8% (41/159) from 2009 to 2014, and for 10.7% (17/159) from 1999 to 2008 (
