<p>High HIV-1 prevalence among Krasnoyarsk Krai population and parallel circulation of the different genetic variants of the virus in certain territories and among risk groups facilitate HIV-1 reinfection including reinfection with genetically different viruses. These conditions are necessary and sufficient for the increase in the frequency of sporadic recombinant events occurrence in the virus genome allowing for HIV-1 rapid evolution. It was shown that random shuffling of HIV genetic material not only increases viral diversity but also enables the virus to evade the response of the human immune system [
