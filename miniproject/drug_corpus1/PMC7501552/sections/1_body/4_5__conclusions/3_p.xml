<p>The uniqueness of the situation (detection of URF HIV-1 in 38.6% of HIV diagnosed people from Krasnoyarsk Krai in 2015–2017) also lies in the fact that monitoring for HIV, in this case, allows for observing the selection process of new viable viruses from a variety of recombinant forms of HIV that occur in the human body. Our studies of HIV-1 isolated from recently infected individuals in Siberian regions carried out in 2015–2018, including this study, for the first time demonstrated the uniquely high contribution of the virus recombinant variability to the increase in heterogeneity of HIV-1 circulating in Russia. This situation is an adverse factor of epidemic development and requires special attention in order to achieve the stabilization of molecular epidemiologic processes in the region.</p>
