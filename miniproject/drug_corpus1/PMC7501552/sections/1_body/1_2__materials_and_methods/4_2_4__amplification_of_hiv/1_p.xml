<p>Viral RNAs were extracted from 250 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of plasma with RealBest DeltaMag kit (Vector-Best, Russia) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The RNA was utilized for reverse transcription PCR and nested PCR. Amplification was performed using a lyophilized ready-to-use Reverse Transcription Master Mix containing all the components for a single-tube reverse transcription and PCR (Vector-Best, Russia) and an in-house set of primers as described previously [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This procedure generates an amplicon of the 
 <italic>pol</italic> gene encoding the protease-reverse transcriptase (PR-RT, 1400 nt), integrase (IN, 960 nt), and a fragment encoding a part of the major envelope protein, 
 <italic>env</italic> (732 nt). For several HIV-1 samples, 
 <italic>gag</italic> (1457 nt) fragment was additionally obtained. After purification, PCR fragments were sequenced by ABI PRISM 3130xl DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, United States).
