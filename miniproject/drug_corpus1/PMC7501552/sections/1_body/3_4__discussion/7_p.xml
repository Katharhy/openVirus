<p>New HIV-1 URFA/B was isolated in 7 cases. In 5 URFA/B cases, we detected a high level of identity for all studied virus regions. One more HIV from that group was identical to 5 HIV-1 URFA/B in 
 <italic>gag-pol</italic> region but was genotyped as URF63/A virus by IN region and was clustered with HIV-1 CRF63_02A1 (Krasnoyarsk 100) in 
 <italic>env</italic> region analysis, which seem to point to the likelihood of the patient reinfection and, consequently, the second recombination between HIV-1 URFA/B and CRF63_02A1 viruses.
