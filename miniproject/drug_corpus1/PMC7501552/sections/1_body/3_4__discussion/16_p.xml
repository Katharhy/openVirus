<p>When carrying out recombinant analysis, we also encountered some difficulties. In some cases, recombinant analysis of several deduced HIV-1 sequences was not possible due to insufficient availability of publicly accessible close homologous sequences which are necessary for the analysis. To carry out HIV-1 URF recombinant analysis using SimPlot software, in each case, we preliminary performed search for viral sequences with the most close genetic identity to the analyzed HIV sequences from GenBank (using HIV BLAST software (

Additionally, we carried out the comparable procedure of searching for the most genetically close sequences for each HIV-1 URF recombinant segment without recombination joint; however, in some cases no genetically close sequences were found.
