<p>Recombination analysis was complicated by the fact that, in Krasnoyarsk Krai, multiple HIV-1 transmissions from other regions are believed to take place including transmission of CRF63_02A1 and possibly URF63/A. As described previously [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], the considerably heterogeneous HIV-1 CRF63_02A1 and URF63/A population is currently distributed in SFD. An absence of genetically close HIV-1 to be used for comparison (references) does not allow for performing reliable determination of recombinant HIV-1 origin in some cases.
