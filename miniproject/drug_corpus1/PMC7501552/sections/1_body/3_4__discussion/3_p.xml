<p>A random sample of 159 patients involved in our study includes Krasnoyarsk Krai individuals infected in 1999–2017. Distribution of people included in the sample and living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) by gender, age, and infection routes corresponded to current epidemic characteristics. Data on previous negative HIV testing for most of PLHIV allowed the distribution of those patients according to possible infection periods. A group of people infected in 2015–2017 included 101 individuals. Since 2012, an increase in circulating HIV-1 heterogeneity has been registered in Krasnoyarsk Krai both due to the new HIV-1 CRF63_02A1 emergence and distribution in that region and due to the emergence of new unique recombinant HIV-1 forms (
