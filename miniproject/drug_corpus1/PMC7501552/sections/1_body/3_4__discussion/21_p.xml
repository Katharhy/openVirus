<p>The analysis of the resistant HIV-1 transmission in Krasnoyarsk Krai revealed infection with HIV-1 carrying mutations associated with the development of the virus resistance to PI, NRTI, and NNRTI in 8.2% of studied cases. Described HIV-1 mutations and the degree of their incidence and analysis of HIV-1 tropism correspond well with data obtained by other researchers for other Russian regions [

 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Most frequently detected was substitution K103N (3/10), which is DR-mutation to NNRTI. This mutation is the most widespread among HIV-infected Russian patients undergoing ARVT since the first generation NNRTIs were the most commonly prescribed drugs for a long time and they have the lowest genetic barrier for resistance development [
