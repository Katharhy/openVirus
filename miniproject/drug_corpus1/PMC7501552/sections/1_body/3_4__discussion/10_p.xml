<p>As HIV-1 heterogeneity in Krasnoyarsk Krai has begun to significantly increase since 2012, we carried out additional analysis of HIV-1 genetic variants registered in 2012–2017 among people practicing risk behavior (HS and PWID). 
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table"> Table 4</xref> demonstrates that among people infected via HS, an infection with СRF63_02A1 is registered more frequently, while a share of HIV-1 URF63/A in PWID is higher almost by 10% as compared to the HS group.
