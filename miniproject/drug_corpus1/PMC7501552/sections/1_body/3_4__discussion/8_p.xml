<p>HIV-1 URFA/B viruses were isolated in PWID (3), PWID sexual partners (1), and individuals infected via HS (3) living in the city of Krasnoyarsk and other cities of Krasnoyarsk Krai. Considerably restricted (as compared to CRF63_02A1) distribution of this genetic variant suggests that the detected HIV-1 URFA/B, which was first discovered in this study, originated in PWID/or was transmitted by PWID and has been distributed among closed PWID group and their sexual partners.</p>
