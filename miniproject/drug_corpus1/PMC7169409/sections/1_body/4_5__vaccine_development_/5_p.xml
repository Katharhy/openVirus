<p>HMPV vaccines have rarely progressed to clinical studies, although a live-attenuated vaccine was once tested in adults [
 <xref rid="B66-pathogens-09-00109" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. For any new vaccine program, there are numerous steps required to advance from vaccine concept to clinical application. Steps typically include, but are not limited to: (i) vaccine design, (ii) pre-clinical vaccine testing for immunogenicity and efficacy in small and/or large animal models, (iii) preparation of pilot vaccine lots, (iv) stability testing, (v) toxicology testing, (vi) application to institutional and government regulatory boards for approval of vaccines produced with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and associated clinical protocols, (vii) clinical testing of vaccines (phases I, II, III) with regulatory oversight, (viii) license application and approval, (ix) vaccine distribution to the target population using appropriate transport and storage conditions, (x) public acceptance and vaccine use, and (xi) continued vaccine monitoring for safety and efficacy. Lagging development of HMPV vaccines may be due, at least in part, to prioritization of other respiratory virus vaccine programs (e.g., influenza virus, RSV, coronavirus).
