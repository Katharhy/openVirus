<p>The threat of HMPV infection and disease continues unabated, perhaps because it is not fully recognized. When a respiratory viral infection occurs, it is often assumed to be due to an influenza virus infection and termed ‘flu’. Diagnostics may be available to score influenza virus and possibly RSV, but not HMPV. New multiplex assays that include HMPV are cost prohibitive in many hospitals. Therefore, diseases caused by HMPV will go undiagnosed and unreported. Here, we recommend that efforts be increased in the HMPV field to: 
 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p>Advance research efforts to reveal mechanisms by which virus induces a host immune response.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Improve surveillance to measure the burden of HMPV disease.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Improve HMPV awareness among clinicians and patients.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Develop a low-cost diagnostic assay for HMPV.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Develop new drugs and treatment options for HMPV.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Advance HMPV vaccines through clinical trials and licensure.</p>
