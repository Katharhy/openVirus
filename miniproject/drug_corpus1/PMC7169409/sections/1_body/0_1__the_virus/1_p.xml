<p>Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a negative-strand RNA virus that replicates in the cytoplasm [
 <xref rid="B1-pathogens-09-00109" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. HMPV and avian metapneumovirus (AMPV), the closest known relative of HMPV, are members of the genus 
 <italic>Metapneumovirus</italic> and the family 
 <italic>Pneumoviridae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B2-pathogens-09-00109" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. HMPV shares many features with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) of the genus 
 <italic>Orthopneumovirus</italic> and family 
 <italic>Pneumoviridae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B3-pathogens-09-00109" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The HMPV genome is approximately 13,000 nucleotides in length. HMPV virions contain a ribonucleocapsid core consisting of viral RNA (vRNA), nucleocapsid (N) protein, polymerase (L) protein, phosphoprotein (P), and M2-1 protein [
 <xref rid="B4-pathogens-09-00109" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The matrix (M) protein lines the inner face of the virion envelope. Envelope spikes projecting from the virus include a small hydrophobic (SH) protein and the attachment (G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins. An M2-2 protein regulates RNA synthesis and supports virus growth in a hamster model [
 <xref rid="B5-pathogens-09-00109" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. HMPV exists as filaments and spherical particles with diameters that range from 150 to 600 nm [
 <xref rid="B1-pathogens-09-00109" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It appears morphologically similar to RSV and to members of the family 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic>. In fact, HMPV and RSV were previously classified as members of the 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> family; listings were recently changed by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) [
