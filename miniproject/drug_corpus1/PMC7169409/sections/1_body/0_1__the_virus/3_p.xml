<p>The ORF of F encodes a 539 residue glycoprotein that shares 33%–38% amino acid identity with other pneumovirus F proteins and 10%–18% identity with paramyxovirus F proteins [
 <xref rid="B4-pathogens-09-00109" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. As is the case for other pneumoviruses and paramyxoviruses, the F protein is synthesized as an F0 precursor protein that is subsequently cleaved into fusion-capable F1 and F2 subunits that form a large, trimeric, mushroom-like extracellular head in addition to C-terminal transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic tail regions. High-resolution structures have been obtained for the HMPV F protein ectodomain in both prefusion and postfusion forms [
 <xref rid="B9-pathogens-09-00109" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-pathogens-09-00109" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These structures share many structural features common to prefusion and postfusion forms of the F proteins from RSV and paramyxoviruses [
 <xref rid="B11-pathogens-09-00109" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-pathogens-09-00109" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-pathogens-09-00109" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-pathogens-09-00109" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. After receptor binding, the F protein undergoes a dramatic change in structure that causes membrane fusion to allow virus entry. Most strains of HMPV catalyze membrane fusion at neutral pH [
 <xref rid="B15-pathogens-09-00109" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] while others are triggered by low pH in endosomes [
 <xref rid="B16-pathogens-09-00109" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-pathogens-09-00109" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In addition to membrane fusion, the F protein can also facilitate receptor binding through an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif that binds integrins [
