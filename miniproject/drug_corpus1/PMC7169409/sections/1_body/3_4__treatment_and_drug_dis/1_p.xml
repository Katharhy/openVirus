<p>There are no standard treatments for HMPV except supportive care. Ribavirin, a nucleoside analogue, has exhibited anti-HMPV activity in laboratory studies, but its use in clinical studies has yielded conflicting results [

 <xref rid="B47-pathogens-09-00109" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The efficacy, route of administration, and dosing of ribavirin for treatments of respiratory infections have been topics of continuous debate [
 <xref rid="B48-pathogens-09-00109" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Other therapies are being developed to block HMPV fusion. For example, the peptide HRA2 (derived from a heptad repeat domain of the HMPV F protein) was shown to significantly reduce viral loads in animal studies [

 <xref rid="B51-pathogens-09-00109" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) or HMPV-specific monoclonal antibodies could potentially be used to neutralize HMPV [
 <xref rid="B52-pathogens-09-00109" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], but their benefits as treatment options for HMPV disease have not been proven. For RSV, virus-specific antibodies have been successful as prophylaxes (particularly for vulnerable children including premature infants and infants with heart/lung disease), but not as treatment [

 <xref rid="B55-pathogens-09-00109" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. To increase the number of treatment options, methods are now being developed to expedite the screening of anti-HMPV drug candidates [
 <xref rid="B56-pathogens-09-00109" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Ongoing studies of HMPV protein structure/function will also assist future drug and vaccine development [
