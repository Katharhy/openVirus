<p id="p0080">In most pharmaceutical sponsored clinical trials, a common practice is to validate each entry in the case report form through onsite visits by a research associate from the sponsor or a contract organization. In settings where onsite clinical staff are extremely busy caring for critically ill patients with COVID-19 disease, they cannot afford to spend additional time with external data auditors. Furthermore, with COVID-19 social distancing and “stay at home” sheltering in place in these settings, such onsite visits often are not feasible or recommended. The electronic data capture software can perform some level of data checking and validation by applying basic statistical quality and consistency checks.</p>
