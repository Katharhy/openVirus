<p id="p0070">One immediate challenge is the speed of recruitment. Trials such as RECOVERY [

 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] have recruited thousands of patients within a few weeks as the pandemic spreads throughout the world. This means that DMCs need to meet with much greater frequency than the usual 2â€“3 meetings per year. In fact, they may need to meet every few weeks as data accumulate at an astounding rate, as in RECOVERY for example. Owing to the need for pandemic sheltering, in-person DMC meetings are not a realistic option. Communication software such as Zoom [
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], Blue Jeans [
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], or Webex [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], increasingly used in recent years, are now standard when conducting DMC meetings for COVID-19 trials. Many of these software platforms allow members to see each other on their laptop or computer screen, and to observe a presentation of data reports including tables and graphs. This allows DMC members to participate effectively in meetings while implementing social-distancing practices. Although this approach to holding DMC meetings appears to be working well, given the risk for security breaches created by external hackers, effective procedures must be in place in COVID-19 trials to protect the confidentiality of interim data and the DMC review process.
