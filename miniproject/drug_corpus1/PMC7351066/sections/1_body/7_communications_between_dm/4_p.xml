<p id="p0105">The value of sharing safety information between DMCs monitoring concurrently conducted related trials is clearly illustrated by the experience in the CPCRA #007 trial [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In that blinded trial comparing an AZT-alone control arm with two experimental arms, one with the addition of ddI and other with the addition of ddC, patients were randomized in an unblinded manner in equal portions to the “ddI side” vs. the “ddC side”, and then participants on each side were randomized in a blinded manner where two-thirds received the active experimental drug (i.e., ddI or ddC) and one-third received the placebo for that drug (1: see Example 5.10). At an interim analysis, the DMC noted 17 deaths in patients receiving ddI placebo vs. 2 deaths in the equal number of patients receiving ddC placebo. It was recognized this difference could be due to chance given the level of multiplicity associated with such exploratory analyses. Nevertheless, there still were substantive safety concerns about continuing a placebo that might be harmful. Fortunately, a nearly identically designed trial was being concurrently conducted in Europe, called the DELTA trial [
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Without revealing the reasons for their request, the CPCRA #007 DMC sought permission from the study sponsors for the CPCRA #007 and DELTA trials to be able to share their DMC closed reports. Fortunately, that permission was granted. The DELTA trial revealed that there was not a similar imbalance in deaths between the placebo groups. That invaluable insight enabled the CPCRA #007 DMC to recommend continuation of the trial as designed, rather than recommending an alteration of trial conduct that would have meaningfully jeopardized the interpretation of this trial and others using the ddI placebo. The final results from CPCRA #007 revealed that the mortality differences between the two placebo arms were small and fully consistent with chance.
