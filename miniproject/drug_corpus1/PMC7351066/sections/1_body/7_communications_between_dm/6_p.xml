<p id="p0115">In the AIDS epidemic, the ACTG and CPCRA DMC monitored a portfolio of concurrently conducted clinical trials, often conducted in closely related settings. That approach, rather than having a series of separate DMCs in place for each trial, has been used for decades [

These advances also have benefitted DMC process in broad settings, including in trials conducted during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. In turn, as we continue pursuit of evidence-based medicine during this pandemic, while being guided by DMC best practices [
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], we also should pursue insightful innovations when we are confronted with novel challenges. Efforts should be made to enable the conduct of properly powered trials that would provide timely and reliable answers to clinical questions of greatest clinical interest, such as whether interventions reduce the risks of death or major organ failure in hospitalized patients, and where DMCs monitoring these definitive trials would have insights about efficacy and safety during trial conduct to effectively address their monitoring responsibilities. To achieve this requires prospective efforts to increase collaborations on the international level between clinical trialists. The phrase currently being stated for the COVID-19 pandemic, “we are all in this together”, is a motivation for greater cooperation across the COVID-19 clinical trial enterprise than ever before so the treatment and prevention strategies can be evaluated as rapidly and reliably as possible.
