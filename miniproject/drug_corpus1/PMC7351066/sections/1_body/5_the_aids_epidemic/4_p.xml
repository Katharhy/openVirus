<p id="p0060">At the beginning of the meeting for each trial, a closed session was held to enable DMC members to discuss privately key elements of the emerging data and share concerns that had been identified from their review of each study's closed DMC report containing data by intervention groups for the key outcomes for benefit and safety. The concept of an open session following the initial closed session was created to allow the DMC to discuss nonconfidential data regarding quality of trial conduct issues with the sponsor and lead investigators. In these open sessions, the DMC could seek clarifications in a manner that did not unblind emerging evidence about treatment effects on efficacy or safety measures. In turn, the trial leaders and sponsors could raise issues with the DMC about which they had concerns. After this exchange in the open session, the DMC returned to a second closed session where the review of confidential information was completed, the insights from the open session were discussed, and the DMC then formulated its recommendations to the sponsor regarding trial continuation and approaches to enhance quality of trial conduct. The DMC meeting for each trial was completed with a debriefing session where the recommendations of the DMC were presented to the trial leaders and sponsors. These refinements for the format for DMC meetings are now part of DMC best practices [
