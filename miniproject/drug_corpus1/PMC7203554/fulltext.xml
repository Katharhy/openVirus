A complete understanding of the virus pathogenesis and host factors involved in the viral lifecycle is crucial for developing novel therapeutic approaches. Sphingomyelin (SM) is the most abundant membrane sphingolipid. It preferentially associates with cholesterol to form distinct domains named lipid rafts. Sphingomyelinases, including acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase), catalyzes the hydrolysis of membrane SM and consequently transform lipid rafts into ceramide-enriched membrane platforms. In this study, we investigated the effect of SM hydrolysis on IAV propagation. Depleting plasma membrane SM by exogenous bacterial SMase (bSMase) impaired virus infection and reduced virus entry, whereas exogenous SM enhanced infection. Moreover, the depletion of virus envelope SM also reduced virus infectivity and impaired its attachment and internalization. Nonetheless, inhibition of ASMase by desipramine did not affect IAV infection. Similarly, virus replication was not impaired in Niemann-Pick disease type A (NPA) cells, which lack functional ASMase. IAV infection in A549 cells was associated with suppression of ASMase activity starting at 6 h post-infection. Our data reveals that intact cellular and viral envelope SM is required for efficient IAV infection. Therefore, SM metabolism can be a potential target for therapeutic intervention against influenza virus infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>influenza virus</kwd><kwd>lipid rafts</kwd><kwd>sphingomyelin</kwd><kwd>acid sphingomyelinase</kwd><kwd>viral envelope</kwd><kwd>plasma membrane</kwd><kwd>bacterial sphingomyelinase</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">American University of Beirut<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100007688</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="60"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Influenza is considered a major public health concern due to the significant morbidity and mortality associated with the disease (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Recent studies showed that respiratory infections-associated with seasonal influenza viruses are responsible for 290,000 to 650,000 deaths per year (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Influenza viruses are negative-sense, single-stranded, segmented RNA viruses that belong to the <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family. The virus is made up of a viral envelope, a matrix layer, and a central core with 8 RNA segments that encode for at least 11 functionally important proteins required during the virus replication cycle (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Klumpp et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Coloma et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Zheng and Tao, 2013</xref>).</p><p>During its infectious cycle, influenza A virus (IAV) has to cross the plasma membrane during entry and budding from host cells. Therefore, the membrane properties and integrity are important determinants of efficient infection. IAV has been shown to selectively bind to host membrane lipid rafts (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Eierhoff et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Verma et al., 2018</xref>). These specialized membrane microdomains are formed from the preferential association of cholesterol with sphingolipids (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, sphingolipids have been implicated during different aspects of the viral life cycles including attachment (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Puri et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Rawat et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Grassme, 2005</xref>), entry (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Nieva et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Miller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Shivanna et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Drake et al., 2017</xref>), replication (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Weng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Mart&#x000ed;n-Acebes et al., 2016</xref>) and budding (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Nguyen and Hildreth, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Ono and Freed, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Tafesse et al., 2013</xref>). As such, they are considered a promising therapeutic target against viral infections (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Yager and Konan, 2019</xref>). Several studies have demonstrated a pivotal role for sphingolipids in regulating IAV life cycle. Sphingosine-1-phosphate- (S1P) metabolizing enzymes have been shown to modulate influenza infection <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Seo et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Xia et al., 2018</xref>). Sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) enhances viral replication through regulating viral RNA synthesis and export of nuclear viral ribonucleoprotein complex (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Seo et al., 2013</xref>). Glucosylceramidase is critical during infection by controlling the successful trafficking of influenza virus to the late endosome and its subsequent fusion and entry (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Drews et al., 2019</xref>). We have previously demonstrated that <italic>de novo</italic> ceramide plays a protective antiviral role against IAV infection (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Soudani et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, exogenous short-chained ceramide enhances the maturation and activation of dendritic cells in response to IAV infection, thus blocking its replication (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Pritzl et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, the sphingolipid biosynthesis is a promising host target for developing novel therapeutic approaches against influenza infection.</p><p>Sphingomyelin (SM) is the most abundant membrane sphingolipid. It is predominantly found in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, endomembranes, as well as in the intracellular organelles (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Slotte, 2013</xref>). Depletion of host membrane cholesterol using Methyl-&#x003b2;-Cyclodextrin (M&#x003b2;CD) reduced IAV binding and internalization (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Eierhoff et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Verma et al., 2018</xref>). However, M&#x003b2;CD also depletes SM, whose effect on IAV binding and internalization has been overlooked. The level of cellular SM is primarily regulated by sphingomyelinases (SMases), which catalyze its hydrolysis back into ceramide and phosphorylcholine (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Go&#x000f1;i and Alonso, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Hannun and Obeid, 2018</xref>). SMases are classified based on their pH optimum into acid (ASMase), neutral (NSMase), and alkaline (AlkSMase) sphingomyelinases (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Go&#x000f1;i and Alonso, 2002</xref>). Among these, the lysosomal ASMase is the best characterized and is mainly responsible for membrane SM turnover (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Go&#x000f1;i and Alonso, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Hannun and Obeid, 2018</xref>). Lysosomal ASMase is translocated to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane by exocytosis, where it catalyzes the hydrolysis of membrane SM and leads to the formation of ceramide-enriched membrane platforms (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Hannun and Obeid, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Sphingomyelin and/or ASMase were shown to affect the infectivity of several viruses. SM and its hydrolyzing enzyme ASMase were implicated during Ebola virus infection (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Miller et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, alphaherpesviruses were shown to exhibit a variable requirement for SM and ASMase during entry into host cells (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Pastenkos et al., 2018</xref>). Japanese encephalitis virus attachment and entry into target cells was shown to be dependent on SM synthase 1-generated SM (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Taniguchi et al., 2016</xref>). It was also reported that alphaviruses require membrane sphingolipids, specifically SM, as a cofactor for virus fusion (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Nieva et al., 1994</xref>). Moreover, Rubella virus was shown to directly bind to SM and cholesterol/SM-enriched microdomains (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Otsuki et al., 2018</xref>). Lipidomic analyses have shown an increase in the SM content of IAV-infected cells (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Tanner et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, it was also demonstrated that the SM biosynthetic pathway is important for the transport of influenza virus glycoproteins to lipid rafts located at the apical surface of the plasma membrane (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Tafesse et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigated the role of SM and it hydrolyzing ASMase and its substrate SM in IAV infection. We found that genetic deficiency or pharmacological inhibition of ASMase does not prevent IAV infection. However, IAV infection was attenuated by the depletion of membrane SM and enhanced upon treatment with exogenous SM. SM depletion of the plasma membrane or the viral envelope impaired IAV attachment and internalization. These results demonstrate that IAV does not require ASMase activity for infection and that intact SM in both cell membrane and viral envelope is essential for efficient IAV entry.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2.SS1"><title>Cells and Viruses</title><p>Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) were obtained from Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resources Repository (BEI Resources), human alveolar lung carcinoma (A549) were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, United States), healthy primary human fibroblasts (GM00038) and Niemann-Pick disease type A (NPA) fibroblasts (GM00112 and GM13205) were from Coriell Cell Repository (Camden, NJ, United States).

However, the role of SM, a major sphingolipid component of the cell plasma membrane and endomembranes, during IAV infection, has not been fully explored. In this study, we demonstrated that efficient IAV infection is dependent on intact SM in the plasma membrane of the host cell and the viral envelope, specifically at the virus entry step, while ASMase activity seems to be dispensable.</p><p>To directly test for the requirement of intact membrane SM during IAV infection, we treated cells with exogenous bSMase before infection to deplete membrane SM. Exogenously applied bSMase, specifically hydrolyzes membrane SM into ceramide in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 1997</xref>). Depletion of SM within lipid rafts by bSMase was shown to impair multiplication of viruses that require SM during infection such as Ebola virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Rubella virus, and porcine alphaherpesvirus (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Miller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Taniguchi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Otsuki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Pastenkos et al., 2018</xref>). In line with these studies, we demonstrated that depleting plasma membrane SM by bSMase suppresses IAV infection. The reduction of virus replication upon bSMase treatment was observed both for laboratory H1N1 strain (PR8) and an H1N1pdm09 virus (Cal07), indicating that the effect of SM depletion is not strain-specific. Exogenous bSMase specifically hydrolyzes SM without affecting cholesterol levels within lipid rafts (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Mizuno et al., 2011</xref>), which confirms that the reduction of IAV observed in bSMase-treated cells is explicitly attributed to the loss of SM. In our study, treatment with exogenous SM was found to enhance IAV replication. The modest enhancement of virus infection may be due to the already SM-saturated cellular membrane in A549 cells, as revealed by the lipidomic and sphingolipidomic analysis of A549 cells (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). This might explain the moderate increase in virus yield observed after SM treatment. Collectively, these results provide strong evidence for the requirement of SM during IAV infection.</p><p>Although lipid rafts were strongly associated with the assembly and budding of IAV, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Eierhoff et al. (2010)</xref> showed that disruption of lipid rafts by M&#x003b2;CD impaired IAV internalization. In addition, lipid rafts are selected by IAV for binding and endocytosis into the host cells (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Verma et al., 2018</xref>). It was previously demonstrated that HA-mediated fusion of influenza virus depends on the lipid composition of the host membrane (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Chernomordik et al., 1997</xref>). In our experiments, cells were only treated with bSMase prior to IAV infection, and SM turnover from intracellular stores is rapid (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Slotte et al., 1990</xref>). Thus, it is expected that SM is replenished by the time of virus budding. This indicates that, in addition to the previously reported role of intact SM pathway during IAV assembly and budding (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Tafesse et al., 2013</xref>), SM is required during the early stages of IAV life cycle. Notably, the decrease in virus entry was partial, most likely due to the multiple internalization mechanisms utilized by IAV that may or may not involve lipid rafts such as clathrin-dependent endocytosis (CDE), clathrin independent endocytosis (CIE), caveolin independent endocytosis, macropinocytosis, and raft dependent endocytosis (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Edinger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Verma et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Since some viruses that utilize lipid rafts during infection show a requirement for ASMase during infection (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Steinhart et al., 1984</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Grassme, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Miller et al., 2012</xref>), we assessed the association between IAV infection and endogenous ASMase. We examined the effect of pharmacological ASMase-inhibition and ASMase-genetic deficiency on IAV infection.

Furthermore, IAV was able to efficiently replicate in ASMase-deficient NPA cells. NPA cells have a mutation in the <italic>SMPD1</italic> gene that results in total loss of enzyme activity (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Levade et al., 1986</xref>). Unlike rhinovirus which induces ASMase activation during infection (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Grassme, 2005</xref>), ASMase was not activated in IAV-infected cells but was rather inhibited in a time-dependent manner. Consistent with our finding, Sindbis virus, which requires SM during infection, also inhibits ASMase in wild type-infected mice (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Ng and Griffin, 2006</xref>). The decrease in ASMase activity observed during infection may be virus-induced to maintain the SM membrane pools required during the subsequent replication cycles or cell-induced to conserve SM needed for cellular activity. Together these results indicate that IAV does not require ASMase activity during infection.</p><p>Desipramine belongs to the group of lysosomotropic weak bases, which includes amantadine and chloroquine, both known to inhibit IAV (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Di Trani et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Kornhuber et al., 2010</xref>). These compounds diffuse through endosomal membranes and become protonated, thus increasing the endosomal pH and causing detachment and degradation of AMSase (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Kornhuber et al., 2010</xref>). A common mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of amantadine and chloroquine against IAV is through inhibiting endosomal activation and low-pH fusion of the virus. As such, this inhibitory effect varies according to the pH-dependency of the virus (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Steinhauer et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Di Trani et al., 2007</xref>). Besides, amantadine blocks the viral M2 channel and subsequently inhibits the uncoating step of the virus life cycle (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 1993</xref>). In this study, desipramine had no inhibitory effect against IAV despite being a weak base. Desipramine is much less potent in neutralizing endosomal vesicles compared to chloroquine albeit having a higher inhibitory effect against ASMase (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Kornhuber et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Nadanaciva et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, the lack of inhibitory effect by desipramine against IAV might be both due to its failure to increase the endosomal pH above the threshold required for activation of PR8 HA and the fact that ASMase is dispensable for its replication.</p><p>Sphingomyelin in the viral envelope was shown to be essential for some viruses. For example, depletion of SM from the envelope of hepatitis C virus and bovine herpesvirus-1 impaired their infectivity (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Aizaki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Pastenkos et al., 2018</xref>). IAV acquires its envelope upon exiting the cell. Thus, the virus envelope shares similar properties as the plasma membrane. The envelope of IAV is mainly composed of host-derived lipid rafts that are selectively incorporated into the envelope and are highly enriched in SM, cholesterol, and phosphatidylcholine (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Scheiffele et al., 1999</xref>). HA and NA viral glycoproteins preferentially concentrate in those lipid microdomains during assembly and budding (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Leser and Lamb, 2005</xref>), suggesting that these glycoproteins also concentrate within the lipid rafts in the viral envelope. In our study, the depletion of SM in IAV envelope by bSMase treatment reduced virus infectivity without affecting the HA levels of the viral envelope. Both cell attachment and internalization of SM-depleted IAV were impaired. While we showed that the HA concentration is not changed upon the treatment of the virus with bSMase, it remains possible that the clustering of the envelope glycoproteins is affected due to the disruption of the lipid rafts. The clustering of HA protein within lipid microdomains was shown to be critical for efficient receptor binding and membrane fusion (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Takeda et al., 2003</xref>). It is also possible that disrupting viral SM might interfere with the barrier properties of the envelope or the lipid mixing step proceeding membrane fusion. Supporting the latter hypothesis, bSMase treatment was shown to abolish rubella virus E1/E2-mediated membrane fusion (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Otsuki et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our present work provides strong evidence that cellular and viral SM is required for efficient IAV infection, particularly during its attachment and entry into host cells. Therefore, we suggest that the previously reported co-localization of IAV with lipid rafts in the host membrane during internalization (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Eierhoff et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Verma et al., 2018</xref>) might be attributed to the SM content of these rafts. However, further investigations are needed to determine the precise mechanisms by which viral and cellular SM mediate IAV entry. Our findings provide support to targeting sphingolipids and SM in particular as an antiviral approach against IAV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="S5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation, to any qualified researcher.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>HZ and AA designed the experiments, analyzed the data, and drafted the manuscript.
