  <p>Cellular SM depletion restricts IAV entry into A549 cells. A549 cells were pretreated with 1 U/ml bSMase (bSMase + IAV) for 2 h at 4°C or left untreated (IAV) prior to inoculation with PR8 at MOI of 15. Inoculated cells were kept at 4°C for 1 h to allow virus adsorption and then washed with cold PBS

   <bold>(A–D)</bold>. The attached virus was labeled with mouse anti-influenza A (H1N1) antibody followed by Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated anti-mouse antibody (green) 
   <bold>(A,B)</bold>. Alternatively, after viral adsorption at 4°C for 1 h, the cells were placed at 37°C for an additional 30 min to allow virus entry, and internalized virions were assessed using mouse anti-NP antibody followed by Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated anti-mouse antibody (green) 
   <bold>(C,D)</bold>. Mock cells were left untreated/uninfected. The cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). The images were taken using confocal microscopy with a 63x oil objective lens 
   <bold>(A,C)</bold>. The variation of fluorescence intensities was measured using ZEN software 
   <bold>(B,D)</bold>. Means ± SD are shown. Results are representative of two independent experiments. Statistical significance between infected (IAV) and treated infected (bSMase + IAV) cells was assessed using the 
   <italic>t</italic>-test (*corresponds to a 
   <italic>P-</italic>value &lt; 0.05).
