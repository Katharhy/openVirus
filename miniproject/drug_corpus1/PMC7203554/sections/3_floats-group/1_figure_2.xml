  <p>Exogenous SM enhances IAV replication. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Cytotoxicity of SM on A549 cells was assessed using MTT assay. A549 cells were treated with increasing SM concentrations up to 50 μM, and MTT assay was then performed at 24 h post-treatment to determine cell viability in treated and untreated cells. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> The effect of SM on IAV infection was studied. A549 cells were pretreated with 50 μM of exogenous SM or solvent for 24 h and inoculated with PR8 at 0.01 MOI. Virus titers were then assessed at 24 hpi using the plaque assay and plotted relative to vehicle-treated cells. Means ± SD are shown. Results shown are representative of two independent experiments. Statistical significance was assessed using the 
   <italic>t</italic>-test (
   <sup>∗</sup>corresponds to a 
   <italic>P-</italic>value &lt; 0.01).
