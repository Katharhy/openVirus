  <p>ASMase is dispensable for IAV infection 
   <bold>(A,B)</bold> Cytotoxicity of desipramine (Des) in A549 cells was assessed using the MTT assay. A549 cells were treated with increasing desipramine concentrations for 24 h 
   <bold>(A)</bold> or with desipramine at 12.5 μM or 25 μM for the indicated durations 
   <bold>(B)</bold>. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> The effect of desipramine on ASMase activity in A549 cells was determined. A549 cells were treated with the vehicle or 25 μM desipramine, and ASMase activity was then assessed at 1 and 24 h post-treatment using Amplex
   <sup>®</sup> Red Sphingomyelinase Assay Kit. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> The impact of ASMase inhibition on IAV infection was assessed using the plaque assay and plotted relative to the vehicle-treated cells. A549 cells were either treated with desipramine for 1 h or left untreated prior to inoculation with PR8 (1 MOI) for 1 h in the presence or absence of the inhibitor. Cells were then incubated with or without the drug for 24 hpi, and viral titers were determined using the plaque assay. 
   <bold>(E)</bold> Primary human fibroblasts deficient in ASMase activity (GM00112 and GM13205) and normal human primary fibroblasts (GM00038) were infected with PR8 at 1 MOI for the indicated durations. Normal human primary fibroblasts were used as a control. The virus yield was determined using plaque assay and plotted relative to the control. The results are representative of two independent experiments. Statistical significance was measured using 
   <italic>t</italic>-test (*correspond to a 
   <italic>P-</italic>value &lt; 0.05 and ***correspond to a 
   <italic>P-</italic>value &lt; 0.001).
