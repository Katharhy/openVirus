  <p>Virus SM depletion impairs attachment and entry. The IAV PR8 stock was treated with 0.1 U/ml bSMase (bSMase-treated IAV) or with the vehicle (HBSS
   <sup>+</sup>) (IAV) at 37°C for 1 h. 
   <bold>(A–D)</bold> Treated or untreated PR8 was inoculated onto A549 cells after dilution in VIM to obtain an MOI of 15. Control cells were inoculated with untreated virus particles. Cells were infected for 1 h at 4°C to allow virus adsorption and then washed with cold PBS
   <sup>+</sup>. After adsorption, attached virions were labeled using mouse anti-influenza A (H1N1) antibody followed by Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated anti-mouse antibody (green) 
   <bold>(A,B)</bold>. Alternatively, following viral adsorption, the cells were placed at 37°C for an additional 30 min to allow virus entry and internalized virions were assessed using mouse anti-NP antibody followed by Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated anti-mouse antibody (green) 
   <bold>(C,D)</bold>. Mock cells were left untreated/uninfected and used to confirm the specificity of the antibodies. DAPI (blue) was used as a nuclear stain. The images were taken using confocal microscopy with a 63x oil objective lens 
   <bold>(A,C)</bold>. The variation of fluorescence intensities was measured using ZEN software 
   <bold>(B,D)</bold>. Means ± SD are shown. The results are the average of two independent experiments. Statistical significance between bSMase-treated and Mock-treated IAV was assessed using the 
   <italic>t</italic>-test (*corresponds to a 
   <italic>P-</italic>value &lt; 0.05, **corresponds to a 
   <italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 0.01).
