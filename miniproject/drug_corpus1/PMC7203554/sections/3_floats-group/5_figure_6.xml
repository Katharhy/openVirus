  <p>Virus SM depletion reduces IAV infectivity. The IAV PR8 stock was treated with 0.1 U/ml bSMase or with the vehicle (HBSS
   <sup>+</sup>) at 37°C for 1 h. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Treated or untreated PR8 was inoculated onto A549 cells after dilution in VIM to obtain an MOI of 1. Control cells were inoculated with untreated virus particles. Virus titers were assessed at 24 hpi using the plaque assay, and the virus yield was compared to control cells. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Alternatively, the infectivity of bSMase-treated or untreated IAV PR8 was assessed by plaque reduction assay using MDCK cells. Confluent monolayers of MDCK cells were inoculated with 90 PFU of bSMase-treated or untreated virus, and plaques were counted at 72 hpi. The % of infectivity was calculated relative to the control cells. Means ± SD are shown. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Hemagglutination assay was performed to assess the HA levels in the bSMase-treated virus. The results are representative of two independent experiments. Statistical significance between bSMase-treated and vehicle-treated IAV was assessed using the 
   <italic>t</italic>-test (*corresponds to a 
   <italic>P-</italic>value &lt; 0.05, **corresponds to a 
   <italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 0.01).
