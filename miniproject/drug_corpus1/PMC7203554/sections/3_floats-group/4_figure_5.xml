  <p>IAV infection restricts ASMase activity at later time-points post-infection. A549 cells were infected with PR8 at 1 MOI or left uninfected. Whole-cell lysates were used to assess ASMase activity at different durations post-infection using Amplex Red Sphingomyelinase Assay Kit. Results shown are fold changes of fluorescence in infected cells compared to their time-matching controls (uninfected cells). The average results of two independent experiments are shown. Statistical significance was measured between infected cells and their time-matching controls using
