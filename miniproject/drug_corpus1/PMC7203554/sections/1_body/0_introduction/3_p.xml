<p>Sphingomyelin (SM) is the most abundant membrane sphingolipid. It is predominantly found in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, endomembranes, as well as in the intracellular organelles (

 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Verma et al., 2018</xref>). However, MβCD also depletes SM, whose effect on IAV binding and internalization has been overlooked. The level of cellular SM is primarily regulated by sphingomyelinases (SMases), which catalyze its hydrolysis back into ceramide and phosphorylcholine (

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Hannun and Obeid, 2018</xref>). SMases are classified based on their pH optimum into acid (ASMase), neutral (NSMase), and alkaline (AlkSMase) sphingomyelinases (

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Hannun and Obeid, 2018</xref>). Lysosomal ASMase is translocated to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane by exocytosis, where it catalyzes the hydrolysis of membrane SM and leads to the formation of ceramide-enriched membrane platforms (
