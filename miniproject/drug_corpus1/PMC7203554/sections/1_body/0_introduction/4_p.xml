<p>Sphingomyelin and/or ASMase were shown to affect the infectivity of several viruses. SM and its hydrolyzing enzyme ASMase were implicated during Ebola virus infection (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Miller et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, alphaherpesviruses were shown to exhibit a variable requirement for SM and ASMase during entry into host cells (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Pastenkos et al., 2018</xref>). Japanese encephalitis virus attachment and entry into target cells was shown to be dependent on SM synthase 1-generated SM (

 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Tanner et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, it was also demonstrated that the SM biosynthetic pathway is important for the transport of influenza virus glycoproteins to lipid rafts located at the apical surface of the plasma membrane (
