<p>Here, we investigated the role of SM and it hydrolyzing ASMase and its substrate SM in IAV infection. We found that genetic deficiency or pharmacological inhibition of ASMase does not prevent IAV infection. However, IAV infection was attenuated by the depletion of membrane SM and enhanced upon treatment with exogenous SM. SM depletion of the plasma membrane or the viral envelope impaired IAV attachment and internalization. These results demonstrate that IAV does not require ASMase activity for infection and that intact SM in both cell membrane and viral envelope is essential for efficient IAV entry.</p>
