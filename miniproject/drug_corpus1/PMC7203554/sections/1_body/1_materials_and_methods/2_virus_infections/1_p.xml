<p>A549 cells seeded in a 12-well tissue culture plate at 3.2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well were washed two times with phosphate buffer saline with calcium and magnesium (PBS
 <sup>+</sup>) and incubated with VIM in the presence or absence of the tested drug. The cells were then infected with 200 μl of the virus diluted in VIM in the presence or absence of the drug at 37°C for 1 h. Afterward, cells were washed twice with mild acidic PBS
 <sup>+</sup> (pH 5) to remove unbound viral particles. Subsequently, cells were incubated with pre-warmed VIM containing 0.2 μg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma) at 37°C in the presence or absence of the drug and the virus yield was determined by plaque assay as described below.
