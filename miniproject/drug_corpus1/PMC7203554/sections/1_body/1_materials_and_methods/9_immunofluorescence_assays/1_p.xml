<p>A549 cells were fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. For ceramide staining, the cells were left unpermeabilized. However, to visualize the internalized influenza virus particles, the cells were permeabilized using 0.2% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 20 min. The cells were blocked with bovine serum albumin (1% BSA in PBS) for 1 h and incubated with either mouse anti-ceramide antibody (Sigma, C8104-50TST), mouse anti-nucleoprotein (NP) antibody (BEI Resources, NR19868) or mouse anti-influenza A (H1N1 antigen) antibody (Merck Millipore, MAB8256) at 1:100 in 1% BSA overnight at 4Â°C. The cells were rinsed with PBS and incubated for 1 h with Alexa Flour 488 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Thermofisher Scientific, A11001) at 1:250 in 1% BSA. Coverslips were mounted with a fluoroshield mounting medium containing DAPI. The images were acquired with a 40x or 63x oil objective lens, as indicated in the figure legends using a Zeiss LSM 710 laser-scanning confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Quantification of fluorescent intensities was done using ZEN software.</p>
