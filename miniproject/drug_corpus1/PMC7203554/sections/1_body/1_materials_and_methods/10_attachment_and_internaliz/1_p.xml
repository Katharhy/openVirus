<p>A549 cells were incubated with bSMase (1 U/ml), or the vehicle (HBSS
 <sup>+</sup>) for 2 h at 37°C, and washed twice with HBSS
 <sup>+</sup>. Treated and untreated cells were preincubated for 15 min at 4°C, after which PR8 15 MOI was inoculated onto the cells and incubated 1 h at 4°C to allow virus adsorption and restrain entry. The cells were then washed twice with cold PBS
 <sup>+</sup> and fixed. The attached virions were labeled using an anti-influenza A (H1N1) antibody and quantified using confocal microscopy.
