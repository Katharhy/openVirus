<p>The viability of cells after concentration or time-dependent treatments of drugs was determined using the standard MTT [3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide] assay. All the treatments were done using 2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well in 96-well tissue culture plates. Briefly, A549 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of the tested drug for a specific period. After incubation, 20 μl of MTT reagent (1 mg/ml in PBS) were added to each well and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. The supernatant was then removed, and the purple formazan crystals were dissolved in 100 μl of solubilizing reagent (acidic isopropanol). Finally, the absorbance was recorded using the Multiskan ELISA reader at 570 nm.
