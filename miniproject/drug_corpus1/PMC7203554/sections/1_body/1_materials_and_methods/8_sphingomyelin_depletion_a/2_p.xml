<p>For depletion of viral envelope SM, PR8 high titer stock was mixed with the vehicle (HBSS
 <sup>+</sup>) or 0.1 U/ml bSMase and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. A549 cells were infected with 1 MOI of the treated or untreated IAV (PR8). Virus yield was then quantified at 24 hpi using the plaque assay. Alternatively, the infectivity of SM-depleted viruses was directly assessed using the plaque reduction assay (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Hsieh et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, MDCK cells (8 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cell/well) were seeded in six-well tissue culture plates 1 day before infection. The cells were inoculated with PR8 at 90 PFU/well and kept on ice for 1 h, followed by incubation for 20 min at 37°C. Then the cells were washed with acidic PBS
 <sup>+</sup> and neutralized with neutral PBS
 <sup>+</sup>. An overlay of 0.5% nutritive agarose was added to the cells and incubated at 37°C for 72 h. The overlay was then removed and the cells were stained with crystal violet. The plaques were then counted, and the percent reduction in infectivity was calculated.
