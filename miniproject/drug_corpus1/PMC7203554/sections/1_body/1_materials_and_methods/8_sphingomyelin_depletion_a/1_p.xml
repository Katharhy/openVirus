<p>A549 cells were plated on the day prior to treatment and incubated overnight at 37°C. The cells were incubated with increasing bSMase concentrations (0.1, 0.5, and 1 U/ml) at 37°C for 2 h and then washed twice with HBSS
 <sup>+</sup> before infection with either PR8 or Cal07. Virus yields in bSMase-treated and untreated cells were determined using plaque assay and RT-PCR as described above.
