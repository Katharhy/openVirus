<p>A549 cells were scraped from the culture plates, centrifuged, washed with ice-cold PBS, and pelleted by centrifugation at 800 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. Cells were re-suspended in 100 μl ASMase acidic lysis buffer (50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA) and incubated for 1 h at 4°C (vortexing every 30 min). Cell lysates were then subjected to centrifugation at 14,000 
 <italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 10 min. The supernatant was isolated and an aliquot containing 30 μg protein (determined by DCTM Protein Assay Kit from BIO-RAD). The sample protein was analyzed for ASMase-activity using Amplex
 <sup>®</sup> Red Sphingomyelinase Assay Kit (Invitrogen, A12220) using the two-step process based on the manufacturer’s instructions.
