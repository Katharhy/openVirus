<p>Virus titers were determined using plaque assay in MDCK cells, as previously described (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Huprikar and Rabinowitz, 1980</xref>). Briefly, 10-fold serial dilutions from the virus collected from treated or untreated A549 cells were prepared. The confluent monolayers of MDCK cells, in 6-well tissue culture plates, were infected with 200 μl of the virus and incubated at 37°C for 1 h, with gentle shaking every 15 min. Then, the virus was removed, and the monolayers were covered with a nutritive medium containing 0.5% agarose and 1 μg/ml TPCK-trypsin. After incubation at 37°C for 72 h, the agar overlay was removed, and the cells were stained with crystal violet containing paraformaldehyde. Finally, the plaques were counted, and the virus titer was calculated.
