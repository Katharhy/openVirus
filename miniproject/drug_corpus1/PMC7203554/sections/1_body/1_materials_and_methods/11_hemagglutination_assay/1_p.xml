<p>Hemagglutination assay was done as previously described (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Killian, 2014</xref>). Briefly, chicken blood was washed up to three times with PBS. The red blood cells were then resuspended in PBS to reach a concentration of 1%. Two-fold virus dilutions were prepared in PBS in 96-well round-bottom culture plate in which 50 μl of the virus was left in each well. Then, 50 μl of the red blood cell suspension was added to each well and left to settle for 30 to 45 min at room temperature before reading.
