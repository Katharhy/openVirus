<p>The supernatant of bacterial SMase (bSMase)-treated and untreated cells was collected, followed by total viral RNA extraction using PureLink Viral RNA/DNA Minikit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using primers and probes targeting the M gene (IAV) (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2018</xref>). One-Step RT-PCR AgPath-ID (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to amplify the target according to the following protocol: 45°C for 10 min, 95°C for 10 min, and then 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 55°C for 1 min. In each sample, the viral gene copy number was assessed using a standard curve generated from AMPLIRUN Influenza A H1 RNA Control (Vircell). The results were plotted in terms of fold-change relative to the control.
