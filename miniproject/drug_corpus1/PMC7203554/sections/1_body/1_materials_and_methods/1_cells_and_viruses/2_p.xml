The viruses were propagated on MDCK cells supplemented with viral infection medium (VIM) consisting of 1X minimal essential media (10X MEM) with 0.3% (vol/vol) bovine serum albumin (BSA; 10% solution), 0.22% sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3; 7.5% solution), 1% MEM vitamin (100X solution), 1% glutamax (100X), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (10,000 units penicillin and 10,000 units streptomycin per ml) and 0.08% gentamicin (50 mg/ml). VIM was supplemented with 1 μg/ml of L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma) just before addition to the infected MDCK cells.</p>
