<p>The virus envelope shares similar properties as the plasma membrane. The observation that virus entry is suppressed in bSMase-treated cells led us to speculate that IAV infectivity could be also affected by perturbations in the lipid content, specifically SM, of its envelope. To address this, PR8 virus stock treated with bSMase (0.1 U/ml) or with the vehicle (HBSS
 <sup>+</sup>), was diluted to 1 MOI and used to inoculate A549 cells (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). To rule out the possibility that the reduction of infectivity of the bSMase-treated virus is due to the alteration in the HA protein density on the virus envelope, we assessed the hemagglutination ability of bSMase-treated virions as an indirect measure of the HA content. We found that hemagglutination titer did not change following treatment with 0.1 U/ml bSMase (
