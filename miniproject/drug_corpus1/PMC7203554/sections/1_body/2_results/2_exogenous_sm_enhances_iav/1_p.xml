<p>Because the treatment of A549 cells with bSMase suppressed IAV infection, we were interested in determining the effect of enriching A549 cells with exogenous SM on IAV infection. SM used in this study has long fatty acyl chain moiety, which favors its incorporation into the plasma membrane rather than being absorbed into the cells. First, we showed that SM treatments up to 50 μM for 24 h have no cytotoxic effect on A549 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Next, A549 cells were pretreated with 50 μM of SM for 24 h at 37°C. SM was then removed, and cells were washed with PBS
 <sup>+</sup> prior to inoculation with 0.01 MOI of PR8, and virus production was assessed in treated and untreated cells at 24 hpi using plaque assay. SM treatment resulted in a moderate but significant increase in virus yield (
