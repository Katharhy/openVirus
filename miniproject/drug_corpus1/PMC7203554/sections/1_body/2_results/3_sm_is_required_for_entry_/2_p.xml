<p>Next, we examined whether SM is required for virus internalization. The cells were infected with 15 MOI PR8 on ice for 1 h to synchronize virus attachment and then shifted to 37Â°C for 30 min to allow internalization of the adsorbed virions. The cells were washed twice, and the internalized virus was labeled with anti-influenza NP-antibody. IAV entry was significantly reduced by an average of 35% in SM depleted cells compared to untreated ones (
