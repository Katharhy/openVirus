<p>The finding that IAV is sensitive to SM levels at the plasma membrane, led us to hypothesize that SM is essential for early steps in the viral life cycle. Therefore, we assessed IAV attachment and internalization upon SM depletion. IAV attachment and internalization were examined by confocal microscopy using anti-influenza A (H1N1) antibody and anti-NP antibody, respectively. We pretreated A549 cells with 1 U/ml bSMase for 2 h at 37Â°C and infected them with 15 MOI of IAV PR8 on ice for 1 h to allow virus adsorption and block entry. For attachment assay, A549 cells were washed twice with cold PBS
 <sup>+</sup> to remove non-adsorbed virions and then immediately fixed and labeled with anti-influenza A (H1N1) antibody. SM depletion resulted in a slight, albeit significant, reduction in virus attachment, suggesting that SM depletion has a minimal effect on IAV attachment (
