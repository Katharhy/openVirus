<p>To examine whether the depletion of cellular SM affects IAV propagation, A549 cells were pretreated with increasing bSMase concentrations (0.1–1 U/ml) for 2 h at 37°C, washed to remove bSMase and inoculated with PR8 0.01 MOI. The virus yield was significantly reduced at 24 hpi in SM-depleted cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Even when an MOI of 1 was used, virus yield decreased by more than 80% in cells treated with 0.5 and 1 U/ml bSMase at 6 and 24 hpi (
