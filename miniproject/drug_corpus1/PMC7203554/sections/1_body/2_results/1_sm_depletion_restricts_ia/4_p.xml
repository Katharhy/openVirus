<p>To prove that the reduction in IAV observed in bSMase-treated cells using plaque assay was due to a decrease in virus yield but not the infectivity of the virus propagated in these cells, we quantified the total viral RNA in the supernatant of bSMase-treated (1 U/ml) and untreated cells at 24 hpi. Similar to the results obtained by using plaque assay, the total viral RNA was significantly reduced in the supernatant of bSMase-treated cells compared to the untreated ones (
