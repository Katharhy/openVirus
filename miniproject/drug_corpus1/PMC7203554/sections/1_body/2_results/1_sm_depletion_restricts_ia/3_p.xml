<p>To verify whether the suppression in virus infection by SM depletion is specific for IAV PR8, we examined the effect of bSMase treatment on the infection with a contemporary A/H1N1pdm09 strain (Cal07). A549 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of bSMase and inoculated with 1 MOI of Cal07. The virus yield was assessed at 24 hpi relative to the control (untreated cells). Similar to PR8, Cal07 virus production was significantly suppressed in bSMase-treated cells in a dose-dependent manner (
