<p>To assess whether manipulation of host cellular SM affects IAV infection, we depleted membrane SM using exogenous bSMase before infection. Exogenous bSMase specifically hydrolyzes outer membrane SM into phosphorylcholine and ceramide, thus decreasing SM content and increasing ceramide in the outer plasma membrane. Using confocal microscopy and specific ceramide antibody, we demonstrated that bSMase (0.1 U/ml) treatment efficiently increases the plasma membrane ceramide content, verifying efficient hydrolysis of SM (
