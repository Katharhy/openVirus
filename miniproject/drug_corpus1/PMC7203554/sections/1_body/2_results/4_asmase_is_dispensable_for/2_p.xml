<p>We next examined the effect of ASMase inhibition on IAV propagation. A549 cells were treated with desipramine for 1 h before inoculation with 1 MOI of PR8 and the inhibitor was maintained in the culture media during infection. Treatment with desipramine at 12.5 and 25 Î¼M did not affect IAV yield at 24 hpi (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>) might be sufficient for efficient viral replication, we assessed IAV replication in NPA fibroblasts, which have total loss of ASMase activity. Two NPA cell-lines (GM00112 and GM13205) and normal fibroblasts (GM00038) were inoculated with PR8 at 1 MOI and virus progeny was quantified at 6 and 24 hpi. IAV efficiently replicated in NPA cells similar to normal fibroblasts (
