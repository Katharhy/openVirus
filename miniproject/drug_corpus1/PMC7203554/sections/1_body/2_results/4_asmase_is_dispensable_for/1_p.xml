<p>Some viruses which utilize lipid rafts for entry require ASMase for efficient infection. However, although IAV utilizes lipid rafts for entry, SM depletion was found to restrict virus entry and infection, suggesting the ASMase activity is not favored by the virus. Therefore, we sought to determine the role of ASMase during IAV infection. We first assessed whether pharmacological ASMase inhibition would affect virus production. To do so, we utilized desipramine, a functional inhibitor of ASMase. Dose and time-dependent cytotoxicity of desipramine on A549 cells were first studied using MTT assay. Desipramine showed no cytotoxicity on A549 cells at concentrations of 25 μM and lower upon treatment for 24 h (
