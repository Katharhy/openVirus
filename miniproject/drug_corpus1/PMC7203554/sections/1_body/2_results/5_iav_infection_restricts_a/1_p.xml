<p>The finding that SM is required for IAV propagation and that ASMase activity is dispensable led us to investigate whether the virus suppresses ASMase activity to preserve the SM pools available in the host cell. Therefore, we measured ASMase enzymatic activity in control (non-infected) and IAV-infected A549 cells. The cells were infected with PR8 at 1 MOI, and ASMase activity was assayed at different time points up to 48 hpi. No detectable change in ASMase activity was observed at early time-points post-infection up to 2 h (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). However, a significant decrease in ASMase activity was observed at 6, 24, and 48 hpi, with only 20% residual enzymatic activity being detectable at 48 hpi. This observation indicated that IAV significantly inhibits ASMase activity at later stages of infection to possibly preserve SM for subsequent infection cycles.
