<p>Although lipid rafts were strongly associated with the assembly and budding of IAV, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Eierhoff et al. (2010)</xref> showed that disruption of lipid rafts by MÎ²CD impaired IAV internalization. In addition, lipid rafts are selected by IAV for binding and endocytosis into the host cells (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Verma et al., 2018</xref>). It was previously demonstrated that HA-mediated fusion of influenza virus depends on the lipid composition of the host membrane (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Chernomordik et al., 1997</xref>). In our experiments, cells were only treated with bSMase prior to IAV infection, and SM turnover from intracellular stores is rapid (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Slotte et al., 1990</xref>). Thus, it is expected that SM is replenished by the time of virus budding. This indicates that, in addition to the previously reported role of intact SM pathway during IAV assembly and budding (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Tafesse et al., 2013</xref>), SM is required during the early stages of IAV life cycle. Notably, the decrease in virus entry was partial, most likely due to the multiple internalization mechanisms utilized by IAV that may or may not involve lipid rafts such as clathrin-dependent endocytosis (CDE), clathrin independent endocytosis (CIE), caveolin independent endocytosis, macropinocytosis, and raft dependent endocytosis (
