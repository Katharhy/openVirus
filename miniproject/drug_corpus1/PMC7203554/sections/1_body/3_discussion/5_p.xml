<p>Desipramine belongs to the group of lysosomotropic weak bases, which includes amantadine and chloroquine, both known to inhibit IAV (

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Di Trani et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Kornhuber et al., 2010</xref>). These compounds diffuse through endosomal membranes and become protonated, thus increasing the endosomal pH and causing detachment and degradation of AMSase (

A common mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of amantadine and chloroquine against IAV is through inhibiting endosomal activation and low-pH fusion of the virus. As such, this inhibitory effect varies according to the pH-dependency of the virus (

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Di Trani et al., 2007</xref>). Besides, amantadine blocks the viral M2 channel and subsequently inhibits the uncoating step of the virus life cycle (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 1993</xref>). In this study, desipramine had no inhibitory effect against IAV despite being a weak base. Desipramine is much less potent in neutralizing endosomal vesicles compared to chloroquine albeit having a higher inhibitory effect against ASMase (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Kornhuber et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Nadanaciva et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, the lack of inhibitory effect by desipramine against IAV might be both due to its failure to increase the endosomal pH above the threshold required for activation of PR8 HA and the fact that ASMase is dispensable for its replication.
