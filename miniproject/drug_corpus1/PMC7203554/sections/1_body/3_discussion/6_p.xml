<p>Sphingomyelin in the viral envelope was shown to be essential for some viruses. For example, depletion of SM from the envelope of hepatitis C virus and bovine herpesvirus-1 impaired their infectivity (

The envelope of IAV is mainly composed of host-derived lipid rafts that are selectively incorporated into the envelope and are highly enriched in SM, cholesterol, and phosphatidylcholine (

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Leser and Lamb, 2005</xref>), suggesting that these glycoproteins also concentrate within the lipid rafts in the viral envelope. In our study, the depletion of SM in IAV envelope by bSMase treatment reduced virus infectivity without affecting the HA levels of the viral envelope. Both cell attachment and internalization of SM-depleted IAV were impaired. While we showed that the HA concentration is not changed upon the treatment of the virus with bSMase, it remains possible that the clustering of the envelope glycoproteins is affected due to the disruption of the lipid rafts. The clustering of HA protein within lipid microdomains was shown to be critical for efficient receptor binding and membrane fusion (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Takeda et al., 2003</xref>). It is also possible that disrupting viral SM might interfere with the barrier properties of the envelope or the lipid mixing step proceeding membrane fusion. Supporting the latter hypothesis, bSMase treatment was shown to abolish rubella virus E1/E2-mediated membrane fusion (
