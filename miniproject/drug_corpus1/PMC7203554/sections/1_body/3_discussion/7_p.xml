<p>In summary, our present work provides strong evidence that cellular and viral SM is required for efficient IAV infection, particularly during its attachment and entry into host cells. Therefore, we suggest that the previously reported co-localization of IAV with lipid rafts in the host membrane during internalization (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Eierhoff et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Verma et al., 2018</xref>) might be attributed to the SM content of these rafts. However, further investigations are needed to determine the precise mechanisms by which viral and cellular SM mediate IAV entry. Our findings provide support to targeting sphingolipids and SM in particular as an antiviral approach against IAV.
