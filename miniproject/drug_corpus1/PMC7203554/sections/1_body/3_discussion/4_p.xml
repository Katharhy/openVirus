<p>Since some viruses that utilize lipid rafts during infection show a requirement for ASMase during infection (

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Grassme, 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Miller et al., 2012</xref>), we assessed the association between IAV infection and endogenous ASMase. We examined the effect of pharmacological ASMase-inhibition and ASMase-genetic deficiency on IAV infection. We found that, unlike Ebola virus, adenovirus, and rhinovirus (

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Miller et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2018</xref>), ASMase inhibition using desipramine did not affect IAV infection. Furthermore, IAV was able to efficiently replicate in ASMase-deficient NPA cells. NPA cells have a mutation in the 
 <italic>SMPD1</italic> gene that results in total loss of enzyme activity (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Levade et al., 1986</xref>). Unlike rhinovirus which induces ASMase activation during infection (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Grassme, 2005</xref>), ASMase was not activated in IAV-infected cells but was rather inhibited in a time-dependent manner. Consistent with our finding, Sindbis virus, which requires SM during infection, also inhibits ASMase in wild type-infected mice (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Ng and Griffin, 2006</xref>). The decrease in ASMase activity observed during infection may be virus-induced to maintain the SM membrane pools required during the subsequent replication cycles or cell-induced to conserve SM needed for cellular activity. Together these results indicate that IAV does not require ASMase activity during infection.
