<p>Lipid rafts, membrane microdomains enriched in SM and cholesterol, were shown to be utilized during different phases of the IAV replication cycle (

However, the role of SM, a major sphingolipid component of the cell plasma membrane and endomembranes, during IAV infection, has not been fully explored. In this study, we demonstrated that efficient IAV infection is dependent on intact SM in the plasma membrane of the host cell and the viral envelope, specifically at the virus entry step, while ASMase activity seems to be dispensable.
