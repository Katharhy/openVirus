<p>We additionally performed the Linjudge FluA/pdm test for patients who were found to be positive for influenza A by ImunoAce Flu (n = 96) (
 <xref rid="pone.0231217.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Six of the 96 cases that were found to be positive for influenza A by ImunoAce Flu were found to be false-positives by RT-PCR. Thus, these were excluded from the analysis. Among the patients in whom influenza A positivity was confirmed by RT-PCR (n = 90), 42 patients were found to be positive for H1N1pdm09 by Linjudge FluA/pdm. RT-PCR revealed that one of these cases was H3N2 virus infection. Thus, the sensitivity of Linjudge FluA/pdm for H1N1pdm was 97.6% (41/42, 95%CI: 87.4â€“99.9).
