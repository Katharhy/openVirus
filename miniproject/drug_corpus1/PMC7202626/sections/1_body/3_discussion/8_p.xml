<p>The distinction of influenza A subtypes, A/H1N1pdm and A/H3N2, has been taken seriously because of characteristic clinical manifestations. Recently, however, it has become more important, mainly because of the lower effectiveness of the influenza vaccine against A/H3N2 [

However, with the combination of ImunoAce Flu and Linjudge FluA/pdm, distinction between influenza A subtypes becomes feasible.
