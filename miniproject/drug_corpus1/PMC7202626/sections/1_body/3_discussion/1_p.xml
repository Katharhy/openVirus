<p>Based on a meta-analysis, RIDTs (
 <italic>i</italic>.
 <italic>e</italic>., antigen detection tests based on the immunochromatography) were reported to show low sensitivity (42.6%; 95%CI: 34.8–50.9) for influenza A in adult patients [
 <xref rid="pone.0231217.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In contrast, an RIDT used in Japan, ImunoAce Flu, showed much 97.1% sensitivity in the detection of influenza A viruses (95%CI: 93.8–98.9) in adult patients (
 <xref rid="pone.0231217.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The performance of RIDTs used in Japan might be higher than those reported in the meta-analysis [
 <xref rid="pone.0231217.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In the same meta-analysis, it was also reported that RIDTs that utilize analyzer devices showed higher sensitivity in the detection of influenza viral antigens than RIDTs without analyzer devices. For example, the BD Veritor System, classified as “a digital immunoassay” in the meta-analysis report [
 <xref rid="pone.0231217.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], showed 83.0% sensitivity and 97.5% specificity, which was much higher in comparison to RIDTs without analyzer devices. Although the BD Veritor System is also used in Japan, this superiority is not recognized. The minimum viral titer required for a positive reaction for influenza A viruses using the BD Veritor System (10
 <sup>3</sup>−10
 <sup>4</sup> TCID50 per 100 μl) was similar to that required by ImunoAce Flu [
