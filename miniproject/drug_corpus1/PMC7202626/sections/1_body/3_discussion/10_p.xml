<p>The present study was associated with several limitations. In some severe influenza cases, including cases with viral pneumonia [
 <xref rid="pone.0231217.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], the infectious titer in the upper respiratory tract is reported to be low. Thus, negative test results in such cases should probably be confirmed by further testing using RT-PCR or other molecular assays to improve the detection of influenza virus infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0231217.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In the present study, we only analyzed the performance of ImunoAce Flu in the detection of influenza A virus infection.
