<p>The purpose of this study was to examine the sensitivity and specificity of an RIDT that is widely used in Japan (ImunoAce Flu, TAUNS, Shizuoka, Japan), and to demonstrate its usefulness in the outpatient department of our hospital. ImunoAce Flu was reported to show high sensitivity and specificity in an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study using viral cultures [
 <xref rid="pone.0231217.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We compared its performance to the results of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). ImunoAce Flu is designed to not only detect influenza A or B, but to also detect H1N1pdm09 with the use of an additional kit (Linjudge FluA/pdm; TAUNS, Shizuoka, Japan, for research use only). Thus, we also assessed the sensitivity and specificity of Linjudge FluA/pdm.
