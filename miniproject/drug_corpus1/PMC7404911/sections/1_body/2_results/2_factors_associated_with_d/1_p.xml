 <sup>2</sup> tests (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) indicated that patients of Han ethnicity were less likely to have DR-TB compared with other ethnicities (23.90% vs. 35.70%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.002). Housekeepers were more likely to have DR-TB than other professions (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Patients who lived in suburban counties/districts were more likely to have DR-TB (27.10% vs. 20.60%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) than those living in central urban areas. Patients aged between 21 and 60 years had a higher risk of having DR-TB than those aged less than 21 years and more than 60 years (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.010). Patients in retreatment (95.20% vs. 4.00%, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and with drug-related hepatotoxicity (43.70% vs. 11.90%, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) were more likely to have DR-TB. However, HIV-positive TB patients were less likely to have DR-TB than HIV-negative TB patients (8.20% vs. 26.00%, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). No differences were observed in sex, symptoms (excluded revisit patients as they had no initial symptoms based on their clinical records), and viral hepatitis between drug-sensitive TB patients and DR-TB patients (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05).
