<p id="Par26">Multivariate analysis of factors associated with DR-TB and TB/HIV co-infection is presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. The assignment of variables is shown in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. The binomial stepwise logistic regression is shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. TB type and HIV infectious status were the dependent variables (Y). Gender, ethnicity, occupation, living region, age, retreatment, drug-related hepatotoxicity, and HIV were the independent variables (X). Results indicated that patients who received retreatment and had drug-related hepatotoxicity were more likely to have DR-TB. However, compared with farmers, patients who worked in other occupations were less likely to have DR-TB. The results showed that patients who received retreatment and lived in county/district were less likely to be HIV positive. Female patients were less likely to be HIV/AIDS positive than male patients. However, compared with farmers, patients who were unemployed were more likely to be HIV-positive, and patients aged 21–60 years had a higher risk of being HIV-positive than those aged less than 21 years and more than 60 years.
