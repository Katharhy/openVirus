<p id="Par30">Since the first HIV infection was reported in Chongqing, the epidemic has developed particularly fast in recent years. The number of cases reached 32,589 in 2015 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The TB/HIV co-infection rate in Chongqing was 6% in 2015, which was much higher than the national average level of 2% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. It is more difficult for TB patients living with HIV to receive TB treatment due to the increasing financial burden, overlapping drug toxic effects, and fragmented care between separated TB and HIV healthcare programmes; therefore, TB patients co-infected with HIV are more likely to develop DR-TB and have treatment failure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Some studies pointed out that the risk factors of both DR-TB and HIV could be highly identical, so that many DR-TB patients are co-infected with HIV, which has aggregated the disease burden and increased poor outcomes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Therefore, it is essential for healthcare facilities to perform drug-susceptibility tests in every patient with TB and HIV [
