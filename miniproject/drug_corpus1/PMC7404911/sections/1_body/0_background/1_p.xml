<p id="Par17">Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the top ten causes of death worldwide and is the leading cause of infectious diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO)‘s Global TB Report 2019, there were 10.0 (9.0–11,1) million new cases of TB, and 3.4% of new cases and 18% of previously treated cases developed multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) or rifampicin (RFP)-resistant TB (RR/TB) in 2018 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) and TB/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection are the challenges in controlling TB (endeavours) worldwide. TB killed 251,000 HIV-positive people globally in 2018, although the number of TB deaths among HIV-positive people has fallen from 620,000 in 2000 to 251,000 in 2018, a decrease of 60, and 8.6% of TB patients are living with HIV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The latest treatment success rates were 85% for drug-sensitive TB, 75% for HIV-associated TB, and 56% for MDR/RR-TB [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In many situations, patients not only had TB/DR-TB, but also HIV and other comorbid conditions and complications, which made co-treatment for TB/DR-TB and other diseases more complicated and challenging [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It was previously proven that HIV-positive patients are vulnerable to DR-TB, and DR-TB is often associated with higher mortality rates in patients living with HIV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A higher mortality rate was observed in HIV-positive TB patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and TB patients co-infected with HIV were more likely to develop extra-pulmonary disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, hepatotoxicity is one of the most common TB complications caused by first-line drugs (isoniazid [INH], RFP, and pyrazinamide), as these drugs are highly associated with hepatotoxicity [
