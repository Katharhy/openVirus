<p id="Par19">The Chongqing municipality is one of four municipalities directly under the control of the Central Government of China, which is located in southwest China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. With over 30 million residents, Chongqing has a high proportion of migrant workers and the highest TB prevalence compared with the other three municipalities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Recently, Chongqing has begun to pay more attention to TB control and has implemented a national TB control programme with great progress [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, the fifth national TB epidemic survey in 2010 indicates that Chongqing’s active TB prevalence rate (&gt; 15 years) and average reported prevalence were both higher than the national average rates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The national survey in 2015 indicated that the incidence of TB in Chongqing was 75/100,000, ranking tenth among the top 10 in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Therefore, TB control in Chongqing faced many challenges, such as the prevalence of MDR-TB and TB/HIV co-infection. Since the implementation of the 12th 5 Year Plan of the National TB Program in 2011, China’s TB control model has transformed from the “Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) model” to the “integrated model” in most regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In the integrated model, the CDC is responsible for the planning, supervision, and health education of TB control. Designated hospitals are responsible for TB diagnosis and treatment. Primary healthcare facilities are responsible for case management and patient referrals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In the integrated model, TB was diagnosed according to the guidelines of TB control issued in 2017 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and the treatment of TB referred to the Guidelines for implementing the national TB control programme in China (2008) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Chongqing has also implemented the integrated model so that TB patients can receive therapy in designated hospitals since 2016. To better understand the progress made in Chongqing’s TB control as part of the integrated model, it is essential to reanalyse TB epidemiology in Chongqing. This study aimed to understand the characteristics of TB epidemiology in Chongqing, particularly among DR-TB and TB/HIV co-infection patients. It also aimed to identify the population at higher risk of DR-TB and HIV-positive TB to provide evidence that can serve as a basis for making responsive strategies to end the spread of TB in Chongqing.
