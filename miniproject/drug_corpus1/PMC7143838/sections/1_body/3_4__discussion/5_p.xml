<p>Unlike HBV infection, there is currently no preventive HCV vaccine and the cost of treatment is enormous. The epidemiological survey showed that the prevalence of anti-HCV was 3.2% in China [

In 2016, the epidemiological survey of hepatitis C showed that the anti-HCV positive rate was 0.8% in the general population of Shaanxi Province. In our study, the rate of anti-HCV was 11.1% among HIV-infected patients in Shaanxi Province, which was also higher than in the general Chinese population, and 14-fold higher than in Shaanxi Province. Other studies have found both lower [

 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-17-01990" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] HCV prevalences in HIV-positive patients, ranging from 2.2% to 62.4%. Pelton et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-ijerph-17-01990" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] found that 2357 cases of HIV/AIDS patients in Xinjiang had an anti-HCV positive rate of 38.0%. Chen et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-17-01990" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] found that the prevalence of anti-HCV was 62.4% among 978 HIV-infected individuals from Hunan Province, while Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-17-01990" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] found that the anti-HCV positive rate was only 2.2% in 1314 HIV/AIDS patients under anti-viral treatment in You’an Hospital. The results above were quite different from that in our study. Different results may be related to ethnicity, region, infection route, and investigation time. Multivariate analysis showed that ethnicity, education level, and transmission routes were risk factors resulting in HIV–HCV co-infection. Among 1018 HIV-infected patients, the anti-HCV positive rate of intravenous drug users was as high as 91.5%, which was the risk factor of HIV–HCV co-infection (OR = 134.024, 95% CI: 14.328–1253.653). It has also been reported that the rate of HIV–HCV co-infection in Chinese intravenous drug users is as high as 69.0–93.6%, and the infection rate of other transmission routes is significantly lower than this level [
 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-17-01990" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], indicating that intravenous drug use is the cause of HCV spread in HIV-infected patients in Shaanxi. The results showed a higher prevalence in the Yi nationality than in Han nationality (OR = 31.030, 95% CI: 11.643–82.694). It may be caused by the high rate (41.0%) of intravenous drug use among the Yi nationality in this study. Therefore, the publicity and intervention work should be especially strengthened in intravenous drug users and the Yi nationality. Besides, the ‘others’ group had a higher prevalence (OR = 59.696, 95% CI: 6.136–580.787) compared to homosexual transmission. The ‘others’ group includes blood transfusion or blood product, selling blood for money and mother-to-fetus transmission in this study, which are risk factors for HCV transmission. However, due to strong government control, blood transmission and mother-to-child transmission have been reduced to the lowest level, thus we do not need to worry about “others”.
