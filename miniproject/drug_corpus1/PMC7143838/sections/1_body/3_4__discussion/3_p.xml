<p>There are few reports on the five tests for hepatitis B in the HIV/AIDS population in China. A total of 19 kinds of HBV marker’s phenotype distribution were found. Of which, the inoculated population (HBsAg-, HBsAb+, HBeAg-, HBeAb-, HBcAb-) accounted for 43.8%, which was higher than Li’s study on 1314 HIV/AIDS patients (22.5%) [

The proportion of HIV-positive individuals with an active acute HBV infection was very low at only 1.6%; however, they could transmit HBV to others very easily. At the same time, the positive rate of HBsAg in Yi nationality (18.3%) was higher than that of Han nationality (10.5%), and the rate of active acute HBV infection in Yi nationality (5.6%) was significantly higher than that in Han nationality (1.3%;
