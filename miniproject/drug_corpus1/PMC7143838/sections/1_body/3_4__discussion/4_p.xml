<p>Increased liver-related morbidity and mortality among HIV-positive individuals co-infected with HBV [
 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-17-01990" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] indicate the importance of effective hepatitis B vaccine immunization. Ideally, individuals should be inoculated with hepatitis B vaccine before HIV infection as the effectiveness of the vaccination is stronger in HIV-negative individuals [
 <xref rid="B53-ijerph-17-01990" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. If HIV-positive individuals are not previously vaccinated, they should be vaccinated against HBV when the HIV viral load is low, as HIV viremia can shorten the retention of anti-HBs positive antibodies [
 <xref rid="B54-ijerph-17-01990" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Because anti-HBs antibodies can disappear several years after effective HBV vaccination [
 <xref rid="B55-ijerph-17-01990" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], we cannot judge whether individuals negative for anti-HBs in this study were not vaccinated before. Regardless, individuals enrolled in this study were susceptible to HBV, suggesting the strategies to enhance the immune response of immunocompromised individuals are needed. In short, this study has found that the positive rate of HBsAg among HIV-positive individuals was higher than that in the general population. Therefore, the hepatitis B vaccination should be strengthened, especially in HIV-infected patients of Yi nationality. At the same time, the specificity of HIV-infected persons, such as HIV viral load, should be considered.
