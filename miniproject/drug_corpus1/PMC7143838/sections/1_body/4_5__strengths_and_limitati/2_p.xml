<p>However, the study also had several weaknesses. First, at baseline tests for CD4+ T-cell counts were not performed on all HIV-infected patients, which restricted our analysis. Second, HIV viral load results at baseline were completely missing. This is an important indicator for evaluating the health status of HIV-infected patients. Third, because the diagnosis of HIV does not require patients to be in a fasting state before testing, fasting has a significant impact on Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) test results, so as not to see the relationship of liver condition, hepatitis virus infection, and other variables. However, we do not believe these limitations affected our estimates.</p>
