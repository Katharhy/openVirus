<p>This study is the first large serological survey of HIV-positive patients in Shaanxi to assess co-infections with HBV, HCV, and syphilis. We found that ethnicity and HIV transmission routes were the risk factors for HCV infection in HIV-positive individuals, while homosexual transmission were the risk factors for syphilis infection in HIV-positive individuals. These patients also had the characteristics of low active detection rate and late diagnosis, especially in the elderly. This study provides important information on epidemiology of HBV, HCV, and TP infection in HIV-positive patients in the Shaanxi Province of China.</p>
