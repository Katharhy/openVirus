<p>Increasing morbidity and mortality have been observed in a growing number of co-infected cases, although a single infection with any of the pathogens can cause serious health problems [

 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-17-01990" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. There is evidence that co-infection with HBV or HCV can adversely affect the clinical process of HIV infection [

 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-17-01990" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. HIV–HBV co-infected individuals, especially those who have high HBV DNA viral load, are associated with lower CD4+ T-cell counts before the treatment [
 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-17-01990" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Similarly, several studies have found that poorer immunological response to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV–HCV co-infected individuals, and co-infection with HCV also increases the morbidity and mortality among HIV-positive individuals [

 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-17-01990" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In addition, the direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) to HCV show serious drug–drug interactions with antiretroviral agents, that makes the treatment of both diseases more complicated [

 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-17-01990" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], as well as make liver disease one of the most important non-AIDS (non-acquired immune deficiency syndrome) causes of death in HIV-infected individuals in the past few years [

 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-17-01990" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], but also increases the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-17-01990" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In a word, mixed infection not only causes changes in biological behavior between viruses, but also affects each other’s natural course, complicates the clinical manifestations of infected individuals, and ultimately brings difficulties to clinicians’ diagnosis and treatment [
