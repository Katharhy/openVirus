<p>In China, HIV-positive individuals are usually found late, especially in the elderly [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-17-01990" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Most are discovered by means of passive detection, such as preoperative testing, other patient detection, and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) clinics, etc. [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-17-01990" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Due to common routes of transmission, patients may not understand their infection status of HBV, HCV, and syphilis, which may accelerate the progression of HIV severely. Moreover, studies show that the rates of co-infection with HBV, HCV, and syphilis have geographical differences and vary from region to region [

 <xref rid="B34-ijerph-17-01990" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], monitored by Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), while HCV positivity (surveilled by anti-HCV antibodies) ranging between 2.2% and 62.4% [

 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-17-01990" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, the epidemiological features of HBV, HCV, and syphilis infection in HIV-positive populations remain unclear in many parts of China. In addition, the impact of HBV, HCV, and syphilis on immunological indicators of HIV-positive individuals is poorly characterized. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the epidemiological features and risk factors of HBV, HCV, and syphilis infection among HIV-positive individuals in Shaanxi Province, which is less developed for economics in northwest China, and their CD4+ T-cell levels at baseline.
