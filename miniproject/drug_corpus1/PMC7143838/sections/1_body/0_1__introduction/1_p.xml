<p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) shares similar routes of transmission with Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), and Treponema pallidum (TP; the agent causing syphilis), which include blood transfusion, sexual transmission, and mother-to-child transmission. Therefore, it is very common that HIV-positive individuals are co-infected with HBV, HCV, and syphilis. It is estimated that approximately 5–20% of HIV-positive individuals worldwide are infected with HBV [

 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-17-01990" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. There is no doubt that the high rate of HBV, HCV, and syphilis among HIV-positive individuals has become a global public health problem [
