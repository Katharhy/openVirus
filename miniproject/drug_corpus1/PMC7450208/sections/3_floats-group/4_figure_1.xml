  <p>Adjusted* odds ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) for various outcomes from being an NGO client compared to not being an NGO client, using mixed‐effect logistic regression.</p>
  <p>*Adjusted for age, gender, whether they had ever been imprisoned, whether they are registered at a drug clinic, and education level. Models have year and city as mixed‐effects except for the HCV model that only has year as a mixed‐effect. The model with being registered in a drug abuse clinic as an outcome did not adjust for this variable.</p>
