<p>Table 
 <xref rid="jia225608-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref> compares the characteristics and behaviours of NGO/non‐NGO clients across survey years and overall. All variables analysed showed differences between these two groups. In these analyses, NGO clients were more likely to be female, older, and to have completed secondary education. They tended to inject more frequently, were more likely to primarily inject opioids and to have ever been imprisoned, but less likely to have been imprisoned in the last year. NGO clients were more likely to be registered in a drug abuse clinic and to have ever been or currently on OAT. They were more likely to have received syringes or condoms in the last year and conversely were less likely to have bought syringes or condoms in the last month. NGO clients were more likely to have either received or bought syringes in the last year, which was also the case for condoms. NGO clients were also more likely to have used condoms for their last sexual intercourse and were more likely to have used a sterile needle for their last injection. For HIV, they were more likely to have ever been tested in the last year or ever. A greater proportion of NGO clients self‐reported as HIV+ (20.4% vs. 7.0%) and tested HIV+ (29.2% vs. 17.8%) or HCV+ (64.5% vs. 48.1%). Of those self‐reporting HIV+, a greater proportion of NGO clients were registered at an AIDS centre and, of these, a greater proportion reported receiving ART. Mean monthly income in 2017 (when data were available) for NGO clients was lower than for non‐NGO clients, 4,663 vs. 5,219 Ukrainian hryvnia (approximately 190.46 vs. approximately 213.17 USD on 23 January 2020).
