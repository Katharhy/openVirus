<p>Table 
 <xref rid="jia225608-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref> shows unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios of being an NGO client for various demographic characteristics. PWID testing HIV+ and HCV+ were more likely to be NGO clients. PWID that were female, that had ever been imprisoned, that were registered in a drug abuse clinic, or had higher education were more likely to be NGO clients, whereas PWID released from prison within the last 12 months were less likely to be NGO clients. In the sensitivity analysis (Table 
 <xref rid="jia225608-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>) removing the ever imprisoned and HCV variables and including the 2009 survey data, produced similar results.
