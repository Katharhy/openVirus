<p>The number of PWID surveyed in each IBBS were 3963 (2009), 9069 (2011), 9502 (2013), 9405 (2015) and 10,076 (2017). Table  shows characteristics and behaviours of the PWID surveyed in each year and tests for trends. Across all surveys, around one‐third of PWID surveyed self‐reported as NGO clients, which was stable over the years. A sensitivity analysis using RDS‐weighted estimates (Table
