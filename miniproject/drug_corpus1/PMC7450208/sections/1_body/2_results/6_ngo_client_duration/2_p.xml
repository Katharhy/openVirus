<p>Trends in characteristics and behaviours by NGO client duration (per year increase among NGO clients) are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="jia225608-tbl-0005" ref-type="table">5</xref>, with PWID that have been NGO clients for longer tending to be older, more likely to have ever been imprisoned or tested for HIV, and less likely to have bought syringes or condoms in the last month. The more experienced NGO clients were also more likely to be registered in a drug abuse clinic, to have ever been on OAT or to currently be on OAT and were more likely to be HIV+ or HCV+. Among those self‐reporting as HIV+, the longer someone was an NGO client the more likely they were to be registered at an AIDS centre or to be on ART.
