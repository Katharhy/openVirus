<p>The differences between NGO and non‐NGO clients seen in Table 
 <xref rid="jia225608-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref> are borne out in Table 
 <xref rid="jia225608-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref> and Figure 
 <xref rid="jia225608-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. In both unadjusted and adjusted regression analyses, NGO clients were more likely to have ever been tested for HIV, to have been tested in the last year, to have used a sterile needle for their last injection, to have used a condom for their last intercourse, to currently or have ever been on OAT, to be registered in a drug abuse clinic, to be registered at an AIDS centre, and to self‐report being on ART (among those self‐reporting as HIV+), and to test HIV+ or HCV+. NGO clients were more likely than non‐clients to have received syringes and condoms in the last year, but were less likely to have bought syringes or condoms in the last month. When combining these measures, NGO clients were more likely to have received or bought syringes, with the same result for condoms. Among the HIV‐negative PWID, NGO clients were more likely to have been tested for HIV in the last year (adjusted odds ratio: 3.96, 95% confidence interval: 3.73 to 4.19) than non‐NGO clients.
