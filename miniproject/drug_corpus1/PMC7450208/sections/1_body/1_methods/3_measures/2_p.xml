<p>Questions were asked about demographic characteristics, injecting and sexual behaviours, harm reduction intervention contact and outcomes, recent contact and duration of contact with NGOs, HIV/HCV testing history, self‐reported HIV/HCV diagnosis status and HIV treatment uptake. The questions included in each survey were similar across rounds with some minor differences, and, in some years, particular questions were added or excluded. Our analyses focus on questions that are comparable across all rounds. Data regarding whether someone is a client of an NGO was obtained through self‐report, using the question: “Are you a client of any non‐governmental organization (have a card or individual code), that provides prevention services for injection drug users?”. Further details of the questions can be found in Table
