In brief, the IBBS used respondent‐driven sampling (RDS) to recruit PWID. Eligible participants had injected drugs in the last 30 days, were aged ≥14 years and resided in a participating city. They needed to give consent to being surveyed, provide a dried blood spot sample, and agree to HIV and/or HCV testing. A person could partake in multiple survey rounds. The number of initial respondents (seeds) varied between 2 and 6 for different cities and years depending on the planned sample size. These seeds had to be aged under 26 and be HIV negative. They were selected to cover a range of parameters regarding gender, age, drug use and harm reduction contact. Table 
 <xref rid="jia225608-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> presents the number of overall participants in each city for each survey round, and their regions. There were 31 cities included, which covered all of Ukraine’s 27 regions, and so should be representative of Ukraine. Fifteen cities were included in all five rounds, whereas 11 were included in four rounds. The surveys were carried out in various locations, mostly rented office blocks, AIDS centres and sometimes offices of organizations providing services to PWID. The surveys were often carried out by NGOs.
