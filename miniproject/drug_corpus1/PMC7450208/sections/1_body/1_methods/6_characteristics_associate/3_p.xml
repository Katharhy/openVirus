<p>In unadjusted and adjusted analyses, we investigated whether testing HIV positive (vs. negative), testing HCV antibody positive (vs. negative), age (years), female sex (vs. male), having ever been imprisoned (vs. not), being registered in a drug abuse clinic (vs. not) and education level (categorical: see supplementary materials) were associated with being an NGO client. For 2009, information on imprisonment was unavailable so data from this year were not included in these models. In a sensitivity analysis, we removed imprisonment and HCV from the model and included the 2009 survey data.</p>
