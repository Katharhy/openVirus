<p>Mixed‐effect logistic regression models with the same structure were used to assess trends between duration of NGO client status (assessed as a continuous variable in years among those with known duration) and various risk behaviour and intervention outcomes. These models were also adjusted for age, except the model with age as the outcome (a mixed‐effect linear regression model). NGO client duration data were unavailable for 2009 so this survey was omitted from these analyses.</p>
