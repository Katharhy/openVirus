<p>To assess for associations between NGO client status and various intervention‐related outcomes around HIV/HCV and their transmission, we used mixed‐effect logistic regression models with year and city as crossed mixed‐effects. In mixed‐effects models the adjusted odds ratios should be interpreted as holding all other variables in the model constant, as well as the random effects for city and year. The use of mixed‐effects models was to account for variation in levels of service provision and epidemiological characteristics between cities and years (and differences between years within cities), without explicitly modelling this. Unadjusted and adjusted associations of the outcomes with NGO client status, age, female sex, having ever been imprisoned, being registered in a drug abuse clinic and education level were assessed.</p>
