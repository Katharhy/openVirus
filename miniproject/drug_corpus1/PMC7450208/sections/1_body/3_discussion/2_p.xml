<p>In this analysis, data from five IBBS in Ukraine spanning 2009 to 2017 showed that PWID in contact with harm reduction NGOs obtained more condoms and new injecting equipment, were more likely to use sterile needles and condoms, and were more likely to be on OAT. These better outcomes were seen despite NGO clients being more marginalized in terms of ever being imprisoned, being poorer, and injecting more frequently. They were also more likely to be HCV positive or HIV positive, with HIV‐positive NGO clients being more engaged in using HIV services than non‐NGO clients. Many of these associations became stronger with longer NGO client duration, which could be due to a dose–response relationship or possibly survivor bias – further research on this topic is required.</p>
