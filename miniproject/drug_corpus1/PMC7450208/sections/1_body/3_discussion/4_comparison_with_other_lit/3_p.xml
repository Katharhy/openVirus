<p>Notably, considering the high imprisonment rates among PWID in this analysis, other studies in Ukraine have highlighted the importance of the prison setting in driving the HIV and HCV epidemics [

A modelling study found that scaling up OAT in Ukraine from the current levels (approximately 2.7% of PWID) to 20% would reduce new HIV infections by 56% and deaths by 49% over 10Â years [
