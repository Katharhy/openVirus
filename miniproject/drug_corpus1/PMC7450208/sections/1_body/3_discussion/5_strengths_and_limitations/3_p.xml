<p>While most questions were the same or similar across years, some questions changed or were unavailable for particular years, especially 2009. Also, while most cities/regions were sampled in all IBBS, some were omitted for certain rounds. HIV viral load was only tested among a subsample of the HIV‐positive PWID (to help estimate HIV incidence) in later surveys so could not be used as a biological marker of successful ART uptake. The analyses were limited to looking at associations rather than causation. While the results for HIV and HCV infection exposure were based on biological testing, all other behaviours and uptake of interventions were based on self‐reported data. These could be affected by a range of biases, such as recall bias, particularly as many questions ask about behaviours over a long timeframe. Social desirability bias could lead to an overestimation of harm reduction practices and an underestimation of risky practices. Despite this, it is uncertain whether there would be differential bias between NGO clients and non‐clients. Another potential limitation is that RDS was used to enrol participants and sample characteristics may change with each survey, although our results are similar with and without RDS weighting. Additionally, the quality of data captured may have improved with each round of the survey due to an increase in expertise of groups (often NGOs) carrying out the survey, which frequently stayed the same across years. However, once again, it remains unclear whether this would differentially affect NGO and non‐NGO clients. There is also the possibility that the question used to determine our main analysis measure, whether or not someone was a client of an NGO, could have been misunderstood by some participants, with some having had contact with NGOs but not being clients. This may mean our results are conservative because NGOs may also have positive outcomes among non‐clients. Carrying out some of the surveys in the offices of organizations that provide services for PWID could also have created information bias where PWID were aware that those carrying out the surveys were linked to NGOs and so preferred to report behaviours that were deemed desirable to the interviewers. Unfortunately, data on survey setting are not available so we could not examine this effect.</p>
