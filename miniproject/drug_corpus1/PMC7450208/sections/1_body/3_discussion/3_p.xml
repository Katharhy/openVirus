<p>Data suggested the use of services by PWID improved over time, with the percentage of PWID ever tested for HIV increasing by half and the percentage of HIV‐positive PWID on ART doubling from 2009/2011 to 2017. The differences in outcomes between NGO and non‐NGO clients also increased between 2011 and 2017, possibly as NGOs became more effective. These results should be considered in light of increases in ART coverage over this time, making interpretation of this trend complicated.</p>
