<p>Globally, there are an estimated 15 million people who inject drugs (PWID), amongst whom there is a high prevalence of HIV (17.8%) and exposure to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (52.3%), primarily due to bloodborne transmission through unsterile injections [
 <xref rid="jia225608-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="jia225608-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>]. Estimates of the global disease burden of HIV due to injecting drug use (IDU) are low (4% globally [
 <xref rid="jia225608-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>]), but high in some regions, whereas for HCV this figure is around 40% for both disease burden [
 <xref rid="jia225608-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>] and incidence [
 <xref rid="jia225608-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>]. Eastern Europe and Central Asia is the only region where the number of HIV infections and HIV‚Äêrelated deaths are increasing [
 <xref rid="jia225608-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>], with this region also having the highest general population prevalence of HCV [
 <xref rid="jia225608-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>]. Ukraine has the second biggest epidemic of both HIV and HCV in the region and in Europe overall [

 <xref rid="jia225608-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>]. In Ukraine, the prevalence of IDU among adults (approximately 1%) is higher than the global average (approximately 0.3%) [
 <xref rid="jia225608-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>], with an estimated 50% and 80% of the HIV and HCV burdens, respectively, being due to IDU [
