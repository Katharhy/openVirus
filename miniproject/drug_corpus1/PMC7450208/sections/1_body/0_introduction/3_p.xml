<p>Due to their high prevalence and incidence of HIV and HCV, PWID, both globally and in Ukraine, require targeted interventions to reduce transmission levels and to provide disease care and treatment. These measures include needle and syringe provision (NSP), opioid agonist therapy (OAT), condom distribution, curative treatment for HCV, and antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV. Evidence shows high coverage of NSP and OAT are effective at reducing HIV and HCV acquisition among PWID [
