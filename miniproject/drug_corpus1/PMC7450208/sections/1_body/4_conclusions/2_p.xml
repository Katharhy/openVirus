NGOs are a major provider of harm reduction services (including needles, syringes and condoms) and testing of HIV and HCV for PWID in Ukraine, whereas the government provides OAT and ART. As of November 2019, support for core NGO services will transition to government funding, with the Global Fund only supporting extended prevention programmes, such as naloxone. Our findings suggest harm reduction NGOs are benefiting PWID in Ukraine by improving access to needles and condoms, increasing OAT uptake, and improving all aspects of the HIV continuum of care. Getting PWID onto ART is crucial for halting the Ukrainian HIV epidemic, whereas harm reduction interventions are crucial for reducing HIV and HCV transmission [
