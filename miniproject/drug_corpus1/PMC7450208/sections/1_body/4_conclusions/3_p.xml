<p>The reduction in Global Fund support for harm reduction NGOs comes during uncertain times for Ukraine. The country has recently emerged from a recession and is still engaged in a war with Russia, resulting in population migration [

 <xref rid="jia225608-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref>]. This situation is exacerbated by the ongoing stigma borne by both PWID and people living with HIV [

 <xref rid="jia225608-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref>]. Additionally, the ongoing COVID‐19 pandemic will likely cause huge disruption to the Ukrainian economy [
 <xref rid="jia225608-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref>]. Against this backdrop of competing priorities for the Ukrainian government, it is important that funding for harm reduction programmes is not reduced, as they are associated with public health benefits [

 <xref rid="jia225608-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">41</xref>], something that will start in October 2020 through support from the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. It is important that these services continue and are expanded because if funding decreases, the HIV and HCV epidemics among PWID could escalate to higher incidence [
