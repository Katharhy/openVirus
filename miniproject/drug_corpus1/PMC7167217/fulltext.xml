These viruses characteristically contain crown-shaped peplomers of 80&#x02013;160&#x000a0;nM size with 27&#x02013;32&#x000a0;kb positive polarity (Woo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2010</xref>; Cui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>). CoVs are pleomorphic and broadly distributed in mammals, especially humans. They have very high recombination rates. Therefore, they are constantly developing transcription errors and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) jumps (Woo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2010</xref>; Cui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">CoVs have a high mutation rate (Cui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>). Zoonotic pathogens (Peiris et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2003</xref>) are present in humans and various animals and can cause clinical problems in the human respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic and neurologic systems with a wide range of asymptomatic strains that lead to hospitalization of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) (Cui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>; Holshue et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>). CoVs used to be considered mild pathogens for humans and are the cause of the common cold (Peiris et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2003</xref>), but they have gained more attention since being connected with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China in 2002 and 2003 with mortality rates of 10% for SARS-CoV (Ksiazek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2003</xref>; Yin and Wunderink <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>). The next of these outbreaks, and its control, occurred approximately 1 decade after SARS-CoV, when another highly pathogenic CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), emerged in Middle Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia with a 37% mortality rate (Yin and Wunderink <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>; Zaki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2012</xref>; Farooq et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>). Since December 8, 2019, a series of cases of pneumonia of of unknown etiologic origin emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China (Zhu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2020</xref>). This problem has been the focus of global attention because of clinical presentations, resembling viral epidemic pneumonia of unknown cause (Shen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2020</xref>; Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>). Most patients worked at or lived near the local Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where livestock animals are traded (Zhu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2020</xref>; Shen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2020</xref>; Imai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">First, an unknown pneumonia case was detected on December 12, 2019, by laboratory testing, and on January 1, 2020, the seafood market was closed (Zhu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2020</xref>). After this, on January 7, a novel coronavirus was identified by the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in a throat swab sample of a patient. This report was released by the Wall Street Journal, and the virus was subsequently named 2019-CoV by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 9 (Tang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2020a</xref>). The first viral genome sequence of 2019-nCoV was released online on January 10, one day after its formal approval, by Dr. Yong-Zhen Zhang and scientists at Fudan University, Shanghai (Wuhan-Hu-1, GenBank accession no. MN908947) (Wu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2020a</xref>). On January 7, 2020, the Chinese higher-ups declared that a new type of coronavirus (novel coronavirus, nCoV) had been isolated (Read et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2020</xref>). This virus changed to COVID-19 on February 11, 2020 (Phan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2020</xref>). As of February 12 to March 1, 2020, 87,137 cases of COVID-19 had been reported and 2979 deaths (World Health Organization, 2019-nCoV Situation Report-41 on 01 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2020</xref>). Although the source of COVID-19 is still unknown, after the first case developed (Phan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2020</xref>; Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020a</xref>), the infection was probably transmitted as a zoonotic agent (from animal to human) (Zhou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2020</xref>). The increase in the number of cases in China and internationally has indicated a second transmission from human to human (Phan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2020</xref>; Gralinski and Menachery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">The geographic distribution of COVID-19 cases worldwide, as of March 1, 2020, is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> (World Health Organization, 2019-nCoV Situation Report-41 on 01 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2020</xref>).

id="Sec2"><title>COVID-19 from SARS to MERS</title><p id="Par6">SARS-CoV, which originated in China and then spread to other parts of the world with hospital-acquired infectious cases, had a mortality rate of 10% and was transmitted to 8000 people during an 8-month outbreak in 2002&#x02013;2003 (Ksiazek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2003</xref>; Yin and Wunderink <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>; Luk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2019</xref>). In 2012, when MERS-CoV emerged in the Arabian Peninsula, it spread to 27 countries with a 35.6% mortality rate in 2220 cases (Yin and Wunderink <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>; Zaki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2012</xref>; Farooq et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>). It is already known that both SARS and MERS are zoonotic viruses showing hospital-acquired and human-to-human transmission (Yin and Wunderink <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>). Similar dynamics apply to this new strain named COVID-19 (CoVs), detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019, and the current rate of mortality is about 2% (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>; Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>). It is also known that CoVs can use different receptors and pathways when entering the cell (Tortorici et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">While SARS-CoV usually infects the youngest (Luk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2019</xref>), MERS-CoV targets people aged &#x0003e; 50&#x000a0;years (Yin and Wunderink <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>), and COVID-19 infects middle-aged groups and above (Phan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2020</xref>). Comparing non-respiratory complications, MERS-CoV involves the cardiovascular system more frequently than SARS-CoV and frequently requires vasopressor treatment (Cui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>; Yin and Wunderink <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>). On the other hand, some case reports have shown that COVID-19 affects the cardiovascular system (Lu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020</xref>; Cao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2020</xref>). Acute kidney failure was more frequently observed in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics compared with COVID-19 cases (Farooq et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>; Luk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2019</xref>). Whereas radiologic findings are present in all three pathogens, airspace opacifications are seen in SARS-CoV and a ground-glass appearance in MERS-CoV and COVID-19 (Yin and Wunderink <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>; Jin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">Hospital-acquired secondary infections have been described for all three pathogens (Cui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>). Despite the knowledge about its etiology, no studies have reported a successful drug to treat the diagnosed patients (Wu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2020b</xref>; Nguyen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2020</xref>). Regarding the epidemic periods, SARS-CoV has had the shortest reported epidemic period so far, ending less than a year after its outbreak (Luk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2019</xref>), and the MERS-CoV epidemic lasted for 7 years even though its spread was toward a more restricted area (Farooq et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>). The questions that follow are how long this novel COVID-19 strain outburst will last and what its impact on the world population will be, questions everyone is curious about.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Virus genome and structure</title><p id="Par9">CoVs are the best-known genome structure among all RNA viruses (Woo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2010</xref>). Two-thirds of their RNA has viral polymerase (RdRp), RNA synthesis materials and two large non-structural polyproteins that are not involved in host response modulation (ORF1a-ORF1b) (Jordan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2018</xref>). One-third of the genome encodes four structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), as well as other helper proteins (Lu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020</xref>; Paraskevis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>). Even though the length of the CoV genome showed high variability for ORF1a/ORF1b and four structural proteins (Jordan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2018</xref>; Paraskevis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>), it is mostly associated with the number and size of accessory proteins (Cui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>; Tortorici et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2019</xref>). The first step in virus infection was the interaction of sensitive human cells with S protein (Tortorici et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2019</xref>; Cao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2020</xref>). Genome encoding occurs after entering the cell and facilitates the expression of the genes (Cui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>), which encode useful accessory proteins (Tortorici et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2019</xref>), and these advance the adaptation of CoVs to their human host (Lu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020</xref>). Genome changes resulting from recombination, gene exchange, gene insertion or deletion have been frequent among CoVs, and this will take place in future outbreaks as well (Paraskevis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>). The CoV subfamily is rapidly expanding with new generation sequencing applications that improve the detection and definition of novel CoV species (Read et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2020</xref>). Briefly, CoV classification is continually changing. According to the most recent ranking of the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), there are 4 genera of 38 unique species (Cui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Pathogenesis</title><p id="Par10">SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV attach to the host cell respectively bind to cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (SARS-CoV associated) and cellular receptor of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (MERS-CoV associated) (Tortorici et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2019</xref>; Park et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2019</xref>; Letko et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2020</xref>). The viral RNA replicates in the cytoplasm after entering the cell (Letko et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2020</xref>). Genomic RNA is encapsulated and polyadenylated, and it encodes various structural and non-structural polypeptide genes (Cui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>; Subissi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2014</xref>). These polyproteins are split by proteases that exhibit chymotrypsin-like activity (Subissi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2014</xref>; Goo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020</xref>). The resulting complex drives (&#x02212;) RNA production through both replication and transcription (Jordan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2018</xref>). During replication, full-length (&#x02212;) RNA copies of the genome are produced and used as a template for full-length (+) RNA genomes (Cui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>; Jordan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2018</xref>). During transcription, a subset of 7&#x02013;9 sub-genomic RNAs, including those encoding all structural proteins, are produced by discontinuous transcription (Cui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>; Jordan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2018</xref>). Viral nucleocapsids are combined from genomic RNA and R protein in the cytoplasm and then are budded into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (Cui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>). Virions are then released from the infected cell through exocytosis (Cui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>). The released viruses can infect kidney cells, liver cells, the intestines and T lymphocytes, as well as the lower respiratory tract, where they cause the main symptoms and signs. Remarkably, CDT lymphocytes were found to be &#x0003c; 200 cells/mm3 in three patients with SARS-CoV infection (Cui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>; Luk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2019</xref>; Paraskevis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>). MERS-CoV can affect human dendritic cells, macrophages and T lymphocytes. This virus can make the antiviral T cell response irregular because of the stimulation of T cell apoptosis, thus causing a collapse of the immune system (Farooq et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>; Park et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2019</xref>; Goo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020</xref>; Cockrell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Epidemiology</title><p id="Par11">In December 2019, many pneumonia cases clustered in Wuhan were reported, and a search determined the source to be the Huanan seafood market (Chan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2020</xref>). The first patient of the COVID-19 epidemic was discovered with unexplained pneumonia on December 12, 2019, and 27 viral pneumonia cases, 7 severe, were officially made known on December 31, 2019 (Zhu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2020</xref>; Tang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2020a</xref>). Etiologic investigations were made into patients who applied to the hospital for similar viral pneumonia findings (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>). The natural history of high-risk animal contact in the medical histories of these patients has strengthened the likelihood of an infection transmitted from animals to humans (Wu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2020a</xref>; Zhou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2020</xref>). On January 22, 2020, novel CoVs were confirmed to originate from wild bats and belong to Group 2 of the beta-coronaviruses, which includes severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Paraskevis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>). Although COVID-19 and SARS-CoV belonged to the same beta coronavirus subgroup, genome-level similarities were only 70%, because the novel group has been found to show genetic differences from SARS-CoV (Lu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020</xref>; Paraskevis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>). The outbreak of the SARS epidemic and COVID-19 occurred during the Spring Festival in China (SFC), the country's most famous traditional festival, during which nearly 3 billion people travel countrywide (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>; Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020a</xref>). These situations caused ideal conditions for the transmission of this highly contagious disease and severe difficulties in prevention and control of the epidemic (Read et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2020</xref>). The SFC lasted from January 17 to February 23 in 2003, when the SARS epidemic peaked, and in 2020 January 10 to February 18 was the time of the SFC (Peiris et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2003</xref>). Similarly, there was a quick increase in COVID-19 cases between January 10&#x02013;22 (Read et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Transmission</title><p id="Par12">CoVs have been defined as a novel respiratory tract virus in the samples collected from individuals who presented symptoms of respiratory tract infection in 1962 (Cui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>). CoVs are a large family of viruses that are common in many different animal species, including camels, cattle, cats and bats (Cui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>). Rarely, animal CoVs can infect humans and, as a result, may spread among humans during epidemics such as MERS, SARS and COVID-19 (Wu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2020a</xref>). At the onset of significant outbreaks caused by CoVs, palm civets have been proposed to be a natural reservoir of human CoVs for SARS and dromedary camels for MERS (Cui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>; Yin and Wunderink <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par13">Conversely, more advanced virologic and genetic studies have shown that bats are reservoir hosts of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Yin and Wunderink <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>), and before these viruses spread to humans (Cui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>), they use the other animals as intermediate hosts. Studies have reported that most of the bat CoVs are the gene source of alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, whereas most of the bird CoVs are the gene source of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs (Zhou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2020</xref>). Recent studies have shown that the novel virus causing epidemics coincides with the CoV isolated in bats (Wu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2020a</xref>; Zhou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2020</xref>; Drexler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2010</xref>). The presence of the wild animal trade in the Huanan seafood market, where the first cases appeared, supports this finding (Wu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2020a</xref>; Zhou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par14">After the first outbreak, secondary cases began to be reported after approximately 10 days (Wu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2020c</xref>). Moreover, while these new patients had no contact with the marketplace, they had a history of contact with humans there (Wu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2020c</xref>). Confirmed recent reports from many infected healthcare workers in Wuhan show that human-to-human transmission can occur (Chan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2020</xref>). As in SARS and MERS epidemics in the past, human-to-human transmission has accelerated the spread of the outbreak, and case reports have also started from other provinces in China (Luk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2019</xref>). The first non-Chinese case of the infection, which spread to the Chinese provinces, and then to the Asian continent, was reported from Thailand on January 13, 2020 (World Health Organization, 2019-nCoV Situation Report-41 on 01 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2020</xref>). The patient reported being a Chinese tourist who had traveled to Thailand and had no epidemiologic connection with the marketplace (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020a</xref>). Other evidence from overseas countries such as the USA (Holshue et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>) and France has continued to be reported (Stoecklin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2020</xref>). This virus disseminated to the Midle Eastern region; for example, Iran was a region with potential to develop a major epidemiologic problem for healthcare (Zamani Ghaleshahi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2020</xref>; Tuite et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2020</xref>). This virus has the potential to become a pandemic problem (MacIntyre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par15">Frequently, close contact leads to human-to-human transmission (Chan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2020</xref>). The transmission primarily occurs when an infected person sneezes and through the respiratory droplets produced, like in the spread of influenza and other respiratory pathogens (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>; Read et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2020</xref>). These droplets can settle in the mouth or nasal mucosa and lungs of people with inhaled air (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020a</xref>). Currently, it remains unclear whether COVID-19 can infect a person by touching an infected surface or object and then touching their mouth, nose or possibly eyes (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>; Phan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par16">Typically, like most respiratory viruses, it is considered to be the most contagious when people are most symptomatic (Phan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2020</xref>). However, patients who were infected by an asymptomatic person in the prodromal period of COVID-19 have also been reported (Jin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2020</xref>). Sufficient data are not available on the infectiousness of the disease, and research is ongoing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Diagnosis</title><p id="Par17">Before the cases of SARS-CoV, it was thought that human CoVs lead to a cold-like upper respiratory infection and self-limiting lower respiratory infection (Yin and Wunderink <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>). The first death due to coronaviruses was reported by the isolation of SARS-CoV from a patient with pneumonia in China (Ksiazek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2003</xref>). As in other respiratory infection viruses and previous beta-CoVs, there are similarities in the clinical aspects of COVID-19 infections, and it is known that the clinical picture varies from simple respiratory infections to septic shock (Gralinski and Menachery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2020</xref>). Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which have caused epidemics in the past years (Yin and Wunderink <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>), the first symptoms are commonly fever, cough and shortness of breath (Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>). Although diarrhea was present in about 20&#x02013;25% of patients with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection (Yin and Wunderink <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>), intestinal symptoms have rarely been reported in patients with COVID-19 (Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>). In another study, which included 99 patients, chest pain, confusion and nausea-vomiting were noted in addition to previous findings (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>). On x-rays or thorax CT imaging of the examined patients, unilateral or bilateral involvement compatible with viral pneumonia was found, and bilateral multiple lobular and sub-segmental consolidation areas were observed in patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>; Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>; Tang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2020b</xref>).</p><p id="Par18">In a cohort study that surveyed 41 hospitalized patients, fever, dry cough, myalgia and fatigue symptoms were reported in most patients; less often, symptoms of expectoration, headache, hemoptysis and diarrhea were also observed (Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>). According to the study, comorbidities such as underlying diabetes mellitus, hypertension and cardiovascular disease were found in about half of these patients (Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>). In addition, patients developed dyspnea accompanied by abnormal thorax CT compatible with pneumonia at mean 8 days after admission (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>). Complications include ARDS, acute heart damage, secondary infections and pneumothorax. Similar to the previous data, x-rays or thorax CT images of the patients revealed unilateral or bilateral lung involvement, compatible with viral pneumonia. Bilateral multiple lobular and sub-segmental consolidation areas were present in patients in the intensive care unit (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>; Gralinski and Menachery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2020</xref>; Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>; Jin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2020</xref>).

The diagnostic tools are molecular methods, serology and viral culture (Gralinski and Menachery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2020</xref>; Jin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2020</xref>; Corman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>). The most common diagnostic methods are molecular methods such as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or real-time PCR, which are made using RNA from respiratory samples such as oropharyngeal swabs, sputum, nasopharyngeal aspirates, deep tracheal aspirates or broncho-alveolar lavage (Corman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>). In particular, lower respiratory tract samples can offer a significantly higher viral load and genome fraction than upper respiratory tract samples. These techniques are beneficial in terms of evaluating the results quickly, showing the genome structure and viral load (Corman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par20">The sensitivity of antibody detection is generally lower than that of molecular methods and is mostly used in retrospective diagnosis (Goo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020</xref>; Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020b</xref>). Viral culture is a more time-consuming method compared with the other methods. Culture is much more useful in the first stage of outbreaks before other diagnostic methods become clinically available. In addition, viral cultures can be used in the in-vitro and in-vivo antiviral treatment and vaccine evaluation trials (Jin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2020</xref>; Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Prevention and treatment</title><p id="Par21">In general, there are few or no treatment options for viral diseases of sudden occurrence (Nguyen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2020</xref>). Today, there is no vaccine or effective treatment to prevent COVID-19 infection (Nguyen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2020</xref>). Molecules are being tested for COVID-19 in in-vitro and human-based SARS-CoV, and MERS-Cov trials, and studies evaluating the antiviral activity of types I and II interferons have reported interferon-beta (IFNb) as the most potent interferon, which reduced in-vitro MERS-CoV replication (Nguyen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2020</xref>; Arabi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2018</xref>). According to a human MERS-CoV case report from South Korea, use of the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) (anti-HIV drugs), pegylated interferon and ribavirin provided successful viral clearance (Arabi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2018</xref>). Another antiviral drug, remdesivir, was used in the first case reported in the USA, and it seemed successful; however, more cases are needed (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2020</xref>).
