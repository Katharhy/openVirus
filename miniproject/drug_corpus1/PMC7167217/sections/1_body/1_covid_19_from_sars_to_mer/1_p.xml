<p id="Par6">SARS-CoV, which originated in China and then spread to other parts of the world with hospital-acquired infectious cases, had a mortality rate of 10% and was transmitted to 8000 people during an 8-month outbreak in 2002â€“2003 (Ksiazek et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>; Luk et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2019</xref>). In 2012, when MERS-CoV emerged in the Arabian Peninsula, it spread to 27 countries with a 35.6% mortality rate in 2220 cases (Yin and Wunderink

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>). Similar dynamics apply to this new strain named COVID-19 (CoVs), detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019, and the current rate of mortality is about 2% (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>; Huang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>). It is also known that CoVs can use different receptors and pathways when entering the cell (Tortorici et al.
