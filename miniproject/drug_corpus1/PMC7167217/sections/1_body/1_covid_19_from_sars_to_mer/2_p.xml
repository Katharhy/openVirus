<p id="Par7">While SARS-CoV usually infects the youngest (Luk et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2019</xref>), MERS-CoV targets people aged &gt; 50Â years (Yin and Wunderink 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>), and COVID-19 infects middle-aged groups and above (Phan 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2020</xref>). Comparing non-respiratory complications, MERS-CoV involves the cardiovascular system more frequently than SARS-CoV and frequently requires vasopressor treatment (Cui et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>; Yin and Wunderink 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>). On the other hand, some case reports have shown that COVID-19 affects the cardiovascular system (Lu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020</xref>; Cao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2020</xref>). Acute kidney failure was more frequently observed in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics compared with COVID-19 cases (Farooq et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>; Luk et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2019</xref>). Whereas radiologic findings are present in all three pathogens, airspace opacifications are seen in SARS-CoV and a ground-glass appearance in MERS-CoV and COVID-19 (Yin and Wunderink 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>; Jin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2020</xref>).
