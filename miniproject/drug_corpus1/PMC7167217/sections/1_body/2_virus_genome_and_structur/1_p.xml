<p id="Par9">CoVs are the best-known genome structure among all RNA viruses (Woo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2010</xref>). Two-thirds of their RNA has viral polymerase (RdRp), RNA synthesis materials and two large non-structural polyproteins that are not involved in host response modulation (ORF1a-ORF1b) (Jordan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2018</xref>). One-third of the genome encodes four structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), as well as other helper proteins (Lu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020</xref>; Paraskevis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>). Even though the length of the CoV genome showed high variability for ORF1a/ORF1b and four structural proteins (Jordan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2018</xref>; Paraskevis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>), it is mostly associated with the number and size of accessory proteins (Cui et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>; Tortorici et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2019</xref>). The first step in virus infection was the interaction of sensitive human cells with S protein (Tortorici et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2019</xref>; Cao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2020</xref>). Genome encoding occurs after entering the cell and facilitates the expression of the genes (Cui et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>), which encode useful accessory proteins (Tortorici et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2019</xref>), and these advance the adaptation of CoVs to their human host (Lu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020</xref>). Genome changes resulting from recombination, gene exchange, gene insertion or deletion have been frequent among CoVs, and this will take place in future outbreaks as well (Paraskevis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>). The CoV subfamily is rapidly expanding with new generation sequencing applications that improve the detection and definition of novel CoV species (Read et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2020</xref>). Briefly, CoV classification is continually changing. According to the most recent ranking of the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), there are 4 genera of 38 unique species (Cui et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>).
