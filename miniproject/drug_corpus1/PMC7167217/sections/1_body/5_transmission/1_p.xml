<p id="Par12">CoVs have been defined as a novel respiratory tract virus in the samples collected from individuals who presented symptoms of respiratory tract infection in 1962 (Cui et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>). CoVs are a large family of viruses that are common in many different animal species, including camels, cattle, cats and bats (Cui et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>). Rarely, animal CoVs can infect humans and, as a result, may spread among humans during epidemics such as MERS, SARS and COVID-19 (Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2020a</xref>). At the onset of significant outbreaks caused by CoVs, palm civets have been proposed to be a natural reservoir of human CoVs for SARS and dromedary camels for MERS (Cui et al.
