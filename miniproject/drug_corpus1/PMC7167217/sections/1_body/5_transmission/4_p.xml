<p id="Par15">Frequently, close contact leads to human-to-human transmission (Chan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2020</xref>). The transmission primarily occurs when an infected person sneezes and through the respiratory droplets produced, like in the spread of influenza and other respiratory pathogens (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>; Read et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2020</xref>). These droplets can settle in the mouth or nasal mucosa and lungs of people with inhaled air (Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020a</xref>). Currently, it remains unclear whether COVID-19 can infect a person by touching an infected surface or object and then touching their mouth, nose or possibly eyes (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>; Phan
