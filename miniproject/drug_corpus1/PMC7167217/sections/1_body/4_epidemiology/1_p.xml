<p id="Par11">In December 2019, many pneumonia cases clustered in Wuhan were reported, and a search determined the source to be the Huanan seafood market (Chan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2020</xref>). The first patient of the COVID-19 epidemic was discovered with unexplained pneumonia on December 12, 2019, and 27 viral pneumonia cases, 7 severe, were officially made known on December 31, 2019 (Zhu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2020</xref>; Tang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2020a</xref>). Etiologic investigations were made into patients who applied to the hospital for similar viral pneumonia findings (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>). The natural history of high-risk animal contact in the medical histories of these patients has strengthened the likelihood of an infection transmitted from animals to humans (Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2020a</xref>; Zhou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2020</xref>). On January 22, 2020, novel CoVs were confirmed to originate from wild bats and belong to Group 2 of the beta-coronaviruses, which includes severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Paraskevis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>). Although COVID-19 and SARS-CoV belonged to the same beta coronavirus subgroup, genome-level similarities were only 70%, because the novel group has been found to show genetic differences from SARS-CoV (Lu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020</xref>; Paraskevis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>). The outbreak of the SARS epidemic and COVID-19 occurred during the Spring Festival in China (SFC), the country's most famous traditional festival, during which nearly 3 billion people travel countrywide (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>; Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020a</xref>). These situations caused ideal conditions for the transmission of this highly contagious disease and severe difficulties in prevention and control of the epidemic (Read et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2020</xref>). The SFC lasted from January 17 to February 23 in 2003, when the SARS epidemic peaked, and in 2020 January 10 to February 18 was the time of the SFC (Peiris et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2003</xref>). Similarly, there was a quick increase in COVID-19 cases between January 10â€“22 (Read et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2020</xref>).
