<p id="Par19">As in SARS and MERS, the diagnosis of 2019n-CoV infection is based on a history of detailed contact and travel and precise laboratory testing (Jin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2020</xref>). The diagnostic tools are molecular methods, serology and viral culture (Gralinski and Menachery

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2020</xref>; Corman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>). The most common diagnostic methods are molecular methods such as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or real-time PCR, which are made using RNA from respiratory samples such as oropharyngeal swabs, sputum, nasopharyngeal aspirates, deep tracheal aspirates or broncho-alveolar lavage (Corman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>). In particular, lower respiratory tract samples can offer a significantly higher viral load and genome fraction than upper respiratory tract samples. These techniques are beneficial in terms of evaluating the results quickly, showing the genome structure and viral load (Corman et al.
