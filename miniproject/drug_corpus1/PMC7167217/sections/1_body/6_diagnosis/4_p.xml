<p id="Par20">The sensitivity of antibody detection is generally lower than that of molecular methods and is mostly used in retrospective diagnosis (Goo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020</xref>; Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020b</xref>). Viral culture is a more time-consuming method compared with the other methods. Culture is much more useful in the first stage of outbreaks before other diagnostic methods become clinically available. In addition, viral cultures can be used in the in-vitro and in-vivo antiviral treatment and vaccine evaluation trials (Jin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2020</xref>; Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020b</xref>).
