<p id="Par4">First, an unknown pneumonia case was detected on December 12, 2019, by laboratory testing, and on January 1, 2020, the seafood market was closed (Zhu et al.

After this, on January 7, a novel coronavirus was identified by the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in a throat swab sample of a patient. This report was released by the Wall Street Journal, and the virus was subsequently named 2019-CoV by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 9 (Tang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2020a</xref>). The first viral genome sequence of 2019-nCoV was released online on January 10, one day after its formal approval, by Dr. Yong-Zhen Zhang and scientists at Fudan University, Shanghai (Wuhan-Hu-1, GenBank accession no. MN908947) (Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2020a</xref>). On January 7, 2020, the Chinese higher-ups declared that a new type of coronavirus (novel coronavirus, nCoV) had been isolated (Read et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2020</xref>). This virus changed to COVID-19 on February 11, 2020 (Phan

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2020</xref>). Although the source of COVID-19 is still unknown, after the first case developed (Phan 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2020</xref>; Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020a</xref>), the infection was probably transmitted as a zoonotic agent (from animal to human) (Zhou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2020</xref>). The increase in the number of cases in China and internationally has indicated a second transmission from human to human (Phan
