  <p>Pathophysiology of COVID-19. The virus can be transmitted via person-to-person contact through (1) the fecal-oral route and or (2) respiratory droplets. (3) The virion enters through the mouth, nose or eyes and (4) infects the alveoli of the lungs. (5) The COVID-19 spike protein binds to ACE-2 on type 2 pneumocytes. (6) COVID-19 releases its genetic material (+ssRNA) for processing. (7) the host machinery, +ssRNA is translated into polyproteins (8), which are further cleaved by proteinases into the different components of the virus. (9) More RNA copies are synthesized by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. (10) Proteins and RNA are assembled into a new virion in the Golgi apparatus, which is then (11) released. (12) These processes stimulate the release of cytokines and other proteolytic enzymes, which cause various complications such as consolidation and (13) pneumonia.</p>
