<p>COVID-19 has become one of the most dangerous pandemics in recent history. The pandemic has claimed more than 740,000 lives, with more than 20 million reported cases since the original outbreak. The disease is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a zoonotic pathogen that acquired mutations as it crossed the species barrier from bat to pangolin enabling it to infect humans.

 </sup> SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed as a novel coronavirus using molecular methods and initially named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

 </sup> The disease caused by this virus was later renamed COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO).

 </sup> SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious and has spread to more than 200 countries in all continents. Hence, the virus was declared a global threat (pandemic) by the WHO. SARS-CoV-2 has a single-stranded positive sense RNA genome (+ssRNA) approximately 30 kb long. The SARS-CoV-2 genome is organized similarly to those of SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV.

 </sup> Using phylogenetic analysis, the SARS-CoV-2 genome was demonstrated to share 96% sequence similarity with a bat CoV genome. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the β-coronavirus genus that includes SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV.

 </sup> The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and pneumonia, which makes the disease enormously dangerous with a high case fatality rate.

 </sup> In contrast to other β-coronaviruses, many SARS-CoV-2 deaths have resulted from multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MSOF) rather than respiratory failure.

 </sup> This could be attributed to the widespread distribution of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), the primary receptor for SARS coronaviruses, in multiple organs.

 </sup> ACE-2 is expressed as a cell-surface molecule in the respiratory tract (epithelium, arterial and venous endothelium), the small intestinal epithelium, and arterial smooth muscle cells.
