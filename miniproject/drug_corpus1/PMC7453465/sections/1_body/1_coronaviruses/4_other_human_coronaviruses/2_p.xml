<p>Generally, the most common diagnostic tools for human CoVs are molecular detection techniques such as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT‚ÄêPCR) using RNA extracted from respiratory tract samples as template. Other methods include serological tests and viral cultures.

 </sup> Although several agents against CoVs, including antibodies, antiviral peptides, and cell or viral protease inhibitors, have been shown to be effective both

 </sup> Therefore, clinical treatments for CoVs are still lacking. Nevertheless, supportive and symptomatic therapy are used for treatment. Interferons, ribavirin, lopinavir/ritonavir, and cyclophilin inhibitors are the most commonly administered antiviral agents as elements of combination therapies.

 </sup> Type I interferons were reportedly used against MERS-CoV in various cell lines and in rhesus macaques. Interferon-alpha 2b and ribavirin have a synergistic effect on SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV in cell cultures.
