<p>Other important human CoVs include alpha‐CoVs (HCoV‐229E and HCoV‐NL63) and two beta‐CoVs (HCoV‐OC43 and HCoV‐HKU1). The receptor for HCoV‐229E is human aminopeptidase N (CD13), a cell‐surface metalloprotease present on cells of the kidney and lung, as well as on epithelial and intestinal cells. The receptor for HCoV‐NL63 is also ACE-2. The receptor for HCoV‐OC43 is 9‐
 <italic>O</italic>‐acetylated sialic acid, while no receptor has been identified for HCoV‐HKU1.
