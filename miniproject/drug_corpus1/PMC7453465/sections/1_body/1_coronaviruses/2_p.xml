<p>CoVs are enveloped viruses with +ssRNA genomes. They have the largest genomes (approximately 26–33 kb) among RNA viruses. All CoVs possess non-segmented genomes with similar organization.

 </sup> Generally, about two-thirds of the genome consists of two large and overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab and subsequently processed to yield 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1 to nsp16).

 </sup> The remaining one-third of the genome consists of ORFs encoding structural proteins including the spike (S) glycoprotein embedded in the envelope and the envelope (E), matrix (M), and nucleoproteins (N).

 </sup> There are short untranslated regions at both the 3ʹ and 5ʹ ends. The S protein plays a role in receptor-binding and entry of virus into host cells and is thus considered a major therapeutic target. The M and E proteins are important for viral assembly, while the N protein is necessary for synthesis of RNA.
