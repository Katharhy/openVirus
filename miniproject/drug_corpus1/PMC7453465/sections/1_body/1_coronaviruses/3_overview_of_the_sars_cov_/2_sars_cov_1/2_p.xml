<p>The SARS-CoV-1 genome is 29,727 nucleotides in length. The 5สน end of the genome contains ORF1a and ORF1b. The polyproteins encoded by these ORF are auto-catalytically processed to yield a number of viral proteases as well as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The remainder of the genome encodes the viral structural proteins (S, E, M and N) as well as several accessory proteins.
