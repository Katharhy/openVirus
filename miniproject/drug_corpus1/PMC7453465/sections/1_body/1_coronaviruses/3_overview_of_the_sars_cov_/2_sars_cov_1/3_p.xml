<p>The receptor for SARS-CoVs is ACE-2, a surface molecule found on cells of the respiratory tract, the small intestinal epithelium, and smooth muscle. In the respiratory tract, ACE-2 is expressed on epithelial cells of the alveoli, bronchi, trachea, and bronchial serous glands, as well as on alveolar monocytes and macrophages. The ACE-2 enzyme plays an important role in protection against lung failure.
