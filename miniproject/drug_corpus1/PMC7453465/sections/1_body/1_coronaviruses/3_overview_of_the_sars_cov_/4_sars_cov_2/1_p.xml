 </sup> The SARS-CoV-2 genetic material is surrounded by a lipid-bilayer envelope. Other structural components include the nucleocapsids, membrane, envelope, and hemagglutinin. Unlike the envelope, the membrane exists in higher quantities within the virions.

 </sup> Among other functions, the envelope serves to release viral particles from the host cells.
