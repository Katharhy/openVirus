<p>The receptor for MERS-CoV is dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4 or CD26). DPP4 is a multifunctional cell surface protein and is expressed on the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, liver, kidney, small intestine, and prostate, as well as on activated white blood cells. DPP4 also plays a vital role in activation of T cells and providing co-stimulatory signals for immune responses of T cells.

 </sup> Consequently, MERS-CoV causes acute pneumonia and renal dysfunction with associated clinical symptoms such as cough, chest pain, sore throat, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. MERS-CoV can infect human dendritic cells and macrophages
