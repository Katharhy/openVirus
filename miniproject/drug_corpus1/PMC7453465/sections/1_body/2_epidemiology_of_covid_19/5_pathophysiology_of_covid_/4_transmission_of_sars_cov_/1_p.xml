<p>There is continued research by multiple groups into the mechanism of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the eyes. Investigations were necessary because health care providers, including a Perking University Physician, may have contracted the virus while not wearing eye protection when treating patients.

 </sup> Some researchers have asserted that avoidance of touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed or unsterilized hands can reduce COVID-19 transmission. The mucous membranes that line various cavities in the body are generally most susceptible to viral transmission.

 </sup> Ocular symptoms such as viral conjunctivitis can result from SARS-CoV-2 upper respiratory tract infections.

 </sup> This was confirmed in 9 of 1,099 patients in China.

 </sup> Other research also found that 1 of 30 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were diagnosed with conjunctivitis.

 </sup> In a study conducted by the American Optometric Association, COVID-19 was linked to ocular signs and symptoms including photophobia, irritation, conjunctival infection and ocular discharge.

 </sup> Thus, the superficial blood vessels of the conjunctiva are an alleged route of exposure and transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
