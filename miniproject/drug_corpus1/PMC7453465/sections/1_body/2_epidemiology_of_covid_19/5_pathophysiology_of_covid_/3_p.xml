<p>Inflammatory mediators further stimulate neutrophils, which release reactive oxygen species and proteases. This process damages the alveoli (both type 1 and 2), leading to consolidation and alveolar collapse. High levels of IL-1 and IL-6 travel through the blood to the central nervous system, instructing the hypothalamus to release prostaglandins and causing fever. Severe lung inflammation leads to systemic inflammatory respiratory syndrome. Progression can lead to increased capillary permeability. The overall blood volume decreases, and through a series of processes involving hypotension and decreased perfusion of multiple different organs, multiple system organ failure (MSOF) can occur. During MSOF, elevated levels of blood urea, nitrogen, and creatinine accrue in the kidney. The liver also releases specific inflammatory and acute phase response biomolecules (aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, bilirubin, C-reactive Protein [CRP], fibrinogen and IL-6) that can serve as biomarkers for patients with COVID-19.</p>
