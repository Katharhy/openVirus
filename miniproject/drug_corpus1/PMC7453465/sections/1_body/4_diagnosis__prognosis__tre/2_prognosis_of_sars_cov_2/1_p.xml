<p>Although the risk factors for COVID-19 remain unclear, some risk factors put patients at a significantly higher risk of mortality, especially in individuals with underlying conditions.

 </sup> COVID-19 mortality rates increase with advancing age, and are especially high in those aged &gt;60 years. Elevated inflammatory markers in response to tissue damage (elevated levels of D-dimer, ferritin, creatine kinase-MB, and troponin) have been associated with higher mortality rates.
