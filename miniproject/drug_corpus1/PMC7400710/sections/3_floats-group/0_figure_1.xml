  <p>Distribution of haplotypes per gene in the different countries. (
   <bold>A</bold>). Gene E showed only three haplotypes, and haplotype 1 was the most frequent in the region (
   <bold>B</bold>). Gene N showed 25 different haplotypes, where haplotypes 1, 2, 5, and 7 were the most frequent in the region. (
   <bold>C</bold>). Gene RdRp showed 101 haplotypes, and was the most diverse gene used in the molecular diagnosis. The trees on the left of each panel show the relationships of the haplotypes, and the black dots indicate well-supported nodes (Bootstrap over 80%).
