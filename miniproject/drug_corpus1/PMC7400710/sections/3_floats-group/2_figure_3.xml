  <p>Multiple alignments of the RdRp gene sequences. There were several polymorphisms identified in the annealing regions of the primers of three schemes (black arrows) (Corman, Jung, and Pasteur). The position in the reference sequence Wuhan-Hu-1 (NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_045512.2) are indicated below in each haplotype alignment. The trees on the left of each panel show the relationships of the haplotypes, and the black dots indicate well-supported nodes (Bootstrap over 80%).</p>
