  <p>Multiple alignments of the N gene sequences. There were several polymorphisms identified in the annealing regions of the primers of three schemes (black arrows) (Corman, Jung, and CDC). The position in the reference sequence Wuhan-Hu-1 (NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_045512.2) are indicated below in each haplotype alignment. The trees on the left of each panel show the relationships of the haplotypes, and the black dots indicate well-supported nodes (Bootstrap over 80%).</p>
