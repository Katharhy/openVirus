  <p>Relationships and nucleotide diversity of SARS-CoV2 genomes reported in South American countries. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Maximum likelihood tree of SARS-CoV2 genomes reported in GISAID database. The black dots represent well-supported nodes; (
   <bold>B</bold>) Nucleotide diversity per genome position determined from whole genome alignment of analyzed genomes. Whole genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 strain (NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_045512.2) was included as a reference sequence for tree reconstruction, as well as nucleotide diversity analysis. This tree was constructed with the available genomes by 15 June, where to date (8 July 2020), around 687 new genomes are available.
