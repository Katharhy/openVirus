<p>The conservation of genomic targets of SARS-CoV-2 for molecular tests was evaluated in this study. As a first step, a revision about different schemes to detect viral infection by reverse real-time PCR was conducted, where we identified sets of primers and probes directed to the E, N, and RdRp genes (
 <xref rid="pathogens-09-00580-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In parallel, whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 reported from South American countries were downloaded from the EpiCoVTM database of Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) by 15 June 2020 [
 <xref rid="B16-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], the most complete repository of genomic data of the pandemic coronavirus causing COVID-19. The complete set of 373 sequences was aligned using MAFFT v7.407 with an FFT-NS-2 algorithm and default parameter settings [

 <xref rid="B18-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The sequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 was included as a reference (access number NC_045512.2). The nucleotide diversity was determined at whole genome level from the alignment of selected genomes. A whole genome phylogenetic analysis was built in IQtree [
 <xref rid="B2-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], considering IGT as the substitution model. The phylogenetic reconstruction was visualized in the interactive tool, Tree Of Life V4 (

 <xref rid="B19-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], considering the annotation of the isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (

Each sub-alignment was manually verified to remove sequences with Ns, unidentified positions (denoted with the IUPAC code), and gaps. The "good sequence" alignment by genes (N, E, and RdRp) was used to identify nucleotide and haplotype diversity using DnaSP 5.10 software [
 <xref rid="B20-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A representative sequence by haplotype was used to construct a haplotype alignment, and then trees were generated using FastTree double precision version 2.1.10 [
 <xref rid="B21-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and visualized in the interactive tool, Tree Of Life V4 (

 <xref rid="B22-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The genomic regions targeted for each scheme (primers+probe) were subsequently inspected, loading the alignment as metadata.
