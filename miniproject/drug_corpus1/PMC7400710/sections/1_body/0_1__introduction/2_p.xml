<p>To date, seven coronaviruses are known to infect humans—HKU1, NL63, OC43, and 229E, which have been associated to mild respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the novel emerging SARS-CoV-2, which share similar zoonotic features and are linked to severe disease outcomes, often in the context of epidemic and pandemic settings [
 <xref rid="B6-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The latter three, aside from sharing their host-switching capacity and zoonotic origin, have also shown a propensity for increased pathogenicity. Such features are intimately related to complex evolutionary mechanisms, including high mutation rates and recombination signals that favor their adaptation process to different species [

 <xref rid="B3-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. After all diversity as seen in most emerging coronaviruses is a feature of host-switching viruses throughout their evolutionary paths. In the last two decades, the spillover of SARS-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in China (2002–2003), and MERS-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the Middle East (2012–2016) have shown the deleterious effect of coronaviruses crossing the species barrier, their devastating effects on human health, and global impact following pandemic spreads [
