<p>The Coronaviridae comprises a large family of pathogenic viruses that are generally transmitted person-to-person through respiratory secretions or the fecal-oral route, but may also spread through zoonotic transmission [
 <xref rid="B1-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Members of this family are generally spherical and slightly pleomorphic, ranging from 80 to 120 nm in diameter and covered by distinct projections, known as peplomers [
 <xref rid="B2-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Coronaviruses (COVs) are enveloped positive-sense, single-stranded (ssRNA+) viruses [
 <xref rid="B2-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] which are known to harbor the largest genomes amongst all known RNA viruses (27–32 kb) [
 <xref rid="B2-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Overall, the genomic makeup of COVs embraces a variable number of small open-reading frames (ORFs) intercalated among different structural genes (ORF1ab, spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid) defining various lineages [
 <xref rid="B2-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Current classification by the Coronaviridae Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTVs’) recognizes 39 species in 27 genera within the 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family in the 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic> order which are known to infect a variety of vertebrates, including humans [
