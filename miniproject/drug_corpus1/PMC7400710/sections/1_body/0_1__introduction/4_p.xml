<p>The genome repertoire of SARS-CoV-2 is extensive (&lt;30,000 nucleotides) as with most of the Coronaviruses that frequently recombine [

 <xref rid="B12-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Its genome alignment is divided into two segment ORF, encoding both non-structural and four structural proteins arranged in the following order: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N). Molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 mainly relies on three regions with highly conserved sequences: (1) the 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> gene (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene) in the open-reading frame ORF1ab region, (2) the 
 <italic>E</italic> gene (envelope protein gene), and (3) the 
 <italic>N</italic> gene (nucleocapsid protein gene), with both the 
 <italic>RdRP</italic> and 
 <italic>E</italic> genes exhibiting high analytical sensitivity for detection (technical limit of detection of 3.6 and 3.9 copies per reaction from in vitro transcribed RNA) [

 <italic>N</italic> gene, which exhibits much lower analytical sensitivity (8.3 copies per reaction) [
