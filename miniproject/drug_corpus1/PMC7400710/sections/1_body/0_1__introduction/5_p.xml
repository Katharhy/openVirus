By 12 June 2020, entries from Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Colombia, Uruguay, Peru, and Argentina have been deposited corresponding to 373 genomes available for this region [
 <xref rid="B15-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, there are no studies addressing genomic diversity and how this may impact molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, herein we compared the capacity of all currently accessible primer-probe sets to detect potential SARS-CoV-2 variants by analyzing against all available South American genomes while also assessing regional variation and how this may perhaps predict test performance by screening for potential mutations affecting regions harboring primer-probe binding sites.
