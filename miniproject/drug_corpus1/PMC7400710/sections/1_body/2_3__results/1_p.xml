<p>A total of 16 oligonucleotide sets (primers+probes) were identified during the revision of schemes to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection using a molecular approach (
 <xref rid="pathogens-09-00580-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The parallel search of whole genome sequences in GISAID revealed a total of 747; however, most of these were duplicated. Verification of redundant sequences showed a total of 373 different genome sequences from the following seven South America countries: Argentina (n = 29), Brazil (n = 95), Colombia (n = 88), Ecuador (n = 4), Peru (n = 2), and Uruguay (n = 11). The results of the different diversity parameters evaluated are described in
