<p>Concerning diversity, in the case of the E-gene, although three haplotypes were identified, only one of them (Hap-1) is predominant in all of the South American countries, with 99.13% of the total sequences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00580-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). No variable sites were found in the targets of the scheme flanking this genome region. In the case of the N-gene, a total of 25 haplotypes were identified (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00580-f001">Figure 1</xref>B), with Hap-2, Hap-1, and Hap-5 being the most frequent (with 62.7%, 16.2%, and 8.9%, respectively). Variable sites were found in N_gene-6 to N_gene-8 schemes, this being the last part of the CDC-N scheme (primers+probe) and in the direct primers of the Jung schemes described in the different countries (China ‘N_gene-2’, Hong Kong ‘N_gene-3’, Japan ‘N_gene-4’, and Thailand ‘N_gene-6’) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00580-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Although most of these variable sites were detected in rare haplotypes, one variable site was detected in a dominant haplotype, involving two nucleotides in the Forward primer of the Jung-China scheme (N_gene-2) detected in Hap-2. In the case of ORF1ab (RdRp), a total of 101 haplotypes were detected in the analyzed dataset (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00580-f001">Figure 1</xref>C), with Hap-1, Hap-7, and Hap-30 being predominant with 18.1%, 9.3%, and 8.8%, respectively. Only in the Forward primer of RdRp-1 were there detected variable sites for Hap-64 and Hap-65, and in the reverse primer of RdRp-4 for Hap-5 and Hap-7. Two areas with variable sites are marked with a black arrow in
