<p>We also analyzed the whole genomic diversity and SNPs frequency of SARS-CoV2 in SA, where the phylogenomic reconstruction showed that there was not a clustering by geography (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00580-f004">Figure 4</xref>A) but that there is a significant number of SNPs in the ORF1a, S, 3a, 6, 8, and N genes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00580-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). Interestingly, the number of SNPs in the E gene was null.
