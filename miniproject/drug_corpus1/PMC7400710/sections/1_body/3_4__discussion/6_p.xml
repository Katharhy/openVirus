<p>A comparative analysis study by Jung et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] showed that a combination of ORF1 ab (China), N2, N3 (USA), and NIID (Japan) displayed the most sensitive and reliable amalgamation of detection targets [
 <xref rid="B23-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Similarly, Wang et al. also reported the occurrence of mutations in the ORF1a (nt8782), ORF8 (nt28144), and N (nt29095) regions, contrasting with the E, 6, and 7b regions which exhibited a solid conservation with no mutations detected [
