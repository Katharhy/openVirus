<p>Current available data, at a global scale, reveal that SARS-CoV-2 has accumulated moderate genetic diversity [
 <xref rid="B31-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. As opposed to other RNA viruses, COVs exhibit a more modest mutation rate, primarily because of their proofreading capacity and greater replication fidelity [
 <xref rid="B32-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Considering the reported underlying global diversity of SARS-CoV-2 to date, its mutation rate has been estimated in 2 of ~6 Ã— 10
 <sup>4</sup> nucleotides/genome/year [
 <xref rid="B30-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] with the majority of these mutations described so far as neutral mutations [
 <xref rid="B33-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Regional variations in SARS-CoV-2 diversity has been recognized as a dynamic process of functional and ongoing adaptation of the virus to the human host [
 <xref rid="B31-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], as well as a result of multiple and variable sources of introduction to other regions [
 <xref rid="B15-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Such is the case of South America, where recent phylogenetic analyses suggest that most viruses have entered from Europe, Oceania, and in a less proportion from Asia [
 <xref rid="B15-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Even though sequence variation among SARS-CoV-2 isolates remains moderate, several consistent mutation hot spots have been identified in specific locations that are critical target regions for viral detection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00580-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Herein, we highlight several mutations in the ORF1 and N genes that are widely used to detect the virus in the region representing a plausible effect on the false-negative rate.
