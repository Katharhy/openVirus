<p>A number of RT-PCR tests using different primer/probe sets targeting different regions of the viral genome have been and continue to be developed. The performance of these molecular tests is highly reliant on the primers, probes, and reagents used [
 <xref rid="B23-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. To date, sensitivities of these nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) are variable, and in many cases, less than optimal [
 <xref rid="B30-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It has been proposed that genetic variations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome may play a role in the observed differences in sensitivity seen amongst different assays. Currently, there are no studies that evaluate the diagnostic performance of these NAATs in the region, and future studies should consider focusing on understanding their diagnostic operational capabilities to be massively used to detect SARS-CoV2 in SA.
