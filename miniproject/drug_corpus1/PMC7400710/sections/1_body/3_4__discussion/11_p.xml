<p>In summary, this preliminary analysis based on the genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in South America demonstrates how the presence of changes in suggested target regions for primer annealing sites may preclude accurate molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 when targeting locations within the N-gene region. Our results confirm the relatively conserved fitness of the E-gene region where no mutations were found, thus making it an ideal candidate for first-line screening in South America. Future studies should consider a specific primer and probe design over these genes that encompass the known diversity of SARS-CoV2 in South America. Due to the lack of resources and unavailability to acquire reagents and consumables for molecular diagnosis in many areas of South America, the implementation of a single marker assay proves a feasible and cost-effective option for diagnostics in resource-depleted countries. Future studies should unveil the diagnostic performance in situ of the E gene across multiple geographical regions.</p>
