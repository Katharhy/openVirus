<p>It is important to note some limitations in the interpretations of our data. First, because all sequences were retrieved from public databases, the accuracy of these sequences could not be entirely verified. In addition, given the most recent emergence of the virus in South America, it is possible that our analysis may represent a snapshot of the most recent evolutionary episodes and not the entire developmental history of the different lineages since their introduction. Further studies will be needed to expand our ability to characterize the complete and evolving evolutionary track of the virus.</p>
