<p>Previous studies from South America have also identified changes in the ORF1ab, E, and nucleocapsid genes, occurring at the level of specific oligo-binding sites which could negatively impact adequate viral identification. Despite the relative conservation of the E-gene [
 <xref rid="B30-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], as also shown by our study, variants associated with a C-to-T transition at position 26,340 have shown to affect testing performance in commercial assays, such as the cobas

 <xref rid="B34-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The fact that this mutation has emerged independently on various occasions adds a word of caution when relying uniquely on this target region, given the latent possibility of mutations that could potentially limit probe binding and impair amplification [
