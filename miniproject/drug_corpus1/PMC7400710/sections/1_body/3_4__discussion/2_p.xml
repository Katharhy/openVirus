<p>These countries share many factors in common, such as marked poverty, lack of access to basic sanitation services, and inadequate healthcare facilities [

Such aspects are relevant in understanding the distinct shaping of the course with regard to epidemics and how it can differently affect the transmission dynamics of the virus. For example, the overcrowded environment of slums that make up most of the suburban areas in most South American cities preclude ideal social distancing efforts [

In addition, the inability to comply with quarantine measures due to stringent economic reasons, as well as the lack of water and appropriate sanitation policies, may favor transmission and halt potential mitigation efforts needed for containment of the virus [
 <xref rid="B10-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This is why there is an urgent need to better understand and address the main drivers influencing the epidemic spread in such a heterogeneous scenario, alongside strengthening public health capabilities. Measures for assessing these scenarios include evaluating the available diagnostic tools for disease detection in order to improve outbreak response and contention.
