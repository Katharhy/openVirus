<p>In this study, we evaluated whether genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 could affect the performance of available primer-probe sets directed at the E, N, and RdRp genes, widely used nowadays for the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2. Our results depict the ample genomic diversity present in the RdRp and N genes, which is a shared feature with other members of the coronaviridae family (

In contrast, for most of the South American genomes, the E gene clustered within one haplotype with no SNPs present in these regions where different sets of primers and probes are known to anneal. This finding highlights the great utility of this gene as a screening target for diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 in the region. However, it is important to point out that these primer-probe sets may be susceptible to regional variations of the SARS-CoV2 virus.
