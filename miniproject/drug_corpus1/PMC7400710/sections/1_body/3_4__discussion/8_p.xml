<p>As a matter of fact, the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), in their most recent guidelines for the detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 virus infection, stated that although a dual-target testing approach using different genetic markers (E, N, or RdRp genes) is recommended, once local circulation is confirmed and widespread though a region, single target testing may be implemented as long as curves and other quality assurance specifications are met appropriately [

 <xref rid="B35-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In light of this recommendation and given the absence of reported SNPs within the E gene from over 300 South American genomes analyzed so far, the E gene stands as the most promising candidate and first-line screening tool for the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 in the region.
