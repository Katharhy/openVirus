<p>Regarding results for the N and RdRp genes, several haplotypes were identified in the analyzed genomes (

 <xref rid="pathogens-09-00580-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Of interest, we identified that diversity across all South American SARS-CoV2 sequences apportioned in at least three different haplotypes for these two genes, portraying the heterogeneity of the circulating strains throughout the region [
 <xref rid="B16-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and the potential role of these proteins in viral pathogenesis [

 <xref rid="B36-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. When screening for SNPs across different primer-probe binding regions, we identified several SNPs capable of altering physicochemical properties of the PCR assays (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00580-f003">Figure 3</xref>). This diversity, as well as its ability to negatively influence diagnostic test performance, is a shared feature with other coronaviruses [

 <xref rid="B38-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. As mentioned earlier, this is the reason why the occurrence of false-negative results in the context of ongoing epidemics should be taken cautiously. Evidence from Europe on the occurrence of false-negative results for N-gene-based assays support our in silico findings [

 <xref rid="B40-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Despite no present evidence on false-negative results for RdRp gene-based assays, its inherent mutation rate (due to environmental pressure and its role as a virulence factor), and considering how this gene showed low sensitivity [
 <xref rid="B41-pathogens-09-00580" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] is an aspect that deserves further investigation.
