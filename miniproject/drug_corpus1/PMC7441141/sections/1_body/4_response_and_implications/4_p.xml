<p id="Par19">Scientific and medical bodies acted to promote science-based knowledge on COVID-19. Medical and scientific journals took steps to ensure timely dissemination of scientific data. Journals and publishing companies formed resource centers on their websites to address COVID-19-related published material. Participants included major scientific journals (
 <italic>Nature</italic> and 
 <italic>Science</italic>) and respected medical journals (the 
 <italic>New England Journal of Medicine</italic>, 
 <italic>JAMA</italic>, the 
 <italic>BMJ</italic>, as well as the Lancet journals) along with respected publishing bodies, including Elsevier, Springer, Oxford, and Wiley. Journals arranged for speeding peer review (‘fast-tracking’) to support prompt public health policymaking and benefit healthcare workers and the public with new discoveries and clinical trial results. Many publishers adopted open-access publication policies for material related to the pandemic to ease access to science-based evidence. Preprint server bioRxiv added a yellow banner to label all articles related to COVID-19, and to remind readers that papers posted there are preliminary reports, not articles having undergone peer review. This warned readers that the findings should not be judged as conclusive nor reported as established data.
