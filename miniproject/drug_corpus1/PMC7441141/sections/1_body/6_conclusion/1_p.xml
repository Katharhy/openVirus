<p id="Par45">Infodemics are as serious as pandemics. International bodies, governments, and health professionals must identify the overflow of contradictory news, misinformation, and manipulated data on social media as a global public health threat. The current COVID-19 outbreak is an example of how hard it is to handle emerging infectious diseases. While speed is the enemy of rigorous science, the perfect scenario for facing an infodemic involves disseminating evidence-based and reliable information swiftly and widely among the public. Media, through its various forms and portals, can play a vital role in raising social awareness, increasing exposure to truthful information, promoting healthy habits, and improving psychological well-being. Governments should develop and direct public health policies to address the role of media portals in propagating information in times of pandemics. The Infodemic Response Checklist is a novel tool for promoting more efficient health communication strategies to alleviate the effects of the current outbreak of misinformation and any other outbreaks that may arise in the future. </p>
