<p>This epidemic has spread exponentially across the globe ever since the advent of the latest coronaviral epidemic COVID-19 triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 virus [

In consideration of the possibility of a pandemic, scientists and physicians have been trying to grasp this emerging virus and its pathophysiology to recognize potential therapeutic protocols and to find therapeutic agents and vaccinations that are successful in the disease management. Several pneumonia cases that were localized in Wuhan in December 2019 were identified, and sources were checked. On 12 December 2019, the first case of COVID-19 was identified with apparent pneumonia, while on 31 December 2019, 27 cases of extreme viral pneumonia were officially confirmed [

The medical history of these patients has increased the likelihood of a virus outbreak. Novel SARS-COV-2 from wild bats and group 2 β-CoVs, which comprises severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-COV), was announced to be developed on 22 January 2020. This was the case, although COVID-19 and SARS belong to the same category of β-CoVs, genome-overlap between the two species is only 70%. The research group led by Bao S has reported that there are some genetic differences with SARS-CoV [

This outbreak has occurred in similar ways to the SARS epidemic during China's spring festival, which is China's most prominent traditional festival, where almost 3 billion citizens fly around the world to witness it. This created ideal conditions for the transmission and resulted in severe problems in the prevention and control of this extremely infectious disease. From 17 January till 23 February 2003, the Chinese Spring Festival ended in the SARS outbreak, and from 10th January to 18th February 2020, the festival was conducted once more. The number of COVID-19 reports from 10 to 22 January has risen rapidly. Wuhan is also a significant node of the spring festival transport network, the center of the outbreak, with approximately 10 million inhabitants. The number of tourists expected at the spring festival in 2020 rose 1, seven-times over 2003, the same festival, from 1.82 billion up to 3.11 billion. The massive population flow has often provided ideal conditions for this problem to spread [
