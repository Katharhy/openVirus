<p>The US CDC distributed the real-time RT-PCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 with reaction primers and specifically engineered probes to detect SARS-like coronavirus in general. The same primer and protocol could be used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in particular based on high genomic similarities [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Additionally, aside from this protocol mentioned above, this protocol has not been evaluated on other platforms or reaction conditions chemistries. Each procedure has certain drawbacks. The analysis technique will be qualified and familiarized with and understood by the participating analysts. Inappropriate processing, distribution or treatment may result in false-negative results due to insufficient viral biological material in the sample. RNA viruses may also display major genetic variation and genetic drifts [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This may lead to a discrepancy between the PCR primers and the detection probe sequence that may decrease the test efficiency or contribute to false-negative outcomes [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The point of care (POC) evaluation kit can presumably mitigate such limits, that should be given the highest priority in the next few months for research and development of diagnostic kits to increase the sensitivity and the reliability of the test [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It may contribute to a discrepancy between the first and the goal series sensors, which may reduce the test output or contribute to incorrect adverse outcomes. The point of care test kit can mitigate these limitations, which should be highly prioritized in the next few months for research and development [
