<p>CDC is said to have a two-serological study procedure, by way of two screening tests and a confirmation check to identify MERS-COV antibody [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a screening procedure used to determine the existence and amount of particular antibodies (nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) ) that are bound to a viral protein [

 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. If either ELISA confirms whether a clinical sample is antibody-positive, the CDC recommends the microneutralization method to validate the positive tests [

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The microneutralization procedure is an exact serological method designed to evaluate neutralizing antibodies or antibodies which may neutralize the virus. This procedure is considered a gold-standard for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum samples. The microneutralization method, though, relative to ELISA, is time-consuming and labor-intensive, require at least 5 days to produce results [
