<p>The first and complete genome sequence of SARS-COV-2, which provides the key to the possible structure and glycosylation pattern of viral proteins and thus modes of association with a host cell, has been recently reported (25 January 2020) NCBI (GenBank: MN908947.3) [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This is an essential step in developing a vaccine for SARS-COV-2. All the coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, encodes nucleocapsid protein (N protein), and S protein [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. The N-Protein is a structural protein bound to the RNA genome of coronavirus and thereby forms a capsid around the enclosed nucleic acid. The N-protein has the following roles in viral life-cycle: associates with the viral membrane protein during viral assembly, and facilitates the production and folding of RNA, this plays a part in viral budding. S protein has two main tasks that enable host infection: it facilitates the interaction between viruses and host cells throughout the surface receptors and it enables their entrance into the host's cell by helping to connect the viral cell membranes with the host's membranes [

 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. ACE2 is an intrinsic protein membrane that enables the entry of SARS-COV-2 throughout invasion by binding its extracellular peptidase domain to S protein [
