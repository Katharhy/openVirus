<p>The N-terminal S1 domain of spike glycoprotein, interacting with several host cell proteins, is the primary motive for the trafficking in and the hijacking of coronaviruses in the host cells [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Host cellular receptors (CD-26) is the crucial component in the immune regulatory pathway of viral infections responsible for the cleavage of amino-terminal dipeptides from polypeptides with either L-proline or L-alanine in the penultimate position of the sequence [

As SARS-CoV-2 has gained global interest, some 15–20 possible vaccine candidates worldwide have been in the pipeline utilizing a range of technologies (e.g., messenger RNA, DNA, nanoparticles, synthetic and modified virus-like particles). It can take more than 1 year to complete clinical trials for most candidates with the exception of those sponsored by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Technologies (CEPI). However, the BGI kit met the national medicinal devices' authorization test and is actually in use in China's therapeutic and testing centers [

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In the majority of the SARS and MERS research, as carried out in cell or animal models, they were omitted. The four trials used in this analysis included the Phase-I SARS or MERS clinical tests. No population style studies were carried out at the screening point on the SARS-CoV-2 (cell, species, human). The clinical trials released were conducted mostly in the USA, but one on SARS in China [
