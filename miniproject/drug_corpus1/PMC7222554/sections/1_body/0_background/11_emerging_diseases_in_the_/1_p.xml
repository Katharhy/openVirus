<p>News of SARS-CoV-2 spread over the internet with broad coverage, and social media transported the news of the disease much faster than previously reported. Over the years, websites such as FluTrackers.com, ProMED (promedmail.org), and others have allowed disease knowledge to be gathered from all around the world and encouraged its distribution to stakeholders. MERS-CoV first attracted the attention of scientific researchers, virologists and public health authorities as to the novel coronavirus embedded in ProMED Mail in 2012 and afterward [

Early in an epidemic, rumors with elements of fact and baseless paranoia can hardly differentiate. The linguistic barriers and record sources may intensify this reality. In this case, however, speculation of a new coronavirus was fueled by well-formulated statements that explicitly excluded individual families of viruses (influenza, adenovirus) but exclusively excluded coronavirus SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Following SARSâ€™ experiences, others became worried that the facts should be preserved. The planet behaved both with fear and alleviated as the agent was ultimately identified as a SARS-CoV-2, the epidemic will not be cached. Although far from flawless, the government's reaction to SARS-CoV-2 compares strongly with the early SARS epidemic. The rapid release of SARS-CoV-2 sequences provided for rapid interaction, review and the creation of diagnostic tests within the scientific community [

Both the Chinese CDC and Wuhan municipal health board have frequently reported reports of the incidents and patient condition to the public health officials so that they can track the situation in real-time. Online media also enabled researchers from all over the world to link up-to-date sequential details and illustrate critical disease acknowledgements. The opportunity to exchange news reports and pieces of evidence in real-time with experts and public health professionals around the globe does not necessarily deliver accurate findings, and it is a massive improvement in the approach to outbreaks. Such openness has rendered the global science community aware of new partnerships and reacted rapidly. While several unknowns remain present with SARS-CoV-2, the environment is dedicated to fighting the SARS-CoV-2 virus imminently. Perhaps this indicates that the experiences from the epidemic of SARS were learned.
