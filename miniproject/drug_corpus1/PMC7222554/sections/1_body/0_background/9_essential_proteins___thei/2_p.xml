<p>The spike glycoproteins composed of two subunits (S1 and S2) are among the structural components of CoVs. The spikes on the viral surface are produced by S protein homo-trimers, which direct the connection to the host receptors, as depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. The S2 domain, including a fusion peptide, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain â€“ is firmly retained in SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It may also be a candidate for antiviral agents (anti-S2). On the other side, only 40% of the SARS-CoV-2 produces an amino acid identity in the spike receptor-binding domain [

This gene mapping is essential to allow researchers to track the phylogenetic tree of the virus and, particularly, to identify strains that differ by mutation. A spike mutation possibly occurred at the end of November 2019 caused jumping to human beings, according to recent studies. Ciccozzi
