<p>SARS-CoV-2, based on full-length phylogenetic genome review, is found to be similar to SARS-CoV much more than MERS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. At the level of each structural protein (S, E, M and N), the findings are reported here. Indeed this was supported by a direct comparison sequence-based study that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV proteins are genetically identical in their M, N and E protein, although S protein has dramatically reduced its reproductive similarity (but still high). In this same study, the resemblance of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV for both proteins were reported, on the other hand, was considerably lower, which is also apparent from the phylogenetic trees involved [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].
