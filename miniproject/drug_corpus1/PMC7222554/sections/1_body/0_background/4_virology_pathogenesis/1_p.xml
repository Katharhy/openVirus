<p>Based on the structural studies of α- and β-coronavirus, the viral genome encodes many structural proteins; including the spike (S) protein glycosylated, which serves as a critical inducer for the host immune response with a functional polybais (furin) cleavage site at the S1–S2 boundary through 12 nucleotides that have been reported [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The S protein mediates host cell invasion by SARS-CoV as well as SARS-CoV-2 through binding of the host cell's membrane protein receptor named angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A detailed study conducted has shown that this cellular invasion includes the production of S-proteins, facilitated by serine protease TMPRSS211, formed by the host cell. The viral genome also encodes a variety of nonstructural proteins such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), coronaviral principal protease (3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro) [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The viral genome is discharged as a positive sense of a single-strand RNA (ssRNA) into the cell. Subsequently, it uses host cell protein translation machinery (ribosomes) to produce the viral polyprotein and then cleaves it into effector proteins through viral proteases 3CLpro and PLpro [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The most complex component of the CoV genome is the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in S protein. Six RBD amino acids were found to be important for ACE2 binding and the host spectrum of viruses close to SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The Y442, S472, N479, D480, T487 and Y4911, which are L455, F486, Q493, S494, N501 and Y505 in SARS-CoV-2, are the co-ordinates centered on SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV are five or six residues. SARS-CoV-2 tends to have an RBD that connects humans, ferrets, cats and other highly-receptor-homologated animals with elevated ACE2 affinity [
