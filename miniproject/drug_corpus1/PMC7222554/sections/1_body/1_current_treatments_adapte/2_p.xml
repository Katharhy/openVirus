<p>The supportive care includes oxygen therapy, conservative fluids supply, managing complications according to what each patient develops, empirical antimicrobial drugs, antipyretic/analgesics, mechanical ventilation and corticosteroids if indicated for other reasons [
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Oxygen therapy is indicated at a rate of 5 L/min to counteract respiratory distress, hypoxemia or shock. It should be continued to reach target oxygen saturation &gt;94% during resuscitation, &gt;90% in stable cases for most patients and &gt;95% for pregnant women. Mechanical ventilation should be given for patients with severe deterioration in respiratory functions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Complications should be expected, including sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, acute kidney injury, acute cardiac injury, acute liver injury and should be managed according to their protocols. Empirical antibiotics should be given based on local epidemiology, common pathogens and discontinued after lab tests.
