<p>This overview of the current COVI19 global interest offers a summary of the existing state of the art concerning effects on public health and safety, pathophysiology and clinical symptoms of the pandemic infection, diagnostics tools available, patient management and global response from enforced curfew to total lockdown that we are witnessing around the globe. Only when the pandemic ceases will we evaluate the health, social and economic consequences of this catastrophic event and, therefore, can draw insights from any possible potential epidemics for future cases, particularly in public and global safety. The proverb of “
 <italic>an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure</italic>” remains the best for the prevention of COVID-19 spread.
