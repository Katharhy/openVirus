<p>Having coronaviral principal protease (3CLpro) as the critical enzyme for SARS-CoV-2 replication and serine protease (TMPRSS211) for S protein priming has made these proteases attractive targets [
 <xref rid="B140" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. Thus, the existing protease inhibitors could be potential drug candidates targeting these enzymes [
