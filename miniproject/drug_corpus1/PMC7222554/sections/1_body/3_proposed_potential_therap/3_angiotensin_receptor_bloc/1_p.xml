<p>As mentioned previously, SARS-CoV-2 gets into the pulmonary cells after binding to the ACE2 receptor domain [
 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. However, due to the limited number of studies, it is still unclear how ACE2 is modified in SARS-CoV-2 infection [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. Kruse has suggested that therapies that block the ACE2 receptor domain could be studied for their potential effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection [
 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. For example, using the small receptor-binding domain (RBD) from the vital domain of the SARS S protein that has shown to bind to ACE2 [
 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>,
 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>] receptor. A second option is to administer an antibody that binds to ACE2, which could prevent SARS-CoV-2 particles from binding to the ACE2 receptor. A third potential option that has been suggested by Zhang and Liu is using compounds that have shown to inhibit ACE2 enzyme such as emodin and promazine [
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Emodin is a natural anthraquinone compound that is derived from the commonly used Chinese medicinal herbs, such as the genus 
 <italic>Rheum</italic> and 
 <italic>Polygonum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. Emodin was found to block the binding of SARS-CoV S protein with the enzyme ACE2 [
 <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>], while promazine is an old anti-psychotic drug with structural similarity to emodin. Promazine has shown inhibitory signs for the replication of SARS-CoV. From these findings, HoÂ 
 <italic>et al.</italic> have suggested that emodin or promazine could be considered as potential therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
