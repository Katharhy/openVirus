<p>The discovery and development of new molecules against SARS-CoV-2 infection need time [
 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. Besides, 
 <italic>in silico</italic> discovery of molecules is relatively a slow process as these molecules need to be experimentally tested. In this section, we summarize the potential therapies as suggested and proposed by several research groups and pharmaceutical companies from the beginning of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The selection of these potential therapies was based on their role in similar viral infections on the corresponding targets.
