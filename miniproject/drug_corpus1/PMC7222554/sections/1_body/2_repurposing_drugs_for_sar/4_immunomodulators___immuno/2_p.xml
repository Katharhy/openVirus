<p>Tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized anti-human IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody. It acts by inhibiting the binding of IL-6 to IL-6 receptors. It has potent anti-inflammatory effects and already approved for the treatment of RA [

Key inflammatory mediators including IL-6, IL-2, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, IFN-γ inducible protein 10 and TNF-α were found to be highly involved in the inflammatory storm inducing severe alveolar destruction and dysfunction in SARS-CoV-2 infections. Elevations in IL-6 levels, in particular, were found as a significant predictor of fatality in patients [

A retrospective study from China hospitals demonstrated the benefits of tocilizumab in addition to the standard therapy of 26 patients with severe and critical care conditions [

 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Tocilizumab was given at a dose of 400 mg once through an intravenous drip in 18 patients. Another dose of tocilizumab was given for the last three patients due to the fever. Treatment with tocilizumab resulted in a significant relief of fever (100%), lowering of oxygen intake 75% and improvement in respiratory function. Tocilizumab normalized lymphocytes levels 52.6%, significantly decreased the C-reactive protein level 84.2% and improved the CT imaging 90.5%. The results from this study are suggesting tocilizumab as promising therapeutic agent for severe and critical SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, this study is observational study with limited number of patients. According to clinical trials are currently conduced to validate these results [
