 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. RBV is being given for SARS-CoV-2 patients in different hospitals. However, the clinical outcomes from its administration are still not clear. RBV was given to 80 patients referred to the First People's Hospital of Yancheng City, the Second People's Hospital of Yancheng Cit and the Fifth People's Hospital of Wuxi from 22 January to 14 February 2020, in China. RBV was given intravenously for periods of 3–12 days [

Currently, one clinical trial (NCT04276688) is recruiting patients to determine the efficacy of RBV for SARS-CoV-2 infection at the University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital. In the study, RBV (400 mg twice daily for 14 days) was administrated in addition to LPV/RTV and INF beta-IB compared with the control group with LPV/RTV alone [
