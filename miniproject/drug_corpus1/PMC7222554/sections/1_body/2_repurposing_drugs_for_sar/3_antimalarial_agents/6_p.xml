<p>A recent protocol approved by the office of National Clinical Advisor, acute hospital division, recommended the use of CQ 500 mg twice daily for 10 days for patients diagnosed as mild, moderate and severe cases. Alternatively, HCQ in a regimen of day 1: 400 mg twice daily, then days 2–5, 200 mg twice daily (total duration 5 days). Another alternative is RVD as an intravenous infusion, 200 mg on day 1, then 100 mg on days 2–10 (total duration 10 days) [

 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. About 36 patients were included, including asymptomatic patients, patients with upper respiratory tract symptoms, and patients with lower respiratory tract symptoms were included. About 20 patients received HCQ sulfate 200 mg, three-times daily for 10 days. Out of the HCQ-treated patients, six patients received azithromycin 500 mg on day 1 and 250 mg for the following 4 days. On day 6, virological clearance was significantly higher in HCQ compared with the control group (70 vs 12.5%). Azithromycin + HCQ group showed 100% virological clearance on day 6. However, this combination is not established yet. The risk of developing severe QT interval prolongation may be a limiting factor. The sample size in this study is small, and more significant studies are needed [

A very recent study utilized global affinity purification-mass spectrometry (APMS) analysis to identify the host-pathogen interferences for SARS-CoV-2, further validate the possible efficacies of CQ and azithromycin. The study showed that the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp6 protein interacted with the sigma receptor. The sigma receptors interact with CQ. Azithromycin has also been shown to be an off-target activity to human mitochondria and ribosomes subunits that interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp8 protein (MRPS27, MRPS5, MRPS25 and MRPS2 ) [

The studies on SARS-CoV-2 showed that the virus interfered with host pathways that are needed to activate the innate immune system of the patient to fight the infection (immune senescence). SARS-CoV-2 blocks the interferon pathway and prevents its upregulation in the host system. Nitazoxanide is antiprotozoal that upregulates the innate antiviral mechanisms and activates interferon pathways in the host [

 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. Accordingly, the study is proposing that dual use of the HCQ with nitazoxanide would have synergistic effects against SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. The proposed dosing system is 400 mg twice a day for 2–3 days (loading) then 200 mg twice a day for 4 days for HCQ and 600 mg –sustained-release (SR) tabs/twice daily of nitazoxanide for 7 days [
