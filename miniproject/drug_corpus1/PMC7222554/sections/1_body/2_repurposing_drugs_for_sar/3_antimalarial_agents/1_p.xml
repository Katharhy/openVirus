<p>Chloroquine (CQ) is currently being investigated extensively for its promising activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection [
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>,
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. CQ is an old antimalarial drug with limited use due to its resistance as well as poisoning risk (rhythm disturbance, QT interval prolongation) [
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. The derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was developed later and showed better clinical safety and lower risks of toxicities [
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. HCQ is also an option for the management of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus. HCQ is a highly available drug with a low cost and an acceptable toxicity profile [
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Moreover, HCQ has good oral bioavailability allowing it to reach significant blood concentration that is sufficient to inhibit SARS-CoV-2. These properties nominate HCQ as a great candidate to be applied on large scale use such as the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. On the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> level, HCQ showed significant inhibition of the SAR-CoV-2 infection [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. CQ and HCQ resulted in significant antiviral cytotoxicity in African green monkey kidney VeroE6 cells (ATCC-1586) (CC
 <sub>50</sub> 273.20 and 249.50 μM, respectively). The two compounds reduced the viral RNA copy number, with CQ being significantly more potent [
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Another 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study has shown the potency of CQ and HCQ against SARS-CoV-2 with HCQ with enhanced potency (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.72% μM vs 5.47% μM) [
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Suggested mechanisms of action include interfering with the pH-dependent steps of viral replication by increasing the pH of intracellular vesicles such as lysosomes and endosomes [
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. CQ also blocks the ACE2 receptor glycosylation and thus prevents the S protein binding [
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Wang 
 <italic>et al.</italic> have demonstrated potent blocking of SARS-COV-2 viral infection by CQ (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.13 μM; CC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt;100 μM, SI &gt;88.50) [
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. CQ and HCQ also have immunomodulatory effects that might help in reversing the hyperinflammation and cytokine storm associated with SARS-COV-2 pneumonia [
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>].
