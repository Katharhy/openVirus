<p id="Par29">Currently, none of the drugs on the market is really effective against COVID-19. The new antiviral drugs should ensure better pharmacokinetic properties, greater potency and/or a lower toxicity profile than currently available therapies. The combined use of multiple antiviral drugs is the right way to go, so it is possible to increase antiviral activity, reduce the dosage of single drugs (and thus toxicity), and prevent the development of resistance by providing a wider antiviral activity than single drug treatment does. Identifying new molecular targets within the virus is also crucial [
