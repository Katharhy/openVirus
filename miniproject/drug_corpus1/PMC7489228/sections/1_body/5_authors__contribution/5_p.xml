<p id="para0025">The pre-treatment protocol for sputa was standardized and applied accordingly in each participant centre. A mucolytic agent (Sputagest Selectavial MAST®, Merseyside, UK) was used at 1:20. If the sputum was still viscous, 200 μL were digested with 20-25 µl proteinase K (Qiagen®, Hilden, Germany) between 20 min and 3 h at 56°C. For sputum and NP samples, nucleic acids from 200 μL were extracted in a biosafety level 2 laboratory to avoid contamination of molecular PCR assays using an automated NUCLISENS® easyMAG™ (bioMérieux S.A., Marcy l'Etoile, France) and eluted in 100 µL of RNase-DNase-free water.</p>
