<p id="para0024">In order to ensure optimal sample quality, nasopharyngeal swabs and nasopharyngeal sputum were taken at the inclusion of each patient by the same experienced medical staff. For NP, a sterile flexible flocked tip with a nylon fibre swab (Copan®) was inserted into each nostril to sample the posterior nasopharynx in a rotating motion, and finally cut into a universal transport medium. Collection of sputa (spontaneous or induced sputa) was obtained as recommended for routine bacteriological cultures
