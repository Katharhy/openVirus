<p id="para0007">Nasopharyngeal (NP) sampling is considered as a reference for respiratory viral screening in general population, but this technique is invasive and sometimes painful and is therefore not systematically carried out, especially in CF patients. Furthermore, epidemics of virulent respiratory virus as H1N1 or SARS-CoV-2 highlight difficulties in obtaining a large number of good quality NP specimens [

As it is a non-invasive method, it seems relevant to define whether sputum sampling could be recommended for the molecular viral diagnosis of acute respiratory infections in CF in order to improve patient comfort while maintaining a sensitive viral diagnosis. Few monocentric studies previously reported scattered data when comparing the two sampling sites for virus detection and did not lead to a change in routine practices [
