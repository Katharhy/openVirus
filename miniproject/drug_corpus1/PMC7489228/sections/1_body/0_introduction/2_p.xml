<p id="para0006">Lung function deterioration is a common event in cystic fibrosis (CF). Pulmonary deterioration has a multifactorial origin with chronic inflammation and polymicrobial infections having a major impact on the respiratory tract. While the role of bacterial pathogens in CF is well known, respiratory viruses are now also considered as major players in CF lung morbidity. Viruses have been detected in 28 to 50% of exacerbations, with a significant impact on the clinical outcome, an increased risk of hospitalisation and longer antibiotic therapy

Viruses could facilitate bacterial colonisation of the CF airways, affecting innate immunity, bacterial adhesion, impairing mucociliary clearance, which facilitates persistence of pathogens in the lung and intensify inflammatory reaction to the infection [

Many recent commercial multiplex PCRs are available allowing for the simultaneous detection of a wide spectrum of known human respiratory viruses [
