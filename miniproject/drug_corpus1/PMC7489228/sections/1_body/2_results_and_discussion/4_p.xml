<p id="para0013">CF is a difficult disease to manage and patient comfort should be given priority while limiting invasive investigations for patients. Our results showed agreement between the two types of samples in terms of molecular virus detection and position CF sputum as an optimal sampling technique for respiratory virus diagnosis with the advantage of being non-invasive and routinely taken for bacterial monitoring. The positioning of the sputum sample as the one single respiratory sample that provides the combining viral, bacterial and fungal investigations could be both relevant for health monitoring and well accepted by patients.</p>
