<p id="para0016">All three centres used different multiplex approaches for respiratory viral detection. These techniques are essential to improve CF patient care: if only virus is detected, an antibiotic cure could be avoided and thus resistance antibiotic can be delayed; if a non-influenza virus is detected, oseltamivir will not be prescribed. Moreover, in the early future, new anti-VRS and anti-rhinovirus will be available, allowing a drug adapted to the viral etiology [

Viral molecular detection and concomitant bacterial or fungal co-infections were not evaluated in this work but will be explored as secondary objectives in a future larger prospective study. This is valuable information as bacterial populations have been identified for 40% of viral infections requiring hospitalisation
