<p id="para0011">Thirty participants were included in this study, 25 adults (18 to 55 years old) and 5 children (2 to 15 years old). Sputum and NP samples were collected in a context of acute respiratory infection during a flu epidemic period. Clinical data were retrospectively collected for 23/30 patients. The thirty pairs of sputum-NP samples were collected within a maximum of 48 hours after the onset of the symptoms. Five, 13 and 12 participants were included in centres A, B, and C, respectively. A virus was detected for 60% of the CF patients (n=18); the most frequently identified viruses were influenza viruses and enteroviruses/rhinoviruses. Two viral co-infections were also reported (
