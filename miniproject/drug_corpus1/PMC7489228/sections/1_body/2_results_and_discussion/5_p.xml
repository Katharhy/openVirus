<p id="para0014">Viral detection discordance was described for five paired-samples. NP flocked swabs allowed the release of high viral loads present in respiratory epithelial cells

 <xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In our study, the quality of the NP and sputa samples from CF patients was not verified as multiplex kits provided no cellular control. Thus, we could hypothesize that the quality of these NP samples was not optimal in the three discordant pairs, which could explain the loss of viral detection sensitivity compared with sputa as it has been well illustrated in diagnosis of COVID-19 and other viral respiratory infections [
