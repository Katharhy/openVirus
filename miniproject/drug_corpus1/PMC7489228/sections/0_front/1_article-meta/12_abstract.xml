 <p>Viruses are important agents in lung function deterioration in Cystic Fibrosis (CF). To date, no standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been established to determine which sampling method is the most effective for an optimal virological diagnosis of respiratory viral infections in CF. Here we investigated the performances of two sampling sites, sputum samples versus nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, for thirty participants from three CF centres presenting an acute respiratory infection. Sputum and NP samples were simultaneously collected and multiplex PCR targeting 16 to 18 viruses were performed. Viruses were detected for 18/30 patients (60%). A high concordance between the sputum and NP samples was observed in 25 (83%) paired samples of which 13 tested positive and 12 tested negative. These results highlighted the relevance of sputum sampling for diagnostic of respiratory viruses in CF, which is less invasive and better accepted by CF patients than NP, and allows accurate bacterial detection.</p>
