  <p>The data for this investigation can be viewed as 
   <italic>n</italic> = 310 vectors (sequences) in 
   <italic>p</italic> = 53 dimensions (computed sequence descriptors). Over 93% of sequences have 10272 bases. Details on the source of data as well as pre-processing steps are available in [
   <xref rid="B82-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. These data can be represented by a matrix X which has 310 rows and 53 columns. Thus, each sequence is represented by a point in
