<p>Since a 3D structure of ZIKV protein is now known, discovery for potential anti ZIKV drugs can be accomplished through a combination of structure-based design, ligand docking, and pharmacophore modeling from literature known active compounds and virtual screening of compound databases. However it is important to note that even though the 3D structure of ZIKV proteins are known, specific features, such as polarization factors, effects of hydrogen bonding arising from specific patterns of solvation in water in the common ATP-binding pockets and dynamic target-inhibitor interactions may not be detectible by x-ray crystallography. Thus to account for such interactions, quantum chemical methods along with molecular dynamics should be better for the identification of potent anti-ZIKV ligands prior to experimental validations. In addition, alternative targets of established 3D protein structures implicated for ZIKV proteins should also be explored for ZIKV drugs. Although pharmacophore modeling has demonstrated many successes in the rational approach for discovery of potential therapeutics solely from structure-activity relationships of known bioactive compounds, without testing for efficacies of identified compounds no compound should be promoted. First in vitro testing followed by in vivo if found promising is absolutely necessary. In summary, it may be commented that for accomplishing a successful ZIKV drug discovery program, the research team should have good medicinal and synthetic chemistry support along with support from molecular biology and modeling groups for a rapid lead optimization.</p>
