<p>Both peptide vaccine design and anti-ZIKV drug discovery involve high throughput in-silico, medium throughput in vitro, and low throughput in vivo methodologies. The availability of high-speed computers and useful software tools allow us to carry out numerous in silico experiments which act as a “decision support system” to the more expensive and time-consuming subsequent steps of in vitro and in vivo methods. This collaborative approach between traditional laboratory experiments and machine learning based prioritization of chemicals has the potential to judiciously use the limited resources available to the vaccine/drug designer. To this end, an interdisciplinary approach that leverages expertise of experts from different domain like epidemiology, machine learning, pharmacology etc., is needed to generate useful insights.</p>
