 <xref rid="B79-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] using standard bioinformatics tools like PCA and SOM. In the PCA analysis (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pharmaceuticals-12-00157">Appendix A</xref>), the first six principal components (PCs) explain more than 99% of the variance in the data. In one of our earlier studies with 3692 chemicals and 90 calculated molecular descriptors we found that first ten PCs explained more than 92% of the variance in the data [
 <xref rid="B174-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>]. This discriminatory power of the orthogonal variables or PCs derived from the calculated ZIKV RNA sequence descriptors is evident from the PC1 versus PC2 plot in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-12-00157-f004">Figure 4</xref> which can clearly separate the African ZIKV sequences from those from Asia and South America. With the refinement of descriptor space by the addition of other indices, such analyses will be improved and will be able to place a novel or newly emerging viral sequence close to a similar set of objects and help us to make a preliminary assessment of their potential in causing an epidemic/pandemic. The clustering of the sequences using the SOM approach (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-12-00157-f005">Figure 5</xref>) is even more interesting. Here ZIKV sequences from various countries and regions are clearly separated from one another. It seems that the descriptors, which count the neighbors of individual bases, sufficiently describe the DNA/RNA sequences and are suitable for chemometrical analysis.
