 <italic>NS5 methyltransferase inhibitors</italic>: The structure of ZIKV MTase with the S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) analog, sinefungin was recently elucidated. In the structural elucidation, Hercik et al. proposed that designing of an inhibitor connecting sinefungin with a Cap analog through a linker could provide stronger affinity to the protein and can make it a more potent compound [
 <xref rid="B111-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Based on this hypothesis, Stephen et al. performed virtual screening of a database comprising about 20,000 compounds and shortlisted ten compounds for experimental evaluation. Four out of these ten compounds exhibited experimental viral growth inhibition below 20 mM concentration with one inhibitor showing IC50 value of 4.8 mM [

However, designing ZIKV-specific MTase inhibitors remains a challenge, mainly because of the selectivity of inhibitors to the SAM-binding site, presence of SAM-utilizing proteins in the host cell, and similarity between the human RNA and DNA MTases [
