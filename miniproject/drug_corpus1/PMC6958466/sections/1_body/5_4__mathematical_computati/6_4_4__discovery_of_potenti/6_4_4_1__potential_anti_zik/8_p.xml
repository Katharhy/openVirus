 <italic>NS5 polymerase inhibitors</italic>: A few nucleoside inhibitors, such as 2′-C- and 2′-O-methyl-substituted nucleosides, 2′-C-fluoro-2′-C-methyl-substituted nucleosides, 3′-O-methyl-substituted nucleosides, 3′-deoxynucleosides, derivatives with a 4′-C-azido substitution, heterobase-modified nucleosides, and neplanocins were found to be potent when tested against ZIKV. The most promising inhibitors were the 2-C-methylated nucleosides with IC50 values &lt;10 mM [
