 <italic>Host proteins as drug targets</italic>: Since ZIKV like other flaviviruses contains a small genome, the host cell machinery will have to carry out the core functions that are essential to viral replication. Therefore, inhibition of the viral protein functions could be an attractive target for ZIKV drug discovery. Moreover, broad-spectrum strategy to target host cell processes could also be advantageous as they are often employed by multiple viruses and are less prone to development of drug resistance [
