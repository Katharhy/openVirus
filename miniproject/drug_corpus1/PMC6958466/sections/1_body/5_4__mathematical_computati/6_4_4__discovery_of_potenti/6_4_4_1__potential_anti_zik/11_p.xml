 <italic>Non-nucleoside RNA polymerase inhibitors</italic>: By in silico screening of a compound library of 100,000 small molecules based on Zika RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) structure, ten lead compounds were reported in a recent study [

 <italic>N</italic>-[(amino)carbonothioyl]-1-benzothiophene-2-carbox-amide (TPB), a non-nucleoside, was found to inhibit ZIKV replication with an EC50 in submicromolar concentration (0.94 μM) [
 <xref rid="B130-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. In silico molecular docking evaluations suggest that the compound binds to the catalytic site of the ZIKV RdRp, acting as an allosteric agent to block the viral RNA synthesis. Furthermore, in vivo studies (25 mg/kg) in animals (immunocompetent mice) infected with ZIKV and treating with the compound, TPB showed a reduction of 40-fold plasma viral load compared to the untreated controls. In addition, PK analysis of the compound in the same animal in post-injection period was also found to retain it in the mouse plasma at 150–100 ng/mL level for 10–12 h. Thus, TPB appears to be a promising compound against ZIKV infection [
