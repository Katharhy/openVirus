 <italic>Viral entry blockers</italic>: Viral entry blockers, such as saliphenylhalamide (SaliPhe), act by the inhibition of the vacuolar ATPase can also function as anti-ZIKV drug [
 <xref rid="B140-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. It was tested in Vero 76 cells, yielding an EC50 value of 0.62 mM for MR766 strain and 0.49 mM for the PRVABC59 strain. Another compound, Niclosamide blocks the acidification of endosomes but probably with a different mechanism that is not yet fully understood [
 <xref rid="B141-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. It was identified through screening against ZIKV in SNB-19 cells showing an EC50 value of 0.37 mM based on the measurement of intracellular viral RNA [
 <xref rid="B95-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Incidentally, niclosamide is an FDA-approved drug, mainly used in the treatment of intestinal helminthiasis and also in pregnancy. However, the drug has not undergone important controlled studies in pregnant women. Moreover, the drug failed in the risk assessment study of the fetus in animal reproduction.
