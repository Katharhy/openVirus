<p>In silico structural-bioinformatics-based methodologies and frameworks have also been developed for the design of ZIKV antibodies. One of these methodologies deals with RosettaAntibodyDesign (RAbD) samplings of diverse sequence, structure, and binding space of antibodies to antigens in customizable procedures for the design of broad range antibodies with different applications [

This method approaches from antibody sequences and structures by capturing structures from a diverse set of the canonical clusters and complementarity known as CDRs. Accuracy determinations includes sampling of the features using Monte Carlo design procedures [
