<p>Pursuit of repurposing strategy on known drugs against ZIKV revealed that a few antimalarial drugs do possess anti-ZIKV activity in vitro [

 <xref rid="B160-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>]. With a similar objective, we recently reported [
 <xref rid="B41-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] an in silico modeling study by developing an “interaction pharmacophore model” from stereoelectronic properties of 12 known antimalarial aminoquinoline derivatives using quantum chemical (QC) calculations. By utilizing the “interaction pharmacophore model” for similarity analysis on aminoquinoline derivatives found in the published literature [
 <xref rid="B85-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], we identified three antimalarial aminoquinolines, Quinacrine (QC), Mefloquine (MQ), and GSK369796 active against ZIKV in in vitro assay [
 <xref rid="B41-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Activities against ZIKV of the three aminoquinolines were found to be: EC50 values: 2.27 ± 0.14 mM (for QC); 3.95 ± 0.21 mM (for MQ); and 2.57 ± 0.09 mM (for GSK369796). A large extended negative potential region with a large hole over the N atom containing the aromatic ring in the compounds appear to be responsible for potent anti-ZIKV activity of the compounds. Thus, a strong H-bond acceptor site, a moderately strong H-bond donor site and a large distribution of hydrophobic area in the aminoquinolines may be used as pharmacophore template for virtual screening of other databases to identify new potential anti-ZIKV antimalarial compounds. However, both in silico and experimental studies would be required on antimalarial compounds for actual consideration of “repurposing” of old antimalarial drugs as potential anti-ZIKV drugs.
