<p>Most of the anti-ZIKV compounds identified so far have shown only low to moderate in vitro efficacy and rarely in vivo efficacy with clinical data. Therefore, search and testing for new compounds should continue till a suitable less toxic and effective anti-ZIKV drug is found. Although no anti-ZIKV drug has yet been discovered by pharmacophore modeling, many studies have indicated that this approach should provide a robust cornerstone to the medicinal chemists for synthesis of multifunctional inhibitors that will eliminate cross-resistance and toxicity as well as improve patient adherence [
