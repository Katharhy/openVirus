<p>Various approaches have been pursued to identify compounds against ZIKV, targeting host proteins including repurposing of FDA approved drugs [
 <xref rid="B93-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], high throughput screening [
 <xref rid="B94-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>], phenotypic screening [
 <xref rid="B95-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>], and computational methods [

 <xref rid="B96-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. As a result, several potential small molecules, vaccines, and therapeutic antibodies have been identified and developed having anti- ZIKV activity. However, most of these studies were in vitro analysis and only a few selected 20 compounds were actually evaluated in vivo. Promisingly, three compounds of these compounds could reach phase I clinical trials [
 <xref rid="B90-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Subsequently, many promising leads including nine vaccines reached phase I or II clinical trials against ZIKV [
 <xref rid="B97-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. However, none of these compounds has yet been approved by the FDA profiles [
 <xref rid="B89-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>].
