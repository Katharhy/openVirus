<p>With ever changing technologies, drug discovery has become a complex process. It requires ten to fifteen years for taking a new molecule from the bench of discovery to the shelf of a pharmacy for human use. The procedure has to undergo several stringent rounds of animal testing, toxicity evaluations, and human clinical trials before approval by the FDA. Current estimated cost of the process is approximately two billion US dollars. Thus, newer technologies are highly valuable for the pharmaceutical industry to improve the efficiency of the process [

Emergence of in-silico technologies has proven remarkable success in many frontiers of this procedure over the past few decades including pharmacophore modeling and virtual screening of compound databases to identify potential new drugs [
