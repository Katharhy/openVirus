<p>Data-driven modelling strategies for countering Zika have been explored keeping a diverse types of end goals in mind. In a departure from traditional epidemiological modelling, [
 <xref rid="B37-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] attempted to predict new primate reservoirs of ZIKV in the wild based on their phenotypical characteristics. This has the potential to help prevent future explosive spreads of the virus through proactive surveillance and prevention of ZIKV spread from the at-risk primate species. A number of studies have explored quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) approaches for developing drugs for the treatment of Zika. These include identifying the novel compounds that are inhibitors of different enzymes present in ZIKV [
