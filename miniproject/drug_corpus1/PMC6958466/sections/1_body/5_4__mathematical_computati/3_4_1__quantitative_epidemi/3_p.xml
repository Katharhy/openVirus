<p>Here β is the disease transmission rate from an infectious person to a susceptible person, and γ is the recovery rate of an infected individual. There has been extensive research on SIR models and their extensions. Its relevance in modelling of several disease spreads, accounting for context-specific priorities like mortality, population growth, vector-borne transmission etc. can be found in [
 <xref rid="B29-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In the case of Zika, a number of works on SIR modelling of the spread of ZIKA are based on estimating its infectious effect. This is obtained through a quantity called basic reproduction number, generally denoted by R
 <sub>0</sub>. This is defined as the average number of infections caused by an infected person among the population which is susceptible to a disease. In case of ZIKV, the different modes of transmission, viz. vector-borne and sexual, as well as seasonal and geographic variations need to be accounted for while calculating R
 <sub>0</sub>. To this end, [
