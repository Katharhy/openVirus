<p>The WHO reports 14 vaccines that are currently under development at Clinical Phase Trial I and 2 vaccines that have moved in to Clinical Phase Trial II [
 <xref rid="B48-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. They are either DNA-based vaccines or inactivated whole Zika virus (ZIKV) vaccines. Additionally, there are two recombinant viral vectors, a peptide vaccine based on mosquito salivary proteins and another that utilizes prM-E (pre-membrane-envelope) mRNA transcript of ZIKV. The peptide vaccine is particularly of importance as it aims to provide immunity against a broad-spectrum of mosquito-borne viruses along with ZIKV.
