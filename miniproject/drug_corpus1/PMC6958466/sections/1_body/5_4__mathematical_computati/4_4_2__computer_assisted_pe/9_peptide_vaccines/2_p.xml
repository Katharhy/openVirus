<p>Addressing the issue of ADE, Dos Santos Franco et al. (2017) [
 <xref rid="B57-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] were able to specifically elicit the cell-mediated immune response by constructing a NS5-based peptide vaccines that targets both Zika as well as Dengue viruses. Furthermore, Richner et al. (2017) [
 <xref rid="B58-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] assembled modified prME mRNA of Zika virus in lipid nanoparticles. The genetic modification allowed for the inactivation of a cross-reactive envelope protein epitope that led to decreased development of cross-reactive antibodies.
