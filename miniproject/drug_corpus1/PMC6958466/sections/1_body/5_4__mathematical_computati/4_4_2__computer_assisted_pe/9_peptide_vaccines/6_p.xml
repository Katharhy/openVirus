<p>New developments in bioinformatics, information technology, and immunoinformatics are poised to take the science of vaccine design to new heights. The best responses to vaccines will be from those designed specifically for an individual at a specific time period of his/her lifeâ€”clearly an impossible task at the current level of technology. However, there are possibilities of using artificial intelligence (AI) to scan all the genes taking part in the human immune response, especially the adaptive receptors on human B and T immune cells, over millions of individuals to model the human immune response and thereby discover and engineer precision vaccine design [

IBM Watson is reported to be already more efficient in detecting cancer symptoms than humans; precision vaccine design by AI may not be too far a goal [
