<p>Subsequently, the conserved peptide regions are superimposed on an average solvent accessibility profile of the same protein. Conservation at the highest levels of solvent accessibility are ideal candidates to move onto the next step of the rational design of peptide vaccines. Based on the myriad bioinformatics tools and servers at our disposal, and based on the HLA population of the target vaccination community, the selected peptides are determined for strong immunogenic response. Next, a rudimentary BLAST search for sequence similarity will eliminate any peptide candidate likely to cause an autoimmune response. With this exercise, the conserved peptides with high solvent accessibility and no autoimmune threats are to be tested for in vitro and in vivo analyses. Dey et al. (2017) [
