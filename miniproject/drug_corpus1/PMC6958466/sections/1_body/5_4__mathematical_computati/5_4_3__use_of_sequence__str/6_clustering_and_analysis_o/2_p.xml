<p>Sequence descriptors can be used in conjunction with established methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) and self-organizing map (SOM) for sequence comparison [
 <xref rid="B80-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. The basic idea of SOM or Kohonen neural network is the projection from multi-dimensional object space onto two-dimensional grid (map) of neurons. Mathematically, the neurons are multi-dimensional vectors. The projection or learning of network is an iterative non-linear algorithm that arranges samples in two-dimensional map with respect to the similarity among them [
 <xref rid="B80-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Because of the basic property of the mapping to locate similar objects, depending on how they are represented using sequence descriptors, close to each other the Kohonen and CP-ANN are inherently useful tools for clustering. The analysis of the SOM map enables us to recognize the clusters and thus the similarity relationships within the data.
