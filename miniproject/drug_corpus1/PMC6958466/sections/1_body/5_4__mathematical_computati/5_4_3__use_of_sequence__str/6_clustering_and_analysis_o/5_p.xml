 <sup>âˆ’1</sup> being the inverse of covariance matrix. The metric of the space is no more Euclidian but is defined by the distribution of objects in the representation space. In other words, the information about the data set is compressed into the space metric. In statistics, the Mahalanobis distance represents an important tool to show how good an individual object fits into the existing data set, or data domain. In our analysis with 310 samples, the 18 outliers, i.e., the objects with larger distance than average + 2*standard deviation are shown in
