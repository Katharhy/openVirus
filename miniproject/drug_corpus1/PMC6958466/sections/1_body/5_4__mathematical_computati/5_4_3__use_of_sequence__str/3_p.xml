<p>For the comparison of sequences of ZIKV we have used two classes of descriptors based on geometrical and matrix method approaches. In the Nandy et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B75-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,
 <xref rid="B76-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] approach, sequences are represented by graphs, G = (V, R), where the bases of DNA/RNA represent the set of vertices V and the inter-base bonds represent the edge set R. On a 2D rectangular grid system one may start plotting a sequence from the origin going one step in the negative x-direction for an adenine, one step in the positive y-direction for a cytosine, one step in the positive x-direction for a guanine, and one step in the negative y-direction for a thymine (uracil). Doing this successively for each base in the sequence in order plots and gives an overview out a graph of the sequence on the 2D grid that displays the base distribution in the sequence.
