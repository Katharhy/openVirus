 <xref rid="B27-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], Zika virus is an evolving pathogen undergoing numerous changes during its transmission from its site of origin (Uganda) to the countries of Africa, Asia, and the Americas; according to our sequence descriptor index, explained later in this section, an estimate of the overall change in genome sequences would be about 11.63% from Africa to Asia, and another 4.55% change from Asia to the Americas. When a viral pathogen suddenly emerges, it is important that we compare its sequence with already known strains of the same organism and try to assess its degree of novelty and probable pathogenicity/pandemicity as early as possible. The alignment-based methods like BLAST [
 <xref rid="B69-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] are popular for the comparison of sequences. In the comparison of chemical structures, there are alignment-based methods like comparative molecular field analysis or CoMFA [

 <xref rid="B74-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] which quantify various aspects of the entire molecular structure. Some studies on the comparison of CoMFA and numerical mathematical descriptors for chemicals show that such methods give comparable results [

 <xref rid="B74-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. In a similar fashion, the field of bioinformatics also witnessed the development of alignment-free sequence descriptors [

 <xref rid="B76-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Such alignment-free numerical descriptors and factors derived from them may be used as fast tools for sequence comparison for emerging pathogens and gain new insights.
