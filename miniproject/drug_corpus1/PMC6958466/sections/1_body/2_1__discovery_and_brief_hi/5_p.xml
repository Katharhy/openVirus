On 2 March 2015 Brazil notified WHO of reports of an illness characterized by skin rash in the northeastern states. From February 2015 to 29 April 2015, nearly 7000 cases of illness with skin rash were reported in these states. All cases were mild, with no reported deaths. Zika was not suspected at that stage, and no tests for Zika were carried out. On 1 February 2016, WHO [

It should be mentioned that WHO later relaxed this warning subsequently in the November of 2016.
