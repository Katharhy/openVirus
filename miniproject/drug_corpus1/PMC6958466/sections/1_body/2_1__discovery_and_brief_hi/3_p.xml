<p>Regarding the spread of ZIKV from Africa to Asia, Liang et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] put forward an interesting idea about this process based on mathematical modeling. These authors carried out quantitative analysis of ZIKV evolution, nucleotide substitution rate, and the time to the most recent common ancestors (tMRCAs). Based on their results these authors concluded that a “global dissemination of ZIKV spread was likely to have originated from Africa, followed by eastward transmission to south-eastern Asia, Oceania, South America, Caribbean, and Central America.”
