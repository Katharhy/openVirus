<p>The 3′ terminal end of ZIKV has a sub-genomic Flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) region that is essential for causing diseases in humans [

 <xref rid="B14-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The envelope protein comprises most of the virion surface. It participates in viral-host cell binding and membrane fusion during replication. Replication of ZIKV occurs in the cytoplasm of infected cells [

 <xref rid="B16-pharmaceuticals-12-00157" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. After endocytosis mediated by a still unknown cellular receptor, viral fusion occurs with endosomal membranes. This results in the uncoating of the viral particle and release of the viral genome. The genome is subsequently translated into a single polyprotein at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The polyprotein is processed by viral NS2B–NS3 protease and other cellular proteases generating mature viral proteins. The positive-sense viral RNA genome is then copied to produce a negative-sense RNA molecule chain, which is used as the template for the synthesis of the full length positive-sense viral genomic RNA. Synthesis of viral genome occurs in association with the ER and is catalyzed by a replication complex consisting of NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and other NS proteins. The new genomes are packaged by the C protein; they acquire envelopes while budding from the ER. These immature virions thus produced are translocated through the cellular secretory pathways, where E glycosylation and cleavage of prM by host furin protease occurs producing the mature virions that are released by exocytosis.
