    <italic>Through mosquito bites</italic>: ZIKV is transmitted to people primarily through the bite of infected mosquitoes (
    <italic>A. aegypti</italic> or 
    <italic>A. albopictus</italic>). Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on a person already infected with the virus. Infected mosquitoes can then spread the virus to other people through bites.

   <label>(c)</label>
   <p>
    <italic>Through sex</italic>: ZIKV can be transmitted through sex from a person who has Zika to his or her partners.

It can be passed from a person with Zika before their symptoms start, while they have symptoms, and after their symptoms end.
