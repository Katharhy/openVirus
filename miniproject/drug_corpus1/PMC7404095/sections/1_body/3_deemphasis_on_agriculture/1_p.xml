<p>Do sources like WHO, CDC, and the Gates Foundation provide a complete picture? Some well-motivated people work for these agencies, and much helpful information is available. But mistakes get made, as have occurred multiple times during the COVID-19 pandemic, and more importantly these sources rarely address the upstream causes of epidemics. Many have commented about the devastating funding cutbacks and de-prioritization that have crippled these organizationsâ€™ capacity to protect public health. As just one example, the annual program budget of WHO for the whole world is smaller by about half than the operating budget of a large medical center in the United States (WHO: $4.34 billion; New York Presbyterian Hospital: about $8 billion).
