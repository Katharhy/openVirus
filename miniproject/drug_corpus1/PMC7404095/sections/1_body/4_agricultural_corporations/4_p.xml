 </sup> In this “tabletop exercise,” coordinated by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, Gates Foundation, and World Economic Forum, a novel coronavirus pandemic begins at pig farms in Brazil and spreads rapidly around the world, resulting in 65 million deaths and catastrophic effects on the global economy, political stability, and international security. After the COVID-19 epidemic actually began, the sponsors of Event 201 emphasized that they did not predict the timing of COVID-19 and that the projected death toll did not necessarily apply. But they did not say anything about an initiative to eradicate the practices of capitalist industrial agriculture that led to the hypothetical scenario of Event 201, to the current global COVID-19 pandemic, and to the inevitable future pandemics that will occur on a similar scale or even worse.
