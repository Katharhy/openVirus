<p>This pandemic and every other important emerging viral epidemic in the recent past and predictably into the future come from the same upstream causes: capitalist industrial agriculture, destruction of natural habitat, and production of meat. In recent decades, the intensity and worldwide scale of these practices have increased rapidly. Pioneering microbiological and epidemiological studies have clarified these upstream causes of emerging epidemics, whose effects we now are confronting every day.

 </sup> In addition to viral epidemics, these and similar agricultural practices also deepen the parallel crises of multi-drug-resistant bacterial infections (through overuse of antibiotics in industrial meat and fish production), climate change (by destruction of rainforest habitats and long-distance transportation of food that requires burning of petroleum), plastic pollution (by agricultural packaging methods), and other severe environmental problems.
