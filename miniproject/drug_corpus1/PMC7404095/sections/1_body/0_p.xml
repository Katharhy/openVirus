<p>While struggling to lessen the many downstream effects of COVID-19, through dangerous and sometimes heroic efforts, we in medicine and public health also must try to maintain a clear and relentless focus upstream on the root causes of the pandemic. Clarity about the upstream causes rarely emerges in current discussions of the pandemic, even in the scientific and public health communities, and hardly ever in pronouncements of the public health institutions on which many of us rely: the World Health Organization (WHO), U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Pan American Health Organization, Gates Foundation, and so forth. Identifying the upstream causes of epidemics has been a central goal of epidemiology since the 1840s, when the pathologist Rudolf Virchow did his path-breaking investigation of the typhus epidemic in Upper Silesia. Due to the current pandemicâ€™s magnitude, one would expect that the upstream causes would be crystal-clear for all to see, so we could address them directly, but amazingly this is not the case.</p>
