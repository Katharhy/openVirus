 </xref> In addition, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, drugs currently used in combination with LVP/r for the treatment of COVID 19, also prolong QT, increasing the risk of ventricular arrhythmia (torsade de pointes). Therefore, the QT interval should be monitored in those patients with risk factors, avoiding drugs that prolong QT as much as possible.
