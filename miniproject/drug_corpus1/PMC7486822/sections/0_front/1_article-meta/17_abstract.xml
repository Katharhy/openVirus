  <title>Objectives</title>
  <p>To determine the prevalence of potential interactions in COVID19 patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r). The secondary objective was to develop recommendations and identify the risk factors associated with presenting potential interactions with LPV/r.</p>

 <sec>
  <title>Subjects and methods</title>
  <p>Cross-sectional and multicenter study with the participation of 2 hospitals. COVID 19 patients over 18 years of age, admitted to hospital and under treatment with LPV/r were included. A screening of potential interactions related to LPV/r and home and hospital medication was carried out. Lexicomp® (Uptodate), HIV-drug interactions and COVID-drug interactions were used as the query database.</p>

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>361 patients with a mean age of 62.77 ± 14.64 years were included, where 59.6% (n = 215) were men. 62.3% (n = 225) had 1 or more potential interactions and 26, 87% (n = 97) 2 or more. The independent variables associated with presenting ≥1 potential interactions were age (&gt;65) (OR 1.95; 95% CI 1.06–3.59, 
   <italic>P</italic> = .033), ICU admission (OR 9.22; CI 95% 1.98–42.93; 
   <italic>P</italic> = .005), previous respiratory pathology (OR 2.90; 95% CI 1.15–7.36; 
   <italic>P</italic> = .024), psychiatric (OR 4.14; 95 CI% 1.36–12.61; 
   <italic>P</italic> = .013), dyslipidemia (OR 3.21; 95% CI 1.63–6.35; 
   <italic>P</italic> = .001) and the number of drugs prescribed (OR 4.33; 95% CI 2.40–7.81; 
   <italic>P</italic> = .000).

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p>The prevalence of potential interactions in COVD 19 patient undergoing treatment with LPV/r is high, with age (&gt;65), ICU admission, previous respiratory and psychiatric pathology, dyslipidemia and the number of prescribed drugs acting as risk factors.</p>
