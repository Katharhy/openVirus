<p id="p0045">The overall pandemic of COVID-19 significantly challenges open clinical frameworks. With restricted clinical assets, treatment needs are controlled by the severity of the patient. Though numerous mild outpatients rapidly turned into serious or critical stage, it’s more significant to recognize them early and give opportune treatment for optimizing treatment procedure and lessening mortality. AI capacities can be valuable to analyze, predict and clarify (treat) COVID-19 contaminations, and help oversee financial effects. So far, most clinical utilizations of artificial intelligence to the COVID-19 reaction have concentrated on diagnosis dependent on clinical imaging. The quality of the present diagnostic methods at the initial introduction of the disease has been questioned. In recent writings, it has been discovered that a few research works use artificial intelligence to help analyze computational tomography (CT) scans, while other research works use patient’s clinical information to predict the advancement of the infection [
