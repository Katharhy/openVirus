<p id="p0060">A novel methodology was proposed dependent on features contained in patients’ clinical data and blood tests to assist doctors in identifying high-risk patients as early as they can under these circumstances, thus improving the forecasting of patients and lessening the mortality of those that are seriously sick [
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In lieu of this, a forecast model dependent on the XGBoost calculation was made to predict mortality risk and distinguish key features which can be estimated in clinics. The researchers found out three key clinical pointers (lactic dehydrogenase, lymphocyte and high-affectability C-receptive protein) for assessing a patient’s mortality. A plus point of this method is its interpretability, the three indicators identified by the methodology correspond to the most significant factors in the pathophysiological progress of COVID-19, specifically cell injury, cell immunity, and inflammation [
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. A corresponding report meant to forecast if existing COVID-19 patients would require a long stay in hospitals or not, based on a U-Net subsidiary trained on CT imaging data [
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These two methodologies can help in recognizing the patients that may require escalated and long-term care, helping clinics deal more adequately. At last, while both of these investigations were constrained in scope and information, they establish significant roads of research that can be supplemented and stretched out with clinical information from approaching cases the world over.
