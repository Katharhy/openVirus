<p id="p0075">Group of specialists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are building an approach to obstruct the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 by making a "decoy" receptor, or protein, that could be taken as a medication. Coronaviruses cause sickness by binding the bodyâ€™s ACE2 receptors. The MIT specialists are utilizing an AI model trained on data about the ACE2 receptor to simulate the connection between the baits and the virus [

 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Such models utilize three sorts of information: the crystal structure of the protein, the co-crystalized ligands, and the homology model of the protein. For each info type, various models including Generative Auto-encoders and Generative Adversarial Networks are utilized [
