<p id="p0070">When virus RNA genome first enters a cell, it mingles with the hostâ€™s protein-production, utilizing it to make proteins that can duplicate RNA molecules. These RNA-replicating proteins, called "polymerases," make a target for treatments [
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Proteins have a 3D structure, which is evaluated by their genetically encoded amino acid sequence, and this structure impacts the role and purpose of the protein [
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. There are two primary ways to deal with the forecast task: template modeling, which predicts structure utilizing similar proteins as a template sequence, and the other is template free modeling, which predicts structure for proteins that have unknown related structure [
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The AlphaFold model depends on an enlarged ResNet architecture and uses amino acid sequences, and also features taken out from parallel amino acid sequences using several sequence arrangements, to foresee the distance and the dispersal of angles between amino acid residues [
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This framework has been applied to anticipate the structures of six proteins identified with SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2 membrane protein, protein 3a, Nsp2, Nsp4, Nsp6, and papain-like proteinase) [
