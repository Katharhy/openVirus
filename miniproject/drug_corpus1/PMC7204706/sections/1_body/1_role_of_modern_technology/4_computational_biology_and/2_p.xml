<p id="p0065">Computational Biology includes the development &amp; use of data analytics, mathematical modeling and computational simulation procedures to study biology. Computational biologists are assisting with battling coronavirus through disease modeling and finding another medication for this pandemic. Disease dynamics modeling contributes in understanding the effect of parameters that rules the spread of the infection, and the impact that mediations can have in controlling this spread [
