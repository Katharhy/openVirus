<p id="p0025">Ever since the first report of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) at Wuhan, China in December 2019, it has affected over 200 countries and territories around the world with two million cases and more than 120,000 deaths as on 21 April 2020. With this growing crisis, companies &amp; researchers over the world are looking for the ways to address the challenges of this virus, to mitigate the spread and develop a cure for this disease. In this baffling battle, science and technology is playing a vital role. For example, early in the outbreak when China initiated its response to virus it focused on artificial intelligence (AI) by relying on like facial recognition cameras to track the infected patients with travel history, robots to deliver food and medicines, drones to disinfect public places, to patrol and broadcast audio messages to public encouraging them to stay at home [

Many researchers are using AI to find new drugs and medicines for the cure, along with some computer science researchers focusing on detecting the infectious patients through medical image processing like X-rays and CT scans [
