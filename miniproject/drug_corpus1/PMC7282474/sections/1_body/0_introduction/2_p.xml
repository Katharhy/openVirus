<p>At present, as the COVID-19 epidemic has expanded worldwide, the task of epidemic prevention and control has become more arduous, and the world is facing enormous challenges. To provide theoretical and practical references to other counties on how health information technology can be used to respond to the COVID-19 epidemic as well as to various public health emergencies and disasters, in this study, we develop a technical framework responding to the COVID-19 epidemic from a health informatics perspective. Based on this framework, we also review specific health information technology practices for managing the outbreak in China, describe the highlights of these applications in detail, and finally discuss critical issues to consider when using health information technology.</p>
