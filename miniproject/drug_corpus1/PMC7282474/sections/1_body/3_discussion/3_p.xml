<p>The COVID-19 epidemic is currently showing a global pandemic trend, and our understanding of the new coronavirus is deepening. Global health information technology practitioners should be proactive and use their professional skills to respond to the COVID-19 epidemic. Practice in China shows that health information technologies play a very important role in responding to the COVID-19 epidemic. Therefore, we believe that the health informatics communities in all countries should react quickly and make full use of health information technology to respond to the epidemic.</p>
