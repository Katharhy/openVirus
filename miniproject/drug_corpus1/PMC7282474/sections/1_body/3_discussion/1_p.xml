<p>This study makes important theoretical and practical contributions. First, this paper discusses informatics response and experience in responding to the COVID-19 epidemic in China through a health informatics lens. We may have made oversights in our case collection; however, that does not detract from our demonstration of the efforts made by the Chinese health information community and the results they have achieved. Practical experience in China has demonstrated that emerging technologies have unique advantages and can play pivotal roles in addressing major public health challenges. Other countries facing a COVID-19 pandemic should consider using health information technology as part of their public health response. The COVID-19 epidemic is a common challenge facing humanity, and as the epidemic spreads, health information professionals from all countries must share their experiences and work together to explore a complete information technology response framework to improve the response to the current COVID-19 pandemic and to future public health emergencies.</p>
