<p>We first defined and described the health information technology elements of response to an outbreak in terms of health information technology participants, service recipients, technologies, and application scenarios.

Through this framework, we provide clear understanding of how health information technology is being applied to the epidemic response and how it functions at different stages of the epidemic.</p>
