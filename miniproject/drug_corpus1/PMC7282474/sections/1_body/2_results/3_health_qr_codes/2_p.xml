<p>There are currently three colors of health QR codes: red, yellow, and green (
 <xref rid="figure2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). These colors indicate three states of health. Different regions have different definitions and requirements for red and yellow codes, while green codes uniformly indicate that a person currently has no symptoms of COVID-19; these codes can be used to quickly judge an individualâ€™s health status. Health QR codes not only play a major role in epidemic prevention and control but will also greatly enhance the digital transformation of government and the efficiency of public services.
