 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup>, including replicase complex (ORF1ab), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). The ORF1ab gene encodes the non-structural proteins (nsp) of viral RNA synthesis complex through proteolytic processing
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
 </sup>. The nsp12 is a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, together with co-factors nsp7 and nsp8 possessing high polymerase activity. From the protein 3D structure view of SARS-CoV nsp12, it contains a larger N-terminal extension (which binds to nsp7 and nsp8) and polymerase domain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). The spike is a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in mediating viral infection through binding the host receptor

 </sup>. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> shows the 3D structure of the spike protein bound with the host receptor angiotensin converting enznyme2 (ACE2) in SARS-CoV (PDB ID: 6ACK). A recent study showed that 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 is able to utilize ACE2 as an entry receptor in ACE2-expressing cells

 </sup>, suggesting potential drug targets for therapeutic development. Furthermore, cryo-EM structure of the spike and biophysical assays reveal that the 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 spike binds ACE2 with higher affinity than SARS-CoV

 </sup>. In addition, the nucleocapsid is also an important subunit for packaging the viral genome through protein oligomerization
