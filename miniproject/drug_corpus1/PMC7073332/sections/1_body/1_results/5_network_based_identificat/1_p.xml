 </sup>. However, our ability to identify and validate effective combinations is limited by a combinatorial explosion, driven by both the large number of drug pairs and dosage combinations. In our recent study, we proposed a novel network-based methodology to identify clinically efficacious drug combinations

 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). Here we sought to identify drug combinations that may provide a synergistic effect in potentially treating 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 with well-defined mechanism-of-action by network analysis. For the 16 potential repurposable drugs (Fig.
