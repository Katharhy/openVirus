 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup> by interacting with and destabilizing the Ebola virus glycoprotein

 </sup> (Table

 </sup>, and blocked an interaction between the SARS-CoV spike protein and ACE2 (ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>
 </sup>). Altogether, network analyses and published experimental data suggested that combining toremifene and emdoin offered a potential therapeutic approach for 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 (Fig.
