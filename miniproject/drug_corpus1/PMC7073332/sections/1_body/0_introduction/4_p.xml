<p id="Par5">In this study, we present an integrative antiviral drug repurposing methodology, which combines a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform that quantifies the interplay between the virusâ€“host interactome and drug targets in the human PPI network. The basis for these experiments rests on the notions that (i) the proteins that functionally associate with viral infection (including HCoV) are localized in the corresponding subnetwork within the comprehensive human PPI network and (ii) proteins that serve as drug targets for a specific disease may also be suitable drug targets for potential antiviral infection owing to common PPIs and functional pathways elucidated by the human interactome (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We follow this analysis with bioinformatics validation of drug-induced gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics in human cell lines to inspect the postulated mechanism-of-action in a specific HCoV for which we propose repurposing (Fig.
