  <title>Drug-target network analysis of the HCoV–host interactome.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold> A subnetwork highlighting the HCoV–host interactome. Nodes represent three types of HCoV-associated host proteins: targetgable (proteins can be targeted by approved drugs or drugs under clinical trials), non-targetable (proteins do not have any known ligands), neighbors (protein–protein interaction partners). Edge colors indicate five types of experimental evidence of the protein–protein interactions (see Materials and methods). 3D three-dimensional structure. 
   <bold>b</bold>, 
   <bold>c</bold> KEGG human pathway (
   <bold>b</bold>) and gene ontology enrichment analyses (
   <bold>c</bold>) for the HCoV-associated proteins.
