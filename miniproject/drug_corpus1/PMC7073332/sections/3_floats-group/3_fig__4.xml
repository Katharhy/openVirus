  <title>A discovered drug-HCoV network.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold> A subnetwork highlighting network-predicted drug-HCoV associations connecting 135 drugs and HCoVs. From the 2938 drugs evaluated, 135 ones achieved significant proximities between drug targets and the HCoV-associated proteins in the human interactome network. Drugs are colored by their first-level of the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system code. 
   <bold>b</bold> A heatmap highlighting network proximity values for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, IBV, and MHV, respectively. Color key denotes network proximity (
   <italic>Z</italic>-score) between drug targets and the HCoV-associated proteins in the human interactome network. 
   <italic>P</italic> value was computed by permutation test.
