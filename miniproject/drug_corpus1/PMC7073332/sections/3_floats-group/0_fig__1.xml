  <title>Overall workflow of this study.</title>
  <p>Our network-based methodology combines a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform that quantifies the interplay between the virus–host interactome and drug targets in the human PPI network. 
   <bold>a</bold> Human coronavirus (HCoV)-associated host proteins were collected from literatures and pooled to generate a pan-HCoV protein subnetwork. 
   <bold>b</bold> Network proximity between drug targets and HCoV-associated proteins was calculated to screen for candidate repurposable drugs for HCoVs under the human protein interactome model. 
   <bold>c</bold>, 
   <bold>d</bold> Gene set enrichment analysis was utilized to validate the network-based prediction. 
   <bold>e</bold> Top candidates were further prioritized for drug combinations using network-based method captured by the “
   <italic>Complementary Exposure</italic>” pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV–host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human interactome network. 
   <bold>f</bold> Overall hypothesis of the network-based methodology: (i) the proteins that functionally associate with HCoVs are localized in the corresponding subnetwork within the comprehensive human interactome network; and (ii) proteins that serve as drug targets for a specific disease may also be suitable drug targets for potential antiviral infection owing to common protein–protein interactions elucidated by the human interactome.
