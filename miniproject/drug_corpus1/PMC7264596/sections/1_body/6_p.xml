Remdesivir (Gilead), a reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor designed originally against SARS RT, has in vitro activity against SARS‐CoV‐2 and is currently undergoing trials in multiple U.S. centers and abroad. In a preliminary report of 53 patients in a multi‐institutional compassionate use cohort, including a spectrum of illness severity, 68% had improvement in oxygenation; however, the study lacked a control group, so the benefit is difficult to assess

Favipiravir (Fujifilm), another viral replication inhibitor designed for treatment of influenza, is also undergoing randomized trials in the U.S. and abroad. Selinexor, a candidate anti‐cancer drug that inhibits nuclear export of viral proteins, is also the subject of expanded studies against COVID‐19.
