<p>The President's endorsement of hydroxychloroquine has raised concern among scientists and clinicians at many levels, not simply because of the lack of convincing data to support its general use against COVID‐19. The wide‐ranging and unsupervised deployment of this medication will undoubtedly affect the ability of serious researchers to recruit patients to randomized trials of this drug and to trials of other more promising agents. Despite the assertion, “What have you got to lose!”, there are serious risks with introducing any new medication, particularly in severely ill people. Hydroxychloroquine is not an innocuous agent. It causes retinal degeneration, myopathy, QT interval elongation, and rarely, ventricular arrhythmias. It is metabolized by hepatic P450 enzymes and thus is capable of significant interaction with antibiotics, sedatives, and other medications commonly used in the treatment of COVID‐19 patients. In patients with hepatic failure, which occurs with multi‐organ failure in acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with COVID‐19, the clearance of hydroxychloroquine is delayed, increasing the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Its general use in severely ill COVID‐19 patients, outside of a research setting, carries the risk of unexpected and potentially lethal side effects, while learning very little in the process.</p>
