<p>The first thought in preventing a recurrence of COVID‐19 is to develop, test, and broadly administer an effective vaccine 
 <xref rid="onco13337-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>. The process of vaccine development will require large‐scale testing in virus‐naïve populations, will likely take more than one year, and will require worldwide cooperation 
 <xref rid="onco13337-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>. It is not sufficient to stop an epidemic in one country, given the level of international travel and commerce. That cooperation must include China, which has been the source of several coronavirus outbreaks and which has the ability to develop and produce vaccines on a massive scale. We realized as a result of our current experience that China is currently the major producer of the world's medical equipment, including masks, protective gowns, and ventilators, as well as the chemical ingredients in most of our medications. A collaborative relationship with health authorities in China will be crucial to our ability to cope with future epidemics.
