<p>Efforts to discover drugs for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection will likely identify more effective and specifically‐targeted compounds 
 <xref rid="onco13337-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>. In recent years the pharmaceutical industry has had remarkable success developing antivirals against HIV‐AIDS, hepatitis B and C, and herpes viruses. There are obvious SARS‐CoV‐2 targets: the viral reverse transcriptase necessary for replication, a protease TMPRSS2 required to cleave the spike protein that provides viral entry 
 <xref rid="onco13337-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, the ACE2 receptor on lung epithelium that interacts with spike, and small molecules that inhibit ACE2. It is possible, although unproven, that common ACE2 receptor inhibitors now used as anti‐hypertensives would block viral entry and mitigate infection. Single agent antiviral therapy may not be sufficient. Antivirals in combination (as they are now used against HIV and hepatitis infection) could be invaluable in prophylaxis against infection and in treating infection before it becomes life‐threatening.
