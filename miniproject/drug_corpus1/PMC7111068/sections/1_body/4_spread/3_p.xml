<p>Wu and Leung (
 <xref rid="mbt213557-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2020a</xref>) estimated the national and global spread of the novel coronavirus on the basis of the air and train traffic data from and to Wuhan, accounting for the strict metropolitan‐wide quarantine measure imposed on Wuhan on January 24 by using an infection metapopulation model. According to this calculation, sufficient numbers of infected subjects had already been exported to major Chinese cities (900 infected subjects to five cities) to start secondary local epidemics. The peak of the Wuhan epidemic was predicted for April 2020 and that of local epidemics peaks in other Chinese cities would lag by 1–2 weeks. If transmissibility could be reduced by 25% through restrictions of people’s mobility, then the magnitude of the epidemic could be reduced by 50% and the peak of the epidemic would be delayed by one month. One major unknown factor of this model is the seasonality of the novel coronavirus infections, respiratory infections being typical winter infections declining with the warming of the seasons. Research, available only as preprint (Lai 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mbt213557-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), estimated that more than 800 infected subjects from Wuhan travelled to international destinations, with Thailand and Japan leading the list. Public health measures must therefore also be taken in these countries to contain the international spread of the epidemic. The epidemic has also reached Europe with an unexplained focus in Northern Italy. Particularly, worrisome will be the spread of infections to African countries where many regions have close economic connections with China, but insufficient hospital and public health resources to assure efficient containment measures (Gilbert 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mbt213557-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Risk of transmission to Africa and South America is, however, by some epidemiologists considered to be low (Haider 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mbt213557-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). It is currently unclear whether transmission will be muted in agro‐economies with lower population densities.
