<p>In late December 2019, Chinese physicians identified a series of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, an 11‐million inhabitant megacity and traffic hub in central China. The infections were epidemiologically associated with a seafood ‘wet’ market in the city. ‘Wet’ market means that live and dead animals are sold, raising the suspicion of another zoonotic virus infection that had spilled over into the human population similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2002, which also started from a live animal market. In SARS, the viral source was traced back to a bat coronavirus with civets as potential intermediate host. The novel Wuhan virus figures under different names (2019‐nCoV for novel coronavirus in the research literature, SARS‐CoV‐2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, COVID‐19 as disease denominator by WHO), all names indicating that it represents a coronavirus. One might argue whether ‘new’ instead of ‘novel’ coronavirus is not a better term since it is not completely different, but related to the SARS coronavirus, while others find that SARS‐CoV‐2 suggests a too close relations with the SARS virus possibly leading to some confusion (Jiang
