  <title>Spatial structures of HA1 belonging to the majorities of avian- and human-derived H7N9 AIVs and the transitional ones.</title>
  <p>The focused substitutions were labelled by deep green. a, d, and g are of the majority of avian-derived H7N9 AIVs, and the template for homology modelling was 4fqv (Identity 98.44%); b, e, and h are of the transitional ones, and the template for homology modelling was also 4fqv (Identity 98.13%); c, f, and i are of the majority of human-derived H7N9 AIVs, and the template for homology modelling was 5v2a (Identity 99.07%). a-c display the substitutions of site 128(136), while d-i displayed the substitutions of site 135(143) from two different perspectives.
