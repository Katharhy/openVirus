<p>In the spring of 2013, the first human infection with a novel AIV of H7N9 subtype (referred to as novel H7N9 AIV) emerged in Eastern China, causing severe human infections and deaths [

H7N9 has thus become a major public health issue. Previous studies have described the novel H7N9 AIV as a triple-reassortant virus of H7, N9, and H9N2 influenza viruses. Phylogenetic characteristics, variations involving key amino acids, virulence, and pathogenicity to human or animals regarding one or more strains isolated from human or bird have been well described [
