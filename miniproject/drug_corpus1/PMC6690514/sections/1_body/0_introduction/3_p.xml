<p>Several viral proteins of IAVs are known to be responsible for immune response, host adaptation, or interspecies transmission, of which the membrane protein HA is the major determinant [

 <xref rid="pone.0220249.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], while the balance between HA receptor-binding affinity and NA receptor-destroying activity is critical for the efficient growth of IAVs. NA also contributes to influenza virus species specificity and determines the virulence and drug resistance of AIVs [
 <xref rid="pone.0220249.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In this study, we further clarified the molecular basis of host tropism and virulence characteristics of novel H7N9 AIVs and provide evidence on the surveillance and early warning signs of an H7N9 epidemic. We used relevant influenza virus bioinformatics databases to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of HA and NA, screen the key amino acid sites related to virulence and infectious characteristics, and predict the possible evolution and mutation trends of novel H7N9 AIVs in the future.
