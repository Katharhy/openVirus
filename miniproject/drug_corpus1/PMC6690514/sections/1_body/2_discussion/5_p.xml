<p>Selection pressure may be manifested by the way of host immune system response to the virus. Although the H7N9 vaccine has not been used in humans, with the increase in natural infections in the population, the immune background of human population gradually accumulates and the immune barrier is gradually improving [

 <xref rid="pone.0220249.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This inference is in line with reality; in China, especially in East China, there are relatively high proportions of antibodies against H7 subtype AIVs in human, particularly, in the poultry workers [

 <xref rid="pone.0220249.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], the immune pressure among poultry will increase over time, and the viruses will further evolve. Thus, it is also of great significance to strengthen the continuous surveillance of H7N9 AIV poultry to better understand the mutational pattern of the virus, develop prevention and control measures, and screening vaccine strains.
