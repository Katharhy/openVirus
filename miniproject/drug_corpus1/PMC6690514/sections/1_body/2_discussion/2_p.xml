<p>Human infections and deaths caused by novel H7N9 AIVs are much higher than any previous H7 subtype influenza [

 <xref rid="pone.0220249.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Compared with early H7, the HA of the novel H7N9 AIVs appeared to have as many as 18 substitutions. Many of these substitutions are located in known antigenic epitopes or the RBS domain of HA1 and were rare in previous H7 subtype AIVs. This means that such substitutions are likely to play a pivotal role in the emergence of novel H7N9 AIV and the outbreak of epidemics; one or more of these substitutions work together might be the molecular basis of virulence enhancement. As for NA, its role is mainly catalytic and it is also important for drug resistance. However, compared with N9, most of the substitutions within NA of novel H7N9 AIVs are rarely located on known drug resistance sites or enzyme activity centers. There are also many sites that are not located at known key sites such as 245(236) and 279(270) in the HA1 subunit and all substitutions involving HA2. There are two explanations for such substitutions. One is that although some amino acid sites are related to virulence and pathogenicity of the virus, these have not been confirmed to date. For example, because HA2 is not a membrane surface subunit of HA, its role in virulence and pathogenicity has been neglected for a long time. In fact, as non-surface proteins, PB1, PB2, and M are all related to the pathogenicity and host tropism of AIVs [

 <xref rid="pone.0220249.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and new antigenic epitopes of novel H7N9 AIVs also have been frequently reported [

 <xref rid="pone.0220249.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, the significance of these substitutions in virulence and pathogenicity deserves further investigation.
