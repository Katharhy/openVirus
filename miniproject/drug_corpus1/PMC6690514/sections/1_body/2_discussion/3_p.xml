<p>As typical AIVs, spillover infections of H7 or N9 from birds to humans should have a corresponding molecular basis. This study found that there are four significant substitutions between avian-derived and human-derived H7 HAs, namely, 136(128), 143(135), 396, and 499. Two significant substitutions in N9 NAs, namely 247(242) and 327(322), also display host specificity. Whether these substitutions are more conducive to cross-species transmission of the virus require further investigation, although homology modelling has revealed that 136(128) and 143(135) are indeed located within the RBS domain of HA1 [

These substitutions might be important to determine which host species can be infected by these H7N9 AIVs and play a decisive role in H7N9 spillover infections from bird to human. So far, there is no report on the substitution of these two sites and thus these have yet to be confirmed. However, a Q235(226)L substitution, which corresponds to position 226 in H3N2 subtype HA and its substitution is considered to be the key factor causing cross-species transmission of AIVs[
