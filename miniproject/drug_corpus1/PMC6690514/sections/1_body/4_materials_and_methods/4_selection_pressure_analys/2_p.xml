<p>The overall selection pressures within each matrix of HA or NA were calculated by using the Datamonkey online server (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.datamonkey.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.datamonkey.org/</ext-link>). HKY85 was selected as the phylogeny test model and single likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC) served as the algorithm. When prior trees were needed, neighbor-joining statistical method, Kimura-2 parameters model, and the bootstrap test with 1,000 replicates were adopted to construct the trees[

 <xref rid="pone.0220249.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Due to the greater accumulation of deleterious mutations that have not yet purged at the population level, estimates of selection pressure can be biased when analyzing intensively sampled populations. To avoid bias, repeatedly submitted sequences were strictly eliminated. Based on the phylogenetic tree and homogeneous identities, sequences shared more than 99% identity were randomly left one for subsequent analysis, and the rest were removed.
