<p>For a protein-encoded nucleotide sequence, if the nonsynonymous substitution caused by a codon mutation is significantly greater than the synonymous substitution caused by this mutation, then this amino acid site is considered subject to a positive selection pressure; if the situation is reversed, then it is considered to be subjected to negative selection pressure. Positive selection pressure may be beneficial to the survival of new mutations, while negative selection pressure may lead to the elimination of new mutations. Selection pressure can be expressed by formula ɷ = 
 <italic>dN/dS</italic>, which is the ratio of nonsynonymous changes per nonsynonymous site (
 <italic>dN</italic>) to synonymous changes per synonymous site (
 <italic>dS</italic>). This ratio is used to infer the type of evolutionary pressure acting on a protein: when ɷ&gt;1, positive Darwinian selection is inferred, when ɷ = 1.0, strict neutrality is inferred, and when ɷ&lt;1, purifying selection is inferred [
