The amino acid majorities of HA and NA belonging to the novel H7N9 AIVs and H7Nx or HxN9 that were established before 2013 were again compared using MegaAlign. When there were different majorities at the same sites, their polymorphisms of amino acids were counted by MS-word by using the function of search-replacement. The composition ratios of amino acid polymorphisms were tested by chi-square analysis with SPSS 13.0. The difference was significant when
