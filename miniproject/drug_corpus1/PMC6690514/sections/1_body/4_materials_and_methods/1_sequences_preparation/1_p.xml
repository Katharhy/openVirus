<p>HA and NA nucleotide sequences were downloaded from two databases, the Influenza Virus Resource of NCBI (

 <italic>only GISAID uploaded isolates</italic> was chosen. For novel H7N9 AIVs, matrices of both HA and NA were downloaded as one of the following: from all host animals, from human only, and from avian only. The 
 <italic>collection date</italic> (not the 
 <italic>release date</italic> or 
 <italic>submission date</italic>) was set as 
 <italic>2013/03/01-</italic>. For the H7 and N9 before the H7N9 epidemics, sequence matrices were downloaded as the formula of H7Nx and HxN9, and the 
 <italic>collection date</italic> (not the 
 <italic>release date</italic> or 
 <italic>submission date</italic>) was set as –
 <italic>2012/12/31</italic>. After removing repetitive sequences manually according to the isolates’ name and removing poor quality sequences that were filled with consecutive letters “n”, all of the matrices were aligned by MAFFT v7.0 (
