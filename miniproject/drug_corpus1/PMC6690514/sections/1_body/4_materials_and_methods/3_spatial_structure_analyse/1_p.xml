<p>As mentioned above, HA is the major determinant for host immune response, host adaptation, or interspecies transmission. The globular head of HA, namely HA1, has the most important domain for binding to receptors on host epithelial cells triggering viral infection, as well as for antigen-antibody reactions [

The variations in the amino acids of the protein primary structure at key sites might lead to changes in protein tertiary structure, which allows ease or difficulty for viruses to bind to specific ligands such as antibodies or receptors located on the surfaces of host-specific epithelial cells. Amino acid sequences of HA1 most similar to human- or avian-derived majorities were obtained by BLASTp (

Homology modelling was done by Automated Mode via the ExPASy web server (
