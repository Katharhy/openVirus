<p>Compared with early H7 and N9, the HA and NA of the novel H7N9 AIVs appeared to have as many as 22 and 26 substitutions, respectively. Four sites within H7, i.e., S136(128)N, A143(135)V, E396A, and S499R, and two sites within N9, i.e., S247(242)P and N327(322)S, showed significant host specificity, which may play a role in determining host tropism. To elucidate the mechanism of the novel H7N9 epidemic occurrence and transmission, further experiments are needed to confirm these findings. This study also found that in the early evolution of H7 and N9, positive selection pressure played a limited role, and purifying selection largely contributed to its pathogenicity. However, since the outbreak of H7N9, the virus has been subjected to positive selection pressure at many sites, especially in human population. This suggests that H7N9 may rapidly vary under the positive selection pressure. It is necessary to strengthen the surveillance of novel H7N9 AIVs both in human and bird populations to determine whether a new virus has emerged through selection and to prevent future epidemics.</p>
