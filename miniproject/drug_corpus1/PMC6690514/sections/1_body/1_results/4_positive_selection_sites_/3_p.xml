<p>Analysis of single amino acid sites one-by-one revealed that two sites of HA1 subunits belonging to the H7 subtype AIVs before 2013 were affected by positive selection pressure, namely, 284(275) and 334(325). None of these sites formed a 
 <italic>de facto</italic> substitution. Similarly, among the 12 positive selection sites of NA belonging to the N9 subtype AIVs before 2013, only variations at site 50 and 287(282) may be caused by positive selection pressure. It is particularly worth noting that since the emergence of the H7N9 epidemic in China in 2013, many positive selection sites within H7 have appeared in both the overall epidemics and the human-derived H7N9 AIVs. Most of these even located within the HA1 subunit. For the overall epidemics and human-derived AIVs, there were both eight positive selection sites, some of them were located within known antigen epitopes or the RBS domain (
