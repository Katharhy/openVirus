<p>For site 143, a substitution from alanine (A) to valine (V) leads to a greater change in the tertiary structure of the RBS domain. However, this conformational change is apparently not caused by a single amino acid residue, A143V, but seems to involve a series of amino acid residue substitutions. These result in a smaller and shallower pocket in the RBS domain (

On the contrary, it will be easier for the viruses to dissociate from the receptors. For viruses that have infected host cells and successfully replicated in large quantities, this conformation will be beneficial for the release of viruses from surfaces of host cells, and thus for the rapid proliferation of viruses. This may partly explain why novel H7N9 AIV has higher virulence to human and bird hosts than previous H7 subtypes AIVs.
