<p>Homology modeling for the tertiary structure demonstrated that sites 136 and 143 are both located on the surface of the HA1 subunit. Site 136 is located within the head of the HA1 subunit and adjacent to the 120-loop of RBS domain, whereas site 143 is situated within the left arm (or left side) of the RBS.</p>
