<p>A substitution from serine (S) of avian-derived H7 [which is represented by A/chicken/Wuxi/0405005G/2013(H7N9) with 100% identity to the avian-derived majority] to asparagine (N) of human-derived one [which is represented by A/Quzhou/1/2015(H7N9) with 99% identity to human-derived majority] at site 136 results in a more prominent bump in the 120-loop of RBS domain. Moreover, the larger side chain of N also provides a wider contact area for the binding of RBS to receptors located in host epithelial cells. This change in spatial structure can be achieved by modifying only a single site, i.e., S136N, of the transitional HA1 (
