<p>For H7 and N9 before the H7N9 epidemics, 2,159 HA sequences were obtained from the two databases, of which 84 were derived from human and other mammals. A total of 758 NA sequences were obtained and except for one whale-derived isolate, all sequences were derived from birds. Because only a small number of sequences were derived from human and other mammals, H7 and N9 before the H7N9 epidemics were not further differentiated based on host.</p>
