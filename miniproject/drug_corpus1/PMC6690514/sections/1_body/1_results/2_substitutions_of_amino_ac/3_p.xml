<p>Compared to both HAs from before 2013 and from the avian-derived novel H7N9 AIVs, human-derived novel H7N9 significantly differed from them at site 136 (corresponding to site 118 of mature HA1 of H7 or site 128 of mature HA1 of H3), 143 (corresponding to site 125 of mature HA1 of H7 or site 135 of mature HA1 of H3), 396, and 499 (

However, the substitution Q235(226)L did not show any host specificity, and the compositions of L occupied 92.27% of human-derived and 90.33% of avian-derived isolates (
