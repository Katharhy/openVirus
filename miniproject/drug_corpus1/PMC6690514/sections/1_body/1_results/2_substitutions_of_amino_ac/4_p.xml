<p>Compared to N9 before 2013, a total of 24 substitutions were identified in novel H7N9 AIVs. The composition ratios of amino acid polymorphisms displayed six substitutions, T19A, N40G, E84(79, referred to A/Shanghai/02/2013(H7N9), Accession: NC_026429) that characterized by a deletion located from 69â€“74 amino acid sites)N, D112(107)S, G359(354)A, and T401(396)A, which were rare before 2013. Similarly, S247(242)P and N327(322)S showed significant differences (
