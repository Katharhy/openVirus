<p>Compared to H7 before 2013, there were 18 characteristic substitutions in the majority of novel H7N9 AIV HA. Note that instead of deleting the signal peptide, parentheses were used to label the numbers according to the mature HA1 subunit of H3 (referred to A/Aichi/2/68(H3N2), Accession: EF614251). The substitutions were V11I, T130(122)A, D183(174)S, I188(179)V, G195(186)V, T198(189)A, I211(202)V, Q235(226)L, L245(236)M, D279(270)G, N307(298)D, E321(312)R, T410N, M427I, N455D, R462K, L506M, and A541V. Eleven of these are located in the HA1 subunit; some of these were even located in the receptor binding sites (RBS) or the known antigen epitopes A to E (
