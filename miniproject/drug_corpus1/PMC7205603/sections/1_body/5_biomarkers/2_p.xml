All patients had lymphocytopenia; the percentage of CD8 cells and the NK cells showed higher reduction in severe groups when compared to mild patients. However, the expression of HLA-DR (a marker of lymphocyte activation), in CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> cells, as well as in Th17 cells, was also shown to be increased, and the cytotoxic particles such as perforin and granulysin were highly expressed in CD8
