 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] proposed a 3-stage classification model recognizing that increasing severity corresponds with distinct clinical findings, imaging, and biochemistry characteristics and clinical outcome. The initial stage occurs at the time of inoculation and early establishment of disease. This involves an incubation period associated with fever and mild respiratory symptoms. Diagnosis at this stage includes PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Blood count may reveal a lymphopenia and neutrophilia without other significant abnormalities. In the second stage, viral multiplication and localized inflammation in the lung are the norm. During this stage, patients develop a viral pneumonia and possibly hypoxia. Imaging reveals bilateral infiltrates or ground glass opacities. The third and most sever stage of illness manifested as an extra-pulmonary systemic hyperinflammation syndrome, characterized by extremely elevated levels of the abovementioned biomarkers of systemic inflammation [
