<p id="Par38">Cytokine storm (CS) refers to an excessive and uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In infectious diseases, CS usually originates from the focal infected area, spreading through circulation. Huang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] measured cytokine levels in 41 inpatients (including 13 ICU patients and 28 non ICU patients). IL-1B, IL-1RA, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IFNγ, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), interferon-γ-inducible protein (IP10), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP1A), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), tumor necrosis factor (TNFα), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were increased. Several chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10) were also find to be higher in severe patients [
