<p id="Par77">Another interesting strategy is the one proposed by Aaron M et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>•]. They argue that as the impact of the COVID-19 differed among countries, these differences not only could be attributed to differences in cultural norms, mitigation efforts, and health infrastructure. They propose that national differences in COVID-19 impact could be partially explained by the different national policies respect to Bacillus Calmette–Guerin (BCG) childhood vaccination. BCG vaccination has been reported to offer broad protection to respiratory infections. Countries without universal policies of BCG vaccination (Italy, the Netherlands, the USA) have been more severely affected than countries with universal and long-standing BCG policies. Countries that have a late start of universal BCG policy (Iran, 1984) had high mortality, consistent with the idea that BCG protects the vaccinated elderly population. BCG vaccination also reduced the number of reported COVID-19 cases in a country. The combination of reduced morbidity and mortality suggests that BCG vaccination might be a potential new tool in the fight against COVID-19.
