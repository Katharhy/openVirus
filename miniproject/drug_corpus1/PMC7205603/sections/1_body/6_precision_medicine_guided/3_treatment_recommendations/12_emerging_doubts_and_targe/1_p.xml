<p id="Par78">As we mentioned above, one of the main pathophysiologic mechanisms of the severe form of COVID-19 is the cytokine storm due mainly to macrophages activation. Other proposed mechanism is the pathological activation of thrombin, with multiple thrombotic episodes ranging from peripheral ischemia, pulmonary thromboembolism to disseminated intravascular coagulation. The first mechanism resembles the macrophage activation syndrome and, the second, the antiphospholipid syndrome.</p>
