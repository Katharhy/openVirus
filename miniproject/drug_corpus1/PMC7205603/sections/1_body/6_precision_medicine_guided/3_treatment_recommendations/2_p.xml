<p id="Par49">Due to the urgent need for drugs that serve to treat the infection and its various complications, in the last few months, numerous medications have been proposed based on their different pharmacological activities and previous experiences with other pathogens. Also because of this urgency, many clinical trials have been rapidly approved. Up to the 11th of April, we identified more than 400 clinical trials when searching in 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrial.gob" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.clinicaltrial.gob</ext-link> using the search terms COVID (242 studies), SARS-CoV-2 (135 studies), 2019-nCoV (38 studies), 2019 novel coronavirus (17 studies), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (8 studies). Two hundred eighty of them are interventional studies classified into 33 categories of drugs interventions (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Most of them fall into one of two categories: (1) Treating respiratory symptoms, especially the inflammation that occurs in severe cases, and (2) antiviral growth, essentially stopping viruses from multiplying inside the human body. There are other outcomes such as to reduce organ failure and to treat pneumonia and/or sepsis, among others (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
