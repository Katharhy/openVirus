<p id="Par33">Zhang W et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] proposed two possible reasons for the destruction of the immune system in patients with COVID-19: lymphocytes directly invaded by virus or indirectly damaged by the cytokine storm (CS). As it is known that SARS-CoV-2 infects target cells through ACE2, while there was no ACE2 expression on lymphocytes, it is speculated that lymphocytes were probably destroyed by CS [
