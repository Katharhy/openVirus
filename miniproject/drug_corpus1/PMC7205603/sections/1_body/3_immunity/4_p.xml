<p id="Par31">Autopsy findings usually reveal spleen atrophy, significant cell degeneration, focal hemorrhagic necrosis, macrophage proliferation, and macrophage phagocytosis. The number of lymph nodes is concomitantly reduced, showing atrophy and necrosis. Immunohistochemical staining showed that CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells were decreased in the spleen and lymph nodes [

The major infiltrated cells in the lung are monocytes and macrophages, whereas the number of lymphocytes is very few, with the lung showing a characteristic bilateral diffuse alveolar injury with cellular fibromyxoid exudates. Most of the infiltrating lymphocytes are CD4-positive T cells. Furthermore, virus inclusion bodies can still be detected in type II alveolar epithelia and macrophages, despite a PCR-negative test [
