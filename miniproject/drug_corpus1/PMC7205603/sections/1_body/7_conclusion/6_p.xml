<p id="Par90">Following the four “Ps” that characterize PM approach to disease management, in the 
 <italic>first step</italic>, containment strategy is to prevent viral circulation in the population. Once it has occurred, in the 
 <italic>second step</italic>, mitigation strategies must be capable to predict suspicious cases, confirm diagnosis, and isolate patients and their contacts in order to reduce the spread of the disease, as well as prepare and guarantee health care provision. Clinical symptoms, a history of potential exposure to SARS-Cov-2, and relevant comorbidities have to be inquired by centralized communication facilities in order to perform pre-diagnosis triage. The 
 <italic>third step</italic> initiates with the final confirmation through a positive RT-PCR SARS-Cov-2 assay performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates. In mild cases, patients will only receive at home palliative treatment.
