The viruses known as human coronavirus (hCoV)-229E, hCoV-HKU1, hCoV-NL63, and hCoV-OC43 are of little concern at a global public health level. Two other coronaviruses have caused significant epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), one in China during 2002&#x02013;2003 (SARS-CoV) and the other one confined to regions of the Middle East (MERS-CoV), emerging in 2012 and showing limited human-to-human transmission but a high case fatality ratio (CFR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. At the end of 2019, a new coronavirus causing a severe acute respiratory symptom (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China rapidly spreading around the world resulting in a new coronavirus disease termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

A short-time late human&#x02013;human transmission was suspected, and finally, the sequence of a new coronavirus as responsible for COVID-19 was reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">The novel virus belongs to the <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family having a large (&#x0223c;&#x02009;30-kb) single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome2. As summarized by de Wit et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], first two-thirds of the genome code for two large polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab from ORF1a and ORF1b) which are proteolytically cleaved into the nonstructural proteins (nsp1 to nsp16) which are essential for the production of new viral genetic material. The remainder of the genome codes for structural proteins and carries the accessory genes that produce virions and alter the host response. Early studies on SARS-CoV-2 have shown further similarities with its namesake virus in that the spike protein utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its cell surface receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. ACE2 is found on ciliated epithelial cells of the human lungs, and this receptor utilization influences the tropism of these viruses.</p><p id="Par16">The reproductive number (<italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>) of the virus is currently thought to be around 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], suggesting the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission that appears to be through respiratory droplets and, potentially, a fecal&#x02013;oral route [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 appear to use the same cell receptor of ACE2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], suggesting a similar tropism. However, the novel coronavirus seems to spread much more efficiently based on the number of cases and the speed at which they have emerged. Proteolytic cleavage sites, such as a furin site in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, might influence this.

Both T cells and NK cells in patients with COVID-19 are reduced, and such reduction correlates with disease severity, as is the case of memory helper T cells and regulatory T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02022;, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">Autopsy findings usually reveal spleen atrophy, significant cell degeneration, focal hemorrhagic necrosis, macrophage proliferation, and macrophage phagocytosis.

Immunohistochemical staining showed that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were decreased in the spleen and lymph nodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02022;]. The major infiltrated cells in the lung are monocytes and macrophages, whereas the number of lymphocytes is very few, with the lung showing a characteristic bilateral diffuse alveolar injury with cellular fibromyxoid exudates. Most of the infiltrating lymphocytes are CD4-positive T cells. Furthermore, virus inclusion bodies can still be detected in type II alveolar epithelia and macrophages, despite a PCR-negative test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02022;, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">Those findings do not seem to be related to a hyper cytokine secretion induced by activated T cells in a late stage of viral infection.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] proposed two possible reasons for the destruction of the immune system in patients with COVID-19: lymphocytes directly invaded by virus or indirectly damaged by the cytokine storm (CS). As it is known that SARS-CoV-2 infects target cells through ACE2, while there was no ACE2 expression on lymphocytes, it is speculated that lymphocytes were probably destroyed by CS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Pathology</title><p id="Par34">Peripheral flow cytometry commonly shows decreased CD4 and CD8 cell counts, but an increase in Th17 cell proportion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02022;]. Th17 cells are helper T cells differentiated from Th0 cells mainly stimulated by IL-6 and IL-23 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, IL-10, IL-2, and IFN&#x003b3; increased in severe cases.</p><p id="Par35">As summarized by Zhang C et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], the pathological mechanism of the pulmonary disease starts when SARS-CoV-2 infects alveolar epithelial cells (mainly alveolar epithelial type 2 cells [AEC2]) through the ACE2 receptor. The destruction of epithelial cells and the increase of cell permeability lead to the release of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 activates the innate immune system; macrophages and other innate immune cells not only capture the virus but also release a large number of cytokines and chemokines. Adaptive immunity is also activated by antigen-presenting cells (mainly dendritic cells). T and B cells not only play an antiviral role but also directly or indirectly promote the secretion of inflammatory cytokines. In addition, under the stimulation of inflammatory factors, a large number of inflammatory exudates and erythrocytes enter the alveoli, resulting in dyspnea and respiratory failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">Endothelium damage is another prominent pathological manifestation in severe COVID-19 patients.

The underlying mechanism of vascular damage may be due to the direct injury of endothelial cells either by virus, leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or by an antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) as antiphospholipid, anticardiolipin, and anti-&#x003b2;2 glycoprotein antibodies have been observed and associated with severe thrombosis in some patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Biomarkers</title><p id="Par38">Cytokine storm (CS) refers to an excessive and uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

However, the expression of HLA-DR (a marker of lymphocyte activation), in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells, as well as in Th17 cells, was also shown to be increased, and the cytotoxic particles such as perforin and granulysin were highly expressed in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02022;].</p><p id="Par40">Considering all the abovementioned features of the COVID-19 illness, Siddiqu and Mehra [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] proposed a 3-stage classification model recognizing that increasing severity corresponds with distinct clinical findings, imaging, and biochemistry characteristics and clinical outcome. The initial stage occurs at the time of inoculation and early establishment of disease. This involves an incubation period associated with fever and mild respiratory symptoms. Diagnosis at this stage includes PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Blood count may reveal a lymphopenia and neutrophilia without other significant abnormalities. In the second stage, viral multiplication and localized inflammation in the lung are the norm. During this stage, patients develop a viral pneumonia and possibly hypoxia. Imaging reveals bilateral infiltrates or ground glass opacities.

BCG vaccination has been reported to offer broad protection to respiratory infections. Countries without universal policies of BCG vaccination (Italy, the Netherlands, the USA) have been more severely affected than countries with universal and long-standing BCG policies. Countries that have a late start of universal BCG policy (Iran, 1984) had high mortality, consistent with the idea that BCG protects the vaccinated elderly population. BCG vaccination also reduced the number of reported COVID-19 cases in a country.

It has been speculated that hydroxychloroquine and favipiravir work through inhibiting the attachment of the virus coat protein to the porphyrin ring molecule.</p><p id="Par83">Also, ventilations and ARDS protocols might lead to ventilator-induced lung injury rather than treating the condition. In the same way, infiltrates on the X-ray and CT scan might be caused by oxidative stress of the accumulation of the heme extracted by the virus in the alveoli causing chemical pneumonitis, not viral pneumonia. Alterations on hemoglobin metabolism are induced by SARS-CoV-2, and its dependence on porphyrin might explain why COVID-19 is more severe in men, diabetics, and older patients. The virus induces a condition similar to high altitude, methemoglobinemia, and carbon monoxide poisoning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. This theory could explain why mechanical ventilation is not so much effective in the treatment of ARDS. Actually, it could be futile and causing more lung damage, but much more evidence will be needed to sustain any change in therapeutic attitude.</p><p id="Par84">Finally, from a prophylactic point of view, the use of bacterial lysates and other immune modulators has been proposed because of their well-known ability to restore the immune response in certain clinical conditions.
