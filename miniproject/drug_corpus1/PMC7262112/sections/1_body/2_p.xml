 </xref> Indeed, at the time of writing this letter, in Italy there are 8514 patients affected by COVID‐19, 529 more than yesterday (+6.6%). The total number of COVID‐19 cases in our country (including deceased subjects and the recovered ones) exceeded 10,000, with a total of 631 deaths – 168 more than yesterday (an increase of 36.2%). The primary intervention to control infection is to prevent the spread of SARS‐CoV. For this reason, nowadays, the Italian government has imposed unprecedented travel restrictions on its 60 million people to limit the human‐to‐human transmission and to control the deadly coronavirus outbreak in the country identifying the whole national territory as a “protected zone.” More specifically, severe limitations of non‐necessary movements have been applied and permission would be necessary for Italians who sought to move around the country for reasons of work, health or extenuating circumstances (the so‐called lock‐down). In this scenario, where the risk of COVID‐19 infection is very high and the citizens must justify their movements with severe penalties and sanctions if non‐compliant with government provisions, there are about 6 millions of people affected by migraine, a clinical condition characterized by a well‐known high personal disability and a large detrimental effect on public health. The novel monoclonal antibodies (mABs) targeting the CGRP‐receptor or CGRP‐ligand have been demonstrated as effective and tolerable in several trials, giving these patients a new hope.

 </xref> Furthermore, widespread clinical experiences in using mABs support these data, with significant improvement of migraine disability and migraine impact on daily life of our migraine patients.
