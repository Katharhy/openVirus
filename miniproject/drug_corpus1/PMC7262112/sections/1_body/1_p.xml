<p>The development of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) disease (COVID‐19) in China at the end of 2019 has caused a large global outbreak and on 30 January 2020 WHO declared COVID‐19 as the sixth public health emergency of international concern. Indeed, COVID‐19 seems to be very contagious and has quickly spread globally, via human‐to‐human transmission, droplets, or direct contact. Moreover, data from reports provided by health policy agencies divide the clinical manifestations of the disease according to the severity of the clinical pictures in mild, moderate, or severe illness. Fever is the most common symptom, followed by cough, and the clinical course of the disease seems to predict a favorable trend in the majority of patients. Nevertheless, in a percentage of cases, which has not been defined yet, a sudden worsening of clinical conditions can be observed after about a week. In the most severe pictures pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have been reported to worsen until to sepsis and septic shock, a serious clinical condition characterized by a wide range of signs and symptoms related to multi‐organ involvement.
