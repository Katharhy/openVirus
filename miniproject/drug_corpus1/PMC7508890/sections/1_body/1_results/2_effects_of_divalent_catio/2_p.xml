<p id="Par8">Comparison of the amino acid sequences of HA from different subtypes of influenza viruses revealed the conservation of the Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> binding residues, Glu68 and His137, in H1 strains, but not in other subtypes (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In some strains, including the 1918pdm and the 1933â€“1936 seasonal strains, the corresponding amino acid residues of HA were substituted with Asp or Tyr, respectively. Nevertheless, the unique binding of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> to HA in a broad range of H1 subtype influenza A viruses reveal a subtype-specific interaction of HA with Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>.
