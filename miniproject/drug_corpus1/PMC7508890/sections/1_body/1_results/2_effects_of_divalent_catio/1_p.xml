<p id="Par7">In parallel, we carried out gel shift experiments involving native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the CU44 HA in the presence of various divalent cations. The Cu
 <sup>2+</sup> and Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> cations promoted robust multimerization of HA (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A, upper panel). To assess whether the presence of the divalent cations can impact the stability of HA, DSF was used to measure the changes in T
 <sub>m</sub>. Many divalent cation had no effect on the T
 <sub>m</sub> values of the HA, whereas the T
 <sub>m</sub> values in the presence of Ni
 <sup>2+</sup>, Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> and Cu
 <sup>2+</sup> were significantly reduced by 8 °C and 18 °C and could not be obtained, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A, lower panel). When HA was treated with 0.1–1 mM Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>, a significant shift in the size exclusion chromatography (SEC) profile was observed. As the concentration of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> increased, multimeric forms of the HA were eluted at the void volume (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B, upper panel). The HA protein sample was filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane prior to chromatography and the peak at the void volume in the SEC profile became lower as the Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>concentration increased, suggesting that larger aggregates of HA formed at high concentrations of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>. In contrast, the HA protein also induced multimerization at acidic pH, but not to the extent of formation of the larger aggregates induced by Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B, lower panel). Additionally, the multimerization of the HA by Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> was not abolished by the treatment of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) at concentrations of 1–10 mM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). The conformational changes and multimeric associations of HA induced by Zn
 <sup>+2</sup> or acidic pH have been examined using SEC-MALS and binding of antibodies (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C, D). The molecular weights of HA multimers induced by Zn
 <sup>+2</sup> or acidic pH were 1785 or 2039 kDa, respectively, corresponding to the associations of approximately 9 HA trimers, and the HA multimers induced by Zn
 <sup>+2</sup> showed a relatively polydisperse population. In addition, the conformations induced by Zn
 <sup>+2</sup> or acidic pH were not recognized by CR9114, but by the D2 interface antibody that binds to the head domain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup>. The results indicate that the stem conformations of HA induced by Zn
 <sup>+2</sup> or acidic pH are not recognized by CR9114 and do not represent the native prefusion conformations. Our results thus suggest that the treatment with Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> induces the conformations of HA, similar to those induced by acidic pH.
