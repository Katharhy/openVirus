<p id="Par5">We originally aimed to improve the stability of HA in solution and crystals to allow high resolution analyses of how pH-induced conformational changes affect its biological functions. A total of nine mutants of the CU44 HA wild-type were constructed: L69S, I71S, L156S, I184S, F260A, and A276T of HA1 in the head region, and L73S, M77I, and V91I of HA2 in the stem region (based on H3 numbering). The mutations largely accounted for reduced exposure of hydrophobic amino acid residues on the surface and increased hydrophobic residues at the monomerâ€“monomer interface within the trimer. They were expressed in insect cell culture, purified, and characterized by differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF). No improvement in protein stability was seen in terms of melting temperature (T
 <sub>m</sub>).
