<p id="Par6">We attempted to determine the crystal structure of the CU44 HA wild type as a control, by molecular replacement using PDB 4EDB as a template. The structure in space group C2 (a = 215.7 Å, b = 124.3 Å, c = 214.5 Å, b = 102.9°) was refined at 3.2 Å resolution with an R/R
 <sub>free</sub> of 26.3/29.5 and exhibited good overall geometry (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The HA trimers adopt an alternating up-and-down arrangement with head-to-head interactions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Surprisingly, anomalous difference Fourier maps calculated with phases from a model showed a pronounced peak at the head-to-head interface between two neighboring HA trimers, clearly visible at the 7 σ level (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Fluorescence scans around the anomalous edges using the HA crystals strongly suggested that Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> ion could contribute to the strong anomalous signal at the absorption edge near at 1.284 Å (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Despite the lack of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> in the crystallization medium, Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> ion was tentatively refined with full occupancy and B-factor of 41–47 Å
 <sup>2</sup> (three Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> ions in the asymmetric unit). The divalent ion binds to the side chains of Glu68 and His137 from two adjacent trimers (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). In the final 2|F
 <sub>o</sub>| − |F
 <sub>c</sub>| and |F
 <sub>o</sub>| − |F
 <sub>c</sub>| difference Fourier maps, the divalent cation adopts an octahedral molecular geometry, mediated by the coordination with Glu68 and His137. They likely act as bi- and monodentate ligands, respectively, to the Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> ion with the coordination bond lengths of 1.9–2.3 Å.
