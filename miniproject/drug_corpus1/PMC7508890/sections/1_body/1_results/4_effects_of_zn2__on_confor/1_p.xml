<p id="Par10">To study the effect of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> on the pH-dependent stability of the CU44 HA, the HA protein was incubated with Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> ion for 10 min followed by rapid neutralization at different pH conditions. Stepwise multimerization of HA proteins was observed as the pH decreased, reaching complete multimerization at below pH 5.4, whereas it occurred readily in the presence of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> even at neutral pH conditions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). More pronounced multimerization was evident at higher concentrations of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>. In addition, the increased concentration of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> reduced the T
 <sub>m</sub> values of the HA even at neutral pH in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C). The T
 <sub>m</sub> values decreased from 58 to 54 °C. Thus, the conformational changes of the HA induced by Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> were similar to that occurring upon acidic incubation without neutralization, which occurred more readily as the concentration of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> increased.
