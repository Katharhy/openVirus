 </sup>. In order to examine the pH-dependent stability of the CU44 HA, DSF experiments were carried out by incubating the HA at different pH conditions followed by rapid neutralization. Two distinct T
 <sub>m</sub> values were obtained for the CU44 HA, 58 °C at pH 5.9–7.0 and 56 °C at pH 5.0–5.7 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A, upper panel). In comparison, the conformational changes started to occur at pH 6.0 upon a 10-min incubation without neutralization, with the changes occurring at pH &lt; 6.0 being irreversible (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A, middle panel). The T
 <sub>m</sub> values continuously decreased from 52 °C at pH 5.9–5.6 to ~ 40 °C at pH 5.0. Upon a 24-h incubation, two distinct conformations were apparent, with T
 <sub>m</sub> values at 58 °C at pH 7.0 and 48 °C at pH below 6.0 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A, lower panel). We postulate that these two distinct conformations correspond to pre- and postfusion states of the CU44 HA and its transition from a reversible to irreversible conformations occurs at pH 5.6–5.8.
