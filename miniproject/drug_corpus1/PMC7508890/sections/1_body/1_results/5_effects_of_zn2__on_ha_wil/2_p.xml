<p id="Par13">In order to examine the effects of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> on biophysical properties of HA, single and double mutations at the Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> binding site were introduced: the H137A single mutant displayed the essentially identical T
 <sub>m</sub> of the wild-type in the absence of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> and the same changes in T
 <sub>m</sub> in the presence of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). The incubation of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> with the mutants induced pH-dependent conformational changes similar to those of the wild-type, where high concentrations of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> equally promoted multimerization of the mutants, similar to those produced by the wild-type (Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>, lower panels for the E68A/H137A and H137A mutants, respectively). Therefore, the HA, already transformed into the postfusion conformation at high concentrations of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>, is not blocked by the mutation or EDTA treatment. When the purified HA crystallized at 10–20 mg/ml by mixing with an equal volume of precipitant solution, protein crystals were produced at less than 0.4 mM Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>, whereas precipitates were found at higher than 0.4 mM. No crystals or precipitates were found at 0 mM Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> (data not shown). Taken together, our results suggest that Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> binding to HA has two phases: Zn
 <sup>+2</sup> binds specifically to the head regions of HA at low concentrations, whereas, at high concentrations, it binds nonspecifically to HA, causing conformational changes similar to those induced by acidic pH.
