<p id="Par12">Although the thermal stability of HA was significantly reduced by Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> and the crystal structure was determined at 3.2 Å resolution, the N-linked glycan structure was exceptionally well-defined in the 2|F
 <sub>o</sub>| − |F
 <sub>c</sub>| electron density maps, which is unusual in HA structures. It showed a branched sugar chain of up to six monosaccharide units attached to Asn residues of the head region (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). The glycans attached to Asn54 and Asn87 are much closer to the Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> binding site than other glycans in the head region, suggesting fairly stable conformations. In addition, the multimerization of glycosylated or deglycosylated HA induced by Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> was not prevented by the treatment of EDTA (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>, upper and middle panels).
