<p id="Par27">The purified HA was concentrated to 10 mg/ml in 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0) and 100 mM NaCl, and crystallized by mixing with an equal volume of precipitant solution using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at room temperature for 3–7 days. The precipitant solution contained 0.1 M Tris–HCl, pH 7.25, 20% PEG 2000 and 2% dimethylsulfoxide used as additive. After a week, small crystals were obtained. Diffraction data were collected with the crystals flash-cooled at 100 K in a stream of liquid N
 <sub>2</sub> in the mother liquor containing 10% ethylene glycerol using synchrotron radiation sources at beamlines BL-17A at photon factory (Tsukuba, Japan) and 11C at Pohang Light Source-II (PLS-II), Korea. The crystals of HA-Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> complex were diffracted to 3.4 Å resolution, which belong to space group C2 with unit cell dimensions of a = 215.7 Å, b = 124.2 Å, c = 214.5 Å, a = 90°, b = 102.9°, and c = 90° (Table
