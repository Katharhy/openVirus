<p id="Par26">For proteolytic cleavage analysis, the CU44 HA was mixed with Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> in 0–1 mM in 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0) and 100 mM NaCl overnight, which was then incubated in 100 mM MES-HEPES at pH 7.4, pH 6.0, pH 5.9, pH 5.8, or pH 5.4 at room temperature for 1 h. It was recovered to neutral pH by mixing with 2 M Tris–HCL (pH 8.5) and mixed with 10 µg of TPCK-Trypsin (THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC, Waltham, MA, USA) at 37 °C for 10 min. Each reaction was stopped by adding 5 × sample buffer and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Aliquots were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.
