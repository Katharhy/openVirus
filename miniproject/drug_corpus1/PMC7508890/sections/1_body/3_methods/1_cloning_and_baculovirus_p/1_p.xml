 </sup>. The synthesized cDNA of the CU44 wild-type HA after RNA extraction was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The wild-type HA gene (1-503 of HA0 based on H3 numbering) was cloned into pFastBac HT A (INVITROGEN, Carlsbad, CA, USA) downstream of the gp67 secretion signal sequence of the transfer vector pAcGP67A (BD BIOSCIENCES, Woburn, MA, USA). The cloned construct had residues 18–344 (1-326) (HA1) and 345–520 (1-176) (HA2), with a thrombin cleavage site, foldon domain, and 6 × His-tag downstream of the HA gene sequence. The recombinant HA protein contained additional plasmid-encoded residues ADPG and RSLVPR at the N- and C-terminus, respectively. Mutant HA genes were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis using a pair of complementary oligonucleotides containing the H137A mutation in the gene (MACROGEN, Seoul, Korea). Briefly, ten cycles of PCR was performed with mutant oligonucleotides to amplify the mutant HA gene, which was treated with Dpn1 (NEB, MA, USA) to remove wild type HA genes for 1 h at 37 °C. Plasmids encoding the mutant HA gene (H137A) was transformed and amplified in 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain DH5α and the recombinant bacmid was generated according to the Bac-to-Bac expression system protocol (INVITROGEN). The sequences were confirmed by automated sequencing (MACROGEN, Seoul, Korea). The CU44 HA in this study showed three mutations different from the original CU44 HA: HA1 M116I and HA2 I91V and N169S, which was used as a wild-type. These mutations also exist in nature. 
 <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> insect cells were transfected with the recombinant bacmid using Cellfectin II (INVITROGEN), which were harvested at 72 h post-transfection and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 15 min to obtain baculovirus, expressing recombinant HA in the supernatant. The transfection efficiency was confirmed by PCR after extraction of DNA from 400 μl of virus.
