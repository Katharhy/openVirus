<p id="Par25">DSF was used to measure the shift in transition temperature of HA at different pH conditions, using Stratagene MX3005P (AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The reaction mixture (25 µl) containing 5 µg of the HA wild-type or mutant, 5X SYPRO Orange (INVITROGEN), 100 mM HEPES or MES and 100 mM NaCl was incubated at different pHs at 25 °C for 1 h. Temperature increment at the rate of 0.5 °C every 30 s for 50 min and relative fluorescence units were recorded at the excitation and emission wavelengths of 492 nm and 610 nm, respectively. The transition temperature was calculated from the maxima of the first derivative of relative fluorescence units/temperature using MxPro QPCR Software.</p>
