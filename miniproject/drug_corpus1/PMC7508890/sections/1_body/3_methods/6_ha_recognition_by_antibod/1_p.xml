<p id="Par24">CU44 HA was incubated with 1 mM Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> or 100 mM MES (pH 5.5) for ELISA at 4 °C overnight. The 8-well strip was coated with the native, Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>, or acidic-pH incubated CU44 HA in a total volume of 100 µl (2 ng/µl) in microplates (Corning). Following blocking with 1% BSA and PBS washing, primary antibodies (the stem-specific CR9114 or head-specific D2 H1-1/H3-1) were applied at 400, 80, 1, 3, 0.64, 0.128, and 0.026 ng per well at 37 °C for 1 h. They were then washed with PBS, and detected by anti-human IgG1-HRP (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) as the secondary antibody for 1 h. 150 µl of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as substrate and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 N sulfuric acid, and the absorbance at 450 nm was monitored.
