<p id="Par21">The purified proteins were prepared under native condition (mixed with 5 × loading buffer, 312.5 mM Tris–HCl (pH 6.8), 50% glycerol, and 0.05% bromophenol blue, without β-mercaptoethanol and sodium dodecyl sulfate). The HA wild-type or mutant (2–5 µg) was incubated in 100 mM HEPES or MES and 100 mM NaCl at different pH and 25 °C for 1 h. Electrophoresis was carried out in 25 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.8) and 192 mM glycine at 200 V and 80 mA for 1 h.</p>
