 <sup>2+</sup> ions in 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0) and 100 mM NaCl overnight. For HA-Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> complexes, the CU44 HA was mixed with Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> in 0–1 mM in 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0) and 100 mM NaCl overnight, which was then incubated in 100 mM MES-HEPES at pH 7.4, pH 6.0, pH 5.9, pH 5.8, or pH 5.4 at room temperature for 1 h. It was either recovered to neutral pH by mixing with 2 M Tris–HCL (pH 8.5) after 10 min, or incubated further for 24 h. The samples were submitted for native PAGE. In the case of the EDTA treatment, the HA-Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> complex was incubated in 1 mM or 10 mM EDTA for 1 h or overnight. The electrophoresis was carried out in 25 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.8) with 192 mM glycine at 200 V and 80 mA for 1 h. The gels were stained using Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (SIGMA-ALDRICH, St. Louis, MO, USA).
