 </sup>, was cloned into the PMAL-p2 plasmid and transformed into 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) (INVITROGEN, Carlsbad, USA). The cells after 0.4 mM IPTG induction were harvested by centrifugation, sonicated, and centrifuged at 12,000×

The supernatant containing the Endo H was purified by affinity and size exclusion chromatography using amylose (NEB, MA, USA) and Superdex 200 10/300 (GE HEALTHCARE, Uppsala, Sweden) columns, respectively. Using the purified Endo H, HA samples were treated at 0.5 μg/ml in phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) at 4 °C for 30 h and separated from the Endo H using a 10 kDa MW cutoff membrane (MERCK MILLIPORE, Billerica, MA, USA). Deglycosylation of HA by the Endo H was determined by gel-shift assays.
