 </sup>. After 3 days at 28 °C, the culture medium was harvested. After centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 30 min, the supernatant was applied to a nickel–nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni–NTA) affinity column (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, and 100 mM NaCl. The column was washed with buffer containing 30 mM imidazole, and the precursor HA protein was eluted in an imidazole gradient (30–400 mM). The eluted fractions were dialyzed against 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0) and 20 mM NaCl, and hydrolyzed by TPCK-treated trypsin for 4–5 h at 4 °C for cleavage of HA0 into HA1 and HA2 and removal of the foldon and 6 × His-tag. The active form of HA was purified using Superdex 200 10/300 GL size exclusion chromatography in 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0) and 100 mM NaCl, connected to an ÄKTA FPLC system (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). It was concentrated in an Amicon 10,000 MWCO concentrator (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) to 10 mg/ml for characterization and crystallization.
