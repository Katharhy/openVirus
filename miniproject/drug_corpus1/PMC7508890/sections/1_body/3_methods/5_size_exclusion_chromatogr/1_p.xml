<p id="Par23">The elution shift of the CU44 HA-Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> complex was examined by mixing the CU44 HA with 0–1 mM Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> in 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0) and 100 mM NaCl overnight. Each sample was applied to a Superdex 200 GL column (GE HEALTHCARE) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 100 mM NaCl at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, connected to a UFLC system (SHIMADZU, Kyoto, Japan). Light scattering and refractive index were measured using in-line WYATT-787-TS miniDAWN TREOS (WYATT Technology, Santa Barbara, CA, USA), and the data were analysed by Astra 6 software.
