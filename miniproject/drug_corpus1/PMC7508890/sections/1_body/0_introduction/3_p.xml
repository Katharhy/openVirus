 </sup>, mainly showing a structural role in zinc binding motifs. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of divalent cation-mediated antiviral activities is far from complete. In this study, solving the crystal structure of HA derived from A/Thailand/CU44/2006 (CU44) led to a surprising finding of a divalent cation Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> bound to the head regions of two neighboring trimers. The divalent cation in the crystal structure appeared to enhance the stability of HA, but significantly decreased the melting temperature T
 <sub>m</sub> of the CU44 HA, depending on the Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> concentrations. The acid-induced conformational change of HA occurred even at neutral pH in the presence of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>. Therefore, our results suggest that binding of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> may facilitate the conformational change of HA, analogous to that induced by acidic pH. Here, we report the structure of HA bound to Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> ions and the effects of the divalent cation on pH-dependent conformational changes of HA.
