<p id="Par2">Influenza viruses belonging to the family 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> comprise four antigenic types: A, B, C, and, D. Influenza A and B viruses co-circulate and cause seasonal epidemics, and influenza C virus causes severe disease in children

 </sup>. Based on the antigenicity of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), 18 HA and 11 NA subtypes of influenza A viruses have been identified in wild waterfowl, and subtypes H17N10 and H18N11 have been discovered in bats

 </sup>. The various subtypes are divided into two groups, group 1 (including H1, H2 and H5) and group 2 (including H3 and H7). Thus far, three HA (H1, H2, and H3) and two NA (N1 and N2) subtypes have adapted to humans to produce pandemic (pdm) and seasonal influenza A viruses

 </sup>. The dynamic nature of influenza viral infections, particularly due to the variation of HA, remains a big challenge in minimizing the mismatch between circulating seasonal strains and vaccines.
