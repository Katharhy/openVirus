<p id="Par3">Progression of viral particles from early to late endosomes results in large conformational changes of the active form of HA that is derived from the proteolytic cleavage of HA0 precursor into HA1 and HA2

 </sup>. The HA structure has two distinct regions. The head region is composed of the receptor binding and vestigial esterase domains of HA1, whereas the stem region includes a long central helix of HA2. The HA plays a critical role for acidic pH-induced membrane fusion in viral fitness

 </sup> and involves the dissociation of the head regions and the extension of central coiled-coil domains in the stem regions. In this context, the stability of HA is an important attribute of influenza viral fitness, which regulates and enhances viral growth and pathogenesis

 </sup>. We also demonstrated that the recombinant HA derived from A/Korea/01/2009, a 2009pdm isolate, is a monomer in solution and crystals, where HA molecules are arranged in a head-to-head manner
