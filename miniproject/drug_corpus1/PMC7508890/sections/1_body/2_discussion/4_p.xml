<p id="Par17">The amino acid residues, Glu68 and His137, coordinated to Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> are highly conserved in a broad range of H1 subtypes, although they are substituted with Asp or Tyr, respectively, in the early 1918 pandemic and the seasonal 1933–1936 strains, and not conserved in other subtypes and type B (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). It is likely that the Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> binding has evolved to play a structural role in the H1 subtype viruses for the past 80 years. Moreover, it was previously suggested that the acid stability of HA during membrane fusion regulates interspecies adaptation of the influenza viruses

 </sup>, in which the HA acid stability affects pathogenicity with pandemic capability. In this context, the arrangement of the HA trimers with head-to-head interactions in the HA-Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> complex is unique, and the Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>-induced conformational changes of HA equivalent to those upon acidification are very striking. Recent analyses revealed that acidification and receptor binding shifts the dynamic equilibrium of HA in favor of forward progression to membrane fusion, and either receptor binding or the presence of a target membrane promotes HA2 conversion to the postfusion state

 </sup>. Similarly, enhanced interactions of the head regions by the presence of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> at low concentrations can provide an efficient way of stabilization of HA, whereas high concentrations of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> induces significant conformational changes of HA, which may result in clustering of the HA molecules, analogous to receptor-promoted formation of the postfusion conformations.
