<p id="Par16">In the crystal structure, the HA trimers line up in an alternating up and down orientation with head-to-head interactions, where Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> is bound between two adjacent HA trimers. This divalent cation may be acquired from the PEG 2000 used in crystallization or the medium of insect cells. In aqueous solution, Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> can be coordinated with up to six water molecules, but it is usually tetrahedrally coordinated in zinc finger proteins and enzymes

 <sup>2+</sup> is applied to catalysis with high Lewis acidity, whereas it is rarely hexacoordinated in catalytic binding sites

 </sup>. In the HA structure, the carboxylic oxygen atoms of Glu68 and imidazole nitrogen atoms of His137 are directly coordinated to the divalent cation, which results in a distorted octahedral, six-coordination geometry, involving bidentate interactions of carboxylic groups. The Zn–O and Zn–N bond lengths are from 2.0 to 2.2 Å. The mean Zn–O and Zn–N distances from octahedral structures in the Cambridge Structural Database and aqueous solution are 2.10–2.11 Å
