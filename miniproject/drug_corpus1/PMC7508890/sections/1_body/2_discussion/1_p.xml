<p id="Par14">HA is a highly dynamic molecule capable of mediating a pH-dependent transition from a prefusion to postfusion state during virus entry. Induction of irreversible conformational changes upon acidification results in the formation of a stable postfusion state via a spring-loaded mechanism

 </sup>. The prefusion conformation of HA is metastable, and the receptor binding head region acts as a clamp to keep the stem region in its metastable prefusion state at neutral pH. Acidification shifts the dynamic equilibrium of HA that favors the progression of membrane fusion

 </sup>. We initially constructed nine mutants to improve the stability and quality of HA in solution and crystals, and the wild-type HA crystal structure derived from A/Thailand/CU44/2006 was determined as a control. Surprisingly, the highest peak in the anomalous difference electron density maps was located at the head domain at the inter-trimer interface, which was tentatively identified as Zn
