  <p>Differential scanning fluorimetry transition curves of HA proteins at different pH conditions. (
   <bold>A</bold>) The T
   <sub>m</sub> values of the CU44 HA were measured after it was incubated at different pH from 7.0 to 5.0 for 10 min followed by rapid neutralization (upper panel) and without neutralization (middle panel) at room temperature, and 24 h incubation without neutralization (lower panel). HA protein was incubated at 25 °C, and the temperature was increased by 0.5 °C every 30 s for 50 min. (
   <bold>B</bold>) pH-dependent aggregation using native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, (
   <bold>C</bold>) differential scanning fluorimetry, and (
   <bold>D</bold>) Proteolytic cleavage of the CU44 HA. HA aggregated at pH 5.4 in the absence of Zn
   <sup>2+</sup>, whereas it aggregated readily at pH 7.4 in the presence of Zn
   <sup>2+</sup>, which was also dependent on the concentrations of Zn
   <sup>2+</sup>. The T
   <sub>m</sub> values of the HA were measured at concentrations of 0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mM of Zn
   <sup>2+</sup> at different pH conditions (pH 7.4, 6.0, 5.9, 5.8, and 5.4) followed by rapid neutralization at room temperature. The T
   <sub>m</sub> values for the CU44 HA significantly decreased from 58 to 54 °C. For the proteolytic cleavage, after the HA was mixed with 10 µg of TPCK-trypsin at 37 °C for 10 min, it was stopped by adding 5X sample buffer and heating at 95 °C for 5 min, and analysed by SDS-PAGE.
