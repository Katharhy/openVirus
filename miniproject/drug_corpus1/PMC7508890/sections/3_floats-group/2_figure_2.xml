  <p>Characterization of HA proteins in the presence of divalent cations. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis results showing the band shifts in the presence of Zn
   <sup>2+</sup> and Cu
   <sup>2+</sup> (upper panel). The CU44 HA protein was isolated as a trimer, whereas the two cations induced multimerization or aggregation of the HA molecules. Differential scanning fluorimetry transition curves of HA proteins at different divalent cations (lower panel). HA protein was incubated at 25 °C, and then the temperature was increased by 0.5 °C every 30 s for 50 min. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The shift in elution volume of the CU44 HA in the presence of Zn
   <sup>2+</sup> (upper panel) and acidic pH conditions (lower panel) in SEC. The experiment was performed using a Superdex 200 GL column equilibrated with 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 100 mM NaCl, and the shifts were monitored as the concentration of Zn
   <sup>2+</sup> increased from 0.1 to 1.0 mM. (
   <bold>C</bold>) The SEC-MALS results of CU44 HA. The HA was incubated with 1 mM Zn
   <sup>2+</sup> or 100 mM MES (pH 5.5) at 24 °C for 30 min and analyzed using SEC on a Superdex 200 GL column equilibrated with PBS at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Antibody recognition of HA conformations, CR9114 (upper panel) and D2 H1-1/H3-1 (lower panel). CU44 HA was incubated with 1 mM Zn
   <sup>2+</sup> or 100 mM MES (pH 5.5) for ELISA at 4 °C overnight. The stem-specific CR9114 or head-specific D2 H1-1/H3-1 at concentrations of 400, 80, 1, 3, 0.64, 0.128, and 0.026 ng per well was used and detected by anti-human IgG1-HRP as the secondary antibody. Absorbance at 450 nm was monitored.
