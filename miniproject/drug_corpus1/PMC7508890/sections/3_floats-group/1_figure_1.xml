  <p>Overview of the structure of the CU44 HA. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Top and side views along the C axis of the crystal packing of HA. The HA trimers adopt an alternating up and down arrangement with head-to-head interactions, which are shown in different colors. Divalent cations are shown as red spheres. A magnified view of the HA trimers, which are shown in secondary structures in different colors (blue, pink, and lime green) for each monomer. (
