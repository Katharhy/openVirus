  <p>SARS-CoV-2 recurrent mutations occurrence over time, divided per geographic area. The graph reports evolution of nonsynonymous (top) and silent (bottom) mutation patterns from January 2020 to April 2020 in Italy, Spain, France, Germany, UK, Sweden and in the USA. The frequency of each mutation in each country and for each month was normalized to 100%, i.e. to the total number of genomes analyzed in that frameshift and collected in that specific country. Recurrent nonsynonymous mutation pattern is characterized by the occurrence of mutations at nt14408, nt 23403 and nt28881–28882–28883 (RdRp and spike protein, respectively), while the most found silent mutations are at nt241 and nt3037 (localized in the leader protein and in the nsp3)</p>
