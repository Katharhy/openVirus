   <bold>b</bold> Case fatality rate of 
   <bold>a</bold> normalized by the ρ factor, i.e. by the number of PCR tests performed per 1 M population over positive cases per 1 M population up to the 30th of April, 2020. Bars indicate the 95% of confidence interval. The normalization leads to the formation of three main groups: group 1 includes Germany, group 2 includes Italy, USA and Spain and group 3 includes UK, France and Sweden
