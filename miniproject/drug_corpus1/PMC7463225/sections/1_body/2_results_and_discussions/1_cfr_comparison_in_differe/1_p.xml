<p id="Par18">Mortality calculations during the epidemics are difficult, mostly due to calculation biases: during the initial period of the epidemic, many patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 only after developing critical illness or even at the time of death, whereas asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic patients were untested, leading to an underestimation of the denominator [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Additional significant biases affect mortality curves: to name a few, the parameters used for death counting, the rigidity of lockdown measures, population age. Over time Countries started adopting better policies for diagnostic PCR testing and lockdown strategies, and consequently the spread of the virus was better monitored and the data were more carefully determined. We chose to analyze the Country-specific data relative to the number of COVID-19 deaths in April 2020, when some of the initial biases were likely attenuated, using the method described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The number of deaths of a specific day was divided by the total number of infected cases reported 14 days before. This method considers the fact that 14 days are the average lag time estimated between the first symptoms to death [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The data analyzed for Italy, France, Germany, Spain, UK, Sweden and USA are reported in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a. For all Countries we observed a decrease in the CFR values over time, with the exception of Germany (that maintains a very low value overall) and Sweden (where no decrease is observed). We identified two critical elements that might affect CFR among these Countries: (a) the number of PCR tests made and (b) the total number of positive cases for each Country. Since the second parameter (b) depends on the first parameter (a), we introduced a corrective Country-specific factor ρ = a/b, that was later used to normalize the CFR previously calculated (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Data obtained through this normalization model are reported in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b. By taking only the data calculated on the 30
 <sup>th</sup> of April and representing them in a bubble plot (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), we clearly identify the presence of three clusters of Countries. Group 1 includes Germany and has a very low normalized CFR (0.31% CI (95%) [0.29 : 0.33] on April 30th 2020). Group 2 includes Italy, USA and Spain and has an intermediate value of normalized CFR (1.62% CI (95%) [1.51:1.72]; 1.65% CI (95%) [0.97:2.33]; 1.76% CI (95%) [1.36:2.15], respectively, on April 30th 2020). Group 3 includes France, Sweden and UK (3.49% CI (95%) [3.23:3.76]; 3.92% CI (95%) [3.83:4.02]; 3.90% CI (95%) [3.25:4.27], on April 30th 2020). The difference among cluster’s CFR (respectively 0.31% vs 1.68% vs 3.78%) was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001). Also, all pairwise comparisons were significant (p-adjusted with Holm method &lt; 0.001).
