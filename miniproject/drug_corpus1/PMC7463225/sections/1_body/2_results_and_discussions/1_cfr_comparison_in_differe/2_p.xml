<p id="Par19">This result could be furtherly refined by considering the variability of the lag time due to patients age, i.e. older people (&gt; 70 y.o.) have a lower lag time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] compared to others. However, even if the daily number of death patients divided per age is available for each Country, we could not provide in this study a further normalization of the CFR taking into account patients age, since a similar daily database of infected people divided per age is not publicly available. Anyway, since the infection mostly leads to death older people or those that have ongoing severe illnesses (i.e. cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer), we can speculate that the overall estimation of the CFR is driven by this class of patients. Therefore, the observed CFR curves observed among different Countries through the introduction of an innovative corrective factor ρ, might be explained mainly by the different policies that were enacted by each Country. To further support this hypothesis, we note that in Countries of group 3 where lockdown was not put in place (i.e. Sweden) or it was adopted late, and less SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were executed (i.e. in UK and France), normalized CFR is higher than in the other groups. Although further data are needed to refine the CFR estimation, we improved the CFR estimate by using a new corrective factor which considers two important variables (number of positives and number of PCR tests performed). In fact, several sources of variability affect CFR but for modifiable confounding factors, a standardization process could help to reduce the biases, improving the interpretability and comparability of CFR across Countries.
