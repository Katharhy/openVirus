<p id="Par23">We noted the emergence of other recurrent mutation sites over time, both nonsynonymous (nt25563, nt28863) and silent (nt2480, nt2558, nt9476, nt15324, nt20268 and nt28656). The nonsynonymous mutations occur in the ORF3a and ORF9 (nucleocapsid phosphoprotein), causing the amino acid mutation Q56H (glutamine to histidine) and S197L (serine to leucine). All these mutations are found in most Countries and they are not exclusively reported in a specific geographic area. An additional recurrent mutation has been detected exclusively in genomes from Swedish at nt24368 (G to T transition); this mutation, which is located in the spike protein sequence, appeared in March (carried by 20% of genomes analyzed) and its frequency more than doubled in April (52% of genomes analyzed). This mutation triggers an amino acid substitution at position 936, from an aspartic acid to a tyrosine, with a significant shift in terms of isoelectric point from 2.85 to 5.64. D936 residue in SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein corresponds to the E918 residue of the homologue protein of SARS-CoV, and it is located in the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) domain [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Heptat repeat 1 interacts with heptad repeat 2 (HR2) domain and form a six-helix bundle fusion core, able to bring viral and cellular membranes in close proximity, promoting fusion and infection of host cell [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This makes HR1 and HR2 good target candidates for drug design. Recently, D936 (site of the recurrent mutation) has been proved to bind to R1185 of the heptad repeat 2 (HR2) domain through a salt bridge. Additional studies are required to further characterize if G936 mutant, present in April in more than half of Swedish genomes analyzed, could provide some beneficial advantages in terms of viral fitness, as observed for mutation nt23403 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Among the Countries in the different groups there are no significant differences in the distribution of mutations, since the recurrent mutation pattern is comparable among different Countries (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, top panel). The only significant difference is the newly emerged mutation nt24368, that in our database was detected only in the genomes analyzed in Sweden.
