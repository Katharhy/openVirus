<p id="Par21">We studied the evolution of the mutation patterns in the selected Countries from January to April 2020, and we reported only the recurrent mutations occurring more than 10 times in the time range considered, as described elsewhere [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The occurrence of each mutation in a specific Country has been normalized by the number of genomes collected in that geographic area for each timeframe, dividing the silent by the non-silent mutations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Interestingly, the number of nonsynonymous mutations increases over time during the spread out of Asia, and appears to stabilize in April (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, top panel). The pattern of nonsynonymous mutations changes quite dramatically from January to February, when such mutations appeared for the first time. More in detail, part of the genomes analyzed in January 2020 belong to patients infected in China or to patients in close contact to those travelling or coming back from Asia. In February, most Countries decided to suspend flights at first from and to China and, after, only few communications were maintained between nations and during that month locally transmitted outbreak cases occurred. We observed a pattern of recurrent mutations which reached a homogeneous distribution across the different Countries in March 2020. This observation is confirmed also in April 2020 in all the analyzed Countries. It is likely that lockdown policies implemented in this period greatly reduced further viral spread from Asia and hampered mixing of SARS-CoV-2 strains among Countries. We observed a similar pattern for silent mutations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, bottom panel).
