<p id="Par22">Overall, our data show a number of silent mutations (nt241, nt3037) and nonsynonymous mutations (nt14408, nt23403 and nt28881–28882–28883) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Among the nonsynonymous mutations, we note the occurrence of an already observed mutation at position 14408, which is located in the viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp gene), a key component of the replication/transcription machinery [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This mutation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, depicted in red) emerged in February 2020 and is quite homogeneously distributed across all the Countries analyzed. This is also observed for a mutation occurring in the spike protein (nt23403, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, depicted in black) and to a minor extent for a mutation in the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (nt28881–28882–28883, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, depicted in blue). The occurrence of the mutation in the RdRp (nt14408) is always associated with that of the spike protein (nt23403), of the nsp3 mutation (nt3037) and of the mutation in the leader protein (nt241). A different pattern of hotspot mutations characterized viral genomes detected in patients from the United States. In February we initially detected three novel mutations (in position 17747, 17858 and 18060), that were not found elsewhere. These mutations were found predominantly in the viral genomes sequenced in Washington State (USA). The occurrence of this isolated pattern over time reflects the viral spreading of a more “European-like” strain (nt241, nt3037, nt14408 and nt23403) in the rest of the US. Overall, the occurrence of this “European-like” group varies from 32.5% of analyzed genomes (in USA) to 100% (in Italy). Our data confirm the previous observations made by Korber et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], when the authors hypothesized that this mutation group, associated with the G clade, could enhance viral fitness, possibly due to the nt23403 mutation that triggers a significant amino acid substitution in a strongly immunogenic linear epitope of Spike protein, which might affect neutralizing antibodies sensitivity.
