<p id="Par24">By normalizing the CFR by the ρ factor, we divided the analyzed Countries in three groups with an increased estimated CFR: group 1 is represented by Germany, group 2 by Italy, Spain and USA and group 3 by Sweden, France and UK. Groups 1 and 2 include Countries that adopted strict lockdown strategies and/or have a wide testing capability, whereas group 3 is formed by Countries that have adopted lockdown restrictions later (or have not at all) and/or did not perform an extensive diagnostic PCR testing. A decreasing trend of case fatality rate has been observed among most Countries. There are several direct factors that might contribute to this decline, such as health service’s ability to cope with COVID-19 patients, increased and improved viral testing and tracing, efficacy of the different lockdown strategies, herd immunity development, influence of age on the affected population, variation in viral contagiousness and lethality. We observe that, after the rapid emergence and diffusion of recurrent mutations in February and March, a specific mutation pattern has stabilized by April 2020 in all the Countries analyzed. This pattern is comprised of mutations nt241, nt3037, nt14408 and nt23403. In Sweden we report the occurrence of a unique nonsynonymous mutation in the spike protein (nt24368) which has been found in more than 50% of genomes. The emergence of specific patterns of mutations concomitant with the decline in case fatality rate needs further confirmation and the biological significance of such mutations remains unclear.</p>
