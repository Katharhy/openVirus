<p id="Par9">Similarities of clinical features between previous 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> infections and SARS-CoV-2 have been noted. Moreover, full genome sequencing has shown that it is closely related to SARS-CoV, both viruses have about 80% similarity and their genomes consist of six major open-reading frames (ORFs) plus a number of other accessory genes. Also, molecular modelling indicated similarities between their receptor-binding domains. The spike protein, that presents the most immunogenic determinants of the virus, has been shown to bind the same SARS-CoV receptor (the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor, ACE2) in order to invade cells, suggesting a similar pathogenic mechanism.
