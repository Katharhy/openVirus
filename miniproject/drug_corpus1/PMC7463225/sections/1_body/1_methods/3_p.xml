<p id="Par16">Therefore, in our study, CFR was calculated as the ratio between the death cases due to COVID-19, over the total number of SARS-CoV-2 reported cases 14 days before, as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. We normalized these rates among different Countries, considering the different policies in terms of number of testing/million inhabitants, and at the same time considering the different incidence of the infection taking into account the number of cases/million inhabitants. A corrective Country-specific ρ factor was defined as the ratio between the number of PCR tests/1 million inhabitants and the number of reported cases/1 million inhabitants (data obtained from

Standard CFR values were normalized by the Country-specific ρ factor. CFR between Countries were compared using proportion test. Post-hoc analysis in the case of more than two groups was performed using pairwise comparison of proportions and p-value was adjusted using Holm method.
