  <p>Anti-inflammatory activity of SAAs. Synthetic and biosurfactants exert potent anti-inflammatory effects by manipulating crucial cell signaling events. Specifically, S-DMPG treatments were shown to inhibit TLR-4 signaling, while a synthetic mixture comprised of recombinant surfactant protein (rSP)-C, palmitoyl phosphatidyl glycerol, and dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl choline (DPPC) exerted anti-inflammatory actions by reducing inflammasome signaling. Furthermore, CHF5633, SLS, Venticute and S-SF treatments significantly decreased the production of inflammatory mediators via unknown mechanisms. Synthetic mixture*: synthetic surfactant composed of recombinant surfactant protein (rSP)-C, palmitoyl phosphatidyl glycerol, and dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl choline (DPPC); SLS**: SP-CL16(6-28) and synthetic phospholipid mixture; S-SF mixture***: synthetic surfactant comprised of dipalmitoyl phosphohatidyl choline (DPPC), hexadecanol and tyloxapol.
