<p>The largest category of synthetic surfactants with anti-microbial actions is cationic surfactants, which exhibit a broad spectrum of biostatic and biocidal activities against planktonic pathogens. They exert their actions by electrostatically binding onto the negatively charged molecules of bacterial surface and disrupting the membrane continuity as well as the metabolic processes that take place on the bacterial inner membrane. However, these surfactants are mainly effective against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi, while most Gram-negative bacteria are resistant. Some examples of such compounds are: (i) a hexameric surfactant with amide moieties shown to be effective against

 <xref rid="B8-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], (ii) an amide gemini cationic surfactant 12 (AGS12) with incorporated silver nanoparticles shown to limit the growth of 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> [
 <xref rid="B9-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], (iii) V-16 and VBP-16 (two dicationic surfactants containing viologen, vinylbipyridinium moieties and hexadecyl chains) exhibiting inhibitory properties against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> 209P, 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> 8052 and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> 855-653 [
 <xref rid="B10-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and (iv) lysine-derived mono-catenary or gemini surfactants with anti-
 <italic>S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> and 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> activity [
 <xref rid="B11-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Other surfactants and surfactant emulsions rely on their hydrophobic moieties for their anti-microbial activity. These compounds are usually more efficient in combating Gram-negative bacteria than cationic surfactants. For example, benzalkonium chloride (BAC) analogues with hydrophobic chains of varying length exhibited anti-microbial activity against (i) Gram-positive bacteria 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, (ii) Gram-negative bacteria 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and (iii) fungus 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> [
 <xref rid="B12-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] while other nonionic, micelle-forming silicon polyether surfactants (with short hydrophilic chains that form micelles) were shown to be effective against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> B21 [
 <xref rid="B13-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Similarly, 
 <italic>N
  <sup>a</sup>
 </italic>-lauroyl-arginine methyl ester-derived cationic double-chain surfactants (with arginine heads) rely on their lipophilic moietiesfor their anti-microbial activity. Indeed, the most lipophilic analogue, LANHC
 <sub>X</sub>, exhibited profound inhibitory activity against 
 <italic>Micrococcus luteus</italic> ATCC 9341, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 29213 and 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> ATCC 12228 and a weaker one against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 27853, 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> ATCC 10321 and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922 [
 <xref rid="B14-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Lastly, gemini lipopeptide surfactants (with aliphatic chains and Lys residue(s) at the Y- and/or Z-position) exhibited anti-microbial activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (K12 and W3110), 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> LT2, 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> 168 and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> FDA 209P. Importantly, these surfactants can, specifically, target the bacterial membranes and do not cause hemolysis to rabbit red blood cells [
