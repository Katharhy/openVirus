<p>With glycolipid biosurfactants, there is evidence that the mechanism of antimicrobial activity depends on the glycolipid type, evidenced by the rhamnolipids inhibiting bacterial growth in the exponential phase whilst sophorolipids inhibit growth between the exponential and stationary phases [
 <xref rid="B16-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Diaz de Renzo et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] suggest that this may be due to the way the two biosurfactants interact with the cell membrane, with rhamnolipids having a greater ability to insert their acyl chains into thus disrupting the membrane [
 <xref rid="B17-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], whilst the mechanism of action of sophorolipids is closer to that of antibiotic drugs. There is also evidence that rhamnolipids and sophorolipids have differing activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with any activity being strongly pH dependent. 
 <italic>Salmonella enteric</italic> and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (both Gram-negative) are resistant to rhamnolipids at all pH [
 <xref rid="B18-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In a separate study, the Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 was also shown to be unaffected by rhamnolipid [

 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillu cereus</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> all show susceptibility to rhamnolipid, with 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> the most sensitive and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> more sensitive at a low pH [

 <xref rid="B19-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Oral pathogens of the genus Streptococcus (
 <italic>S. mutans, S. oralis, S. sanguinis</italic>), 
 <italic>Actinomyces naeslundii</italic> and 
 <italic>Neisseria mucosa</italic> are also sensitive to rhamnolipids in both the planktonic and biofilm state [
