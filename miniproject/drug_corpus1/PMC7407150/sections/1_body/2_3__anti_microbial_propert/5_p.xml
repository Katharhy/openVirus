<p>The antibacterial activity of MELs against Gram-positive sporing bacterium 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> was reported by Shu et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>, which is a food-borne pathogen, is able to produce spores resistant to high temperatures, UV and chemicals; therefore, the authors targeted both the vegetative cells as well as the spores for treatment with MELs. Their findings show that MELs had a significant effect on the sporesâ€™ germination and also successfully reduced the viability of vegetative cells. Their findings show a high potential of MELs as a natural preservative in the food industry. One of the recent studies by Ceresa et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] presented an excellent activity of MELs against a wellknown pathogen 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 6538. The surfactants were efficient at disrupting the 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> biomass, reducing the metabolic activity of the biofilm and also showed bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties against the pathogen. The biofilm experiments were performed on silicone-coated discs.
