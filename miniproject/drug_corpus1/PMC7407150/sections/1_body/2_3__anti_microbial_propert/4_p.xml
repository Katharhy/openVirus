<p>Sophorolipids have been found to have a bactericidal effect towards Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains [
 <xref rid="B21-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Diaz De Rienzo et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] presented an inhibitory effect of sophorolipids (SLs) on the growth of Gram-positive 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> BBK006 and Gram-negative 
 <italic>Cupriavidus necator</italic> ATCC 17699, as well as the biofilm-disruption properties on the biofilms of single and mixed cultures of 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> BBK006 and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 9144. In the latest study by Ceresa et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], the antimicrobial properties of SL in medical-grade silicone discs were evaluated against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 6538, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 10145 and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> IHEM 2894. SLs were found to significantly decrease a biofilm formation by both Gram-positive strains and significantly reduce the attachment of the yeast 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> on the silicone-coated discs. Sophorolipids adsorbed onto gold surfaces showed a compelling reduction in the viability of some significant Gram-positive (
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>) and Gram-negative (
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Salmonella typhymurium</italic>) pathogens, as reported by Valotteau et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These reports feed into a potential application of SLs in antiadhesion therapy, which is proposed as an alternative to the use of antibiotics and antifungal drugs for treating biofilm-associated infections [
 <xref rid="B25-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. According to the authors, SLs exhibited strong and versatile antiadhesion properties against two well known nosocomial pathogens, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, making these surfactants promising candidates for the design and production of anti-infective biomaterials.
