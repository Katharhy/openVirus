<p>The discovery and production of anti-microbial agents at the industrial scale has significantly contributed to the world-wide increase in life-expectancy and to the improvement of life quality. Antibacterial and antifungal factors can eliminate the viability and growth of microbial populations by: (i) disrupting their extracellular membranes and/or their cell wall (e.g., penicillin), (ii) inhibiting gene expression (e.g., aminoglucosides), (iii) inflicting DNA damages (e.g., metronidazole) or (iv) manipulating important metabolic pathways (e.g., sulfonamides). However, in recent decades, the severity of antibiotic resistance has dramatically increased, while the discovery of novel safe antibiotics has plummeted. A meta-analysis conducted in 2014 has shown that antibiotic abuse in hospital and community settings is the main factor leading to resistance [

 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Enterobacter</italic> sp. which can often result in fatal outcomes. In addition, some of the aforementioned bacteria as well as fungi (e.g., 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>) can organize into compact structures (i.e., biofilms) that attach to abiotic or biotic surfaces. Biofilms are comprised of microorganisms with an altered metabolic activity that are enclosed in a calyx of exopolysaccharides, DNA and proteins. Neither the hostâ€™s immune cells nor antibiotics can penetrate these structures, thus leading to chronic infections [

Biofilms can cause serious implications in the recipients of prosthetics and patients with chronic wounds, as the bacteria can be dislodged from the structure, travel through the bloodstream and possibly establish bacteremia and systemic infections. Today, antibiotic use, infection control and the development of novel disinfectants and vaccines are the main challenges for the scientific community. To these ends, compounds with surface-active properties are considered promising antibiotic/disinfectant agents, as well as antibiotic-delivery vehicles due to their physicochemical properties. Most of these molecules disrupt the outer and inner membranes of pathogens by exploiting their charge and hydrophobicity. The advantages of using SAAs as anti-microbials include their broad-spectrum bactericidal action and the lack of resistance mechanisms from the pathogens. Nonetheless, a major setback for the medical administration of these agents is their potential hemolytic activity, due to the lack of specificity of action.
