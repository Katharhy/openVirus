<p>Surfactants could be effective anti-biofilm agents due to their physicochemical properties that allow them to penetrate and disrupt hydrophobic structures. For instance, (i) sodium hypochlorite (SHY) effectively disrupted 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> biofilms and killed its planktonic cells [
 <xref rid="B29-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], (ii) cetylpyridinium chloride exerted bactericidal effects against planktonic cells and the biofilms of clinically relevant cariogenic 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B30-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], whereas (iii) cetylpyridium chloride nano-emulsion limited the attachment of other cariogenic strains like 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>, 
 <italic>Lactobacillus casei</italic>, 
 <italic>Actinomyces viscosus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> [
 <xref rid="B31-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In the same manner, novel synthesized ionic liquid nanoparticles [(IL)-incorporated 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate-incorporated, chitosan-modified, submicron-sized poly (DL-lactide-co-glycolide; PLGA)] together with surfactants Tween-20 or Poloxamer-188, managed to eliminate 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> biofilms. The underlined mechanism involved the degradation of the biofilms’ polysaccharides (EPS) content, thereby exposing the underlying bacteria to the action of the surfactants, consequently inducing the destruction of the cell wall and the cytoplasmic membrane as well [
 <xref rid="B32-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Additionally, the synthetic surfactants could act in synergy with other surfactants and/or antibiotics in order to maximize their beneficial outcomes. To this end, a 8:1 mixture of arginine-based surfactants [NαNω-bis (Nαcaproylarginine)] α, ω-propyldiamide [C
 <sub>3</sub>(CA)
 <sub>2</sub>]] together with an anionic lipopeptide (lichenysin), synergistically limited the growth of entero-pathogens 
 <italic>Yersinia enterocolotica</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7, 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, due to their ability to interact with bacterial phospholipids and to activate signaling cascades resulting in a viable, but not culturable, state [
 <xref rid="B33-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Moreover, the gemini quarter ammonium bromides [10 (TMPAL-10 Br) and 12 (TMBEAL-12 Br)] were shown to act synergistically with azoles (itraconazole and fluconazole) or polyenes (nystatin and amphotericin), two classes of antifungal agents, resulting in a two-fold increase in the surfactant’s inhibitory activity against the pathogens 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. In addition, both TMPAL-10 Br and TMBEAL-12 Br exerted an antiadhesive action, while only TMEAL-12 Br could dislodge pre-formed 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilms in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, TMPAL-10 completely stopped filament formation in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, a key early process for biofilm formation [
