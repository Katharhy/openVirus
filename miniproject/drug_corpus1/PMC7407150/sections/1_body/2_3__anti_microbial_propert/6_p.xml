<p>Janek et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] examined the antimicrobial and antiadhesive properties of trehalose lipids (TLs) against a number of pathogens. The authors concluded that TLs indicated the highest antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>Vibrio harveyi</italic> and 
 <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic>, as well as inhibited the growth of the yeast 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> by 30%. Moreover, the authors observed a strong antiadhesive property, especially against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> on polystyrene surfaces and silicone urethral catheters. According to the authors, their findings show that TLs could be successfully used as surface-coating agents.
