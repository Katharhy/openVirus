<p>Biosurfactants are also the potent disruptors of biofilms for human bacterial and yeast pathogens. Rhamnolipids were able to remove up to 88.9% of the 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm in skim milk or 35% in nutrient broth, both deposited onto polystyrene [
 <xref rid="B35-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Similarly, Aleksic et al. extracted dirhamnolipids (with two C10 acyl chains, C10C12 and C8C10 acyl chains) from Lysinibacillus sp. BV152.1 fermentations, and showed that they could prevent biofilm formation by 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> [
 <xref rid="B36-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The semi-synthetic morpholine amide derivative of these rhamnolipids showed an increased biofilm disruption activity (80% against 50% for the unreacted rhamnolipids) with 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1. Rhamnolipid congener type also affects biofilm disruption with C10C10 mono-rhamnolipids produced by 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> having a lower effect than C14C14 di-rhamnolipids from 
 <italic>Burkholderia thailandensis</italic> E264 on biofilm formation by 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> BBK006 [
 <xref rid="B37-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Bisurfactants also appear to be less effective at preventing or removing biofilm in mixed bacterial cultures compared to single strains. Rhamnolipids at 0.25% were able to remove 24% of the biofilm from a mixed culture of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> and 
 <italic>S.Enteritidis</italic>, compared to 58.5% for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 26.5% for 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, and 23.0% for 
 <italic>S.Enteritidis</italic> on their own [
 <xref rid="B38-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The biofilm-disrupting ability of rhamnolipids extends to pathogenic fungi. Rhamnolipids at 0.16mg/L reduced the adhesion of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> to polystyrene by 50%, increasing to 90% at 5mg/L [
 <xref rid="B39-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. With 
 <italic>Yarrowia lipolytica</italic>, rhamnolipid is more efficient than CTAB or SDS at reducing biofilm formation (up to 50%) [
