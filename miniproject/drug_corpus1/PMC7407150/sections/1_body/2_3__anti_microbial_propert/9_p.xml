<p>Importantly, surfactants and emulsions can be incorporated into chronic wound care either as direct anti-microbial agents, or due to their ability to produce gels and foams for topical application. Chronic wounds usually attract biofilm-forming microorganisms that decelerate wound healing and often lead to systemic disorders. In this context, a non-propellant based foam (NPF; loaded with the antibiotics sulfadiazine and pectin-capped green nano-silver), applied onto second degree thermal wounds inflicted onto Swiss Albino mice, was shown to protect the wound from microbial insults while promoted skin regeneration [

 <sup>®</sup> and Wound Dressing and the anti-microbial PluroGel
 <sup>®</sup> PSSD) eradicated the pre-formed

 <italic>S. epidermidis, S. aureus</italic> and methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) biofilms on several experimental models, by entrapping and killing the dispersed microorganisms from the biofilm [

 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>,

 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> biofilm, eliminate their planktonic cells and prevent intrusion by environmental pathogens, as documented in various in vitro models [

In 2016, SSD was tested in a multi-center clinical study, where 70% of the participants experienced positive outcomes (wound closure, reduction of inflammation and odor) with 56% of whom achieved wound closure in less than 11 weeks [

To this end, cotton fibers [coated with nano-structured zinc oxide (ZnO NP) stabilized by the surfactants sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) or alkyl hydroxy-ethyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (HY)] were shown to exert strong anti-microbial activity against 
 <italic>E. coli, S. aureus, C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>Microsporumcanis</italic>, while they were provento be non-irritable for the skin [
