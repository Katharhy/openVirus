<p>Synthetic surfactants and emulsions can also be used as anti-biofilm agents on the surfaces of prosthetic medical devices and health care disposables (e.g., cotton buds and respiratory protective devices). More specifically, nystatin admixed with the surfactant sodium deoxycholate (at a ratio of 1:0.8) induced an over 40% inhibition of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilm formation on endotracheal tubes, an effect attributed to the fact that the surfactant enhanced the nystatin penetration into the prosthetics [

Regarding the safety of health professionals, engineered respiratory protective devices (with non-woven reusable fabrics and embedded hexamethylene-1,6-bis (N,N-dimethyl-N-dodecyl ammonium bromide; GS-12-6-12 crystals onto halloysite nanocrystals) exerted an anti-microbial action in the presence of water (i.e., humidity from exhaled air) against

 <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> as well as 
 <italic>Penicillumchrysogenum</italic> and 
 <italic>A. niger</italic> [

To this end, an anti-microbial and algae-static nanofilm (containing silica-modified quaternary ammonium compounds) was synthesized in an effort to replace chlorine-based water disinfection methods. This nanofilm effectively limited the viability and adhesion of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Microcystis aeruginosa</italic>, respectively [
