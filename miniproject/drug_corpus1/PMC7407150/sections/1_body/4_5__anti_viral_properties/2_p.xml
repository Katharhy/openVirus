<p>One of the first reported applications of synthetic surface-active compounds with anti-viral potential, was their incorporation in topically-applied gels for the management of sexually-transmitted infections. Nonoxynol-9 was the first non-ionic surfactant with established spermicidal activity, which was tested as a potential virucidal against enveloped viruses, including those of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Clinical trials that investigated the use of nonoxynol-9 against HIV infection in female sex workers led to controversial results regarding the efficacy and safety of a such approach [

 <xref rid="B113-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Although nonoxynol-9 appeared as a non-appropriate candidate for a topical virucidal use, it did set the stage for the research of synthetic SAAs with virucidal potential [

 <xref rid="B115-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. Of note, the poly-anionic SDS was found to be effective against HIV-1, HSV-2 and the non-enveloped human papilloma virus (HPV), due to its surface-active and denaturing properties [

In an earlier study, sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS; an anionic surfactant with protein denaturing potency, otherwise called SDS) was shown to be effective against the same targets. Furthermore, a gel formulation containing SLS was potent against herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2)-induced vaginal and epidermal lesions in rabbits and mice [

For instance, commercial South African soap bars diluted in water demonstrated virucidal action against cell-free HIV-1 virions and cytotoxic effects against HIV-1-infected lymphocytes. These effects were reported after a very short incubation period, ranging from 30 secs to 2 min [
