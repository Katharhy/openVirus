<p>Re-emerging and emerging viral infections lacking effective therapeutic and preventive measures constitute a global threat. Vulnerable populations (immune-deficient and/or immunocompromised individuals and groups at the extremes of age) are more prone to developing severe disease manifestations and rare complications, often leading to chronic disorders and death. Currently available anti-virals comprise of: (i) directly-acting (DAAs) and (ii) host-acting (HAAs) anti-virals, which can either directly target the virion or alter thegene expression and enhance host anti-viral responses, respectively [
