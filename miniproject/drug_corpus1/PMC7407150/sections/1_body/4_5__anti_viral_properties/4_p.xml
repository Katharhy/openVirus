<p>Viral infections account for a significant percentage of food-borne diseases worldwide. The two most prevalent viral enteropathogens are the norovirus (NoV) and rotavirus (RV). Human NoV (HuNoV) does not propagate in cell cultures, but instead, close phylogenetically viral surrogates, like the murine NoV (MNV), are utilized in research for anti-noroviral compounds. In a recent study, the anti-MNV potential of the surfactants SDS (powder), NP-40 (4-nonylphenyl-polyethylene glycol), Triton X-100, and Tween-20 was examined, and found that all surfactants were able to inactivate MNV-1 in a dose-dependent manner [

Similarly, a mixture consisting of levulinic acid and SDS limited the activity of MNV and hepatitis A virus (HAV) on strawberries. The mean reduction of viral yield only reached 1-log, but levulinic acid/SDS mixture was more efficient compared to water or bleach [

A recent study, using viral-like particles, consisting of the noroviral capsid proteins only, reported that the cationic surfactant cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and the anionic surfactant SDS could disassociate and entrap the viral-like particles in micelles, effectively limiting their infectivity [

 <xref rid="B133-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. Regardless, alcohol-based sanitizers have been shown to completely diminish the infectivity of RV and HAV in less than 30s [
