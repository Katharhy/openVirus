<p>Furthermore, a synthetic complex consisting of κ-carrageenan and collagen peptides (CP) (κ-ca3000 + CP) inhibited UV-induced apoptotic death in HaCaT and MEF cells by (i) blocking the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, (ii) reducing the MMP-1 expression and (iii) inhibiting ROS production, thus resulting in increased levels of collagen I synthesis [
