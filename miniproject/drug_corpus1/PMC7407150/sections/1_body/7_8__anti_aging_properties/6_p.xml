<p>Glycolipid biosurfactants have been reported to have potential anti-aging properties that could be exploited in cosmetic formulations. The focus of this research has been on MELs, although any glycolipid displaying anti-oxidant or anti-inflammatory properties has anti-aging potential, with rhamnolipids as the subject of patents for anti-wrinkle and anti-aging products [
