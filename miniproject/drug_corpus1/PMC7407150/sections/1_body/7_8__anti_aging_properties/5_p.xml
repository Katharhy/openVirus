<p>Over the years, the prevention of aging has attracted significant interest among the scientific community. On the other hand, the increased production of ROS has been identified as one of the most prominent determinants of aging, affecting cellular anti-oxidant defense systems and favoring pro-inflammatory and immune dysfunction [

To this end, the development and use of anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory agents appear as a promising strategy against aging and age-related diseases. Interestingly, COS exert significant in vivo anti-aging activity against D-gal induced subacute aging mice by (i) blocking the impairment of kidney and liver functions, (ii) partially mediating an improvement of the anti-oxidant activity (by the means of the increased expression of CAT, GSH-Px, SOD) and furthermore (iii) enhancing the immune function (by the means of an increased expression of serum immunoglobulins IgG and/or IgM) [
