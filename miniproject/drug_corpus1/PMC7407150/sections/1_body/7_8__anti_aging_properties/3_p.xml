<p>Different studies have shown the protective activity of synthetic biosurfactants against UV-induced damage by utilizing both in vitro and in vivo experimental models. For instance, chitooligosaccharides (COS; water-soluble derivatives of chitin or chitosan) obtained through chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis [

Specifically, 3-5kDa COS were shown to absorb both UV-A and UV-B light, indicating a protective effect against skin photo-damage. At the molecular level, COS inhibited the expression of various MMPs including MMPs-1, -8 and -13 collagenases and MMPs-2 and -9 gelatinases, an effect accompanied by the induction of their negative regulators TIMP-1 and -2. Moreover, COS-treated HDF cells showed an increased expression of different pro-procollagen members, such as I, III and IV, through the negative regulation of the AP-1 signaling pathway members, like c-Jun and c-Fos [

Following the topical application of COS, an improvement of UV-induced damages of the skin (at the macroscopic and histopathological levels) were documented and shown to be mediated by the increased levels of total collagen as well as collagen I. Moreover, the increased levels of various anti-oxidant enzymes like catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), together with reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-a, IL-1ÃŸ and IL-6), contributed to the photo-protective effect of COS [
