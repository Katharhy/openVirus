<p>Aging is generally considered a complex, multifactorial and time-dependent process that is strictly related to morbidity and mortality among humans [
 <xref rid="B191-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>]. Specifically, aging is characterized by a significant decline/deterioration of physiological and anatomical functions at the molecular, cellular and tissue levels [
 <xref rid="B192-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>], leading to the impairment of homeostasis and ultimately to death [
 <xref rid="B193-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>]. At the cellular level, several mechanisms have been associated with the aging process including: (i) increased levels of oxidative stress, (ii) the dysfunction of the mitochondrial machinery, (iii) telomere attrition and finally (iv) the impairment of DNA repair mechanism [

 <xref rid="B196-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>], all of which have been correlated to the onset of different age-related diseases such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders and neurodegenerative diseases [
