<p>The origin of these bioactive properties most likely arises from the ability of SAAs to interact with proteins and lipid membranes. The propensity for SAAs to bind either to specific binding sites or non-specifically to proteins (including enzymes) is wellknown [
 <xref rid="B2-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and they have been exploited as protein denaturants, for many years, in sodium dodecyl sulfateâ€“polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) assays. Thus, there is certainly the possibility that SAAs can and will disrupt critical microbial and cellular metabolic processes in addition to interacting with membranes [
 <xref rid="B3-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The amphiphilic structure of SAAs allows them to penetrate the phospholipid leaflet of a membrane, modifying the membrane structure and fluidity, thus increasing the permeability and disrupting cellular metabolic processes.
