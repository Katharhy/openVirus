<p>In this review, the veracity of the scientific evidence for the bioactive properties of a range of biological and synthetic surfactants is considered, with an emphasis on the mechanism(s) of action and their potential use as the components of industrial and consumer product applications. The discussion on biosurfactants will be confined to those that are produced by microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, yeast) and in particular the glycolipids (rhamnolipids, sophorolipids and mannosityl erithritol lipids (MELs)).</p>
