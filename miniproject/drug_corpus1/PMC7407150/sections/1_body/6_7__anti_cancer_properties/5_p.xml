<p>The effect of rhamnolipids on the cancer cell lines HL-60, BV-173, SKW-3, and JMSU-1 has been determined for the C10C10 monorhamnolipid R1, and the corresponding C10C10 dirhamnolipid R2 [
 <xref rid="B173-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. R1 was the more potent of the two and inhibited cellular division at lower concentrations (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) than R2. The mechanism of inhibition appeared to be the induction of apoptosis. Rahimi et al. [
 <xref rid="B174-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>] confirmed the anti-cancer properties of R1 and R2 (on the MCF7 human breast cancer cells) and the lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> of R1 (25.87 µg/mL) compared to R2 (31.00 µg/mL). Others have also confirmed the anticancer potential of rhamnolipids [
