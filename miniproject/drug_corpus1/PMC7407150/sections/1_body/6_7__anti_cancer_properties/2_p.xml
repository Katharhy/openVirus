<p>Benzethonium chloride (BCl) is a synthetic quaternary ammonium salt, characterized as a cationic surfactant and is mainly known for its anti-microbial activities [

However, according to the National Cancer Institute/NIH Developmental Therapeutics Program (NCI/NIH-DTP), BCl was also found to exhibit significant anti-cancer potential against leukemia, lung, colon, melanoma and ovarian cancers [

In another report, BCl inhibited the proliferative activity of human laryngeal (UMSCC23) and tongue (HN12) squamous carcinoma cells, by inducing a terminal unfolded protein response (UPR), which led to the up-regulation of the transcription factor CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) and subsequently to CHOP-dependent apoptosis [

This compound also exhibited a significant anticancer effect, against FaDu, (hypopharyngeal) and C666-1 (nasopharyngeal) squamous cancer cells. Specifically, in FaDu cells, BCl-induced apoptotic death was related to the activation of caspases -2, -8, -9, -3 and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δ
