<p>There are numerous reports on the anti-tumour activity of MELs against various cancer types. In some, the successful treatment was related to the MEL-containing liposomes as summarised by Silva Coelho et al. [
 <xref rid="B183-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>]. The anticancer effect of MEL-A and MEL-B on human leukaemia HL-60 cell lines was reported by Isoda et al. [
 <xref rid="B184-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">184</xref>] The surfactants were also found to inhibit the insulin-dependent proliferation of human myelogenous leukaemia cell line K562 through the inhibition of the tyrosine phosphorylation [

 <xref rid="B187-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>] reported an induction of apoptosis by MELs against mouse melanoma B16 cell lines. The authors [

 <xref rid="B190-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>] presented the use of MELs for synthesizing gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs) and assessed the MEL-AuNPs properties. Based on their findings, the newly synthesized nanoparticles showed potential cytotoxic activity against human liver hepatoma HepG2 cells. Furthermore, the authors evaluated other MEL-containing nanocomposites, MEL@ZnONPs and Ag–ZnO/MEL/GA, for their cytotoxic activity against HepG2, and observed a decrease in the viability of cells with increasing concentrations of the nanocomposites.
