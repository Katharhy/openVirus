<p>SAAs are molecules of multifunctional significance given their widespread use in almost every major industrial sector producing consumer products, aiming to optimize their utilization in accordance to their beneficial properties. To this end, SAAs are characterized in the context of their health-promoting properties, while the scientific interest keeps on growing in an attempt to shed light on the underlying molecular mechanism(s) by which they exert such properties. This is of utmost importance as it provides a valid rationale for the selection of better chemical derivatives with enhanced functionality. In this respect, biosurfactants have excellent promise as the replacers of synthetic SAAs as they would find favor with consumers due to their perceived naturalness, lower toxicity and ecotoxicity, higher biodegradability and excellent surface active properties. However, the study of their bioactive properties is relatively new and before they can fully replace synthetic SAAs in bioactive applications, more work is required to fully understand the mechanisms and extent of their efficacy in health-promoting activities.</p>
