<p>Synthetic and biosurfactants are amphiphiles, which have both hydrophilic and lipophilic regions that allow them to adsorb to interfaces, including biological membranes. Their structures, however, can differ markedly, particularly in terms of their hydrophilic regions. Synthetic surfactants often contain an alkyl chain attached to a polar or compact charged hydrophilic head group [
