<p>Moreover, a newly synthesized collagen peptide (CP)-κ-carrageenan oligosaccharide complex κ-ca3000 + CP, was evaluated for its potential free radical scavenging activity. To this end, the complex [consisting of κ-carrageenan conjugated with bioactive tilapia skin collagen peptides (CP), rich in hydroxyl and carboxyl groups, and with noted anti-oxidant and photo-protective properties] was effective against UV-induced cell death in HaCaT and MEF cells more efficiently than each compound alone. Finally, this effect was mediated by: (i) the inhibition of apoptotic cell death (HaCaT), (ii) the induced production of collagen I and reduced matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) expression levels (MEF), accompanied by (iii) the inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathway activation and ROS production as well. According to the authors, the complex κ-ca3000/CP exerts significant photo-protective and anti-oxidant activities, thereby indicating its potential use in cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries [
