<p>The visible light irradiation of photosensitizers such as riboflavin (hydrophilic) [

 <xref rid="B79-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], appear to represent a key mechanism of promoting lipid oxidation in food products [

 <xref rid="B81-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. In a recent study, anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and neutral Tween-20 coated oil droplets, were shown to be more stable compared to those coated with cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) in riboflavin-photosensitized O/W emulsions [

 <xref rid="B82-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Moreover, lipid oxidation appeared less rapidly in droplets coated with the anionic surfactant SDS, compared to those coated with the non-ionic surfactant Tween-80 [
 <xref rid="B83-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Finally, a study that evaluated the influence of the structureâ€™s interface on the oxidative stability of the surfactant-stabilized O/W emulsions indicated that the metal-initiated lipid oxidation and the formation of volatile compounds occurred more rapidly in the emulsions stabilized by a mixture of non-ionic Tween-20 and Span-20 surfactants, when compared to those stabilized by a single Tween-20 [
