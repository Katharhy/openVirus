<p>Chitosan (CS), a semi-synthetic derivative of the polysaccharide chitin (produced through alkaline deacetylation), has exhibited considerable anti-microbial, wound-healing and anti-oxidant activities, among others [

 <xref rid="B101-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. To this end, synthetic single N-quaternized (QCS) and double N-diquaternized (DQCS) chitosan derivatives were shown to exhibit water solubility. Moreover, both QCS and DQCS derivatives exhibited higher anti-oxidant capacity when compared to single CS. Specifically, the anti-oxidant potential of all the tested compounds followed the order of DQCS &gt; QCS &gt; CS, as evidenced by various anti-oxidant assays [

These results suggest that the DQCS synthetic derivatives of chitosan could be used in pharmaceutical and food areas as promising anti-oxidant agents. On another note, the synthesized derivatives of glucosyl- and glucuronosyl alkyl gallates demonstrated better surfactant and anti-oxidant activities when compared to those of alkyl galates. However, their ROSscavenging capacity appeared to be lower when compared to that of alkyl esters [
