<p>Non-ionic surfactants (e.g., polysorbates; Tween group) have been widely used in preclinical and clinical practice due to their amphiphilic nature as emulsifiers. Specifically, Tween-20/80 non-ionic surfactants have been used as pharmaceutical surfactants in various drug delivery systems (oral/parenteral) with poor solubility and consequently, their intravenous use has been approved by the European Medicines Agency and US Food and Drug Administration [

However, although Tween-20/80 surfactants are generally characterized by a safe profile, extensive knowledge of their antioxidant potential is rather limited. In a recent report, the antioxidant capacity of Tween-20/80 was evaluated by several in vitro assays at concentrations commonly used in laboratory tests [

According to the results, both surfactants possessed a low scavenging capacity against (2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate; DPPH) radical formation. However, Tween-20 and -80 significantly inhibited the generation of ROS (by means of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or the H

 <sub>2</sub>-induced activation of human neutrophils), while Tween-20 exhibited the strongest reductive activity. Specifically, Tween-20 showed a greater inhibitory effect against ROS formation in PMA-induced human leucocytes compared to the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-treatedcells, while the antioxidant capacity of Tween-80 was similar in both cases. According to the authors of this study, the results indicate that the anti-oxidant potential of both polysorbates (i.e., in terms of decreased ROS production) cannot be assigned to their free radical scavenging ability, but rather to their undefined biological interaction-based mechanism(s) [
