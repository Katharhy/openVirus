<p>Native as well as the synthetic derivatives of carrageenans have all been shown to associate with significant anti-oxidant potential, such as in the case of Îº-carrageenan oligosaccharides as well as some of their over-sulfated (SD), low-, high-acetylated (LAD and HAD, respectively) and phosphorylated (PD) derivatives. According to the results, all the types were shown to limit ROS production, to a variable extent, thereby suggesting that chemical modification(s) could enhance their anti-oxidant potential, in vitro, in a manner following the pattern of PD &gt; SD &gt; LAD &gt; HAD. This observation, in turn, highlights the significant role of the sulfated content in exerting an anti-oxidant response [
