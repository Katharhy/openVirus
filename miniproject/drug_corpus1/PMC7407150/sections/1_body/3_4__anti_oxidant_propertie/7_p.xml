<p>In another report, erythorbyl laurate (6-O-lauroyl-erythorbic acid), a synthetic product derived from the enzymatic esterification between erythorbic acid (a stereoisomer of L-ascorbic acid widely used as an anti-oxidant in a variety of processed foods) and lauric acid (a medium-chain fatty acid with a strong anti-microbial activity against food-related pathogens) was documented to act as a surface active agent with significant foaming ability [

 <xref rid="B98-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Such property was related to its high concentration at the O/W interface and consequently resulted in the significant inhibition of lipid peroxides, particularly in soybean oil emulsions. The observed emulsifying and anti-oxidant properties indicate its potential use as a promising solubilizer/stabilizer of hydrophobic functional food ingredients in emulsified food systems [
