<p>On the other hand, tyrosol, a biophenol with notable anti-oxidant potential [
 <xref rid="B95-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>], was utilized for the formation of alkyl-succinylatedtyrosol synthetic amphiphilic lipids (catalyzed by lipase succinylation of tyrosol with different alkyl chain lengths of alkyl succinic anhydrides) [
 <xref rid="B96-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. According to the characterization profile of tyrosol-based-derived synthetic lipids, all four derivatives exhibited surface active and anti-oxidant abilities to a variable extent. Specifically, among them, the 2-dodecen-1-yl succinylated compound exhibited greater activity against DPPH radical formation when compared to free tyrosol, as well as to the rest of the synthetic lipids. At an emulsion state, both 2-octen-1-ylsuccinylated and 2-dodecen-1-ylsuccinylatedtyrosol-based emulsions inhibited lipid oxidation to a greater extent, as opposed to that of free tyrosol emulsions.
