<p>Food products are also susceptible to oxidation, mainly affecting their lipid, protein and carbohydrate content. Specifically, lipid oxidation in emulsion-based food products is considered as the main mechanism causing the deterioration of food quality (e.g., reduced nutrition value), short shelflife, undesirable rancidity, color, texture, etc.). Moreover, the subsequent formation of toxic by-products is often associated with the incidence of pathological conditions including neurodegenerative diseases and cancer [

 <xref rid="B64-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. To this end, the amelioration of oxidatively-induced damage through the utilization of synthetic and/or naturally-occurring antioxidant compounds, both in humans and in food products, has been extensively reported. In most cases, synthetic antioxidants appear to be more efficient at lower concentrations, while naturally-derived ones usually require higher concentrations. In this context, the utilization of SAAs as novel-antioxidant compounds has attracted scientific interest in recent years [

 <xref rid="B67-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In general, lipid oxidation in emulsion-based products including those of the food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries, is a major health concern for consumers [
 <xref rid="B68-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Specifically, the lipid oxidation of emulsion-based foods, rich in fatty/oils, can deteriorate the foodâ€™s nutritional and sensory quality (during processing and storage) in terms of undesirable color, texture and rancidity while the formation of toxic by-products could potentially relate to serious health problems [
 <xref rid="B69-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. In general, oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions are used as an emulsion-based model, in food products, consisting of emulsifier-surrounding lipid droplets dispersed in an aqueous continuous phase [
 <xref rid="B70-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Lipid oxidation takes place at the interface between the aqueous and oil phase and it is the net effect of the activity of various enzymes, transition metals and photo-sensitizers, all of which can promote lipid oxidation [
 <xref rid="B71-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Therefore, it is evident that the composition and characteristics of the interfacial layer and the surrounding microenvironment are critical factors, influencing lipid oxidation rates and oxidation stability in O/W systems [

 <xref rid="B74-pharmaceutics-12-00688" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Consequently, the use of interfacial agents able to manipulate interfacial characteristics, has attracted significant attention, especially towards their application in commercial food products. Indeed, several synthetic compounds that possess both surface active and antioxidant potential have been evaluated for their use as antioxidant emulsifiers in O/W emulsions [
