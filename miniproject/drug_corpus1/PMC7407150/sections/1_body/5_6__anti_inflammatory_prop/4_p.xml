<p>In addition, another synthetic surfactant, a mixture of recombinant surfactant protein (rSP)-C, palmitoyl-phosphatidyl-glycerol (PPG) and DPPC also inhibited the release of IL-1Î², in U937 human lymphoma cells, by interfering with the ATP-mediated inflammasome activation, in a dose-dependent manner. The authors suggested that the active constituent of the surfactant was DPPC, which acted as an antagonist on non-canonical nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in immune cells [
