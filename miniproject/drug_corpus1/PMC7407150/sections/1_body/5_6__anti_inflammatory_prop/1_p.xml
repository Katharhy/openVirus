<p>Balanced inflammatory responses are crucial for survival. They are divided into two broad categories: acute and chronic. Acute inflammatory responses can be triggered by pathogens, chemical irritants or tissue injury and can result in the neutralization of the stimuli and wound tissue repair [

The main soluble mediators of inflammatory response are interleukins (ILs), chemokines, eicosanoids and histamine, produced by the injured tissue or in situ immunological populations. On the other hand, the duration and magnitude of the inflammatory response is tightly regulated by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), which locally suppresses the production of pro-inflammatory molecules, whilst supporting the proliferation of fibroblasts and the production of extracellular matrix proteins, involved in the remodeling of the damaged tissue. In this way, unregulated responses can lead to systemic and chronic inflammation that are strictly correlated with autoimmune disorders, cancer, metabolic and cardiovascular disease, among other pathological conditions [
