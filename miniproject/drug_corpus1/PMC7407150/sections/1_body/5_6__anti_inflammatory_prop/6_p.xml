<p>In vivo studies exploring the anti-inflammatory potential of synthetic SAAs are limited. A protein-free synthetic surfactant prepared from DPPC (i.e., hexadecanol and tyloxapol) exhibited anti-inflammatory properties in rats with LPS-induced lung injury. The surfactant-treated rats showed a lower expression of IL-1β, IL-2, TNF-α, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1β (MIP-1β) (chemokines that recruit monocytes and activate granulocytes, fibroblasts and macrophages in situ, respectively), when compared to the non-treated (control) ones [
