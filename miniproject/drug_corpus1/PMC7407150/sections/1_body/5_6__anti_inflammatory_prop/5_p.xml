<p>Lastly, synthetic galactose-taurine sodium salt has been shown to exhibit surface active properties by halting the pro-inflammatory response in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 macrophages via: (i) the down-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression levels as well as (ii) the suppression of the activation of nuclear factor-κΒ (NF-κΒ).
