<p id="p0030">Symptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 reportedly present with fever, dry cough, shortness of breath and myalgias. The mortality stems from rapid, severe progression to acute lung injury (ALI), ARDS, respiratory failure, sepsis or cardiac arrest. Pathological reports from postmortem assessment describe bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with edema, pneumocyte desquamation, hyaline membrane formation and massive pulmonary embolism [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These pathological features resemble the pneumonia seen with SARS and MERS [
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The overall nucleotide sequence of the current virus exhibits about 79% similarity to SARS-CoV-1, and more specifically, key structural components such as binding ability to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor are shared [
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The overlap of pathology and genetic structure allows parallels from more established literature about the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-1. In addition to viral overload, animal models have illustrated apoptosis of epithelium and endothelium and an array of inflammatory and immune responses leading to a cytokine storm. Subsequent vascular permeability and abnormal T-cell and macrophage responses induce ALI and ARDS [
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Hyper-inflammatory response and compromised vasculature are increasingly shown to spur multisystem dysfunction, including in the heart, kidneys, nerves and gastrointestinal tract [
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therapies that can modulate the inflammatory cascade, immune response or cytokine storm may work to prevent the rapid progression to the ARDS and fulminant systemic organ failure that are driving mortality with COVID-19.
