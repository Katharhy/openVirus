<p id="p0025">Coronaviruses (CoVs) are RNA viruses that primarily infect birds and livestock [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], but when they cross the species barrier, coronaviruses have been highly infectious and lethal to humans in the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in 2012, and in the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic [

 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Up to the submission date, Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering has confirmed over 8.4 million cases and 453,900 deaths worldwide, more fatalities than in the SARS and MERS epidemics combined [
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. To date no registered treatment or vaccine for the disease exists. Various general treatments, from nutritional interventions to antivirals used for other diseases, have been reviewed and proposed [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Recent reports suggest that ventilator therapy may be ineffective and may even increase morbidity and mortality in severely ill patients [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The absence of a specific treatment and the high mortality rate dictate an urgent need for therapeutics that may control the replication and rapid spread of the virus. Here we review the potential for nitric oxide in limiting the density of virus within the lungs, preventing the onset and development of COVID-19 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and treating ARDS.
