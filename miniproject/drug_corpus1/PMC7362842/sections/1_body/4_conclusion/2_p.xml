<p id="p0065">With the emergence of COVID-19 as a pandemic with the ability to overwhelm the body and the healthcare infrastructure, patients have a pressing need for effective agents that can slow down the disease in their bodies and in their communities. While the search for a vaccine and targeted drugs continues, much of medical research is actively exploring the infection's pathophysiology for points of plausible intervention. An exaggerated immune response and unchecked inflammation are likely at the root of severe illness. Nitric oxide has demonstrated promise in similar respiratory disease models in modulating the prominent inflammation, and the early reported proofs of concept urgently call for randomized control trials in treating COVID-19. Exogenous NO therapy geared toward the right population at the optimal stage of infection may be an accessible, compelling option for patients. If its efficacy is illustrated as therapeutics firms seek its indication for COVID-19, nitric oxide treatment can be pivotal in the world's fight against this immediate threat to public health.</p>
