<p id="p0055">NO is one of several potential treatments included in the emergency expanded access program by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Several innovators are pursuing the indication for NO in treating COVID-19. On March 30 Bellerophon Therapeutics announced the first treatment of a patient with COVID-19 using their proprietary INOpulse® inhaled nitric oxide system [

 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The biotherapeutics firm currently uses INOpulse for other cardiopulmonary indications, such as pulmonary hypertension associated with pulmonary fibrosis. Portable and designed to deliver NO in outpatient settings outside of the hospital, INOpulse could aid in preserving hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) capacity as the pandemic progresses. Through expanded access the FDA also recently approved VERO Biotech's GENOSYL DS® iNO to treat patients with COVID-19 at home [

Currently used for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, GENOSYL is a tankless device that provides even more flexibility for healthcare resources by allowing home use of iNO. Zamanian et al. describe solely outpatient management of a patient with concomitant idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension and COVID-19 disease, reporting symptomatic improvement with GENOSYL DS® with no urgent care, emergency department or hospital visits [
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Such delivery systems align with our proposal to harness NO's potential in the early stages of COVID-19 infection. As groups continue to publish more results with their respective NO platforms, dosing and protocol variations should be examined in evaluating the studies.
