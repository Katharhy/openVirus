<p id="p0050">Exogenous NO has been administered with inhalation and with donor compound pro-drugs relying on enzymatic activity [
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Inhaled NO (iNO) for treatment of active ARDS was reported by Chen and colleagues during the 2003 epidemic, but existing literature shows mixed efficacy when expanding outside the SARS-CoV-1 disease model [
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials have shown that iNO, does not reduce mortality when used therapeutically in the management of ARDS [
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Variations in dosing and treatment protocol may at least partly account for the differences in the literature. Additionally, the level of cellular debris and tissue damage during active ARDS may be too overwhelming to allow for NO efficacy. Donor drugs with S-nitrosothiols containing molecules (RSNOs) have demonstrated antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity [
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. NO delivered with 
 <italic>S</italic>-nitroso-
 <italic>N</italic>-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) inhibits the replication cycle of SARS-CoV-1 in a concentration-dependent manner and reduces the post-translational palmitoylation of the S protein, inhibiting S protein and ACE2 receptor interaction and subsequent membrane fusion [

 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This mechanism of action suggests an additional effect of preserving host ACE2 levels that may better regulate RAS and promote endogenous NO production as described above. NO releasing nanoparticles (NO-nps) demonstrate potential in limiting inflammatory cascades and ischemia reperfusion injury [
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. We propose that delivering modest, persistent amounts of iNO or RSNO at the early stages of COVID-19 infection might limit the progression toward ARDS and fulminant systemic failure, particularly in vulnerable patients who may have decreased levels of endogenous NO due to increased age or comorbid conditions. This approach should decrease viral replication, downregulate ACE, prevent the onset of any hypoxia-reoxygenation/ischemia reperfusion-based inflammation, control the cytokine cascade, allow for removal of cell debris, limit lipid peroxidation and concomitant cell damage, reduce detrimental vascular permeability and maintain proper blood flow.
