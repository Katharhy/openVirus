<p>To further understand the mechanism of infection governed by the SIR model, we now give a brief summary of its analytic properties that provide useful guidelines for us to build statistical models and methods to learn the SIR model from available surveillance data from public health databases.

    <p>Strictly speaking, the size of each component population of 
     <italic>S</italic>(
     <italic>t</italic>),
     <italic>I</italic>(
     <italic>t</italic>) and 
     <italic>R</italic>(
     <italic>t</italic>) is integer valued; however, they are treated as continuous valued. This slight technical drawback vanishes when the probabilities

     <sup>

     <xref rid="insr12402-disp-0002" ref-type="disp-formula">2</xref>). More importantly, although the dynamic system defined by the SIR model is continuous over time, available surveillance data are reported at discretised measurements over discretised time points. For example, most of the COVID‐19 public databases update data on a daily basis, in which ‘a day’ is the unit of time for measurement. Knowing this discrepancy between the continuous time underlying mechanistic model and the sampling frequency at discrete times for available data is essential to create a statistical framework to link the SIR model with the data at hand.

    <p>The SIR model is deterministic and does not contain any probabilistic components. It is noteworthy that dynamics and stochasticity are two different mathematical properties; a dynamic system (e.g. the SIR model) is not necessarily stochastic, while a stochastic system is not necessarily dynamic. As shown in Figure 
     <xref rid="insr12402-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, the compartment sizes 
     <italic>S</italic>(
     <italic>t</italic>),
     <italic>I</italic>(
     <italic>t</italic>) and 
     <italic>R</italic>(
     <italic>t</italic>) are time‐varying functions with no random fluctuations, which are completely determined by the model parameters and the initial conditions of the SIR model. Obviously, this is a limitation of the SIR model when it is applied for data analysis, where data collection is subject to profuse uncertainties and random errors.

   <def>
    <p>It is easy to show that the number of individuals at risk (in the entry of the system), 
     <italic>S</italic>(
     <italic>t</italic>), is monotonically non‐increasing and that the number of removed cases (at the exit of the system), 
     <italic>R</italic>(
     <italic>t</italic>), is monotonically non‐decreasing (see Figure 
     <xref rid="insr12402-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Hence, the total number of individuals who have been exposed to a virus is equal to 
     <italic>N</italic>−
     <italic>S</italic>(
     <italic>t</italic>)=
     <italic>I</italic>(
     <italic>t</italic>)+
     <italic>R</italic>(
     <italic>t</italic>), which is monotonically non‐decreasing. 
     <italic>I</italic>(
     <italic>t</italic>), the number of active contagious cases, or the difference between the two groups of the exposed cases and the recovered cases, can be either increasing or decreasing. The middle panel of Figure 
     <xref rid="insr12402-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> nicely conveys such directionality of movements, in which the time of 
     <italic>I</italic>(
     <italic>t</italic>) reaching the peak and the time of 
     <italic>I</italic>(
     <italic>t</italic>) reducing to zero are two important turning points of interest in epidemiology. The former indicates the turning point of disease mitigation, and the latter corresponds to the turning point of disease containment.

    <p>It can be shown that 
     <italic>I</italic>(
     <italic>∞</italic>)=0 (or equivalently, 
     <italic>θ</italic>
     <sup>
      <italic>I</italic>
     </sup>(
     <italic>∞</italic>)=0), meaning that the disease will eventually die out. This is because when 
     <italic>t</italic>→
     <italic>∞</italic>, the rate of prevalence 
     <italic>θ</italic>
     <sup>
      <italic>I</italic>
     </sup>(
     <italic>t</italic>), given by (
     <italic>βθ</italic>
     <sup>
      <italic>S</italic>
     </sup>(
     <italic>t</italic>)−
     <italic>γ</italic>) in (
     <xref rid="insr12402-disp-0002" ref-type="disp-formula">2</xref>), will become negative at a certain time and then become more and more negative until converging to zero because 
     <italic>θ</italic>
     <sup>
      <italic>S</italic>
     </sup>(
     <italic>t</italic>) is a decreasing function and 
     <italic>θ</italic>
     <sup>
      <italic>I</italic>
     </sup>(
     <italic>t</italic>) is bounded in the succeeding text by zero. However, this property of decaying to zero is conditional on the assumptions listed earlier. Violation of Assumptions 1 and 3 are most likely to cause a disease to persist because the monotonicity of 
     <italic>S</italic>(
     <italic>t</italic>) used in the earlier argument is no longer valid. An example of such diseases includes seasonal influenza, where immunity does not last long.

   <term>Property 5:</term>
   <def>
    <p>The SIR model has a recursive property in that at any given time, disease progression (i.e. shapes of the three functions) is only dependent on their current values and not on other information from the past. This property of recursion should not be confused with the Markov property that has exclusively used in the literature of stochastic processes under the conditional probability law. Here there is no probability law involved in the recursive operation, which is indeed a fully deterministic recursion. Such conceptual distinction may help understand the differences between dynamics and stochasticity.</p>
