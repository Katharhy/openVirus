<p>As an alternative to a fully non‐parametric function, Wang 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (
 <xref rid="insr12402-bib-0094" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) assume a form 
 <italic>β</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>)=
 <italic>βπ</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>), 0&lt;
 <italic>π</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>) ≤ 1, where 
 <italic>π</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>) is a known function specified according to given control measures. This specification allows to assess the effectiveness of a target preventive measure, as well as to compare different preventive strategies. Clearly, the model with 
 <italic>π</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>)≡1 represents disease progression in the absence of any mitigation effort, which sets up the baseline situation in the policy assessment and comparison. The flexibility in specifying 
 <italic>π</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>) allows easy incorporation of future business reopening events; for example, in the COVID‐19 pandemic, this function may be specified as a U‐shaped curve in that control measures (e.g. social distancing) gradually relax after a certain time point (see more details from Wang 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="insr12402-bib-0094" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>, and some numerical results of the COVID‐19 data analysis). More discussions on the time‐varying transmission rate are given in Section
