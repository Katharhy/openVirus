<p>Given what we said earlier, the current version of SIR is only applicable for diseases, where long‐term immunity can be developed, and does not apply to recurring infectious diseases, such as the common cold. This is because the disease transmission rate is set as a constant in SIR. In this section, we introduce the SIR model in its basic deterministic form (Section 
 <xref rid="insr12402-sec-0006" ref-type="sec">2.1</xref>), define reproduction numbers (Section 
 <xref rid="insr12402-sec-0007" ref-type="sec">2.2</xref>), elaborate its assumptions (Section 
 <xref rid="insr12402-sec-0008" ref-type="sec">2.3</xref>) and properties (Section 
 <xref rid="insr12402-sec-0009" ref-type="sec">2.4</xref>) and present some technical extensions to the basic SIR model. Mechanistic extensions, such as modifications to the three‐compartment SIR model to account for additional components or disease mechanism, are discussed in Section 
 <xref rid="insr12402-sec-0012" ref-type="sec">3</xref>.
