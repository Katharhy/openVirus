<p>The first infectious disease model (McKendrick, 
 <xref rid="insr12402-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">1925</xref>; Kermack &amp; McKendrick, 
 <xref rid="insr12402-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">1927</xref>) is widely known as the Susceptible–Infectious–Removed model, or in short the SIR model (see Figure 
 <xref rid="insr12402-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). It is a three‐compartment model for studying how infectious diseases evolve over time on the population level. It defines a mechanism of disease transmission and recovery for a population at risk by a dynamic system of three disjoint states: susceptible, infectious and removed. We note an important distinction between infectious and infected individuals. Infectious individuals are those who are currently infected and not yet recovered or dead (currently infected individuals become infectious immediately in the SIR model, although it may not be true in reality; see the SEIR model in Section 
 <xref rid="insr12402-sec-0012" ref-type="sec">3</xref> where currently infected individuals become infectious with a delay in time), whereas infected individuals could mean only currently infected or both currently and previously infected. For clarity, we will refer to currently infected as infectious so that the three states in the SIR model are mutually exclusive. Individuals in the susceptible state are not immunised and can become infected by coming into contact with infectious cases, so they are at risk at a given time. Individuals in the infectious state contribute to the transmission of the disease until they ultimately recover or die, so they are contagious. Individuals in the removed state include those who either recover or die (without distinction). This is an exit from the infection system, meaning that once an individual leaves this system (recovers or dies), he or she would never return to the system. This is true for people who die from the virus but may not be the case for recovered individuals. Thus, in the SIR model, there is a technical assumption that a recovered individual would become self‐immunised to the virus and no longer impact the disease transmission. A possible way to relax this assumption is to create two separate compartments corresponding to recovery and death states, respectively, leading to a four‐compartment infectious disease model. To make our presentation focused on the basic three‐compartment model, we make this self‐immunisation assumption in this section.
