<p>In the second part of the paper, we introduce a class of micromodels. When an epidemic continues, data become abundant and of high resolution at community level. For example, the surveillance data of the COVID‐19 pandemic in the USA are collected from individual counties. This allows building county‐level microinfectious models in addition to country‐level or state‐level macromodels. Being a certain subgroup analysis, such micromodelling is appealing to address spatial heterogeneity across the more than 3 000 counties in the USA and consequently improves the prediction accuracy. As far as the spatial modelling of infection dynamics concerns, we review the classical cellular automata (CA) that is extensively used to describe person‐to‐person interacting rules associated with epidemic spreading patterns in a population via relevant interlocation connectivity functions. This CA may vary spatially and temporally, which presents a principled way to extend a state‐level macroinfectious disease model to a stratified microinfectious model. In addition to the case of geographical subgroups, other types of subgroups by, for example, age, race, income, political party and economy, are also of interest.</p>
