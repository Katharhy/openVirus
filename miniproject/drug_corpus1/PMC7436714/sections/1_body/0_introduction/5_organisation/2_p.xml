<p>The main focus of this paper will be given to a statistical modelling framework based on a class of state‐space models, in which the systematic component is specified by multi‐compartment infectious disease models while the random component is governed by a certain sampling distribution of surveillance data. Note that multi‐compartment infectious disease models present a class of classical mechanistic models widely used in practice and that incorporating certain sampling distributions allows to make statistical estimation, inference and prediction with quantification of uncertainties. We organise the paper as follows.</p>
