<p>In the first part of the paper, we introduce a class of macromodels. We begin with the most basic SIR mechanistic model in details, followed by some important extensions used to address representative scenarios of disease spread and infection evolution. Examples include SEIR model with an additional compartment of exposure accounting for potential incubation period of infection and Susceptible–Antibody–Infectious–Removed (SAIR) model with an additional compartment of antibody accounting for potential self‐immunisation after being infected. Then, we formally introduce the framework of state‐space models, a powerful statistical modelling approach that aims to model available surveillance data from public health databases with the utility of the underlying latent mechanistic model.</p>
