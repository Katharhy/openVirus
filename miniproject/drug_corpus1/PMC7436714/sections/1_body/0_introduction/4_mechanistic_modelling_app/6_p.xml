<p>As shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="insr12402-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, on each of these 100 days, the sum of the three values from the three curves is always equal to 100, presenting a time‐varying redistribution of the 100 individuals. With no control measures in this hypothetical infection dynamics, the susceptible compartment quickly drops and reaches an equilibrium state after 35 days of the outbreak, and during the period of first 35 days, the infectious compartment increases to a peak and then decreases to zero (no contagious individuals in the population) as all currently infected individuals move to the removed compartment, which is the exit of the system.
