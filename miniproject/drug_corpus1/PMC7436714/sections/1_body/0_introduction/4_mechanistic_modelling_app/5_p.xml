  <label>Example 1</label>
  <p>Consider the SIR model for a hypothetical population with a constant population of 
   <italic>N</italic>=100 residents and an initial condition of 99 susceptible individuals, 1 infectious individual and 0 individual removed (either died or recovered). Here 100 subjects may be also regarded as 100% if the unit of proportion is used in the interpretation. The transitions between compartments, written in ODEs as in (
   <xref rid="insr12402-disp-0001" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>), represent population movement from one compartment to another (see Figure 
   <xref rid="insr12402-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We consider an example with 
   <italic>β</italic>=0.5 (a rate of moving from S to I) and 
   <italic>γ</italic>=0.2 (a rate of moving from I to R), leading to 
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sub>0</sub>=
   <italic>β</italic>/
   <italic>γ</italic>=2.5. Here 
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sub>0</sub> is the so‐called basic reproduction number that quantifies an average number of susceptible individuals contracting a virus from one contagious person in an environment of no preventive measures. This is a quite infectious scenario as we will see later. The 
   <sc>r</sc> script in the succeeding text shows a scenario of obtaining the solution to the system of ODEs by standard ODE solvers (
   <sc>r</sc> package 
   <monospace>deSolve</monospace>) using the first‐order Euler method (not shown) or the Runge–Kutta fourth‐order (RK4) approximation method (Figure 
   <xref rid="insr12402-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Details about the RK4 method can be found in Appendix
