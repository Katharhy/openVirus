<p>Often times, the interest for such system lies in the function values over time, but the closed‐form analytical solution for such functions may not exist. For example, to answer the question of how many individuals will be infected with the COVID‐19 by the end of the year 2020 (or any future time) requires to know a calculator that computes the cumulative numbers of susceptible, infected and removed cases over time from the past to the future. Unfortunately, in reality, functions relevant to this calculator are usually non‐linear, and their exact forms are difficult to directly specify. In contrast, a set of ODEs helps better understand the disease transmission dynamics (i.e. traits of infectious diseases) and more conveniently captures their key features, where each ODE may correspond to one mode of disease evolution. Such ODEs for disease spread may be regarded as a model for the expected dynamic mechanism, serving as a systematic component in a statistical model. Numerical methods such as the Euler discretisation method or the Runge–Kutta approximation method (Stoer &amp; Bulirsch,

 <xref rid="insr12402-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) can be used to obtain approximate solutions of such ODEs with given boundary conditions. Regardless of methods used, solutions to a dynamic system are deterministic functions. We illustrate a basic mechanistic model of disease spread in the succeeding text. Additional review from deterministic and mathematical perspectives of multi‐compartment models is given by Anderson
