<p>Despite relying on a valid infectious diseases mechanism, deterministic approaches have several drawbacks: (i) the actual population in each compartment at a given time is never accurately measured because we only obtain an observation around the mean; (ii) the nature of disease transmission and recovery is stochastic on the individual level and thus never certain; and (iii) without random component in the model, it is neither possible to learn model parameters (e.g.

 <sub>0</sub>) from available data nor to assess prediction uncertainty. The latter is of critical importance given many unobserved and uncontrolled factors in surveillance data collection. In an early stage of the current COVID‐19 pandemic, the daily infection and death counts reported by health agencies are highly influenced by the availability of testing kits, reporting delays, reporting and attribution schemes, and under‐ascertainment of mild cases in public health surveillance databases (see discussions in Angelopoulos

 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="insr12402-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>); both disease transmission rate and time to recovery or death are also highly uncertain and vary by population density, demographic composition, regional contact network structure and non‐uniform mitigation schemes (Ray 
 <italic>et al.</italic>,
