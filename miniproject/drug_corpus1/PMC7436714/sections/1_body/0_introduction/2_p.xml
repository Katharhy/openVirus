 <xref rid="insr12402-bib-0098" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), has become a global pandemic that has spread swiftly across the world since its original outbreak in Hubei, China, in December 2020. As of 27 June 2020, this pandemic has caused a total of 9 801 572 confirmed cases and 494 181 fatalities in more than 200 countries. Being one of the most lethal communicable infectious diseases in human history, it is expected that the COVID‐19 pandemic will continue spreading in the world population, causing even higher numbers of infections and deaths in the future. With no effective medical treatments or vaccines currently available, public health interventions such as social distancing have been implemented in most of the countries to mitigate the spread of the pandemic. One of the central tasks of statistical modelling is to provide a suitable risk prediction model that enables both government and public health workers to evaluate the effectiveness of public health policies and predict risk of COVID‐19 infection at the national and regional levels. Such information is valuable for governments to assess the preparedness of medical resources (personal protective equipments and intensive care unit beds), to adjust various intervention policies and to enforce the operation of social distancing.
