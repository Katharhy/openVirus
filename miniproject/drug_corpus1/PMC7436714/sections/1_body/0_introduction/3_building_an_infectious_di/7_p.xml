<p>Last, to make research findings transparent and to place resulting toolboxes into the hands of practitioners, an open‐source software package must be a deliverable. This is indeed a rather demanding task, as the ease of implementation and numerical stability impact the choice of statistical models and statistical methods for estimation and prediction. Note that not every statistical model permits delivery of a user‐friendly computing package that is general and flexible enough to handle various types of data. In this paper, we focus on the discussion of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods that have been developed in the literature to perform estimation and prediction for state‐space models (Section
