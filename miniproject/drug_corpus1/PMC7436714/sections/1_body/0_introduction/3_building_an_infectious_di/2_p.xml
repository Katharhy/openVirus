<p>Modelling for infectious diseases has a profound role in informing public health policy across the world (Heesterbeek

The outbreak of the COVID‐19 pandemic in December 2019 has led to a surge of interest in disease projection that ubiquitously relies on mathematical and statistical models. A crucial step in modelling disease evolution is to capture key dynamics of the underlying disease transmission mechanisms from available public health surveillance data, which enables reliable projection of disease infection into the future. A prediction model may help us foresee some possible future epidemic/pandemic scenarios and learn consequent impacts of current economic and personal sacrifices due to various control measures.
