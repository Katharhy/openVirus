<p>Because of both data quality and data limitations from public surveillance data systems, a statistical model should take the following features into account in its design and development. First, a statistical model should be able to make predictions and, more importantly, to quantify prediction uncertainties. Forecasting is known to be a notoriously hard task, which depends heavily on the quality of data at hand and a certain model chosen to summarise the information from observed data and then to reproduce information beyond the observational time period. The chosen model is of critical importance to deliver prediction. This paper concerns a review of the family of classical compartment‐based infectious disease models, which have been the most widely used mechanistic models to capture key features of infection dynamics. We begin with the most basic 
 <italic>Susceptible–Infectious–Removed (SIR) model</italic> to build up the framework (Section 
 <xref rid="insr12402-sec-0005" ref-type="sec">2</xref>), and this three‐compartment model is then generalised to have more compartments to embrace additional features of infection dynamics (Section 
 <xref rid="insr12402-sec-0012" ref-type="sec">3</xref>), such as the well‐known four‐compartment model, 
 <italic>Susceptible–Exposed–Infectious–Removed (SEIR) model</italic>, which takes the incubation period of contagion into account. Given many types of factors potentially influencing the evolution of an epidemic, a single prediction value is insufficient to be trustworthy unless prediction uncertainty is reported as part of forecast analysis. Quantification of prediction uncertainty is of critical importance, especially when a forecast is made at an early phase of an epidemic with limited data. Building sampling variations in infectious disease models makes a statistical modelling approach different from a mathematical modelling approach. A clear advantage of a statistical model is that the model parameters, including those in the mechanistic model, can be estimated, rather than being specified by certain subjectively chosen prior information.
