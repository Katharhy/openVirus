<p>Second, the consideration of building sampling uncertainties in the modelling of infectious disease is a fundamental difference of a statistical modelling approach from a mechanistic modelling approach known in the mathematical literature of dynamic systems. A mechanistic model is typically governed by a system of ordinary differential equations, such as the existing three‐compartment SIR model consisting of three differential equations, which explicitly specifies the underlying mechanisms of an epidemic. This model is assumed to govern an operational system of disease contagion and recovery or death, which, in reality, cannot be directly observed. Most of the time, public surveillance data are accessible, which represent only a few snapshots of the underlying latent mechanistic system of an epidemic. Such gaps may be addressed by a statistical model that incorporates sampling schemes to explain how observed data are collected from the underlying infection dynamics. In turn, prediction uncertainty will reflect forms and procedures of the chosen sampling schemes specified in the statistical model. In this paper (Section 
 <xref rid="insr12402-sec-0024" ref-type="sec">5.1</xref>), we will introduce the state‐space model as a natural and effective modelling framework to integrate the mechanistic model and sampling schemes seamlessly.
