<p>Fourth, as the epidemic evolves further, surveillance data become abundant and have higher resolution. For example, in the USA, the numbers of confirmed symptomatic COVID‐19 cases and case fatalities are recorded for each county. The average county population size in the USA is approximately 98 000, so a microinfectious model may be built upon county‐level surveillance data to make high‐resolution prediction and to assess the effectiveness of control measures at a community level. This paper (Section 
 <xref rid="insr12402-sec-0032" ref-type="sec">6</xref>) will discuss this important extension of the classical SIR model, essentially a temporal model, to a spatio‐temporal model that enables borrowing of information from different spatially correlated counties in the improvement of risk prediction. This exemplary model generalisation sets up an illustration from a nation‐level macromodel to a county‐level micromodel. The latter is more relevant and useful for local governments to make decisions of business reopenings and for residents to be aware of local infection risk.
