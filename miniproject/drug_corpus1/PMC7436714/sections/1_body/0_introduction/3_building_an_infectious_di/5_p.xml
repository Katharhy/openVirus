<p>Third, given the scarcity of the available data in public health surveillance systems, the complexity of a model used for prediction should be aligned with the issue of parameter identifiability. For example, at the beginning of an outbreak, one should consider a simple model, which may be expanded over the course of an epidemic's evolution with increased data availability. To make the specified model useful to answer a certain question of practical importance, a relevant feature should be included in the model building. For example, in the study of control measures to mitigate the COVID‐19 spread, the model specification should incorporate a structure that is sensitive to the influence of a preventive policy. In Section 
 <xref rid="insr12402-sec-0025" ref-type="sec">5.2</xref>, we will introduce an expansion of the basic SIR model in that time‐varying control measures are allowed to enter. The flexibility of permitting certain modifications is an important property of a model to be considered in an infectious disease model. In this field, all models need to be tailored with increased data and more knowledge from the literature as a disease evolves over time. From this point of view, compartment‐based models are superior to other models because, for example, it is easy to add other compartments, such as an exposure compartment, a quarantine compartment or a self‐immunisation compartment, to improve the mechanistic model, to answer specific question of practical importance and to capture distinctive data features for better prediction.
