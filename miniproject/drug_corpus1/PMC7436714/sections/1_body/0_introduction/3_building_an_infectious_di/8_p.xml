<p>In this paper, we invite the readers on a journey of surveillance data, modelling, estimation and prediction, implementation and software development. After reading this paper, one should be able to use existing compartment‚Äêbased models or to expand them in a study of an infectious disease epidemic, to improve estimation and/or prediction methods, or create one's own software. It is our hope that this paper may pave the path to learning, practising or developing new methodologies that are useful for a broader range of infectious disease modelling problems.</p>
