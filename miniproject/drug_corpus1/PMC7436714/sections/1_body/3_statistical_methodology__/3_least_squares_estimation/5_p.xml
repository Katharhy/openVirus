<p>Being often used as a classic textbook example, this least squares approach is equivalent to the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) under the assumption that measurement errors are independent and normally distributed with a homogeneous variance. In general, this approach gives consistent estimation and does not require a distributional assumption for the data generation and thus can be applicable to non‐normal data. However, the ordinary least squares loss used in the earlier example assumes that data are independently sampled over time, which is not true because the observations are time series and are thus temporally correlated. Because of this, the least squares estimation is not efficient. Cintrón‐Arias 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (
