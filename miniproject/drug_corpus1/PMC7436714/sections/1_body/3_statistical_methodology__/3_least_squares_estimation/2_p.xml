<p>In the SIR model (
 <xref rid="insr12402-disp-0001" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>), the transmission rate 
 <italic>β</italic> and recovery rate 
 <italic>γ</italic> are two target parameters of interest. Estimation of 
 <italic>β</italic> and 
 <italic>γ</italic> can be carried out through optimisation in search for a model that best fits to the data. A commonly used minimisation criterion is the least squares loss. Given 
 <italic>β</italic> and 
 <italic>γ</italic>, numerical approximations (e.g. Runge–Kutta methods) can be used to solve for the trajectories, 
 <italic>S</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>),
 <italic>I</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>) and 
 <italic>R</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>). These expected trajectories are then compared with the observed trajectories to compute a discrepancy score, such as the sum (over time) of the squared errors, represented as a loss function of target parameters. Now, it remains to find the estimates of these parameters that give rise to the curve that best fits the data through standard optimisation tools. In this case, the optimisation pertains to a two‐dimensional search, which should be computationally straightforward. Even a greedy search is computationally cheap. We illustrate using both simulated data and real data in Examples
