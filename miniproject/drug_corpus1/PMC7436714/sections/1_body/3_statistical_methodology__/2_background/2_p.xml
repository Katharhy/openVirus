<p>This section mainly focuses on an introduction of statistical models to analyse surveillance data of an epidemic. Each statistical model consists of two components: a systematic component and a random component. In the context of infectious disease data analysis, the former may be specified by a dynamic infectious disease model from Sections 
 <xref rid="insr12402-sec-0005" ref-type="sec">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="insr12402-sec-0012" ref-type="sec">3</xref>. The latter is built upon a random sampling scheme that enables a stochastic extension of the mechanistic model (e.g. SIR model) given in the systematic component. Essentially, the notions about disease transmission, recovery or other characteristics are used to define key population attributes or parameters in an infection dynamic system of interest, which will be estimated by available data via a statistical modelling framework, where some covariates may be incorporated to learn some subgroup‐specific risk profiles.
