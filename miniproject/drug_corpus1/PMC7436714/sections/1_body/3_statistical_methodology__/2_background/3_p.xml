<p>A clear advantage of statistical and stochastic extensions is the ability to quantify uncertainty in both estimation and prediction in connection to sampling variability. This added uncertainty is crucial to policymaking as models not only generate an average estimation or prediction but also present the best and worst possible scenarios for more robust and confident handling of epidemics, given that surveillance data are subject to various issues in the data collection. An example presented in Britton (
 <xref rid="insr12402-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>) vividly shows the uncertainty in the progression of an infectious disease. Consider patient zero, who will go on and infect

 <sub>0</sub> number of other individuals, as defined by a certain disease mechanism. The number of individuals who contract the virus from this patient is in fact stochastic, varying around the expected number of infections

 <sub>0</sub>, which could be described by a distribution (e.g. Poisson or negative binomial) with mean 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> on the support of non‐negative integers. With a non‐zero probability of taking the value zero due to the variability in human activities, there is a non‐negligible chance that an epidemic is completely averted. The opposite could be an outbreak with a non‐zero probability that infects tens of thousands of people. Without modelling such uncertainty, we cannot see all these possibilities and associated likelihoods of their occurrences during the course of an epidemic (Roberts 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="insr12402-bib-0076" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Infectious disease systems governed by the class of multi‐compartment models, though describing the population average, are useful to describe individual‐based stochastic processes if certain random components are introduced into the modelling framework. Thus, the resulting statistical models present more natural approaches to the analysis of surveillance infectious disease data.
