<p>Because of the issue of parameter identifiability in some mechanistic models, specifying hyperparameters in the model fitting is inevitable. However, holding hyperparameters fixed at certain values according to some external data sources is indeed controversial, and the validity of consequent analyses is highly dependent on the appropriateness of these certain 
 <italic>prior</italic> values. To relax this technical weakness, later in SectionÂ 
 <xref rid="insr12402-sec-0023" ref-type="sec">5</xref>, we introduce a Bayesian framework in which such prior information (e.g. hyperparameters) enters the statistical model via certain prior distributions rather fixed values, so that the uncertainty on those hyperparameters is adaptively compensated with the amount and quality of observed surveillance data. Such flexibility has a great advantage in synthesising prior evidence and observed data.
