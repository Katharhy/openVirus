<p>To present this section at a reasonable technical level, most of the discussions in the succeeding text are given in the setting of the basic SIR model, and generalisation to other compartment models should follow with slight modification. In closing, it is noteworthy that the frequentist statistical methods discussed in the succeeding text are based on a fundamental assumption of data collection; that is, the population‚Äêlevel compartment data 
 <italic>S</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>), 
 <italic>I</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>) and 
 <italic>R</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>), and others if relevant, can be directly collected from the study population. In other words, at given time, every individual in the population can be observed directly for his or her current status of being susceptible, infectious, recovered or died. This is practically impossible. Thus, the interpretation of the estimation results should be carried out with caution.
