<p>The outreach large‐sample theory for the MLE with discrete time series data provides a statistical inference relevant to most of infectious disease applications. As an epidemic evolves, the number of equally spaced time points (say, daily) for data collection increases. When sampling errors in both 
 <italic>I</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>) and 
 <italic>S</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>) are allowed, the likelihood earlier is indeed a kind of conditional composite likelihood (Varin 
 <italic>et al.</italic>,

Thus, the standard theory of composite likelihood estimation implies that the asymptotic covariance of the estimator is given by the inverse Godambe information matrix (or a sandwich estimator). The sensitivity matrix in the Godambe information is hard to obtain analytically because of the serial dependence in the time series. Instead, one may take a non‐parametric bootstrap approach similar to that considered by Gao and Song (
