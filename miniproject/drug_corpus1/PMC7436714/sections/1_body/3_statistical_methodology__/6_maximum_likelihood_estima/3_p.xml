<p>There are two types of statistical inference theory considered in this context, namely, the infill asymptotic theory and the outreach asymptotic theory. The former pertains to the situation where the sampling points increase within a fixed time window (i.e. fixed 
 <italic>T</italic>), while the latter is a situation of practical relevance where the time window of the data collection tends to infinity (i.e. 
 <italic>T</italic>→
 <italic>∞</italic>). Britton 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (
 <xref rid="insr12402-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>) discuss the infill large‐sample properties under the assumption that the complete epidemic data, that is, continuously observed counting processes (
 <italic>S</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>),
 <italic>I</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>))
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>∈[0,
  <italic>T</italic>]
 </sub>, are available. Under such setting, the asymptotic distribution of the MLE based on continuously observed trajectories is established. Obviously, it is really rare in practice to collect infectious disease data via such infill sampling schemes. Nevertheless, for the sake of theoretical interest, we refer readers to Britton 
 <italic>et al.</italic>(
