<p>Conditional independence is a strong assumption for mathematical convenience in the MLE. Relaxing it has drawn some attention in the literature. For example, Lekone and Finkenstädt (

 <xref rid="insr12402-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>) construct likelihood‐based approaches using discrete time Markov chain SEIR models; Becker (
 <xref rid="insr12402-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">1977</xref>) and Becker and Britton (
 <xref rid="insr12402-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>) consider the MLE in the SIR model using martingale methods when all transition events for each individual are observed. It is however unlikely that such individual‐level details are observed in most surveillance data used for modelling of infectious disease mechanisms. Estimators using less detailed data have been proposed (e.g. Becker,
