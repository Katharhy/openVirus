<p>As part of efforts on further relaxing strong conditions in the earlier stochastic SIR model (

 <xref rid="insr12402-sec-0024" ref-type="sec">5.1</xref>, we review a state‐space modelling approach that generalises the current likelihood model and estimation framework, where 
 <italic>S</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>), 
 <italic>I</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>) and 
 <italic>R</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>) are not directly measured and rather treated as Markov latent processes. Also, hyperparameters are included via their prior distributions instead of fixed values, and a Bayesian estimation similar to the MLE is established through the MCMC approach. This class of state‐space models is so far one of the most flexible statistical modelling frameworks to analyse infectious disease data.
