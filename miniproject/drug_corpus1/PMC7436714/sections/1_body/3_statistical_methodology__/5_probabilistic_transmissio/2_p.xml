<p>In both the least squares estimation and method of moments estimation, there are no explicit assumptions about probability laws for data sampling. Implicitly, both methods are based on the sampling scheme on the entire population; that is, the current status of every individual in the study population is recorded. This is certainly not true in practice. To overcome this, some estimation methods are proposed to account for sampling variability under certain parametric distributions. Distribution assumptions can be made for many quantities in an infectious disease model. Some are fully specified based on given knowledge. For example, the distribution of incubation period of a disease can be represented as a probability mass function by days (Lauer
