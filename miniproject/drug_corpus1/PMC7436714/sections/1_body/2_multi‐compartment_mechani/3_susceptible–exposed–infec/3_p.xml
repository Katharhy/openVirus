<p>Technically, the SEIR model often suffers from the issue of parameter identifiability because determining a correct incubation period of an infectious disease and thus the parameter 
 <italic>δ</italic> is a rather difficult task in practice. First, incubation period varies from one person to another; in the case of COVID‐19, the incubation period ranges from 0 to 15 days, with a median of 5.1 days (Lauer 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="insr12402-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). In another study of COVID‐19 patients in China, Guan 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (
 <xref rid="insr12402-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) have reported that the estimated incubation period is between 0 to 24 days with a median of 3 days. It is clear that this quantity is very person dependent. Second, ascertainment of contagion may be largely delayed because of shortage of virus testing sources. This length‐biased sampling problem is notoriously challenging for the estimation of the incubation period (Qin 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="insr12402-bib-0072" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Third, in the literature (e.g. He 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="insr12402-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) researchers found that COVID‐19 carriers tend to be more contagious right after contracting the coronavirus than a week later because they are not self‐quarantined in the absence of clinical symptoms. In other words, in the case of the COVID‐19, the incubation period (or sojourn at exposed state) is too short to play a substantial role in the modelling of the pandemic.
