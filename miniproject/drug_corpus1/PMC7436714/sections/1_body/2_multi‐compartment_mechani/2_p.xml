<p>In this section, we review several four‐compartment mechanistic models as extensions of the basic SIR model introduced in Section 
 <xref rid="insr12402-sec-0005" ref-type="sec">2</xref>. Being a simple version of a mechanistic model with three compartments, the SIR model has some limitations in real‐world applications. Thus, extensions of this basic type to account for different disease mechanisms and assumptions have been widely considered in the literature.
