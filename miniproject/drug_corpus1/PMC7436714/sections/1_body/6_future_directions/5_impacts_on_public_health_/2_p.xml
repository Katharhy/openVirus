<p>Most investigation efforts made by quantitative researchers have been relatively independent in an academic setting, and it is high time that policymakers and stakeholders are involved and play an active role in such modelling efforts. Long‐term projection of the COVID‐19 is most sensitive to and highly dependent on public health policy. A major source of uncertainty is due to the conflicting demands between public health (disease mitigation) and the need to sustain economic growth (livelihood), and the balance of the two is a moving target. One way to account for the modelling uncertainty is to factor in economic planning as a time‐varying modifier of projection models. Although some efforts have been made to incorporate economical data, most are retrospectively oriented, and we believe more efforts should be spent to prospectively incorporate expert inputs and economic forecasts. This is a research area of great importance worth serious exploration.</p>
