<p>We like to close this review paper by casting a few open questions of great interest to the public (at least to ourselves) that statisticians may help deliver answers with existing or new data to be collected by innovative study designs. We also hope that these questions motivate new methodological developments. 
 <def-list list-type="simple">

   <term>Question 1:</term>
   <def>
    <p>How would researchers assess both timing and strength of the second wave of the COVID‐19 pandemic? Is the second wave worse than the first one? Answers to these questions need a relatively accurate long‐term prediction of the infection dynamics. Among so many different statistical models being able to predict future spreading patterns, we need to identify few ones or their combinations that are particularly useful to make long‐term predictions.</p>

   <term>Question 2:</term>
   <def>
    <p>As many countries and regions started to reopen business, how would government monitor the likelihood of a recurring surge of COVID‐19 caused by business reopenings? Does the social distancing measure help reduce a potentially rising risk? Answers to these questions require adequate data that may not be easily collected by routine approaches. Statisticians may work with practitioners to develop good sampling instruments and schemes for community risk surveillance.</p>

   <term>Question 3:</term>
   <def>
    <p>Is face mask protective? If so, how to assess the compliance of face mask wearing? Questions about the causal effect of face mask wearing on disease progression are very challenging. This is because there is no randomisation in the intervention allocation and many confounding factors are unobserved.</p>

   <term>Question 4:</term>
   <def>
    <p>Is there evidence that the contagion of the coronavirus decays over time because of an increasing recovery rate of virus carriers and a decreasing rate of case fatality? Statisticians ought to work out some thoughtful and convincing answers to the public.</p>
