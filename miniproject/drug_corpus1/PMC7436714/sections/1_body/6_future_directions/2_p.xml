<p>In this paper, we have presented the basics of multi‐compartment infectious disease models from both deterministic and stochastic perspectives. We emphasise on the probabilistic extension of mechanistic models, which opens the door to a suite of statistical modelling techniques while still preserving the infectious disease dynamics in multi‐compartment models. Within the stochastic modelling framework, both the frequentist and the Bayesian schools of modelling considerations and statistical methods are visited, along with high‐level review and illustrative examples. Epidemic models have played a key role in the past century to provide understanding of past and ongoing infectious diseases, and it is our belief that they will continually be valued and be improved to help us better understand the current COVID‐19 pandemic as well as future infectious diseases. We conclude with several remarks on future directions of stochastic infectious disease modelling.</p>
