<p>Given that model projections for the COVID‐19 pandemic have been changing dramatically from day to day primarily because the underlying models are changing, the primary aim may be set at optimising prediction models for nowcasting or short‐term projections and be aware of the probable worst case scenarios for longer‐term trends. As shown in the data example in Section 
 <xref rid="insr12402-sec-0037" ref-type="sec">6.5</xref>, the optimal tuning parameter is determined by the minimal short‐term 1‐day ahead prediction error. As pointed out by Huppert and Katriel (
 <xref rid="insr12402-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>), transmission models with different underlying mechanisms may lead to similar outcome in one context (e.g. short term) but fail to do so in another (e.g. long term). The further we project, the more we are uncertain about the validity of model assumptions. Hence, extra caution is needed when reporting and interpreting long‐term projection results. With the available surveillance data, making a nowcast of infection risk in next few hours is difficult; but it may become feasible when certain data sources of local information are accessible, such as electronic health records from local hospitals, viral testing results from local testing centres and mobile tracking data from individual cell phones. This requires a finer‐resolution prediction machinery that may be established by generalising the CA to certain spatial point processes. Despite being challenging, such prediction paradigm would be very useful and worth a serious exploration.
