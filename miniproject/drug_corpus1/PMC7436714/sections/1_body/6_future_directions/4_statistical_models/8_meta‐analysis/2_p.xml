<p>For a global pandemic such as the COVID‐19 that affects over 200 countries in the world, an integrative analysis is appealing to understand common features of the pandemic so to learn different control measures. Given the fact that a pandemic evolves typically in a certain time lag, experiences from countries with earlier outbreaks may be shared with countries with later outbreaks, where statistical methods may borrow relevant information to set up prior distributions in the model fitting. For example, the estimated reproduction number estimated from the European COVID‐19 data may be a hyperparameter in the statistical analysis of the US COVID‐19 data. There is a clear need of more comprehensive meta‐analysis methods to better integrate data from different countries than using the data to create hyperparameters. Along this line, one of the earliest attempts is to combine COVID‐19 forecasts from various research teams using ensemble learning (see, e.g.
