<p>Because of the potential bias in surveillance data, either delayed reporting of infected case or inaccurate ascertainment of death caused by a virus, there are many measurement errors in data. This calls for statistical methods that can directly handle various data collection biases or are robust to such biases. There is little work performed in this important field of statistical modelling and analyses.</p>
