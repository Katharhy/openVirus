<p>A major weakness noted for the existing mechanistic models is the inflexibility of adding individual or subgroup covariates (e.g. age and race). The current strategy of handling these extra variables is via stratification, which would end up with strata with small sample sizes, so that subsequent statistical analyses lose power in both estimation and prediction of infection dynamics. An extension from the CA seems promising as the CA presents a system of particles distributed in different cells (or strata), where individual characterisations on particles may be added via covariates. The resulting model would assess and predict personal risk, as well as identify hotspots of new infection. This is worth serious exploration in the future with appropriate data available (e.g. electronic health records from hospitals).</p>
