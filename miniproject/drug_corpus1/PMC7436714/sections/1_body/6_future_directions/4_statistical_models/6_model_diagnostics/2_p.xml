<p>In the current literature, model diagnostics for infectious disease models are largely lacking. Given that most of the existing mechanistic models are based on certain parametric distributions (e.g. Poisson processes), checking model assumptions is required. For example, for the proposed Poisson process, the assumption of incremental independence and overdispersion should be checked. In addition, procedures of validating prediction accuracy are also important in which the choice of test data is tricky and needs to be guided by some objective criteria.</p>
