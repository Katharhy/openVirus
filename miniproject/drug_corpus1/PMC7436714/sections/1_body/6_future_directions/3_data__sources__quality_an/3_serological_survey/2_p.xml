<p>The population of self‐immunised individuals is a significant source of bias in COVID‐19 surveillance data; they have never been captured by public health monitoring systems. According to survey results (New York State Report, 
 <xref rid="insr12402-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), 20% of individuals in the city of New York have been tested antibody positive to the coronavirus. This simply means that a nationwide serological survey is a must in order to come up with an appropriate assessment for the underlying epidemiological features of the COVID‐19 pandemic in the USA. The design of this nationwide serological survey is a challenging statistical problem. Solving it requires some innovative ideas and methods; for example, a cost‐effective design of pooling several serum samples to perform a pooled test (e.g. Gollier &amp; Gossner,
