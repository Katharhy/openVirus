<p>Large‐scale tracking data have played an important role in evaluating the effectiveness of social distancing in communities. The precision of intervention efficacy helps improve both estimation and prediction that directly impact government's decisions on tightening, extending or lifting control measures. One emerging data source pertains to the information of real‐time cell phone locations, which allows better contact tracing so that individual data sequences can be recovered and used for modelling of personal risk and regional hotspots. A research group in the University of Maryland (
