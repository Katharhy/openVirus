<p>Although publicly available surveillance data are useful to build preliminary models for the understanding of spreading patterns of infectious diseases, their data quality in terms of measurement biases and under‐reporting has been known an outstanding issue that significantly impacts the validity of statistical analysis results (Angelopoulos 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="insr12402-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). This is indeed an open problem to date with no appropriate solutions yet. With no insurance of reliable data, statistical methods, regardless of macromodels or micromodels, would fail to produce meaningful results. One potentially promising solution to such a fundamental concern is to build reliable and well‐validated open‐source benchmark databases that include not only traditional surveillance data but also personal clinical data from various sources such as hospital electronic health records, drug trials and vaccine trials. In addition, data from serological surveys and data from mobile devices or as such are also useful to increase information resolution and reliability, to remove major measurement biases and to calibrate data analytics. This task requires also efforts of data integration and international collaborations. Research on the COVID‐19 pandemic certainly gives rise to a new opportunity of developing data integration methods to not only address challenges of data multi‐modality but also overcome many data‐sharing barriers and data confidentiality concerns.
