<p>In the modelling of influenza A viral infections, Beauchemin 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (
 <xref rid="insr12402-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>) use a simple two‐dimensional CA model to investigate the influence of spatial heterogeneity on viral kinetics. Their study population consists of two types of cell species, the epithelial cells and the immune cells. The epithelial cells are the target of viral infection, and the immune cells are those fighting the infection. The CA model is built upon a two‐dimensional square lattice with the Moore neighbourhood (see Figure 
 <xref rid="insr12402-fig-0013" ref-type="fig">13(B)</xref>), where the condition of a certain cell will only be influenced by the eight closest cells around it. The set of states for the epithelial cells include healthy, infected, expressing, infectious or dead, while an immune cell can be in any of two states: virgin or mature. Decision rules of updating the CA system are governed by parameters, such as INFECT_RATE that models the probability of a healthy epithelial cell being infected by contacting each infectious nearest neighbour. Detailed updating functions are discussed in Beauchemin 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (
 <xref rid="insr12402-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). Simulations show that the proposed CA model is sophisticated enough to reproduce the basic dynamic features of the cell‐to‐cell infection.
