<p>Different from the modelling of the influenza A viral infection earlier, Fuks and Lawniczak (
 <xref rid="insr12402-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>) propose a lattice gas CA that is closely connected to an SIR framework of an epidemic, where the interacting patterns of individuals are modelled. It is assumed that the status of individuals will change between three types, susceptible, infectious and recovered, denoted as {
 <italic>S</italic>,
 <italic>I</italic>,
 <italic>R</italic>}. The space where the epidemic takes place is set as a group of regular hexagonal cells, in which the individuals are located at the centre of each cell and can move through a channel that is created by connecting two centres of adjacent cells. The evolution of the CA occurs at discrete time steps under the operation of three basic functions, including contact 
 <italic>C</italic>, randomisation 
 <italic>R</italic> and propagation 
 <italic>P</italic>. With the application of function 
 <italic>C</italic>, an individual who is susceptible can become infected with probability

 <italic>β</italic> is the transmission rate and

 <sub>
  <italic>I</italic>
 </sub> is the number of infectious individuals within the same cell. Meanwhile, an individual who is infectious can recover with probability 
 <italic>γ</italic>, where 
 <italic>γ</italic> is the recovery rate. The function 
 <italic>R</italic> randomly assigns individuals in each cell to move through the channels, which contributes to modelling the mixing process of individuals. In the final propagation step, individuals simultaneously move to the cells that they are randomly assigned to by 
 <italic>R</italic>. In addition to the basic epidemic dynamics modelled by the proposed lattice gas CA, Fuks and Lawniczak (
 <xref rid="insr12402-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>) also study the effect of heterogeneous spatial distribution of individuals with states S, I and R and the influence of different types of barriers in controlling the spread of an epidemic.
