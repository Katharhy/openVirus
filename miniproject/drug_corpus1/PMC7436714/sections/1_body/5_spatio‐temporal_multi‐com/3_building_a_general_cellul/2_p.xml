<p>When applied to model spatial variations of epidemic spread, CA has three distinctive features: (i) it treats individuals as discrete entities in order to study person‐level movements in the infection dynamics. This high‐resolution paradigm necessitates the incorporation of individual's heterogeneity such as residential address, age, race, pre‐existing medical conditions and others in the modelling. In surveillance data, geographical information is publicly available (e.g. county that an individual lives), so it is feasible to utilise this variable in the extension of the macromechanistic model. (ii) CA allows to introduce local stochasticity; for example, the CA paradigm may be built upon a person‐to‐person infectious mechanism if individual‐level information is available; otherwise, it may be based on a group‐group infection process. (iii) CA is formulated in a network of particles (e.g. individuals, groups, villages and counties) with certain rules of connectivity and stochastic laws of disease transmission. This network topology is well suited for computations and simulations. Because of these unique advantages, the CA paradigm has been employed by researches as an efficient method to study spread patterns of epidemics (Beauchemin
