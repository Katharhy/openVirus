<p>In the modelling of infectious diseases, the basic CA formulation involves three primary components: (i) a two‐way array of cells (e.g. an age group or a county) that contain groups of individuals under study, and each individual belongs to one cell; (ii) a set of discrete states (e.g. susceptible, self‐immunised, contagious, recovered and death) that describe different conditions of individuals during an epidemic; and (iii) some specific rules or updating functions that determine spatially how local interactions with a target cell from its neighbouring cells can influence and change the states of individuals in the target cell; all cells in a CA system achieve a global propagation of infection status updates instantaneously and continuously. In the application of the CA, determining neighbouring cells is tricky, and different types of neighbourhood topology have been proposed in the literature, including von Neumann neighbourhood, Moore neighbourhood, MvonN neighbourhood and extended neighbourhood (Hasani &amp; Tavakkoli,

 <xref rid="insr12402-fig-0013" ref-type="fig">13</xref> for an example of these four neighbourhood types).
