<p>Technically speaking, the majority of existing macromechanistic models to study the spread of infectious disease are based on the assumption that the system is homogeneous in space. This means that the spatial characteristics that could potentially play a non‐trivial role in the development and outcome of disease infection are not taken into consideration. This is a valid assumption if the population vulnerable to the infectious disease is mixed well and the human interventions (e.g. vaccination strategies) are homogeneous across different spatial locations. However, in reality, there exists substantial heterogeneity in the urbanisation, ethnic distribution, political views, governance and economic composition across different subgroups of individuals distributed over geographical locations, all of which will influence the spread of infectious disease and make the previous macromechanistic model not appropriate to address the dynamics spatially. One possible extension is to utilise partial differential equations (PDEs) (Murray 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="insr12402-bib-0065" ref-type="ref">1986</xref>) in spatial homogeneity, which is relaxed to allow area‐specific spread patterns of epidemics. As noted in the literature, one limitation of PDEs is that this approach ignores the fact that infectious disease is spread through person‐to‐person interactions, rather than by a continuous population. Thus, PDEs may lead to impractical results about the dynamics of an epidemic (Mollison, 
 <xref rid="insr12402-bib-0064" ref-type="ref">1991</xref>). A natural strategy is to embrace a micromodel mimicking an interactive particle system, and CA is one of the well‐studied systems with the strength of modelling spatially varying infection dynamics. Originated in the works of von Neumann and Burks (

 <xref rid="insr12402-bib-0088" ref-type="ref">1962</xref>), the CA paradigm has been used in many applied fields, including the modelling of infectious diseases.
