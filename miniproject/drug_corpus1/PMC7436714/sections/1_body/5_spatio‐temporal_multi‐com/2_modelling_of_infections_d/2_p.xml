<p>All mechanistic models discussed in the previous sections are useful to analyse the infection dynamics for a large population such as a country or a state in which most of model parameters may be assumed to be homogeneous and representing the entire population. This type of macromodelling approach is particularly valuable at the early phase of disease outbreak when the national public health administration aims to come up with nationwide macrointervention protocols with very limited amounts of relevant data available. Once an epidemic evolves further into its middle phase, with more and more surveillance data collected from local communities, a macromodel is no longer suitable for an in‐depth analysis of microinfection dynamics owing to the existence of substantial heterogeneity across local communities. This section concerns a review of significant extensions of infectious disease models by incorporating spatial heterogeneity across different geographical locations into modelling and analysis. The focus will be on the recent development of integrating the classical spatial cellular automata (CA) (von Neumann &amp; Burks, 
 <xref rid="insr12402-bib-0091" ref-type="ref">1966</xref>) with the previously discussed temporal multi‐compartment models, leading to an important class of spatio‐temporal multi‐compartment models. This class of models is useful to predict local infection risk.
