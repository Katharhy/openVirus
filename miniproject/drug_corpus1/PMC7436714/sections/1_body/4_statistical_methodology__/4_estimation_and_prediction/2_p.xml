<p>Markov chain Monte Carlo has been extensively used for the estimation and prediction in the state‐space model (see, e.g. Carlin

The essential strategy for the calculation of each high‐dimensional integral is to approximate it by a sample mean of the involved integrand. This sample average is obtained from many MCMC sample draws from posterior distributions of the model parameters, including the time series of the latent probability vector
