<p>Convergence diagnostics of the MCMC algorithm may use standard diagnostic tools such as the Gelman–Rubin statistic based on multiple chains with different initial values, monitoring trace plots of the model parameters and so forth. The 
 <sc>r</sc> package 
 <monospace>coda</monospace> provides a comprehensive toolbox of convergence diagnostics (Brooks &amp; Gelman, 
 <xref rid="insr12402-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">1998</xref>). Using the MCMC draws collected after the burn‐in, various summary statistics may be obtained to estimate model parameters, conduct inference and make prediction. The summary statistics (e.g. posterior mean and posterior mode) from the in‐sample draws of the model parameters can provide point estimates and 95% credible intervals with the left and right limits set respectively at the 2.5th percentile and 97.5th percentile, and those of the observed processes may be used to check the goodness of fit of a proposed model and to perform model selection via the deviance information criterion (Spiegelhalter
