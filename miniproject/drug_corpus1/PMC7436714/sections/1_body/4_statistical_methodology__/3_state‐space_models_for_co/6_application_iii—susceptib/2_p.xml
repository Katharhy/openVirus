<p>In a similar spirit to the SQIR example of Application II earlier, Zhou 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (
 <xref rid="insr12402-bib-0102" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) consider an interesting extension of the basic SIR model in the analysis of the US COVID‐19 data to include an antibody compartment to handle the subpopulation of self‐immunised individuals. This four‐compartment model is termed as SAIR model, which has been discussed in detail in Section 
 <xref rid="insr12402-sec-0015" ref-type="sec">3.3</xref>. Because the antibody compartment is also a second exit from the infection system, similar to the quarantine compartment, one can turn the SAIR model given in (
 <xref rid="insr12402-disp-0009" ref-type="disp-formula">6</xref>) into a similar form of the SQIR model in (
 <xref rid="insr12402-disp-0023" ref-type="disp-formula">14</xref>), where 
 <italic>ϕ</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>) is replaced by 
 <italic>α</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>), the rate of self‐immunisation. It is known that the population immunity rate cannot be estimated from observed surveillance data, which needs to be figured out by using large‐scale serological surveys in the population. Thus, 
 <italic>α</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>) may be specified as a Dirac delta function (e.g. Figure 
 <xref rid="insr12402-fig-0010" ref-type="fig">10(G)</xref>–(I)) with jumps at times when the surveys are conducted and function values based on the survey results. It is worth pointing out that although the SQIR and SAIR models have very similar model structures, their interpretations are very different. The former is applicable to the case of very stringent self‐isolation control measures in Hubei, while the latter is reflective to the situation of self‐immunisation due to mild control measures in the USA, so that a substantial proportion of individuals who contracted the virus, recovered and became immunised.
