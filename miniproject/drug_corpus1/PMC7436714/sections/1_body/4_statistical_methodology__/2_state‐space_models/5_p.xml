 <xref rid="insr12402-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">1981</xref>), the state‐space model is a parameter‐driven model in that the processes of the compartment proportions are unknown population parameters to be estimated, while the stochastic multi‐compartment model such as the stochastic SIR model in (
 <xref rid="insr12402-disp-0013" ref-type="disp-formula">7</xref>) is a data‐driven model where the compartment proportions are directly observed. As pointed out earlier, the validity of the latter is questionable in practice, especially in the analysis of the COVID‐19 pandemic data.
