<p>The state‐space model framework is advantageous over the stochastic compartment models introduced in Section 
 <xref rid="insr12402-sec-0020" ref-type="sec">4.4</xref> in the following aspects of statistical modelling: (i) state‐space model does not assume that the compartment processes 
 <italic>S</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>), 
 <italic>I</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>) and 
 <italic>R</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>) are directly observed, which are treated as latent processes to be estimated from observed data. (ii) State‐space model allows an explicit sampling scheme to be part of the model specification, which enables the quantification of both estimation and prediction uncertainties in the statistical analysis. (iii) State‐space model is built upon the compartment probabilities (or rates or proportions) that automatically adjust for potentially varying population sizes. This conveniently relaxes the condition of a constant population size in the basic SIR model. (iv) State‐space model provides a flexible statistical modelling framework that embraces time‐varying model parameters and integrates prior knowledge of disease mechanisms (e.g. 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> value from other studies) via prior distributions of the model parameters. (v) Implementation of MCMC methods in state‐space modelling provides a powerful approach to parameter estimation and predictions using conditional distributions given the history. This is different from all estimation methods in Section 
 <xref rid="insr12402-sec-0016" ref-type="sec">4</xref> that are always formulated via marginal distributions under strong assumptions of sampling rules.
