<p>State‐space models refer to a class of linear or non‐linear hierarchical stochastic models with parametric error distributions. The conventional state‐space model is not formulated as a Bayesian model, but later, its Bayesian formulation has gained great popularity because of the availability of MCMC methods for the estimation of the model parameters (Carlin

In particular, it has been used to model the time series of proportions associated with multi‐compartment models given in (
