<p>Several robust methods that are developed specifically for the prediction of the COVID‐19 are cited by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (

It is difficult to appreciate the original work and followed comments without running real COVID‐19 data using their software, which is lacking for the IHME models, among some others. To increase research transparency, releasing software or computing code used in statistical methods to the public is strongly encouraged.
