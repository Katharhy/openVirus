 <xref rid="insr12402-bib-0102" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) have developed a series of extended SIR models by introducing time‐varying transmission rate, quarantine process and asymptomatic immunisation process (details in Section 
 <xref rid="insr12402-sec-0025" ref-type="sec">5.2</xref>). The proposed methods have been established in an open‐source 
 <sc>r</sc> package 
 <monospace>eSIR</monospace>, available on GitHub (

 <monospace>rjags</monospace> to generate MCMC chains and retains a few MCMC controllers from 
 <monospace>rjags</monospace>. The package is also updated weekly with new summarised US state‐level count data for the COVID‐19 pandemic.
