Despite the large uncertainty, the projected mean and median prevalence curves show a decreasing trend over time, which means that the social distancing works to mitigate the epidemic in Michigan although the rate of improvement is moderate. Also the fact that the two estimated turning points have occurred before 9 June is another piece of evidence for the positive effects of the series of social distancing orders issued by the state governor since 23 March 2020.
