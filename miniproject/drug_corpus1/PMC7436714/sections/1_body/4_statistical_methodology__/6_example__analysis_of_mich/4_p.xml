<p>There are two different prior settings for sensitivity analysis. One follows the example code earlier, with the prior mean for the log‐normal distribution of the basic reproduction number to be 3.5, the removal rate 0.1 and thus the mean transmission rate 0.35, and the other with all these values to be 4, 0.2 and 0.8, respectively. The two distinct settings provide similar estimating and forecast results as can be seen in Figure 
 <xref rid="insr12402-fig-0011" ref-type="fig">11</xref>. Their estimated reproduction numbers are 3.154 (95% credible interval [2.162, 4.369]) and 3.143 (95% credible interval [2.294, 4.147]), respectively, which are similar considering that their prior settings are quite different. The output Gelman–Rubin statistic developed by Gelman and Rubin (
 <xref rid="insr12402-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">1992</xref>) are close to 1 (data not shown). Both pieces of evidence as well as stationary trace plots warrant the convergence of the MCMC chains. One can further check the quality of the MCMC draws through the output by setting 
 <monospace>save</monospace>_
 <monospace>mcmc</monospace> = 
 <monospace>TRUE</monospace>. The estimation and forecast plots for the rates of infection and removal compartments, diagnostic trace plots and other useful ancillary plots are automatically saved under the directory assigned via 
 <monospace>file</monospace>_
 <monospace>add</monospace>  by setting 
 <monospace>save</monospace>_
 <monospace>plot</monospace>_
 <monospace>data</monospace> = 
 <monospace>TRUE</monospace>. Other statistics for the posterior distributions of the parameters and dates of turning points can be saved by setting 
 <monospace>save</monospace>_
 <monospace>files</monospace> = 
 <monospace>TRUE</monospace>.
