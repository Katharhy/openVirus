<p>The introduction of nucleic acid-based diagnostic tests into diagnostic virology has made tremendous improvement in the detection of human viral infections. Since nucleic acid-based diagnostic tests are highly sensitive and specific, they play a crucial role in the diagnosis and control of medical viruses. Molecular diagnostic methods diagnose viral infections by detecting viral RNA or DNA. Therefore, these techniques can pick infected individuals before antibody response is mounted against the virus in question. This is especially important in young, elderly, and immunosuppressed patients. However, they are beyond the reach of resource-limited nations due to their high cost, instrumentation complexity, and requirement for technical expertise. Immunoassays also play a significant role in the diagnosis and serosurveillance of viral infections worldwide. Although immunotechniques are easy to perform and inexpensive compared to molecular methods, they are not widely available in low-income countries. Consequently, scientists are working hard to develop inexpensive good quality tests in low-income nations. Moreover, most countries in the developing world are training their citizens abroad and inland at postgraduate level by opening relevant departments and institutes.</p>
