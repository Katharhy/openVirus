<p>Some viruses such as dengue virus, adenovirus, rubella virus, measles virus, and influenza virus have hemagglutinin antigen on their surfaces that binds and agglutinates RBCs termed hemagglutination (HA). The inhibition of the ability of the viruses to agglutinate RBCs is utilized for the development of HI assay. In the HI assay, serial dilutions of serum sample are prepared in a microtiter plate. Then, a specified amount of viral hemagglutinin is added. Finally, appropriate RBCs are added. The absence of HA indicates a positive reaction. This is judged by tilting the microtiter plate, which allows free RBCs to stream (
