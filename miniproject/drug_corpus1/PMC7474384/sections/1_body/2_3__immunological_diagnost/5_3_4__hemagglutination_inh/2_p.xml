<p>Immunological diagnostic methods are widely employed in routine clinical diagnosis of human viral infections worldwide. The methods have several advantages, such as high sensitivity and specificity, relatively simple to conduct, rapidity, and possibility of testing several specimens simultaneously [

 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. However, immunological-based assays do have several limitations. The assays are subject to interferences. Interferences in immunoassays may result from the presence of (a) cross-reactive agents in the sample that carry similar or the same epitopes as the viral antigen of interest, leading to false-positive result [

 <xref rid="B162" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>]; (b) endogenous antibodies, like autoantibodies, heterophilic antibodies, or human anti-animal antibodies in the specimen. Despite the fact that viral antigen is not present in the sample, endogenous antibodies may interact with antiviral antibodies or detection antibodies, leading to false-positive result [

 <xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>]. The specificity of immunoassay may be affected when they are used in malaria-endemic areas. As it is known, 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> induces nonspecific polyclonal B-cell activation that leads to generation of nonspecific antibodies [

In one study, of 34 samples from PCR confirmed malaria patients, 14 samples were positive or borderline for anti-ZIKV antibodies in commercially available ZIKV ELISA test kit. When these 14 samples were tested using virus neutralization assay, ZIKV infection was not demonstrated in the 11 samples [

 <xref rid="B157" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B166" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>]. In case of IF assay, prolonged exposure of specimen to UV light leads to fading of fluorescence that could result in false-negative test [
 <xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>]. Reagents and equipment that are used in some of the immunoassays are expensive [
