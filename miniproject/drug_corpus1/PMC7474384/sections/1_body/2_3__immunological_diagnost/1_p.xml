<p>The humoral branch of the immune system makes antibodies in response to viral infections. This natural response of the human body against viral infection is utilized for the development of immunological diagnostic methods. Several immunological diagnostic techniques are available for the detection human viral infections in clinical samples, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blotting, immunofluorescence assay, and hemagglutination inhibition assay. The principles of these assays rely on the formation of antigen-antibody complex and consist of clinical specimens, whole virus or viral antigen, and an indicator [
