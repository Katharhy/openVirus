<p>Immunofluorescence assay is commonly conducted for the detection of viral antigens or antiviral antibodies in clinical samples. The assay is conducted in two formats: direct immunofluorescence assay (DFA) that detects viral antigens in patient sample [

 <xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>] or viral antigen [
 <xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>] in clinical specimen. In the DFA, antibody that recognizes viral antigen is directly conjugated to fluorescent dye. In the IFA, viral antigen specific antibody is unlabeled and is detected with a second fluorescently labeled anti-human antibody (

IFA is more sensitive than DFA because several fluorescently labeled anti-immunoglobulin antibodies bind to each antiviral antibody, increasing the intensity of fluorescence at the site of each antiviral antibody. The most widely used fluorescent dye in diagnostic virology is fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), which emits an intense yellow-green fluorescence, but rhodamine, which emits a deep red fluorescence, is also available. After staining, the specimen is examined under fluorescence microscope with a source of incident UV light [
