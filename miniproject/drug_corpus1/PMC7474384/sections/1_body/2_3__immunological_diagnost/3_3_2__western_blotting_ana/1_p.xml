<p>Western blotting (also known as immunoblotting) assay detects viral proteins or antiviral antibodies. For detection of viral proteins, denatured whole viral proteins are first separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Viral proteins are then electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane is then incubated with enzyme conjugated antibodies specific for the viral proteins. If the viral proteins are bound by enzyme labeled antibody, addition of a chromogenic substrate leads to the formation of colored bands at the sites of the viral antigens (

For detection of antiviral antibodies, viral specific denatured proteins are electrophoretically blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane after subjected to SDS-PAGE. The membrane is then incubated with patient serum. If the patient serum contains antibodies against the viral proteins, they will bind to their specific viral proteins. The addition of enzyme conjugated secondary anti-human antibody and a chromogenic substrate results in the production of colored bands at the locations of the viral proteins [
