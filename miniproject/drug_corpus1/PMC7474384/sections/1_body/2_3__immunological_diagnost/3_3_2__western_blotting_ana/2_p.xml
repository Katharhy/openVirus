<p>Immunoblotting has been used in clinical diagnosis for serosurveillance and as confirmatory tests for human viral infection. He et al. [
 <xref rid="B143" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>] developed western blot assay for detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV in human serum samples. The assay demonstrated a sensitivity of 98.3% and specificity of 90.9%, compared to IFA. Western blotting assay was also used for the detection of anti-Chikungunya virus antibody in human serum. Sensitivity of 83.3% and specificity of 96.7% were demonstrated by the assay using 30 sera from confirmed Chikungunya virus infected patient and 30 normal sera [

 <xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B148" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. Western blotting assay is also commercially available. For example, J. Mitra and Co. Pvt. Ltd (Mumbai, India) developed commercial kit (HIV 1 and HIV 2 western blot) for the detection of antibodies to HIV-1 and HIV-2 in human serum or plasma samples. The assay uses preblotted nitrocellulose membrane strips with resolved HIV-1 viral lysate and HIV-2 antigen (gp36). The assay has 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity when compared with licensed western blot test. GS HIV-1 Western Blot kit for the detection of antibodies to HIV-1 in human serum, plasma, or dried blood spots is also available developed by Bio-Rad Laboratories (Redmond, USA). The assay uses preblotted nitrocellulose membrane strips with resolved HIV-1 viral proteins. The assay has 100% sensitivity and 87.2% specificity, compared to licensed HIV-1 western blot test.
