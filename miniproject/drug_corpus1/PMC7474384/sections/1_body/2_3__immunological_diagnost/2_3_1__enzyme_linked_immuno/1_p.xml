<p>In ELISA, enzyme conjugated antibody is utilized to detect the presence of specific antiviral antibody or viral antigen in human specimens. In positive sample, the reaction between an enzyme conjugated with an antibody and colorless chromogenic substrate leads to the formation of a colorful product. In the absence of antigen/antibody in the clinical specimen, no color is produced. The intensity of the color is directly proportional to the amount of antigen-antibody complex formed. The color change can be observed by the naked eye or read by a spectrophotometer, which can measure the absorbance. Several enzymes, including alkaline phosphatase, horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and
