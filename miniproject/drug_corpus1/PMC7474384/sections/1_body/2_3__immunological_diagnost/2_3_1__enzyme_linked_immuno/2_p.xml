<p>ELISA is sensitive and specific, easy to perform, and has a short turnaround time for results. Consequently, the assay has been developed and extensively utilized for the detection and serosurveillance of human viral pathogens. Recently, Adams et al. [
 <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>] developed antibody-capture ELISA for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG in human plasma samples. The assay was tested by using 40 plasma samples from RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and 50 plasma samples from healthy control. It demonstrated overall sensitivity of 85%, compared to RT-PCR and specificity of 100% in the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG or IgM in plasma samples. This assay detected IgG levels in all of RT-PCR positive individuals from ≥10 days following symptoms onset with a sensitivity of 100%. Similarly, Colavita et al. [
 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>] developed antibody-capture ELISA for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM, and IgA in serum samples. The assay was validated using 553 serum samples collected from suspected and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection cases, healthy donors, and patients positive for other infections or autoimmune conditions. The assay showed overall sensitivity of 91.7% and 97.9% for the detection of IgG and IgA in serum sample, respectively, and specificity of &gt;96% for all antibody types, compared to IFA reference test. Chen et al. [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] also developed antigen-capture ELISA for the detection of MERS-CoV in clinical specimens. The assay demonstrated a LoD of &lt;1 ng of MERS-CoV-recombinant nucleocapsid protein/ml and specificity of 100%. Antigen-capture ELISA was developed for rapid detection of dengue virus NS1 and differentiation of DENV serotypes in human specimens. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the test were 84.85% and 100%, respectively, compared to RT-qPCR, and the sensitivity rates for serotyping were 88.2%, 94.7%, 75%, and 66.6% for DENV serotype 1 (DENV1), DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4, respectively, with no cross-reactivity among serotypes [

 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>], SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>], hepatitis viruses [
 <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>], H5N1 influenza virus [
 <xref rid="B140" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>], and ZIKV [
