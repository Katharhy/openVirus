 <xref rid="B173" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. Recently, the RT-qPCR technique is widely used in several research institutes, universities, and clinical laboratories for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. In general, few molecular techniques such as conventional PCR and RT-PCR are utilized in research institutes and universities for research purposes. Since most laboratories are budget-restricted and do not have trained laboratory personnel, molecular methods are not used for routine clinical diagnosis of human viral infections in the country. Nationwide use of RT-qPCR technologies for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and the experiences obtained will open the door to introduce molecular techniques for routine laboratory testing of other human viral infections.
