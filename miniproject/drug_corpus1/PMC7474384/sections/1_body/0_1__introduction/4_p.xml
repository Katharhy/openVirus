<p>Traditionally, laboratory diagnoses of medical viruses are carried out by isolating viruses in embryonated chicken eggs, in tissue culture, or in laboratory animals and visual examination of viral particles in sample using electron microscopy among others [

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Immunological methods detect viral infections by identifying antiviral antibodies or viral antigens in clinical samples [
