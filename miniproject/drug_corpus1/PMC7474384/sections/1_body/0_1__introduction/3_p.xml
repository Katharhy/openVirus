<p>The morbidity and mortality rates of human viral infections are significantly high [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. For example, the pandemic swine influenza A (H1N1) infection in 2009 occurred in 214 countries with more than 18,036 deaths [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In 2010 alone, the number of human deaths due to rabies globally was estimated to be 61,000, with 84% of the deaths occurred in rural areas [

 <sup>th</sup> January 2015, H5N1 viruses have killed 402 out of 694 laboratory-confirmed human infections in 16 countries [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], with a mortality rate of around 58%. Recently, the world is challenged by the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The disease is caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The pathogen first emerged in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China, which has now quickly gained worldwide spread [

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. On 11
 <sup>th</sup> March 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. According to the WHO, 9, 129, 146 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide, including 473, 797 deaths since 31
 <sup>st</sup> December 2019 and as of 24
 <sup>th</sup> June 2020 [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, good diagnostic techniques are required to detect these viral infections early and accurately. Early and accurate detection of viral diseases plays a significant role in selecting appropriate therapy timely, minimizing therapy costs, minimizing unnecessary loss of human lives, and controlling the disease. It also helps to develop appropriate disease prevention and treatment strategies, like development of antiviral vaccines and new therapeutic agents [
