<p>NGS has been used in diagnostic virology for several applications. Recently, Kustin et al. [
 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>] used NGS for rapid and robust identification of respiratory viruses in clinical samples. It was applied to track influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus [
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. Dessilly et al. [
 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>] used NGS for the detection of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations. NGS was also conducted to discover a new Ebola virus [
