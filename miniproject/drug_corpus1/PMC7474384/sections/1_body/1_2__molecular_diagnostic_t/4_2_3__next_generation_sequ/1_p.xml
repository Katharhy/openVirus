<p>NGS finds itself very useful in diagnostic virology as it can directly analyze viral nucleic acid fragments extracted from clinical specimens [

 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. Generally, NGS involves preparation of test sample, sequencing of the target nucleic acid fragments using one of the available NGS platforms, and analysis of the sequence data using suitable bioinformatic tools [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Several companies produce different NGS machines that use different methods of sequencing, reagents, and data analysis tools [
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. For example, pyrosequencing (Roche 454) detects release of pyrophosphate following incorporation of nucleotides in a DNA polymerization process. Illumina's NGS platforms detect release of fluorescent labels from incorporated nucleotides in a DNA polymerization process. The emerging technologies like Oxford nanopore (MinIon) platform sequences the target nucleic acid by sensing the ionic current of DNA/RNA molecules that pass through the nanopores [

 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Despite its high sequence error rate (up to 38.2%) [
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>], MinION nanopore sequencer has merits over other NGS platforms. Firstly, it can generate longer read lengths (up to 882 kb) in real time [
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>], making it suitable for whole genome sequencing of viral pathogens with short turnaround time [
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. Secondly, it is portable and no Internet is required for analysis, making it deployable in the field during outbreaks of viral infections [
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. Thirdly, it has low capital cost, making it affordable in low-income countries and budget-restricted laboratories across the globe [
