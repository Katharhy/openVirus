<p>Molecular techniques that involve the amplification of viral genomic material are extremely sensitive and specific, provide rapid diagnosis, and allow the detection of several viruses at same time [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Nucleic acid amplification techniques are very useful for the detection of viruses that are uncultivable or difficult and harmful to culture, slow growing viruses in culture, and viruses that display antigenic variations [

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The nucleic acid amplification tests are very popular in the diagnosis of viral infections caused by several viruses, including hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), dengue virus, Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), influenza viruses, Zika virus (ZIKV), Ebola virus, and coronavirus [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Several nucleic acid amplification methods are currently available for the laboratory diagnosis of viral infections worldwide, and their advantages and limitations will be summarized in
