<p>RT-PCR was designed to amplify RNA targets. In this technique, reverse transcriptase (RT) is used to convert viral RNA targets into complementary DNA (cDNA), and then the resulting cDNA is amplified by conventional PCR. Since its development, RT-PCR has been used for the diagnosis of human infection by RNA viruses. Conventional RT-PCR demonstrated overall sensitivity ranging from 73% to 100% and specificity ranging from 99% to 100% in the detection of viral infection [
