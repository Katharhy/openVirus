<p>The utility of LAMP is expanded by merging it with reverse transcription (RT) into RT-LAMP to allow the rapid detection of RNA viruses in clinical specimens. Recently, for instance, Huang et al. [
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>] developed a rapid RT-LAMP assay for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 with LoD of 80 copies of viral RNA/ml in a sample within a 30 minutes reaction. This assay was validated by using 16 clinical samples (8 positives and 8 negatives) that were also tested by RT-qPCR. The testing results of the assay were consistent with RT-qPCR method, suggesting RT-LAMP assay can be used for rapid, simple, cost-effective, and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples. Similarly, Lu et al. [
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>] developed the RT-LAMP method for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 with LoD of 30 RNA copies/reaction and turnaround time of 40 minutes . Further, Baek et al. [
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] developed a rapid RT-LAMP assay for early detection of SARS-CoV-2. The assay has LoD of 100 RNA copies/reaction, which is close to that of RT-qPCR with a rapid detection span of 30 minutes . RT-LAMP assay has also been developed to detect Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) with LoD of 3.4 copies of MERS-CoV RNA/reaction along with the same sensitivity as MERS-CoV RT-qPCR, no cross-reaction to other respiratory viruses, and results available in &lt;1 hour [
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Kurosaki et al. [
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>] detected acute Ebola virus infection by RT-LAMP coupled with a portable device. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay was 100% each, compared to RT-qPCR and turnaround time of 35 minutes . In one study, RT-LAMP was more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR and NASBA [
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. The assay has been also developed for rapid detection of dengue virus [
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus [
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>], H5N1 avian influenza virus [
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>], HCV [
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>], HIV-1 [
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>], RSV [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and ZIKV [
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] in clinical samples. RT-LAMP-based commercial test kits are available for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens. The assay is developed by Color Genomics (USA), and it uses three SARS-CoV-2 specific primer sets targeting N gene , E gene , and ORF1a region, respectively, and a fourth control primer set targeting human ribonuclease P (RNaseP). It has LoD of 0.75 copies of viral RNA/
 <italic>μ</italic>l with 70 minutes reaction. The assay received EUA from the US FDA in respiratory specimens. Abbott Diagnostic Scarborough, Inc. (USA) has also developed RT-LAMP-based test (ID NOW™ COVID-19 assay) for direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasal, nasopharyngeal, or throat swabs. The kit has received EUA from US FDA. The assay targets RdRp gene of SARS-CoV-2. The LoD of the test is 125 genome equivalents (GE)/ml with positive results in &lt;5 minutes and negative results in 13 minutes . LAMP primer sets such as the Loopamp primer set for avian flu H5 and H7 and FluA influenza are commercially available from Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd. (Japan).
