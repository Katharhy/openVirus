<p>LAMP assay has been successfully utilized to the rapid detection of a number of DNA viruses in human specimens, such as HSV-1 with LoD of 10 copies of HSV-1 DNA/
 <italic>μ</italic>l and no cross-reactions with other selected viruses [
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], hAdV40 and hAdV41 with LoD of between 50 and 100 copies of DNA/reaction, no cross-reactions with other selected viruses, and turnaround time of 60 minutes [
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], EBV with sensitivity of 86.4%, specificity of 100%, compared to serological assay, and only 45 minutes of amplification of the target sequences [
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>], and CMV with LoD of 10 DNA copies/
 <italic>μ</italic>l, no cross-reactivity with other viruses, and turnaround time of 1 hour after RNA extraction [
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>].
