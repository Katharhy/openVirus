<p>TMA-based assays for the detection of HCV and HIV-1 are commercially available, developed by Hologic (San Diego, CA, USA). The Aptima HCV RNA qualitative assay is used for the detection of HCV RNA in human plasma or serum. The assay utilizes TMA to amplify conserved regions within the 5′-UTR of the HCV genome. The assay has LoD of 7.5 IU/ml with a specificity of 99.6%. NASBA-based kits for detection of HIV-1, CMV, enterovirus, and RSV are also commercially available, developed by bioMérieux Clinical Diagnostics. The NucliSens Easy Q RSV A and B assay is developed by bioMérieux (Marcy l'Etoile, France), and it is used for qualitative detection of RSV in respiratory samples of different types. The assay is based on real-time NASBA, and it targets F gene of RSV. Moore et al. [
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] evaluated the performance of the commercial test kit using 508 respiratory specimens that were tested by direct immunofluorescence and culture. The assay was found to be more sensitive than culture and immunofluorescence assay. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were determined to be 99% and 87%, respectively, compared to immunofluorescence assay with turnaround time of &lt;4 hours.
