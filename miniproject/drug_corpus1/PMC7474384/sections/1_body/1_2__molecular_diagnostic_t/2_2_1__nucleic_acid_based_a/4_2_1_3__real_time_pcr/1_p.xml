<p>In real-time PCR system, viral nucleic acid amplification and detection steps are carried out at the same time. The detection of the amplification product is relied on the amount of fluorescence emission from the specimen. The fluorescence emission from the specimen is monitored by special thermal cycler. The computer, with appropriate software connected to the thermal cycler, records the data and produces an amplification plot at every reaction cycle [

The SYBR green dye binds to the minor groove of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) product and upon excitation by appropriate light, it exhibits improved fluorescence, which is directly proportional to the accumulated dsDNA product. The TaqMan probe is a DNA oligonucleotide with a fluorescent dye termed reporter attached to one end (5′ base) and quencher on the other (3′ base) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). TaqMan probes are designed to hybridize to an internal region of a PCR product. During the annealing stage of the PCR, both the primer and the TaqMan probe bind to the template strand. When the Taq DNA polymerase extends the primer, the polymerase cleaves the probe by its the 5′-3′ exonuclease activity. Cleavage of the probe leads to the release of the fluorescent dye (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), resulting in fluorescence emission. The amount of fluorescence is directly proportional to the PCR product. Molecular beacon is a small DNA molecule with a fluorescent dye at the 5′ end and a quencher at the 3′ end. The sequences at the very 3′ and 5′ ends are complementary to each other. The internal part of the molecule is designed to be complementary to the target sequence of a PCR product. When molecular beacon is free in solution, it will adopt a hairpin structure. This brings the fluorophore and quencher in close proximity, leading to absorption of emitted light of the florescent dye by the quencher and hence fluorescence is not detected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> A). However, when a molecular beacon hybridizes to the target sequence, the fluorophore and quencher are separated, leading to the emission of fluorescence (
