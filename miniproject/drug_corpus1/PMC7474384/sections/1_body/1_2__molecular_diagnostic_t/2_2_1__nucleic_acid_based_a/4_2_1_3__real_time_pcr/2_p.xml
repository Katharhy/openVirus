<p>Owing to high sensitivity and specificity, short turnaround time for results, and ease of performance [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], most laboratories across the globe employ real-time PCR for the detection and quantification of medical DNA and RNA viruses in clinical specimens. For example, Boppana et al. [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] used real-time PCR for the detection of cytomegalovirus (CMV) in liquid saliva with overall sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 99.9%, compared with standard rapid culture. The method was also employed for the diagnosis of primary of EBV infection with overall sensitivity of 95.7% and specificity of 100%, compared to serologic assays [

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The determination of viral loads in patient specimens is crucial as it provides prognostic and predictive information. In this study, patients with higher viral loads in their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) found to require acyclovir therapy for a longer duration and had a poorer clinical outcome than the patients with lower viral loads in their CSF [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The assay can also be used for the multiplex identification of different viruses. Both TaqMan probe and molecular beacon play crucial roles for multiplex identification of different viruses in a single PCR reaction. In multiplexing assays, different probes/beacons are labeled with different fluorescent dyes [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In multiplex assay, sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 99.6% were reported, compared to immunofluorescence assay, for real-time PCR in the detection of human adenovirus B, C, and E in the throat swab samples [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Ramamurthy and his colleagues [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] compared multiplex real-time PCR with multiplex conventional PCR for the detection of neurotropic viruses (CMV, EBV, herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV)) in CSF. Out of 147 CSF samples collected from patients with neurological disorders, real-time PCR detected viral pathogens in 88 samples while conventional PCR could only detect the viruses in six samples, suggesting that real-time PCR has higher sensitivity than conventional PCR. Qiu et al. [
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] developed a triplex quantitative real-time PCR assay for rapid and differential detection of human adenovirus (hAdV) serotypes 2, 3, and 7 for potential clinical use. The analytical sensitivity (limit of detection; LoD) of this assay was 10
 <sup>2</sup> DNA copies/reaction for each of serotypes and no cross-reactions with other respiratory pathogens. The authors concluded that the assay is sensitive and specific and has the potential for clinical use in the rapid and differential detection and quantitation of hAdV serotypes 2, 3, and 7 in human specimens.
