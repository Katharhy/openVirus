<p>PCR is a typical example of nucleic acid amplification assay. It has revolutionized the field of molecular diagnosis since developed by Mullis and Faloona [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. PCR is based on extraction and purification of DNA molecule and exponential amplification of the target sequence, using a thermostable DNA polymerase and two specific oligonucleotide primers. After the PCR reaction, the amplified product can be detected by several techniques, including gel electrophoresis, colorimetric methods, and sequencing [

 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. These reports suggest that PCR can be employed for the detection of medical viruses in a variety of specimen types. Conventional PCR is still in use by some clinical laboratories worldwide, but it is rapidly replaced by more advanced variants of the technique.
