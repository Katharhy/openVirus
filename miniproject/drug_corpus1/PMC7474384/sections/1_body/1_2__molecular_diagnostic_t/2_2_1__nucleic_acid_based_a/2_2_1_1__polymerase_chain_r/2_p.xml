<p>PCR is a highly versatile technique. A number of variants of the conventional PCR have been developed, but the most important variants are reverse transcription-PCR and real-time PCR [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The first method was devised to amplify ribonucleic acid (RNA) targets [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]; the second technique was introduced to quantify deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in real time throughout the PCR reactions [
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].
