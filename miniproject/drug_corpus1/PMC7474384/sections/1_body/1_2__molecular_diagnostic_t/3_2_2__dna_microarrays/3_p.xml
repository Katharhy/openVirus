<p>DNA microarray technology is a high-throughput tool as it allows multiplex detection of a large number of potential viral pathogens in clinical specimens [
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. The technique does have a number of limitations nevertheless, including being too expensive to be used for routine clinical diagnosis, labor-intensive, and time-consuming (the hybridization process may take hours to days to complete). Nonspecific hybridization between test materials and immobilized probes can affect the sensitivity of the assay. In addition, designing of specific probes requires almost complete information of the genetic makeup the virus of interest. The assay detects only those viral pathogens that have target probes on the array [
