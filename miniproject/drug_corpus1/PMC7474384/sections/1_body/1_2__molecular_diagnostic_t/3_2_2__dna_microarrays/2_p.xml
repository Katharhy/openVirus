<p>Extensive literature exists demonstrating the utility of DNA microarray for the detection of medical viruses in human specimens. Chiu et al. [
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] used DNA microarray for high-throughput multiplex detection of viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirate samples originated from children infected with respiratory viruses. The assay demonstrated overall sensitivity of 87% to 90% and specificity of ≥99% in the detection of RSV, influenza A virus, and rhinovirus/enterovirus compared to RT-PCR. In one study, DNA microarray was utilized for simultaneous detection of HSV-1/2, VZV, EBV, CMV, human herpesvirus-6 types A and B (HHV-6 A/B), and adenovirus in clinical samples with LoD of 10 GE/reaction for each virus without cross-reactivity [

 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. DNA microarray was also utilized for high-throughput multiplex detection of gastrointestinal viruses [
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>], viruses transmitted by small mammals and arthropods [
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>], herpesviruses, enteroviruses and flaviviruses [
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>], HIV-1, HIV-2, and hepatitis viruses [
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>] and dual infection with two dengue virus serotypes [
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>] in human specimens. DNA microarray was used to identify and genotype drug-resistant mutations of HIV [
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>] to detect and genotype drug-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutations [
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>], to detect and genotype SARS coronavirus [
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>], and to detect and determine lineage of influenza B viruses [
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. During an outbreak of SARS in China in 2002, DNA microarray also served for the discovery of a new member of the coronavirus family [
