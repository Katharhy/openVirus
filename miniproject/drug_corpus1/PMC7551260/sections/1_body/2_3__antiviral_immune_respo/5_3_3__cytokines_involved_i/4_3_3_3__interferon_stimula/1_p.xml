<p>IFNs activate the kinases of the JAK family and phosphorylate several members of the STAT family of transcription factors in an autocrine and paracrine manner, resulting in the expression of numerous ISGs that establish an “antiviral state” in both infected host cells and the surrounding uninfected cells [

 <xref rid="B76-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. This state can efficiently inhibit viral infection and replication, and it also simultaneously induces priming of the adaptive immune responses which, in most cases, eventually clears the virus from the infected host. ISGs known to exert direct antiviral activity are upregulated during viral infection, such as IFN-induced proteins with IFN-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs), tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs), and ISG15. These ISGs have broad-spectrum antiviral functions [

 <xref rid="B78-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that IFITMs can inhibit cellular entry of MERS-CoV [

 <xref rid="B80-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 induces a robust IFN response and substantially increases the expression of IFITM2 and IFITM3 [
 <xref rid="B68-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Despite the upregulation of ISGs in COVID-19 patients, there is no clear correlation between the observed ISG upregulation and disease severity [
 <xref rid="B81-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. The potential ISGs exert protective functions against SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may explain the lower proportion of severe cases and the lower case-fatality rate in COVID-19 patients compared with SARS cases [
 <xref rid="B82-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. However, a high viral load has been detected at the very early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection after symptom onset [
 <xref rid="B83-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], suggesting that the novel emerging coronavirus might exploit unique strategies to evade host innate immunity.
