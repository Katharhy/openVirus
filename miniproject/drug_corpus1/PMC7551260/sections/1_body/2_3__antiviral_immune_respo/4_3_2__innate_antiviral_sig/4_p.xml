<p>In contrast, RLRs, mainly including MDA5 and RIG-I, are cytoplasmic recognition molecules that sense RNA viruses in many cell types [
 <xref rid="B55-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Recognition of RNA viruses by RLRs induces the activation of several transcriptional factors, mainly including interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 1, IRF3, IRF7, and NF-κB. The transcriptional factors of IRFs 1/3/7 could trigger the transcription of Type I IFNs (IFN-α/β) and Type III IFNs (IFN-λ) [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], while NF-κB mediates the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines [
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. For instance, MHV can be detected by both MDA5 and RIG-I, which induces Type I IFN production in oligodendrocytes via the activation of the transcriptional factor IRF3 [
 <xref rid="B57-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Meanwhile, infection with MHV activates MDA5 signaling, resulting in decreased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, which effectively reduces the severity of MHV-induced pathogenesis [
 <xref rid="B58-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Nevertheless, SARS-CoV infection causes temporal and spatial activation of the transcriptional factor NF-κB, which leads to transcription of proinflammatory cytokines at 12 h postinfection, whereas transcription of Type I IFNs by IRF3/IRF7 is delayed until 48 h postinfection [
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 has been proven to share approximately 80% of the genome with SARS-CoV, and almost all of the encoded proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are highly homologous to SARS-CoV proteins [
 <xref rid="B60-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 may produce similar RNA intermediates that trigger TLR and RIG-I signaling during the viral life cycle.
