<p>Innate immunity signaling cascades are activated by recognition of the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of the invading virus by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs). The PRRs involved in the detection of viral pathogens mainly include toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG) type I like receptors (RLRs), C-type lectin-like receptors (CLRs), and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs) [

PAMPs of coronaviruses, such as amino acids, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), and glycoproteins, can be recognized during viral infection and replication via TLRs and RLRs, resulting in the activation of innate immune signaling cascades [
