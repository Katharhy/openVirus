<p>In addition, TLR4 expressed on the lung epithelium may act as a cofactor, affecting viral entry [

 <xref rid="B49-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. TLRs 3, 7, 8, and 9 are distributed in the cytosol and involved in sensing endosomal nucleic acid of RNA intermediates. It has been shown that TLR3 signaling via TIR-containing adapter protein inducing IFN-β (TRIF) adaptor molecules induces an effective host cell-intrinsic antiviral defense against lethal SARS-CoV infection [

 <xref rid="B53-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Nevertheless, whether pDCs are essential for controlling viral infection still needs to be tested in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Moreover, the enteric coronavirus PEDV induces nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation by TLR 2, 3, and 9 pathways, indicating that the innate immune sensors can recognize the PEDV surface glycoproteins as well as RNA intermediates in the cytoplasm [
