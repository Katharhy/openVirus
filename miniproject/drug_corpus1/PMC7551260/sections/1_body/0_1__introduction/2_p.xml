<p>Interferon (IFN) production is a fundamental process involved in the innate immune response to viral infection. These soluble antiviral cytokines can induce upregulation of an array of intracellular effectors of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) through the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signal pathways, such as Mx proteins, protein kinase PKR, and ISG15, which have antiviral activity as they halt viral replication and dissemination of infected cells [

Thus, before effective adaptive immune responses are initiated, the IFN-mediated innate immune response plays a critically important role in eliminating virus invasion and protecting tissue damage and inflammation at the early phase of infection [

 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Indeed, coronaviruses are known to efficiently circumvent the host immune systems, and IFN production can barely be detected during the early phase of coronavirus infection [

 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 patients have extended incubation periods without apparent symptoms, which subsequently contribute to the cytokine storm, damaging inflammation, and other severe complications [

 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. On the other hand, coronaviruses might have evolved to escape innate immune responses by their infected hosts [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It has to be mentioned that IFN-antagonistic functions affect viral virulence to a considerable extent and might be associated with interspecies transmission of emerging and reemerging viruses [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therefore, in this review, we summarize antiviral immunity in the respiratory and intestinal tracts against coronaviruses that have been reported to cause epidemics in both humans and domestic animals. In particular, we highlight how these different coronaviruses exploit multiple strategies to evade immune surveillance exerted by the host.
