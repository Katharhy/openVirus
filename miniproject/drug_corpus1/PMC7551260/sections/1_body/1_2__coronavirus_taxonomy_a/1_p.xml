<p>Coronaviruses, members of the family Coronaviridae, have positive-stranded RNA genomes, and their virions are roughly spherical and moderately pleomorphic with an average diameter of 60−220 nm. Their genome range is approximately 26–33.5 Kb in length with a 5′-cap and 3′-polyadenylated tail displayed as ORF1a-ORF1b-S-ORF3-E-M-N in order, with both termini flanked and untranslated regions [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The 5′-proximal two-thirds of the genome contain a large replicase polyprotein, of which ORF1a encodes a large polyprotein, pp1a, and ORF1b expresses the pp1ab fusion protein using ribosomal frameshifting. These polyproteins can be proteolytically cleaved to 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp) from nsp1 to nsp16 [
