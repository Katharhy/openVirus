<p>The 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro, also called Mpro) of coronavirus is the main proteinase that controls the activities of the viral replication complex. This protease often exerts unique functions to support virus immune evasion [
 <xref rid="B107-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. For example, PEDV 3CLpro is used for cleaving cellular substrates to promote viral infection and inhibit the innate immune response through cleavage of the NF-ÎºB essential modulator (NEMO), resulting in attenuation of the innate immune response to virus infection [

A structural comparison revealed that (R)-16, an inhibitor of SARS 3CLpro, also has an inhibitory effect against PEDV 3CLpro, despite PEDV 3CLpro and SARS 3CLpro sharing a sequence homology of only 45.4% [

Analysis of the crystal structure revealed that 3CLpro has a striking degree of conservation of the substrate-binding sites among coronaviruses, and thus, this proteinase is an ideal drug target for the treatment of diseases caused by coronavirus infection [
