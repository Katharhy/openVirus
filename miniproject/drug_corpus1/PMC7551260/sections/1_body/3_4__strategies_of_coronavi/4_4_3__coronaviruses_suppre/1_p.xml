<p>Coronaviruses encode multiple proteins as antagonists of IFN signaling that impede or delay the IFN signal cascades and expression of ISGs and, consequently, contribute to viral pathogenesis [
 <xref rid="B65-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Some reports have shown that SARS-CoV encodes at least 11 viral proteins as IFN antagonists [
 <xref rid="B96-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>], and more than 10 viral proteins of PEDV have an inhibitory function that is involved in the regulation of IFN expression [
 <xref rid="B97-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Indeed, various coronavirus proteins exploit diverse strategies to suppress the innate immune signaling pathways, of which the viral protein functions of nonstructural proteins such as nsp1, nsp3, nsp5, and nsp16 are emphasized in this review (
