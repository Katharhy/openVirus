<p>Ubiquitin is a key regulatory factor that corrects the function of cellular processes mediated by linkage of the chain, of which K48-linked ubiquitin chains contribute to degradation. It has been revealed that viruses exploit several strategies to interfere with the ubiquitin cellular system [
 <xref rid="B102-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Nsp3 of coronaviruses expresses papain-like protease (PLpro), which is a kind of deubiquitinase (DUB) [
 <xref rid="B103-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. SARS-CoV PLpro has deubiquitinating activity and can potentially deconjugate cellular substrates to inhibit the ubiquitin-mediated signal pathway [
 <xref rid="B103-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. The DUB activity of SARS-CoV PLpro is manifested in the K48 lysine-linked polyubiquitin mediated degradation of the target protein through the ubiquitin−proteasome pathway [
 <xref rid="B102-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. In contrast, MERS-CoV PLpro shows broad linkage specificity for the cleavage of polyubiquitin chains [

 <xref rid="B105-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. PLpros from other coronaviruses, such as HCoV-NL63 PLP2, TGEV PLP1, and MHV PLP2, exert similar inhibitory functions to that of IFN expression [
 <xref rid="B106-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. This indicates that coronavirus PLpro is highly conserved in viral evolutionary processes and is recognized as an attractive antiviral drug target.
