<p>Besides the receptors on the membranes of susceptible target cells, the spike glycoprotein can also bind to cellular factors on antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) and microfold cells. The pathogens bind to factors on DCs, which can aid in their spread to infect other individuals [
 <xref rid="B84-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. DCs can capture antigens directly in the lumen by forming transepithelial dendrites. These antigen-bearing DCs can migrate to the adjacent lymph nodes and present the antigens to T cells or B cells for further activation of cellular and humoral immune responses [
 <xref rid="B85-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. DCs possess high levels of TLRs, and they also express CLRs, such as DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN). Viral glycoproteins interact with DC-SIGN, which helps viruses to break through the epithelial barrier. Thus, they act as a “Trojan Horse”, allowing the virus to evade antiviral immune responses, resulting in virus dissemination in the submucosal layer of mucosal tissues [

 <sup>+</sup> T cells in the submucosa [

 <xref rid="B88-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Additionally, the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein interacts with DC-SIGN and contributes to the low production of antiviral cytokines such as IL-12 and IFNs, which might help the virus evade the innate immune system [
 <xref rid="B84-viruses-12-01039" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. The mentioned coronaviruses bind to the antigen-presenting cells, such as DCs, using the unique glycoproteins on their envelope, which facilitate the virus in breaking through the mucosal barrier and avoiding detection by the PRRs on the cellular membrane of the epithelium. To date, little information is available about the roles of DCs and pDCs in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, further investigation is required to elucidate whether the DCs could mediate SARS-CoV-2 transmission to target cells.
