 <bold>Drug ‘spots’:</bold> Sharing drug consumption paraphernalia, living communally, lack of proper nutrition, and making money through waste collection are common among people residing at ‘spots’. For those located in the margins of highways and deserted areas where there is no access to water and sanitation, provision of hand washing liquids or bars of soap is not practical. Instead, distribution of alcohol pads and disinfectants is more useful and helpful. For the ‘spots’ located near or in parks, with reference to the social distancing restrictions in public places, access to water and sanitation has been limited, resulted in increased risk of contracting and transmitting the infection.
