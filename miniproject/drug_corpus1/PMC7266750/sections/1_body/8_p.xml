 <bold>Supply shortage:</bold> Lack and/or shortage of disinfectants and medical equipment are a public concern. Furthermore, the common bureaucracy of government agencies to send essential medical supplies and equipment does not have capacity for the current situation. This has not only slowed down the provision of services but also has affected the spirit of service providers; for instance, their motivation and enthusiasm. However, the advocacy and use of public networks, NGOs, donors and professionals have been somewhat helpful.
