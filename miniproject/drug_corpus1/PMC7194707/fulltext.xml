Participants&#x02019; willingness to dispense without prescription may be influenced by the media which has been proposing hydroxychloroquine as the treatment of COVID-19. About 95% of participants in this study reported that they currently follow the latest coronavirus updates on treatments obtaining their information mostly (60% of them) from the media. Highlighting more reliable sources such as the FIP released guideline in March of this year could benefit in providing accurate information to pharmacists globally, by clarifying required coronavirus information for pharmacists and the pharmacy workforce, and presenting evidence-based information.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref>
</p><p id="p0145">Many pharmacists were not sure about the role of hydroxychloroquine (12%) and 29% of them thought it has been used as a preventative therapy against the coronavirus infection. It may be posed that Jordanian pharmacists need to be made aware about current preliminary recommendations for the symptomatic management of mild COVID-19 cases, i.e.fluids, antipyretics and rest. Specialist hospital unit physicians of course have trialed and may be using treatments such as chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, as well as of course ventilatory support for patients with severe respiratory distress symptoms.<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref> Most participants (72%) knew that azithromycin has been trialed along with hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of the coronavirus infection, while only 28% knew that antivirals, such as oseltamivir, have been used in the management in critical cases of the infection and 46% were not sure.<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref>
</p><p id="p0150">Ibuprofen the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicine, or NSAID, is sold under a number of brand names, including Advil&#x000ae; and Nurofen&#x000ae;. In addition to treating pain, it's often used to manage fever associated with various viral or bacterial infections. At the time of designing this study, it was said that NSAIDs such as ibuprofen can increase the risk of complications when used during viral infections (including the coronavirus infection). However, the WHO declared on March 18, 2020 under a post titled &#x02018;Anti-inflammatory drug has been subject of conflicting reports&#x02019; that &#x02018;there's no evidence to suggest that using ibuprofen to manage symptoms of COVID-19 will worsen the condition&#x02019;. Earlier reports said a spokesperson had cautioned against using ibuprofen to manage symptoms of the illness caused by the coronavirus until WHO experts could investigate&#x02019;. This case provides a good example on the confusing information provided to healthcare professionals, including pharmacists, via the media regarding COVID-19 pandemic.<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr"><sup>47</sup></xref>
</p><p id="p0155">The use of corticosteroids by COVID-19 patients has also been a confusing issue to many pharmacists. Corticosteroids were widely used during previous outbreaks of similar types of infection such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV.<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48</sup></xref> However, although there appeared to be some evidence that corticosteroids may be beneficial if used in the early acute phase of infections, conflicting evidence from the WHO surrounding corticosteroid use in certain viral infections means this evidence is not conclusive.<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr"><sup>49</sup></xref> Current reports indicate no unique reason exists to expect that patients with COVID-19 infection will benefit from corticosteroids, and they might be more likely to be harmed with such treatment.<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr"><sup>50</sup></xref> Hence, considering the current availability of literature, caution should be exercised until further evidence emerges surrounding the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients.<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr"><sup>51</sup></xref>
</p><p id="p0160">Pharmacists and pharmacy students showed acceptable awareness about the COVID-19 pandemic as more than half of them knew the correct answers to the awareness related items except for the items probing the appropriate distance they need to maintain between them and the patients; the majority (67%) believed that at least 3&#x000a0;m (10 feet) were the needed distance when counseling patients during a pandemic while the appropriate answer as per Jordanian guidelines is 2&#x000a0;m (6 feet) and 7% were not sure. It was important to raise awareness about this fact (as participants received the correct answers upon completion of the study), because anecdotal comments from pharmacists indicated that some did not allow customers to come anywhere near them which negatively affected the counseling process. The majority (76%) of them were not aware of the highest risk population group in terms of contracting the coronavirus infection and they believed that children under the age of 9 were at highest risk along with and to the same extent as the elderly (&#x0003e;65) and immune-compromised patients, while 5% were not sure. It was interesting to note that generally significantly more pharmacists answered the awareness items on the survey correctly than pharmacy student. This may indicate the experience boosts clinical awareness and reasoning skills of pharmacists. Study results indicated that not only being a practicing pharmacist versus a pharmacy student was associated with better awareness, but that older age, being a public university alumnus versus a private university alumnus, attending more educational workshops on a yearly basis were also significantly associated with a better level of awareness. None of these are of course surprising except of course the difference in graduating from a different type of educational institution (public vs. private). It is noteworthy to recognize that this finding could be due to the fact that about half of the graduates from the private educational institutions in Jordan are international students, who travel back to their countries once they graduate; international students who remain in Jordan are not able to practice as pharmacists.</p><p id="p0165">Representing a front-line professional component of essential health care and being the most accessible healthcare providers, pharmacists' role has been expanding along with the advancement of different configurations of pharmacy services provided to customers. The drive-through pharmacy service is one example of the numerous newly emerging community pharmacy services in Jordan. This model initiated in the nineties in the United States of America (USA) with pharmacy chains being initial adopters, though now it is a well espoused model acrossthe USA.<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr"><sup>52</sup></xref> In Jordan, drive-through pharmacy services have recently been introduced representing a new trend in community pharmacy services with positive customer awareness and perceptions towards the service.<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr"><sup>53</sup></xref> Although of course the model limits the &#x02018;sit-down&#x02019; counseling deemed as a higher order role of pharmacists, in Jordan, this service appeared well received particularly in a certain subset of customers, but concerns regarding proper counseling represented the main disadvantage of the service.<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref>About 50% of the participants in this study believed that they should be allowed to sell medications for coronavirus management via the drive-through service available in some chain pharmacies in Jordan. Although benefits may be found in this approach of dispensing in the COVID-19 era, suboptimal counseling raises a concern. This discussion falls unto policymakers to make a clear announcement about whether to allow, encourage, or prohibit pharmacists from dispensing coronavirus patients' medications via the drive-through service. In public health emergencies, clinical pharmacists enact their professional expertise by analyzing the current situation rationally and working in a professionally cohesive and efficient manner to provide innovative pharmacy services around medication safety and rational use of medicines.<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> We acknowledge that the scope of community pharmacy practice varies considerably across countries, hence, it is important to examine ways in which the profession can assist with the public health response to COVID-19. This can be donenot only by maintaining the continuity of healthcare services but by achieving optimal use of possible services.<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr"><sup>54</sup></xref>
</p><p id="p0170">A limitation of this study is that it was conducted via an online questionnaire, but due to the pandemic that the world is going through, and the public quarantine currently imposed in Jordan, other research methods were possible. There are of course, issues of representativeness in the profile about participants. A majority of the participants were from Amman, the capital, where the availability of CPD workshops can be higher than in other areas of the country. We did not ask the pharmacy students about their study year, which could have played a role in the results obtained; fourth and fifth year students for example are expected to have a wider awareness in the clinical field as compared to students in the earlier years of their study. The survey itself, is also of course not validated, although, items were put together in real-time, based on the literature and reviewed by a team of clinical pharmacy experts.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0175">More than half of the pharmacists and pharmacy students believed that they got enough education previously about epidemics/pandemics, and the majority follow on the latest coronavirus updates on treatments mostly from the media followed by the WHO reports. The majority believed they have a major role in the management of epidemics/pandemics through their pharmacies. Certain gaps in the awareness about COVID-19 were identified highlighting areas of improvement, and generally, pharmacists showed significantly higher awareness score than students, which is, in a way, a satisfactory and expected finding. Higher age of participants, graduating from a public university versus a private university, and attending educational workshops on a yearly basis also significantly affected the awareness level.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Funding</title><p id="p0180">This study was funded by the Deanship of Academic Research at Applied Science Private University, Amman, Jordan.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Specific contributions of each contributor to the paper</title><p id="p0185">All authors were involved in all parts of study and manuscript preparation including literature search, study design, analysis of data, manuscript preparation, and review of manuscript.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of competing interest</title><p id="p0190">None.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Unites States Department of Health and Human Services</collab></person-group><chapter-title>Principles of Epidemiology in Public Health Practice</chapter-title><year>2013</year><publisher-name>Third Edition An Introduction to Applied Epidemiology and Biostatistics</publisher-name><publisher-loc>Atlanta, Georgia, USA</publisher-loc><comment>Available at:</comment><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/ophss/csels/dsepd/SS197" id="intref0010">http://www.cdc.gov/ophss/csels/dsepd/SS197</ext-link><comment>Accessed on 1/4/2020</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="other" id="sref2"><article-title>WHO.
