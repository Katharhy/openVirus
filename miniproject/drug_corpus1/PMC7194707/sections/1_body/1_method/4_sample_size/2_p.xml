 <sup>2</sup>. Where P is the anticipated prevalence (prevalence of awareness here), d is the desired precision, z is the appropriate value from the normal distribution for the desired confidence. Using 95% confidence level, 5% precision level and 50% anticipated prevalence of inappropriate awareness (This conservative prevalence value results in the highest possible sample size that can be used in this study, as no previous studies in this area were found to indicate other prevalence of inappropriate awareness), a sample size of 385 was considered representative of this sampling frame.
