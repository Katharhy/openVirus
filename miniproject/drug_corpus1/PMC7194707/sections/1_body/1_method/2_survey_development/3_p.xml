<p id="p0050">The final version of the questionnaire was organized into three main sections addressing different topics of interest. The 
 <italic>first section</italic> included items to collect demographics data. The 
 <italic>second section</italic> included items aimed at assessing potential participants' current epidemics/pandemics and COVID-19 awareness; here potential participating pharmacists were asked about how much they know about the coronavirus, including a) symptoms, b) modes of transmission, c) how to prevent the transmission and the spread of the virus, and d) awareness about where to access the latest coronavirus updates regarding treatment. For each of these sections, there were several detailed items, e.g. participants when asked, for example, were probed about the modes of coronavirus transmission, such as if the virus can be transmitted from the respiratory droplets from person to person among close contacts and after touching surfaces that were contaminated by the virus.

 </xref> Other questions investigated participants' awareness regarding the highest risk patients in addition to the symptoms that are associated with coronavirus such as fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches and gastrointestinal symptoms.

 </xref> The latest coronavirus updates on treatment were questioned, for example, if hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin have been used as a preventive therapy against coronavirus infection, or if oseltamivir is being used in the management of the coronavirus infection.

 </xref> Other questions in the treatment section were about whether the use of some drugs (glucocorticoids and autoimmune disease medications) increase the susceptibility to contract coronavirus infection.

 </xref> Participants' awareness of how to prevent the transmission and the spread of the virus was assessed in depth as well, such as if washing hands with soap and water for 20 s would be enough to clean the hands, also the least distance that should be kept while counseling patients (2 m/6 feet).

 </xref> Two questions were about exercise, the first one asked if exercise causes antibodies and white blood cells to circulate more rapidly in the body, therefore detecting and combating infections at an early stage, and the second question asked if the brief rise in body temperature during and after exercise prevents bacterial growth, thus increases the body's ability to fight the infection.

 </xref> Participants were asked to provide their email to receive the answers for the awareness questions once the study was completed if they wished to receive this information. Potential participants were also given the choice to view the correct answers via a Facebook page designed for this study. All items in this section required a True/False/Not sure response.
