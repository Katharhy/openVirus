<p id="p0140">Some participants indicated that they were willing to dispense hydroxychloroquine directly to patients. This is quite surprising as hydroxychloroquine has been regulated by the Jordan Food and Drug Administration and is not allowed to be sold in the community pharmacy without a valid prescription. Furthermore, the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine has not been thoroughly established for COVID-19 and the medication has a risk: benefit profile that requires clinical supervision when used. Participantsâ€™ willingness to dispense without prescription may be influenced by the media which has been proposing hydroxychloroquine as the treatment of COVID-19. About 95% of participants in this study reported that they currently follow the latest coronavirus updates on treatments obtaining their information mostly (60% of them) from the media. Highlighting more reliable sources such as the FIP released guideline in March of this year could benefit in providing accurate information to pharmacists globally, by clarifying required coronavirus information for pharmacists and the pharmacy workforce, and presenting evidence-based information.
