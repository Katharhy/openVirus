There are of course, issues of representativeness in the profile about participants. A majority of the participants were from Amman, the capital, where the availability of CPD workshops can be higher than in other areas of the country. We did not ask the pharmacy students about their study year, which could have played a role in the results obtained; fourth and fifth year students for example are expected to have a wider awareness in the clinical field as compared to students in the earlier years of their study. The survey itself, is also of course not validated, although, items were put together in real-time, based on the literature and reviewed by a team of clinical pharmacy experts.</p>
