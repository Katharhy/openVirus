  <title>Number of naïve patients in transmission clusters of the PT-naïve cohort vs time of origin (i.e. most recent common ancestor- MRCA) of those TCs.</title>
  <p>The number of naive patients included in the TCs is represented in the y-axis while the year of origin is in the x-axis. The type of clusters is presented as pairs (dashed line) and clusters ≥3 (solid line) for B (dark red) and G-like (blue). (
   <bold>A</bold>) Time of origin (MRCA) of non-drug resistant TCs in the PT-naïve cohort (
   <bold>B</bold>) Time of origin (MRCA) of all TDR TCs in the PT-naïve cohort. Time of introduction of Highly Effective Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) (1996), time of start of needle and syringe program (NSP) in Portugal (1993), time of increasing number of regimen options (2001) and time of introduction of potent drugs (2007) are marked as grey dotted lines in the x-axis.
