  <p>Prevalence of subtype G in Portuguese originated people during the period of the study (years in the y-axis) when considering the ones who were in transmission clusters (
   <bold>A</bold>). The light blue shades are the confidence intervals of the proportion of patients for a period of two years (dark blue line). The first period was excluded given the few numbers of patients but significance did not change. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Prevalence (dot) and 95% confidence intervals of the Transmitted drug resistance for subtypes B (red) and G (dark blue) for the PT-naive cohort and for each drug group. Geographical differences were observed for TDR when Lisbon was compared with other regions. Significant differences are shown with an asterisk. Abbreviations: NRTI: Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, NNRTI: non-NRTI, PI: Protease inhibitors; TCs: Transmission clusters, vs: versus, %: percentage.
