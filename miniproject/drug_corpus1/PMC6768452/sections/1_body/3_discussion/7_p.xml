<p>In conclusion, we have shown different patterns of transmission of HIV-1 and resistance for the two most important sub-epidemics in Portugal: subtype B and G. Our findings suggest that long-term prevention policies have impacted the transmission of subtype G in Portugal and resulted in decrease of prevalence of this subtype, while subtype B is reflecting the current patterns of HIV-1 transmission that is happening in other European countries.</p>
