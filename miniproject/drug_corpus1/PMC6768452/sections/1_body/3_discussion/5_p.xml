<p>While we described that TDR levels differ between subtypes, with higher levels for B, the overall TDR remains stable across time, which agrees with the European study SPREAD [
 <xref rid="pone.0218226.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. TC analyses indicates that onward transmission of TDR is limited and mainly associated with subtype B and with a decreasing proportion of involvement of treated population since 2006. A higher TDR level for subtype B for NRTIs and PIs could result from several factors: i) The earlier beginning of the treatment for subtype B patients than for subtype G, and/or ii) a lower fitness of G strains in presence of SDRMs, which would cause faster reversion and consequent lower transmissibility level of SDRMs; and/or iii) behavioral patterns affecting the G sub-epidemic dynamics, with slower transmission rates and therefore higher likelihood that SDRM revert before their onward transmission; and/or iv) different treatment strategies for each subtype, which is unlikely because these patients are treated in the same country with similar regimens.
