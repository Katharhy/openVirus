<p>We observed a decline both in the prevalence and in the number of patients present in subtype G TCs in native Portuguese people since 2005 (

This sub-epidemic was unique in Europe and mainly circulating within Portugal. It was imported from West Africa, it was associated with intravenous drug users (IDUs) [

With the introduction of the needle and syringe program in 1993, new infections in IDUs declined and this could be potentially associated with the decrease of viral transmission together with the introduction of HAART in 1996 [
