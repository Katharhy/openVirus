<p>Through our detailed analyses of the Portuguese HIV-1 epidemic, we find strong indications that: 1) transmission of subtype B is associated with younger males; 2) transmission of subtype G is decreasing in Portugal and in the native Portuguese population; 3) transmission of drug resistance has different patterns: males living in 
 <italic>Lisboa</italic> and 
 <italic>Vale do Tejo</italic> regions drive the active and onward transmission of TDR, while this transmission is limited for subtype G and does not correlate with any socio-demographic factors.
