<p>Twenty-six TDR-TCs originated in the last five years for subtype B (active clusters; 
 <xref rid="pone.0218226.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and Table A in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218226.s001">S1 File</xref>). This population was similar to the population involved in subtype B active clusters: male (85%, 64/75), living in 
 <italic>Lisboa</italic> and 
 <italic>Vale do Tejo</italic> region and &lt;35 years old (both 65.3%). Twenty-four TDR-TCs had evidence of onward transmission of SDRMs, those were mainly thymidine analog mutations (TAMs) and/or NNRTIs SDRMs. Seven out of those 24 TDR-TCs with evidence of onward transmission were still active in the last five years. The characteristics of the population reflected that male (77%, 20/26) and living 
 <italic>Lisboa</italic> and 
 <italic>Vale do Tejo</italic> region (69.2%) still drive the transmission of TDR.
