<p>As expected, when transmission of TDR was compared in the subtype B and G sub-epidemics, subtype B was significantly associated with transmission of TDR (OR: 1.75, 1.24–2.49, p = 0.0007). In this subtype, younger age (OR
 <sup>10-years</sup>: 0.53, 0.39–0.73, p&lt;0.0001) and males (OR: 4.53, 1.92–10.66 p = 0.0005) were consistently associated with transmission of TDR.
