When the Portuguese treated population was included as complementary database for the TCs analyses, it was observed that nearly half (n = 39/82) of the TDR-TCs for subtype B included at least one treated patient. However, the number of treated patients in subtype B TDR-TCs decreased over time since 2006 (p&lt;0.0001).
