<p>When considering the time origin of TDR-TCs, 35.3% patients of the PT-naive cohort were involved in TDR-TCs originated between 1996 and 1999, followed by 27.5% between 2000–2003 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218226.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Then, mainly pairs including 27.5% and 25.5% of the TDR-patients were originated in 2000–2003 and 2004–2008, respectively. There were no socio-demographic factors or time trends associated with transmission of TDR. When including controls and comparing people transmitting TDR versus without TDR in TCs of subtype G, age (median: 44, IQR: 34–54 versus 37, 31–46, p = 0.002), and viral load were significant in the univariate analysis (median: 4.9 Log-copies/mm
 <sup>3</sup>, IQR: 4.4–5.7 versus 4.6, 3.9–5.2, p = 0.03). However, those were no longer significant in the multivariate analyses. When TDR-TCs ≥3 were analysed including controls, residence outside of the 
 <italic>Lisboa</italic> and 
 <italic>Vale do Tejo</italic> region was significantly associated with TDR within subtype G in the multivariate analysis (OR: 2.96, 1.29–6.79, p = 0.01). Interestingly, this geographical pattern was no longer observed in the seven onward-TDR clusters, and from those only one was an active-TC. Unlike subtype B, the socio-demographic factors did not show any clear pattern.
