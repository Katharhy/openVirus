<p>When subtype B and G were compared, there were higher prevalence of TDR (OR: 1.47, 1.17–1.89, p = 0.001), NRTIs TDR (OR: 2.98, 1.92–4.76, p &lt;0.0001) and PIs TDR (OR: 1.83, 1.20–3.83, p = 0.003) for subtype B. Subtype B patients with TDR were also older (OR
 <sup>10-years</sup>: 0.68, 0.55–0.82, p = 0.001) and more frequently male (OR: 3.10, 1.83–5.24, p&lt;0.0001).
