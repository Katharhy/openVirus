<p>For subtype G, the TDR prevalence in the PT-naive cohort was 7.6% [118/1557, 6.4–9.0], 1.7% [27/1557; 1.2–2.5] for NRTIs, 4.9% [76/1557; 3.9–6.0] for NNRTIs and 2.2% [34/1557; 1.6–3.0] for PIs. Dual and triple class resistance were found, respectively, in 12.7% and 1.7% of subtypes G patients. Older age, heterosexual transmission and living outside of 
 <italic>Lisboa</italic> and 
 <italic>Vale do Tejo</italic> regions were significantly associated with TDR in subtype G (

 <italic>Lisboa</italic> and 
 <italic>Vale do Tejo</italic> regions associated with TDR in subtype G (OR: 1.87, 1.22–2.88).
