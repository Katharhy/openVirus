<p>In a sub-analysis considering only TCs originating in the last five years of the cohort (active-TCs), 24.1% (120/497) and 14.1% (47/333) TCs were subdivided in smaller active-TCs for subtype B and G, respectively (

Socio-demographic characteristics of the patients in active-TCs and the total cohort were similar (Tables A and B in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218226.s001">S1 File</xref>). Males (OR: 6.56, 3.63–11.85, p&lt;0.0001) and patients living in Lisbon (OR: 2.03, 1.12–3.69, p&lt;0.05) were associated with the active transmission of subtype B when compared with G. Since we completed our cohort with controls retrieved from other databases, it is important to note the active-TCs included mainly controls sampled in Portugal for both subtypes, indicating transmission of HIV-1 predominantly occurs between patients in Portugal.
