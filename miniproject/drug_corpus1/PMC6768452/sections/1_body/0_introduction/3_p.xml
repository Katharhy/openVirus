<p>The epidemiology of HIV-1 in Portugal is unique in comparison to other European countries. Most of the epidemic is caused by parallel sub-epidemics of subtype B and subtype G [
 <xref rid="pone.0218226.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Until 2005, subtype B accounted for approximately 40% of infections and subtype G accounted for 30% [

 <xref rid="pone.0218226.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0218226.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The present large-scale cohort provides the unique opportunity to compare the temporal evolution of the parallel epidemics of these subtypes in the same country. Herein, we use transmission cluster reconstruction to understand the drivers of HIV-1 transmission in Portugal and its correlation with primary drug resistance: prevalence of TDR and factors associated with the spread of TDR. The characterization of HIV-1 transmission in the Portuguese epidemic can help to design targeted prevention strategies.
