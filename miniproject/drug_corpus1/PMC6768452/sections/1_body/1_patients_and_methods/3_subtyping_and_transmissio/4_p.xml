<p>TCs identified were confirmed with Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference, as implemented in BEAST v1.8.2 [

 <xref rid="pone.0218226.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The uncorrelated log-normal relaxed molecular clock with a discretized GTR substitution model and the Bayesian Skygrid coalescent model were used [
 <xref rid="pone.0218226.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Three separate MCMC chains were run for at least 100 million generations. Convergence was determined with Tracer using a burn-in of 10% (

The maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree was constructed with TreeAnnotator after discarding the burn-in, and visualized with FigTree v1.4.2 (
