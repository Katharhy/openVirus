<p>The TCs analyses included the following definitions: (i) A pair was defined as exactly two patients included in a TC, one of them from the PT-naive cohort; (ii) a cluster ≥3 included three or more patients, with at least one from the PT-naive cohort (iii) a TDR-cluster-≥3 or TDR-pair contain at least one PT-naive patient with a sequence harboring a SDRM; (iv) an onward-TDR-cluster had ≥3 patients with the same SDRM in the majority of the patients and at least one from the PT-naive cohort with TDR, which suggest onward transmission of TDR; and (v) active-TCs included transmission of HIV-1 or/and TDR that involves at least one PT-naive patient within a time frame of ≤5 years. The time frame was calculated as the maximum length of time between the ancestral node and the most recent tip (year 2014) of the MCC trees [
