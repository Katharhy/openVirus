<p>HIV-1 subtypes were determined with Rega v3 and COMET v.1.0 [

 <xref rid="pone.0218226.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Subtype G and CRF14_BG were merged in a single group (named hereafter G dataset), given that: i) this genomic region has the same evolutionary origin for G and CRF14_BG strains; ii) the origin of the CRF14_BG strains occurred in the Iberian Peninsula [

 <xref rid="pone.0218226.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]; iii) previously, we reported that the two tools and the manual phylogenetic analyses were not conclusive whether the sequences were G or CRF14_BG in the present cohort [
 <xref rid="pone.0218226.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]; iv) there was no recombination breakpoint in the genomic regions of protease and reverse transcriptase in these sequences. A statistical sub-analysis was performed considering only â€œpure" subtype G strains (excluding CRF14_BG), defined by the concordant assignment of the two subtyping tools [
