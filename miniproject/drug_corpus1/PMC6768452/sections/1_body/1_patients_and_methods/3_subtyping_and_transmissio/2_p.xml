<p>For the TCs analysis, the dataset was complemented with controls retrieved from: (i) the treated population of the Portuguese cohort between 2001 and 2014, (ii) the 50 best-matched sequences to each sequence of the total cohort of subtype B and G, as retrieved by BLAST (

 <xref rid="pone.0218226.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Three subtype D or B reference sequences were used as the outgroup. Sequences with low quality, duplicates and clones were deleted. The resulting dataset was aligned with Muscle [

 <xref rid="pone.0218226.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. To avoid convergent evolution, SDRMs were removed [
 <xref rid="pone.0218226.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The final subtype B and G datasets consisted of 7497 and 4372 sequences, both with a length of 1173 nucleotides (IQR:1173â€“1173).
