<p>A Maximum likelihood tree was constructed with the GTR+ 4Γ nucleotide substitution model and 1000 bootstraps, as implemented in RAxML version 7.5.5. The transmission clusters (TC) were identified with Cluster Picker using a threshold that included a genetic distance of 0.045 and ≥ 80% bootstrap replicates [

 <xref rid="pone.0218226.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. To evaluate the effect of the definition of TCs in the results, sensitivity analyses were performed with varying genetic distances (0.015, 0.030, 0.045, 0.060) and bootstrap supports (70, 90, 95, 98).
