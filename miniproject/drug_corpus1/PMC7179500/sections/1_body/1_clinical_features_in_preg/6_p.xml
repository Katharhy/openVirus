 </xref> The authors described women aged between 22 and 36â€¯years, the majority of whom were in the third trimester. The presenting complaint was fever in 10 patients, with only three presenting with respiratory symptoms. Three patients recovered and were discharged without further complications, but 10 patients suffered complications of pregnancy. Six went into preterm labour, and all 10 ultimately underwent emergency caesarean delivery indicated because of fetal distress or intra-uterine fetal demise.
