<p id="p0220">The major concern about general anaesthesia for caesarean section is the risk of healthcare worker infection and the impact of tracheal intubation on a patient with acute respiratory compromise. Intubation and extubation are AGP and the risk of viral transmission to staff is greater than with non-AGP. Strategies to minimise this must be employed. Checklists, cognitive aids and standardised airway trolleys can improve team performance.

 </xref> Multiple checklists have been produced for intubation and general anaesthesia of COVID-19 infected patients; these checklists are readily transferrable to obstetric practice.

 </xref> Antacid prophylaxis and positioning adjuncts should be added as is routine in obstetric practice. There is an increased risk of difficult and failed airway management in obstetric practice compared with non-obstetric surgery.
