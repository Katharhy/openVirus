<p id="p0260">COVID-19 is an unprecedented international public health emergency and health care services have shifted dramatically to focus on the management of patients with respiratory failure. During the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone in 2016, a decrease in the number of women attending antenatal and postnatal care, and presenting for birth at a healthcare facility, was observed following the outbreak of the epidemic. This corresponded to a 34% increase in the facility-based maternal mortality ratio and a 24% increase in the stillbirth rate.

 </xref> While there are obvious disparities between income and the provision of healthcare in Sierra Leone and the high-income world, this highlights that the battle against COVID-19 should not come at the expense of falling standards in other sectors of healthcare. Within obstetric anaesthesia, dealing with COVID-19 must not undermine the quality of care provided to all obstetric patients. Hospitals should mitigate the impact of fewer in-person antenatal, postnatal and high-risk clinic visits with the use of strategies that include telephone or video appointments. The impact of COVID-19 on the delivery of clinical services may need to be considered and evaluated on each hospital's risk register. In the UK, the NHS ‘Clinical guide for anaesthesia service reorganisation during the coronavirus pandemic’ has highlighted obstetrics as an area that cannot decrease clinical activity and where services must receive ongoing support by anaesthetists.
