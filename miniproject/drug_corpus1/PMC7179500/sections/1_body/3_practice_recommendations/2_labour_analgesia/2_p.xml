<p id="p0125">Neuraxial analgesia, administered in established labour, is recommended for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. This practice may reduce the need for general anaesthesia if urgent delivery is required. There is no evidence that epidural or spinal analgesia or anaesthesia is contraindicated in the presence of coronaviruses. Currently, there are minimal data on haematological function or complications related to neuraxial anaesthesia in COVID-19 parturients. However, mild thrombocytopenia appears to be common in non-pregnant patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 (36% of patients in a Chinese study of 1099 non-pregnant COVID-19 patients had a platelet count of &lt;150 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L).

 </xref> thrombocytopenia should be anticipated in term pregnant patients with COVID-19, irrespective of infection severity. Case data for 61 obstetric COVID-19 patients had platelet counts available for only 19 women, among whom the median (IQR [range]) platelet count was 270 (188–293 [81–366]) × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L. Therefore, we recommend that the platelet count be checked before initiation of epidural or spinal analgesia/anaesthesia, and potentially before the epidural catheter is removed, depending upon timing and infection severity. All standard contraindications to neuraxial block apply, with the caveat that there is no information about platelet function in COVID-19 parturients.
