<p id="p0050">Transmission of the virus occurs through respiratory spread via droplets or aerosols (airborne transmission); the virus replicates in the respiratory epithelium. Droplets are expelled particles that have a propensity to settle quickly to the ground, usually within 1â€¯m of the site of generation.

 </xref> Aerosols, expelled particles that are comparatively smaller in size than droplets, can remain suspended in the air for prolonged periods. This can lead to exposure of a greater number of individuals to possible infection at a greater distance from the source.
