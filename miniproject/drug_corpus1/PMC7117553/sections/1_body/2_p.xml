<p id="Par4">At present, there is insufficient data as to whether patients with rheumatic diseases or those using immunosuppressive therapy who contract COVID-19 are at increased risk of worse outcomes, although researchers are beginning to report COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic diseases

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>. Existing literature suggests that there is a substantial increase in serious infections in those treated with commonly used anti-rheumatic agents such as biologic drugs, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors and glucocorticoids

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>
 </sup>, and there is a particular risk of Herpes zoster infection in those patients receiving JAK inhibitors

 </sup>. However, extrapolation of this data to SARS-CoV-2 infection is problematic given the heterogeneity in specific drug-associated adverse events and the potentially protective role of immunosuppressive drugs in abating a severe inflammatory response to infection. During previous coronavirus epidemics, such as the 2002â€“2003 SARS-CoV epidemic and the MERS-CoV that has caused sporadic infections globally since 2012, comorbid disease or diabetes portended a worse outcome in some reports

 </sup>, but not in others

 </sup>. However, only limited data on the disease course of those taking immunosuppressive therapies and who contracted SARS or MERS have been published to date, restricting inferences from these previous coronavirus outbreaks
