<p>Emerging data for abnormal liver enzymes seen in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients raises several questions. Are these abnormalities due to direct viral damage, drug-induced liver injury (DILI), unknown pre-existing liver disease, or indirect consequence of viral damage to other systems (cardiopulmonary, haemostasis)? Liver samples from infected patients were examined, and moderate microvascular steatosis with mild lobular and portal activity were reported [
