<p>For instance, it has been shown that patients with SARS-CoV-2 show an increase of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCAP1), which is a chemokine known to exacerbate steatohepatitis [

 <xref rid="B43-pathogens-09-00430" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. NAFLD patients, alongside those with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, are often treated with ACE inhibitors, which have anti-inflammatory and anti-obesity effects. While there has not been a reported effect on mortality of ACE inhibitor drug use, it has been speculated that ACE inhibitors up-regulate the ACE2 receptor and therefore can increase viral load in patients taking these medications [

 <xref rid="B44-pathogens-09-00430" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. NAFLD patients often exhibit increased cytokine levels due to their chronic inflammatory stage. Prins and Olinga suggest that this predisposition, in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, could expedite the progression of NAFLD to a more aggressive non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [
