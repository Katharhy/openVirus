<p>Regardless of the source of injury, it is clear that managing those with pre-existing liver disease needs to be thought out carefully during this pandemic and in future outbreaks of coronavirus infection. These patients are at higher risk of being infected and of more severe COVID-19 disease and should be practising strict social distancing or shielding if they take steroids or immunosuppressive therapies [

A new international registry developed between the University of Oxford and the University of North Carolina has shown that those with decompensated cirrhosis are at most risk and are calling on hospitals to routinely test patients with deranged liver function/enzyme results for SARS-CoV-2 so early observation and treatment may prevent further deterioration. The British Liver Trust also suggests that all patients with decompensated cirrhosis practice social shielding, a step up from social distancing, even though it is not yet part of the formal guidance [
