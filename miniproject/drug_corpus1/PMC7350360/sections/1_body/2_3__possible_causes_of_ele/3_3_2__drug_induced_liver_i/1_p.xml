<p>A study by Fan et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-pathogens-09-00430" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] has raised the question of DILI as a possible cause of liver injury seen in COVID-19 patients. They show that patients given lopinavir or ritonavir after admission presented higher incidence of liver injury and required longer stay in hospital. It is also possible that these patients were given antivirals because they had a more severe presentation that might have affected their liver in the first place. Though recent evidence suggests lopinavir and ritonavir had no clinical effect on SARS-CoV-2, perhaps future application of antiviral drugs should also take into account their effects on the liver [
