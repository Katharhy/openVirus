It has recently been reported that in certain patient groups, often younger patients, micro vascular thromboses can cause end stage organ damage and may potentially affect the liver. It is also notable that high levels of alkaline phosphatase have been used as a prognostic value for ischemic stroke patients and in identifying high risk haemorrhagic transformation and are also shown to be high in COVID-19 patients suffered thrombotic events, although in other cases, alkaline phosphatase levels have been normal or very mildly raised [
