<p>ACE2 is found in a variety of tissues (heart, liver, lung, bladder, kidney, and pancreas); however, it is known to be abundant in alveolar cells accounting for the viral injury to lungs of infected patients [
 <xref rid="B22-pathogens-09-00430" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. While there is conflicting evidence of ACE2 receptor density in the liver, current reports using single-cell RNA sequencing have confirmed that cholangiocytes have the highest levels of ACE2 receptors [

 <xref rid="B27-pathogens-09-00430" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Hu et al. used in silico and in vitro techniques to sample hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, Kupffer cells and other components of fresh liver samples [
 <xref rid="B25-pathogens-09-00430" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. They found that 59.7% of cholangiocytes had ACE2 receptors in comparison to only 2.6% of hepatocytes. This data suggests that cholangiocytes have the same percentage of ACE2 receptors as aveolar type 2 cells [
 <xref rid="B25-pathogens-09-00430" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Further, it has been suggested that infection of cholangiocytes may be the source of the virus found in faeces [
 <xref rid="B28-pathogens-09-00430" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. While the presence of a receptor is needed for the virus to gain entry into the host, it is still unclear if other conditions are also needed or could possibly aid the virus.
