<p>SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus known to cause respiratory infections with severity ranging from mild cold- and flu-like symptoms to fatal pneumonia. While respiratory based, if severe, it can cause dysfunction of other organs such as the kidneys and liver. It is likely that the liver injury seen in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients is multifactorial and the result of a combination of inflammatory response, sepsis, hypoxia, microthrombotic events, DILI, and viral damage. Pre-existent liver disease is an independent risk factor of death in SARS-CoV-2 related infection, and severity of liver damage most likely correlates with COVID-19 disease severity. Nevertheless, abnormalities in the liver function tests of these patients, without pre-existing liver disease, may have prognostic significance and predict adverse outcomes. Patients with chronic liver disease and in particular those on immunosuppressive therapies including liver transplant recipients should be particularly careful and managed according to internationally accepted guidelines regarding strict social distancing or shielding.</p>
