<p>COVID-19 disease refers to infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Incubation time is within 14 days following exposure, with a median of four days [

 <xref rid="B14-pathogens-09-00430" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], infection initially presents with a broad spectrum of symptoms that typically includes general malaise, fever (commonly over 37 °C), dry cough, shortness of breath, anosmia/dysgueusia, headaches, and muscle aches [

 <xref rid="B17-pathogens-09-00430" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Some other viral related symptoms, albeit less common, can also be seen—sore throat, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, skin rashes, and vasculitic manifestations. Severe infection seems to present a biphasic pattern [

 <xref rid="B21-pathogens-09-00430" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. A first phase (‘viremia’), corresponding to viral invasion of the body, causes symptoms as described above. This phase is followed by an ‘inflammatory’ phase, corresponding to excessive host inflammatory response (‘cytokine storm’), responsible for severe cardiopulmonary manifestations, sometimes leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock, and death [

 <xref rid="B21-pathogens-09-00430" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Respiratory symptoms, in particular hypoxia, have been the main indication for hospitalisation.
