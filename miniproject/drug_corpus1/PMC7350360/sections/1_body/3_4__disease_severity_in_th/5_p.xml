<p>Many epidemiological reports regarding treatment and prognosis of COVID-19 syndrome are based on the general population who would have had healthy immunity before viral infection, thus overlooking important data for immunocompromised patients [

At the time of this publication, no significant conclusions have been drawn regarding the outcome of COVID-19 in patients in receipt of immunosuppressive therapy. More research into cytokine activation, T cell signalling and migration, and viral clearance are needed [

The postulated anti-inflammatory benefits of immunosuppression should be balanced against the possibility of inhibiting anti-viral immunity by delaying viral shedding and possible organ rejection for those patients having undergone transplant [
