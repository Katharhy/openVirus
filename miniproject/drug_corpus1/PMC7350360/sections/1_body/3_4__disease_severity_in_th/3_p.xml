<p>Another study of 90 SARS-CoV-2-positive transplant patients in New York City also described reducing antimetabolites, steroids, and/or calcineurin inhibitors in 55 patients [
 <xref rid="B53-pathogens-09-00430" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Pereira et al. categorized patients as mild (outpatient care only), moderate (admission as general inpatient), or severe (mechanical ventilation, admission to intensive care unit, or death) [
 <xref rid="B53-pathogens-09-00430" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Within this group, 24% presented with mild disease, 46% moderate, and 30% severe. As with other studies, advanced age and comorbidities were associated with disease severity [

 <xref rid="B41-pathogens-09-00430" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Type of transplant and time of viral infection after transplant were not statistically significant factors [
 <xref rid="B53-pathogens-09-00430" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Laboratory values were similar between moderate and severe cases, though albumin was lower in the severe group [
