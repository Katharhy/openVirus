<p>Zhu et al. reported on 10 SARS-CoV-2-positive renal transplant recipients in Wuhan, China [
 <xref rid="B51-pathogens-09-00430" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. All were admitted to hospital with significant progressive pneumonia. The severity of pneumonia in this group was recorded as greater than their infected family members and others in the local population. In accordance with Influenza A/HINI guidance, calcineurin inhibitors were stopped in seven patients for nine days and in one patient for 12 days [
