  <p>Liver injury in SARS-CoV-2. There are multiple reports of increased liver enzymes and liver dysfunction in SARS-CoV-2 patients presenting with elevated alanine transaminase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), bilirubin, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1). Taken together with lower levels of albumin, this points to liver damage with possible injury to biliary cells. Liver injury is most likely multifactorial and seen mainly in patients at the severe end of the disease spectrum.</p>
