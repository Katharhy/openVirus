<p id="p0475">In this paper we have developed a stochastic model of measles transmission dynamics with double dose vaccination. The governing equations for both deterministic and stochastic models have been formulated. The basic qualitative behaviors of the two models have been analyzed. We have determined a closed form expressions for the basic reproductive numbers of the models and showed that the disease-free equilibrium point is locally asymptotically stable if the basic reproductive number is less than one in each case. Numerical simulations have been also carried out to examine the increase or decrease of the size of the population over time and investigate the effect of basic parameters like the rate of contact and recovery on the infected population. According to the numerical results, it is clear that real world problems such as disease are not deterministic in nature so including random effects to the model gives us a more realistic way of modeling measles epidemics diseases. So, stochastic model analysis is more effective compared to deterministic model analysis in studying the measles transmission dynamics with double dose vaccination. Therefore, we advice the use of stochastic analysis in studying dynamics of infectious diseases, decrease in contact between susceptible and infective population, increase receiving double dose vaccination coverage, combination of awareness and treatment to elimination measles in the community.</p>
