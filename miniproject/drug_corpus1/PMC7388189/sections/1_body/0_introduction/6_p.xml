<p id="p0030">The deterministic approach has some limitations in the mathematical modeling transmission of an infectious disease. They are simple to analyses but give less information, hard to perform estimation because it is not probabilistic and also repeated simulation from identical model result to one realization. The stochastic model of a process describes the uncertainty about the process development. Uncertainty is generated by randomness, which is a characteristic feature of the evolution of universe, and by ignorance, which is a characteristic feature of mankind.</p>
