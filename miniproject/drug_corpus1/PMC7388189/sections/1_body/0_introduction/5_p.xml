<p id="p0025">Mathematical modeling is the process of expressing real world phenomena using mathematical principles and formula. Mathematical Modeling can be classified into deterministic models and stochastic models based on certainty. Mathematical models have been applied to infectious diseases since the middle of the 20th century. Infectious diseases like measles have been analyzed by both deterministic and stochastic epidemiology models.</p>
