<p id="p0045">All the above studies have developed deterministic as well as stochastic mathematical models of measles transmission dynamics. But there is no research done so far focusing on stochastic model of measles transmission dynamics with double dose vaccination by partitioning first and second dose vaccinated classes to the best of the knowledge the authors. But we need to be sure about the mentioned gap.</p>
