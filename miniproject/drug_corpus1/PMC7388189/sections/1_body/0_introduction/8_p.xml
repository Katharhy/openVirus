<p id="p0040">Few essential researches have been done on the transmission dynamics of measles in the last decade. The study done by (
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Ochoche &amp; Gweryina, 2014</xref>) performed a SIR mathematical model of measles with vaccination and two phases of infectiousness. Their study realized that the disease will certainly be eliminated if all susceptible are vaccinated. They therefore suggested that the measles vaccine should be made compulsory such that no child is allowed to enter school without evidence of at least two dose measles vaccination (
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Raymond, 2016</xref>). studied stochastic modeling of the transmission dynamics of measles with vaccination control. The study has shown the effectiveness of stochastic analysis in studying the dynamics of measles compared to deterministic analysis. Moreover, the study done by (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Edward et al., 2015</xref>) performed a mathematical model for control and elimination of the transmission dynamics of measles. Elimination of measles requires maintaining the effective reproduction number less than 1, as well as achieving low levels of susceptibility. Simulations of variables of the model have been performed and sensitivity analysis of different parameters has been done using MATLAB. Additionally (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Christopher, Ibrahim, &amp; Shamaki, 2017</xref>), developed a mathematical model for the dynamics of measles under the combined effect of vaccination at the susceptible class, and administering measles drug therapy to screened infected individuals in the exposed class. The results of the numerical experiments revealed that eradicating measles is more efficient if susceptible individuals are vaccinated and followed by drug therapy to screened infected individuals in the exposed class. The study by (
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">NigusiePurnachandra, 2017</xref>) also considered and investigated SEIR mathematical modeling and simulation study for the control and transmission dynamics of measles. Infected has been split into two: Infected catarrh, and infected eruption. Numerical simulation was conducted using ode 45 of MATLAB. Similarly (
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abu &amp; Okutachi, 2017</xref>), studied simulating deterministic and stochastic differential equation models of measles outbreak considering population size and initial vaccination regime. Numerical results reveal that the solutions of the stochastic model display strong stochastic components for small susceptible population sizes. Thus, the solution of the deterministic model is a limit of the solutions of the stochastic counterpart for larger susceptible population sizes (
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">SowoleSangare et al., 2019</xref>). also studied on the existence, uniqueness, stability of solution and numerical simulations of a mathematical model for measles disease. They carried out the stability of the model, established the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the model. Runge-Kutta fourth order method was used to solve the model numerically. This was used to do a simulation of the model by using MATLAB to determine the best strategies to adopt in controlling the measles disease.
