 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.Â 2</xref> for deterministic case we observe that the number of population in all compartments decreases as time increases, except the number in the recovered population in which case the number of individuals recovered rises steadily as time increases. The stochastic case in the same figure shows that susceptible, infected ones are decreasing from the beginning till a certain time t, where it starts decreasing to be zero. This means that vaccinating first and second dose (double dose) contributes in controlling the measles disease and helps to eradicate the disease from the population after a certain period of time, while keeping the recovered population increasing. We can observe that the solutions of the deterministic model equations are smooth in nature whereas that of the stochastic model exhibit randomness behavior and more effectively.
