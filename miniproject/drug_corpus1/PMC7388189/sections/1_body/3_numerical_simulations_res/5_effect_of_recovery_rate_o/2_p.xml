 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, we investigate the impact of recovery rate α on the size of infected population. The simulation results were obtained by varying the value of recovery rate and keeping the other parameters constant. The numerical results revealed that the number of infected population decreases with increasing the value of recovery rate α. When the value of recovery rate increased from 0.14286 to 0.24286; there is a significant and regular decrease in the number of infected population. Moreover, for the case of α = 0.44286 the number of infected people rapidly decreases. It is also observed in the figure that for the deterministic model (left) the infected population decreases smoothly but in the stochastic model (right) it decreases irregularly. Hence, we can analyze that when the value of the recovery rate increase and other parameters are kept constant, the measles disease transmission eliminate from the community.
