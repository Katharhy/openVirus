 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> we tried to demonstrate the impact of the contact rate β on the number of infected population. The numerical results were obtained by varying the value of contact rate β while keeping other parameters constant. In the deterministic model (left), when the value of contact rate β increased from 0.09091 to 0.3, there is a significant and regular increase in the number of infected population. Moreover, when β = 0.6 the number of infected people quickly increases above 25 and start to go down a bit, but still manages to be higher than the previous two cases. The results from the stochastic model (right) are also increasing maintaining their perturbing property due to the randomness behavior. However, the overall outcome is that the number of infected population still increases significantly with increasing the value of contact rate β. Therefore, we can infer that, when the contact rate β is increasing and other parameters are kept constant, the measles disease transmission expands in the community.
