 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> displays the plot of the number in the population who got vaccinated second dose against time by varying the value of receiving second dose of vaccine rate b and keeping the other parameters constant. When the value of receiving second dose of vaccine rate b increased from 0.8 to 1.8; there is a significant and regular increase in the number of vaccinated second population. Moreover, when b = 2.8 the number of vaccinated second population quickly increases. It is also observed in the figure that for deterministic model (left) the vaccinated (second dose) population decreases smoothly but for the stochastic model (right) it decreases irregularly. Therefore, receiving second dose (double dose) of vaccine the target population has a significant contribution in eliminating the measles disease from the community.
