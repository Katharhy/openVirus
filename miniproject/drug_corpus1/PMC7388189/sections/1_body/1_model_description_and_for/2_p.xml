 <italic>R(t).</italic> Susceptible(S): individuals who have not yet been infected with the disease, but are susceptible to the disease, and so might become infected. Vaccinated first dose (V
 <sub>1</sub>): individuals who have received first dose of vaccine. Vaccinated second dose (V
 <sub>2</sub>): individuals who have received second dose of vaccine. Infected (I): individuals who have been infected with the disease and are capable of spreading the disease to susceptible. Recovered (R): individuals who have been infected and then recovered from the disease, those are not able to be infected again.
