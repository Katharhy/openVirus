<p id="para0028">If infection with COVID-19 is diagnosed on the day of transplantation (day 0), then HCT should proceed as intended, with no delays in the PBSC or bone marrow infusion. Convalescent plasma infusions, if indicated for COVID-19 infection on a clinical trial, should be avoided on the day of transplantation to minimize the risk of allergic reactions.</p>
