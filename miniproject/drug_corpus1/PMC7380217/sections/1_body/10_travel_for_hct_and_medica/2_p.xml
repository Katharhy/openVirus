<p id="para0043">Patients who underwent HCT in a foreign country should avoid travel back to their respective countries in the immediate post-HCT period, especially if they are currently residing in a country/state/province/city that has an extremely high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. HCT recipients who will require frequent visits in the initial months following HCT should remain at the original transplantation center until their clinical condition stabilizes (eg, 3 to 4 months after allogeneic HCT).</p>
