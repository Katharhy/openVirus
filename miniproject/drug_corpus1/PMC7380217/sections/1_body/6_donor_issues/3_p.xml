<p id="para0024">Ideally, a backup donor should be available, but this might not be possible in all cases. PBSCs should be used unless there is a strong indication for using bone marrow. The rationale for using PBSCs is less need for blood transfusions (due to earlier engraftment), no need for using inpatient rooms and personal protective equipment for bone marrow harvest, and faster neutrophil engraftment, which may result in earlier discharge of recipients. Coordination with the local and international authorities (especially with the border customs officials in certain countries) may be needed to ensure trouble-free transport of cell therapy products. Donor safety issues must be a top priority during this pandemic, and the World Marrow Donor Association and the local donor stem cell registry recommendations should be followed. In some countries, the use of umbilical cord blood units as a backup strategy may be preferred, depending on the existing resources and current practices.</p>
