<p id="para0012">Two kinds of tests are available for COVID-19: a viral test using PCR to detect the virus and an antibody-based test to detect the occurrence of previous infection (which can take 1 to 3 weeks after infection to become positive). Notably, PCR-based testing does not distinguish between live and dead SARS-CoV-2. For diagnosing COVID-19 infection in HCT recipients, testing with real-time RT-PCR ideally should be done on nasopharyngeal swabs; however, sputum samples and nasal swabs also can be used 
 <xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Each center needs to understand the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the specific test being used, which may be affected by the regional prevalence of the infection. Pitfalls in SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostics have been reported recently 
 <xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. At present, there is no known role for antibody-based (serologic) testing for SARS-CoV-2 for diagnostic purposes. Exposure (especially to contacts with COVID-19 patients) and symptom history, physical examination, and chest imaging are helpful in evaluating HCT recipients.
