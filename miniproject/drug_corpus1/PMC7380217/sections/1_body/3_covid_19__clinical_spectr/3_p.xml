<p id="para0013">In the event that the diagnosis is not clear, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage may be pursued in selected cases, albeit with extreme caution because this procedure also puts the pulmonologist at risk of acquiring the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Specific symptoms/findings ascribed to SARS-CoV-2 infection including fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle/body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea. The degree of symptoms may range from asymptomatic (eg, no fever) to mild to severe

Suspected patients with classic COVID-19 symptoms in an appropriate medical setting may be cohorted or isolated as soon as possible in special wards or units (temporary or permanent depending on the institutional policies and/or resources). Only when the RT-PCR test comes back negative should these patients be considered standard-risk HCT recipients and managed accordingly. In the absence of appropriate diagnostic tools (ie, RT-PCR), physicians may need to rely on history, physical exam, and chest imaging, in which case a chest computed tomography scan may be helpful, as it is more sensitive than a chest radiograph.
