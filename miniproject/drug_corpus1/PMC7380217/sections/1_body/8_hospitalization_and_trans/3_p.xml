<p id="para0033">HCT recipients with suspected COVID-19 should not stay in a positive-pressure room. They should be tested in a neutral-pressure (or negative-pressure) room (a private room if available). If RT-PCR is not available and/or suspicion is high, the patient should be kept in a private room (neutral or negative pressure) if possible, or cohorted. It may be advisable to perform these tests immediately before admission and wait for results if possible.</p>
