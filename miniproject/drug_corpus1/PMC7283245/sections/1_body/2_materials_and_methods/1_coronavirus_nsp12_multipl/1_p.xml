<p id="Par10">From the orf1ab polyprotein (Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolate Wuhan-Hu-1) deposited in the NCBI (NC_045512.2), we selected the nsp12 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence (protein id. YP_009725307.1). A BLASTp was performed and representative sequences of current SARS-CoV-2, SARS- and MERS-related coronaviruses as well as two bat betacoronaviruses were downloaded. In order to analyze the possibility that mutations might have emerged during the four months of the COVID-19 pandemic, we downloaded sequences from samples collected in April from the GISAID platform
