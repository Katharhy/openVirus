<p id="Par3">In recent years we have witnessed the outbreaks of other “emergent” RNA viruses, including the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in 2009, ebola in 2014 and 2018–2019, and zika in 2016, in addition to the endemic dengue and yellow fever viral outbursts, which annually infect hundreds of thousands of patients in tropical regions

Combined with their high mutation rates, large population sizes and fast replicative cycles, RNA viral populations quickly explore a vast number of mutational landscapes, which can lead to the emergence of new infectious viruses in humans or viruses with different pathogenic properties. In contrast with other RNA viruses, coronaviruses and other families of the
