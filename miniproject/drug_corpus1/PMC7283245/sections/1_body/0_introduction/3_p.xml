<p id="Par4">As of today, there are no broad-spectrum antivirals available to treat the vast majority of emergent RNA viral infections. This is due to the extreme variability of RNA viral proteomes and the absence of conserved therapeutic targets at which antivirals could be aimed. Currently, the WHO is undertaking the “Solidarity clinical trial for COVID-19 treatments”, a global effort aimed at discovering an efficient treatment against the COVID-19 among those pharmacological resources that have proven to be effective

 </sup>. The drugs being repurposed in this global effort include HIV-1 protease inhibitors Lopinavir/Ritonavir; Interferon β-1a; the anti-malarial hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine as viral entry inhibitors, and viral RdRp inhibitor Remdesivir. Furthermore, over 950 clinical trials worldwide are registered in the WHO platform as of April 17
