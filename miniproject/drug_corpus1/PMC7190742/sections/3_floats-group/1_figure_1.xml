  <p>HCV phylogenetic and recombinant analysis. (
   <bold>a</bold>) A representative subset of N = 212 study 5′UTR-core region sequences are shown as white branches on a Neighbor-Joining tree. Reference genotypes for each clade are shown on the outer ring of the radial tree and branches with study sequences in them are highlighted in color. Relevant nodes with bootstrap &gt;70 are labeled with a black square. (
   <bold>b</bold>) The recombinant sequence (IN-M75) is shown in blue with reference strains in black. The classifications and Genbank accession numbers of related strains are labeled. A similarity plot (
   <bold>c</bold>) and a bootscan plot (
   <bold>d</bold>) for the recombinant sequence using a 200 basepair window, 40 basepair steps, Kimura 2-paramter, and T/t 2.0 conditions. Consensus sequences for reference strains were used for these plots inclusive of all subgenotypes for each classification.
