<p id="Par3">The incredible sequence diversity of HIV and HCV presents unique challenges to diagnostic tests, which fundamentally rely on sequence conservation to deliver accurate results. With 2 types, 4 HIV-1 groups, 9 Group M subtypes, and over 100 recognized circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), HIV is a highly divergent virus
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup>. Part of this diversity is driven by recombination between strains in co-infected individuals, which has led to the establishment of CRFs and unique recombinant forms (URFs) as increasingly prevalent strains globally
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup>. Although HCV is also capable of recombination, it is far less common with mostly isolated cases of recombinant strains identified and only one recognized circulating recombinant form; CRF01_1b2k
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup>. However, HCV strains are more divergent than HIV strains
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
 </sup>, with 8 major genotypes and more than 80 subgenotypes identified to date
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>. Global molecular surveillance of circulating HIV and HCV strains is essential for defining the true extent of viral diversity and to ensure that diagnostic tests, vaccines, and therapeutics keep pace with viral evolution.
