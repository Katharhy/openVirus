<p id="Par20">Geographical stratification of the HIV and HCV strains identified herein confirmed that higher levels of viral diversity were present in cities near borders with neighboring countries where drug trafficking routes exist

 </sup>. Notably, the HCV strains that predominated in the Northeastern city of Imphal varied dramatically from those identified in the Northern border city of Amritsar (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Furthermore, a greater number of different HCV strains were encountered in both of these cities (7–8 total) than were found in either of the Central cities of Kanpur (5) or New Delhi (4) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). These results support the hypothesis that new strains have been imported to India via the Golden Triangle and Golden Crescent opium trade routes

 </sup> (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Although HCV samples were not available for sequencing from the Aizawl site in Northeastern India, this was the only location where CRF01_AE HIV strains were identified, which is consistent with the high prevalence of CRF01_AE in Southeast Asia
