 </sup>. The study was approved by the institutional review boards (IRB) of YRGCARE in Chennai, India, and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore. The study survey participants provided verbal informed consent as approved by the IRBs. Individuals were eligible to participate if they were 18 years or older. All methods were carried out in accordance with the protocols approved by the IRB. A subset of samples with sufficient viral load (&gt;3.5 log IU/ml) and remaining volume from 5 cities were included in this analysis: Amritsar and Delhi in North India, Kanpur in Central India and Imphal and Aizawl in Northeastern India. Samples were tested for HIV on-site using three rapid tests as previously described
