<p id="Par11">To compare serological assay performance, all HCV and HIV specimens with sufficient remaining volume underwent additional serological testing on the ARCHITECT i2000 instrument (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA). HCV specimens were screened with the anti-HCV and HCV antigen tests and HIV specimens were screened with the HIV Ag/Ab Combo test according to the package inserts.
