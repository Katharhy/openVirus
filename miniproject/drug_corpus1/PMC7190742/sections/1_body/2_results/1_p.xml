<p id="Par12">In an HIV/HCV study conducted amongst PWID in India, plasma specimens were collected from N = 5000 participants across five cities as part of the evaluation assessment of a cluster randomized trial: Amritsar, Aizawl, Delhi, Imphal, and Kanpur (1000/site)

 </sup>. Leftover specimens with sufficient volume were selected for further molecular characterization in this study if viral load was at least 3 log 10 IU/ml (HCV) or 3 log 10 copies/ml (HIV). In total, N = 975 leftover plasma specimens with sufficient volume and viral load for sequencing that were collected from N = 477 HIV antibody positive, N = 220 HCV antibody positive, and N = 278 dual positive study participants were sequenced to identify the viral strains present (Supplemental Fig. 1). HIV viral loads for these specimens ranged from 3.5 to 6.9 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/ml (median 4.8 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/ml) and HCV viral loads for included specimens ranged from 3.8 to 7.3 log
 <sub>10</sub> IU/ml (median 5.6 log
 <sub>10</sub> IU/ml).
