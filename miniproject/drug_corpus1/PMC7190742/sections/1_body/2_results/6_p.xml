<p id="Par17">To characterize the prevalence of HIV drug resistance mutations circulating in PWID in India, the N = 742 HIV 
 <italic>pol</italic> IN sequences were further examined for the presence of major integrase inhibitor (INSTI) resistance mutations as defined by the Stanford HIV drug resistance database (HIVDB)

 </sup>. The overall prevalence of INSTI resistance mutations was low, with N = 4 (0.5%) specimens identified with a pure INSTI mutation (E92Q, E138A, or R263K) and N = 7 (0.9%) with a mixture of wildtype and resistance mutations at the amino acid 92 position. Since INSTIs were not used by public-sector clinics during the period of this study

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>
 </sup>, the identified resistance mutations are likely due to the natural level of variation in the 
 <italic>pol</italic> IN gene, although it is also possible that these strains were imported. The detection of these INSTI resistance mutations at three different sites (Aizawl, Delhi, and Amritsar) confirms that INSTI resistance was not localized to a single city.
