<p id="Par14">Unlike the diversity encountered within the HCV sequences, the HIV sequences sampled from these same cities were substantially less diverse, although recombinant strains were identified. Either the HIV 
 <italic>env</italic> IDR (N = 16 samples), 
 <italic>pol</italic> IN (N = 87 samples), or both regions (N = 652 samples) were sequenced from a total of N = 755 HIV positive specimens. Altogether, N = 668 
 <italic>env</italic> IDR and N = 739 
 <italic>pol</italic> IN sequences were classified, the majority of which were classified as HIV subtype C (728, 96.7%) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). A small number of URFs were identified with discordant IDR and IN classifications or recombination detected in at least one region (19, 2.5%). The majority of the URFs were A/C recombinants (13, 68.4%), with B/C or CRF15 recombinants (3, 15.8%) and unclassifiable regions also identified (3, 15.8%) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). URFs containing at least one region classified as a CRF were only identified in the Northeastern city of Aizawl (CRF15, CRF01) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Overall, URFs were identified in all of the sites except Kanpur, with the highest prevalence found in New Delhi (15, 4.7%) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Three CRF01_AE infections were identified exclusively in Aizawl (0.4%), and New Delhi was the only site were subtype A infections were found (N = 3, 0.4%), consistent with unique localized epidemics (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).
