<p id="Par16">All characterized specimens with residual volume were screened with additional serological assays to evaluate their performance with diverse clinical specimens from India. Amongst the N = 674 HIV specimens available for testing on the ARCHITECT HIV Combo assay, all specimens were reactive, giving an assay sensitivity of 100% (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Likewise, the sensitivity of the ARCHITECT Anti-HCV assay was 100%, with all N = 488 HCV specimen with sufficient volume detected as reactive (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). A total of N = 474 remaining HCV specimens were subsequently screened with the ARCHITECT HCV antigen assay and the results were compared to HCV viral load. A total of N = 470 samples were detected as reactive or grayzone-reactive (between 0.80 to 0.99 S/CO), resulting in an assay sensitivity of 99.16%, consistent with previous reports

 </sup>. Unfortunately, replicate testing could not be completed for the four samples that were nonreactive due to sample depletion. The sequences for these four samples confirmed that they were of the most common genotypes found in the study; 1a, 3a, and two 3b samples, suggesting that genotype alone could not explain the nonreactive results for these samples. Furthermore, point mutations in the detection epitopes of these specimens were also present in samples of similar viral load with detectable HCV antigen.
