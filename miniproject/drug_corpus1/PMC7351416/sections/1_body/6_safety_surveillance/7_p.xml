<p id="p0565">As was done prior to launch of the 2009â€“2010 H1N1 vaccines, active surveillance systems should calculate the incidence of background rates of AESI prior to vaccine roll out 
 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Establishing these background rates of disease prior to vaccination allows for a stable rate, based upon multiple years of data, so that the rates of these outcomes after vaccine roll out can be compared. CEPI is developing a comprehensive list of AESIs. The incidence of these outcomes will vary tremendously based upon the region, underlying population, and methods use for case ascertainment which will be highly dependent on the characteristics of the active or sentinel surveillance system. Surveillance in LMIC must be established now, in preparation for vaccine roll out, so that background rates of AESIs can be calculated.
