<p id="p0570">There are several approaches that can be used to establish active surveillance systems in LMIC. There is very limited access to large healthcare administrative databases in LMIC. India and South Africa (the only country in Africa) have such administrative databases though with limited vaccine safety experience. Other LMIC have registries or sentinel site-based surveillance capacity, such as hospital surveillance, that can be very useful for some outcomes. There are a large number of international collaborations with LMIC institutions that have the potential to be used as active vaccine safety surveillance sites. For example, the NIH Fogarty International Center Global Health Program has over 80 partner LMIC institutions and many academic institutions have well established sites in LMIC. Such sites require a defined population and local capacity to collect primary data. Efficiencies can be accomplished by global standards for AESIs and development of harmonized case definitions (as is being done by the Brighton Collaboration under contract with CEPI). However, the time is now to develop these sites for vaccine safety assessment and calculate background rates prior to vaccine introduction.</p>
