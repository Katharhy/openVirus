<p id="p0560">Active and sentinel surveillance systems are necessary to rapidly and rigorously evaluate the safety profile of the vaccines. Many high-income countries have large healthcare administrative databases to conduct such active surveillance and have vaccine experience. However, low-and middle-income countries (LMIC) generally lack the capacity to conduct active safety surveillance and do not have large healthcare administrative databases. As equitable access to the vaccines for people during epidemics is imperative, active safety surveillance in LMIC is critical to ensure that safety surveillance is also equitable.</p>
