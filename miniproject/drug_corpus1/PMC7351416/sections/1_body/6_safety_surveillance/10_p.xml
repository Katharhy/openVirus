<p id="p0580">The COVID-19 pandemic is a global crisis with enormous human and financial costs. Present efforts aimed at curbing the pandemic through social distancing may be helpful. Ultimately, a vaccine is likely the most important long-term tool. However, we must invest in active vaccine safety surveillance globally, and most particularly in LMIC, to ensure the potential of a COVID-19 vaccine is realized. With crisis comes opportunity to expand our global vaccine safety system to meet the needs of COVID-19 and other routine and emergency use vaccines. The WHO Global Vaccine Safety Blueprint 2.0 offers the framework to do so and must be fully funded and implemented.</p>
