<p id="p0545">Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) (serious or non-serious) are events of significant medical and scientific concern specific to the sponsorâ€™s program or product. These require ongoing monitoring and communication by the investigator to the sponsor and might require further investigation to characterize and understand them; and rapid communication by the trial sponsor to regulators. They could be related to vaccines in general, specific vaccine platforms or the disease. AESIs reporting and assessment is done with high priority as they could change the benefit-risk profile of the vaccine or require prompt public communication. For the COVID-19 vaccines, the AESIs could potentially include vaccine-enhanced disease (vaccination could make subsequent infection with SARS-CoV-2 more severe) 
 <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Enhanced disease, with a few deaths, was associated with the Dengue vaccine and had been reported with formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine in young children who received the vaccine and were subsequently infected with natural RSV in 1967. Enhanced disease was seen in some preclinical studies with SARS-CoV vaccines and raised questions about other coronavirus vaccines showing a similar AESI. Other AESIs relevant to COVID-19 disease could potentially include respiratory (including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome), cardiac (including cardiogenic shock, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, myocarditis and pericarditis), acute renal, and hepatic injury, neurological (including encephalopathy, encephalitis, GBS, anosmia and ageusia), sepsis and septic shock, hypercoagulability, rhabdomyolysis and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children 
 <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. AESIs related to novel adjuvants and vaccine platforms (e.g. cardiac AE including myo/pericarditis with MVA, and arthritis with VSV platforms); and vaccination (e.g. anaphylaxis, thrombocytopenia, seizures, GBS) should also be considered.
