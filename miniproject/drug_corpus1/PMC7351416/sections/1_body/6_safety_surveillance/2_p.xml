<p id="p0540">There are accelerated timelines for vaccine development to achieve WHO Emergency Use Listing, while using regulatory pathways through national regulatory authorities. Common adverse events that occur shortly after vaccination may be detected in the clinical trials, but rare adverse events, and those with delayed onset, are likely to be detected only once large populations are immunized. In addition, no DNA or RNA vaccines have been licensed in humans to date. Safety surveillance accompanying deployment will be critical. Historic example of real adverse reactions that are only detected after widespread vaccine use (Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS) following the 1976 swine flu vaccine program and enhanced disease post infection after vaccination with the Dengue vaccine) and coincidental events later found not be caused by the vaccine (autism following MMR vaccine and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) with whole cell pertussis vaccines) that undermine the immunization program, highlight the critical role for robust safety monitoring. CEPI has funded the Brighton Collaboration Safety Platform for Emergency vACcines (SPEAC) project to harmonize the safety of its candidate vaccines, including COVID 19
