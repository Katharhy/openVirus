<p id="p0550">An adverse event following immunization (AEFI) is “any untoward medical occurrence which follows immunization and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the usage of the vaccine”. AEFIs include the background rate of all diseases post-vaccination and may include excess burden of these diseases if the vaccine causes a vaccine adverse reaction. Safety surveillance must be capable of investigating AEFIs and AESIs as our understanding of the biological mechanisms for adverse reactions has limitations and we must anticipate coincidental events that clinicians, the media and the public may attribute to the vaccine. Safety surveillance must be able to detect and rapidly investigate AESIs and AEFIs to determine if the temporal relationship is causal or coincidental.</p>
