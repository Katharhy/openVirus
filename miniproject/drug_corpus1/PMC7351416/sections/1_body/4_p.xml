 <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The S1 subunit contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that binds with the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), S protein priming occurs through the serine protease TMPRSS2 (to cleave S protein at S1/S2) and fusing of the viral and host membranes occurs through the S2 subunit. The S protein induces neutralizing-antibody and T-cell responses, as well as protective immunity, during infection with SARS-CoV
