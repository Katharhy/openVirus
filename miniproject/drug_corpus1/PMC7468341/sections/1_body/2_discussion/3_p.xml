<p id="p0115">The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) constitutes the major protein degradation system of eukaryotic cells that participates in a wide range of cellular processes and is another critical target of diverse viruses (
 <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2018</xref>). UPS plays an indispensable role in fine-tuning the regulation of inflammatory responses. For instance, proteasome-mediated activation of NF-κB regulates the expression of proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 1 β (IL-1β), and IL-8. Similarly, UPS is essential for the regulation of leukocyte proliferation (
 <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2018</xref>). The UPS is generally considered a double-edged sword in viral pathogenesis. For example, UPS is a powerhouse that eliminates viral proteins to control viral infection, but at the same time viruses hijack UPS machinery for their propagation (
 <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2018</xref>). In case of herpes simplex virus type 1, varicella-zoster virus, and simian varicella virus, induction of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-mediated host innate immunity is suppressed by the manipulation of UPS components (

 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Raaben et al., 2010</xref>). In our study, the ubiquitin proteasome module was composed of several members of 26S proteasome ATPase or non-ATPase regulatory subunits, which includes PSMA2 (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>E). It still needs to be determined whether PSMA2 plays important roles in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and is potentially involved in the cytokine storm. While the mechanistic evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 interaction with these two high-value targets needs to be explored, both the mRNA and protein expression corresponding to PSMD8 were recently shown to be decreased by up to 30% in aged keratinocytes (
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Ishii et al., 2018</xref>). Because reduced proteasome activity results in aggregation of aberrant proteins that perturb cellular functions, we hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 targets these proteins to interfere with endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mediated cellular responses. Indeed, the aged population is more prone to severe disease pathogenesis (
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Davies et al., 2020</xref>). AP2M1, the μ subunit of clathrin adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2), is another significant CSP in this pathway (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>E). Interestingly, AP2M1 was previously shown to be essential for the assembly of HCV (
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Neveu et al., 2012</xref>). However, it remains to be determined how SARS-CoV-2 mechanistically targets AP2M1 for its assembly and/or disruption of intracellular trafficking.
