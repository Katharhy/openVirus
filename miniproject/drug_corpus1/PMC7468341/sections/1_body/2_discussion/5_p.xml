<p id="p0125">Our network topology analyses discovered 33 CSPs that have been implicated in several above-described modules and pathways (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>E). To provide a system-wide perspective of the importance of these CSPs in COVID-19, we categorized these CSPs into three groups based on their possible functionality. Group-1 includes CSPs that are potentially relevant to modifying host response following SARS-CoV-2 infection. These include SPECC1, DCTN2, BCL2L1, ATP6V1A, KPNA2, KPNA4, AP2M1, UBE2I, CCDC86, ETFA, RAB1A, RAB2A, RAB5C, and RAB7A (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>E). We hypothesized that such CSPs are important in creating a protective environment in the host tissue following the viral infection. For example, SPECC1 under the predisposing conditions of oxidative stress regulates TGF-β signaling and autophagy, whereas DCTN2 specifically affects autophagy (
 <xref rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, BCL2L1 regulates apoptosis by blocking mitochondrial VDAC channels and is considered important in controlling ROS production and autophagy regulation (
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Naghdi and Hajnoczky, 2016</xref>). Another mitochondrial ribosomal protein, MRPS25, is also targeted by SARS-CoV-2, and if altered it could lead to mitochondrial dysfunction such as those underlying encephalomyopathy. ATP6V1A is considered important in receptor-mediated endocytosis and protein sorting and could also be involved in early autophagy regulation (
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Merkulova et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, KPNA2 and KPNA4 under hypoxic conditions control the cytoplasmic-nuclear transport mechanism. Interestingly, influenza polymerase nuclear trafficking is known to be regulated by these proteins (
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Christiansen and Dyrskjot, 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Resa-Infante et al., 2019</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 could also utilize these or similar groups of proteins for its effective shuttling between various subcellular compartments. Although AP2M1 and UBE2I were discussed earlier, CCDC86, an important cytokine-induced protein that regulates various immune responses, was shown to be expressed in the hippocampus of adult macaque monkeys, indicating the importance of this CSP in neurological disorders during COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Shishkov et al., 2013</xref>). RAB and RHO group of ras proteins may be involved in augmenting inflammatory signaling pathways (
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Prashar et al., 2017</xref>). Group-2 CSPs that we identified are likely to be hijacked by SARS-CoV-2 for its entry, proliferation, and survival in the host tissue. In this category, one of the most important CSPs is prohibitin (PHB; 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>E). PHB is an important protein shown to be a receptor for dengue and chikungunya viruses (
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Kuadkitkan et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">Wintachai et al., 2012</xref>). Although it has been shown that ACE2 serves as the main receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cells (
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Shang et al., 2020</xref>), it is quite interesting that pathogenesis of the viral infection is not significantly different between the populations of hypertensive patients who receive or do not receive ACE2 inhibitors (
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Kuster et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Meng et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Vaduganathan et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, it is plausible that under certain physiological conditions when SARS-CoV-2 does not engage with the ACE2 receptor for its entry into the cell, PHB or other yet to be discovered proteins serve as an alternative receptors or co-receptors. It also remains to be demonstrated whether viral entry through different receptors is context dependent. Another CSP Integrin β1 encoded by ITGB1 was recently shown to be required for the entry of rabies virus (
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Shuai et al., 2020</xref>). Whether ITGB1 could also promote the entry of SARS-CoV-2 is another question that needs to be addressed. Similarly, PPP1CA was shown to regulate HIV-1 transcription by modulating CDK9 phosphorylation (
 <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Tyagi et al., 2015</xref>) and thus is potentially involved in the gene regulation of SARS-CoV-2. Another significant CSP, CAV1, regulates aquaporin 4 and is involved in water/glycerin transport and metabolic reprogramming. Dysregulation of this protein is possibly related to neuropathic pain (
 <xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, a number of neurologic impairments were reported to be associated with COVID-19. As discussed earlier, RPL20, RPL36, and NUP98 are other three CSPs that are targeted by SARS-CoV-2 for its entry and proliferation (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>E). Similarly, NUP98 can also be utilized for viral entry into the nucleus. Additional three CSPs in this category, RPL36 and RPS20 (
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Li, 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Lv et al., 2017</xref>), could be employed for viral transcription and protein synthesis (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>E). Finally, Group-3 CSPs are proteins that SARS-CoV-2 may utilize both to facilitate its proliferation as well as to induce a conducive environment in the host tissue for its sustenance and pathogenesis (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>E). These CSPs include DDX21, DDX5, UPF1, EXOSC, STOM, and members of Group-1 with overlapping functions. The dead box proteins (DDX21 and DDX5), which have helicase activity, are important in regulating RNA biogenesis, RNA transport, and protein translation, as well as other processes (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>). It is important to note that SARS-CoV-2 not only regulates the expression of these genes but also affects many other genes related to protein translation, such as eIF2A. These proteins are known to interact with Jun, a part of the AP-1 transcription factor complex and a significant CSP in our study, which is altered by SARS-CoV-2 infection and plays key roles in regulating oxidative and inflammatory signaling pathways (
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Gazon et al., 2017</xref>). COVID-19 patients are known to manifest upregulated inflammatory and oxidative signaling pathways. In addition, UPF1 is another RNA helicase that is involved in the RNA decay pathway (
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Kim and Maquat, 2019</xref>) and is a target of SARS-CoV-2. It is interesting to note that a subset of COVID-19 patients manifests pulmonary thrombosis and microvascular thrombosis leading to severe morbidity (
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Ackermann et al., 2020</xref>). An important CSP pertinent to this phenomenon in our study is STOM, as its loss of function can cause a type of hemolytic anemia (
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Genetet et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, Group-3 and Group-1 share CSPs that exhibit overlapping functions. Among these CSPs, EEF1A1, PPIA, RAB1A, RAB2A, RAB5C, RAB7A, and UBE2I are identified as the ones that are potentially associated with the pathogenesis of the cytokine storm as observed in some severely affected patient populations. Intriguingly, EEF1A1, a target of several viruses, is known to be activated upon inflammation (
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Maruyama et al., 2007</xref>). This CSP is independently identified as one of the major regulators in human-SARS-CoV-2-predicted interactome (
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Guzzi et al., 2020</xref>). The CSPs, which regulate protein folding and translation, could be utilized by SARS-CoV-2 to halt host protein translation, folding, and protein quality control. In addition, we also identified these translation-related proteins as the first neighbors of some of these CSPs. These CSP complexes play key roles in promoting cell death, causing inflammation, and acting enzymatically as viral integrases. Collectively, these CSPs and their first neighbors could, directly and indirectly, perform intricate pathophysiological functions but those mentioned here could be the key effects of COVID-19 on host tissue dysregulation. This classification is also crucial for the design of effective therapeutic interventions against COVID-19. Finally, we presented transcriptional modeling of CSI genes including CSPs that participate in the cytokine storm, interferon signaling, eIF2 signaling/translation, protein ubiquitination pathway, hypoxia, and T cell receptor regulation of apoptosis. Thus, these signaling pathways and TFs discovered through our analyses could provide important clues about effective drug targets and their combinations that can be administered at different stages of COVID-19.
