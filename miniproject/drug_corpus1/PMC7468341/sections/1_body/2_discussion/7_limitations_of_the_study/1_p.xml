<p id="p0135">The PPI network used in this study is composed of ∼19,000 nodes. Thus, the interactome does not represent the full scope of cellular activities and in turn, may lack some targets of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, Gordon et al. (
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>) viral target dataset is generated in an ex-vivo experiment using individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins expression in HEK-293T/17 cells followed by affinity-purification–mass spectrometry (AP-MS)-based proteomics. We expect both false-positive and false-negative targets in such a study. For instance, Spike protein interaction with ACE-2 was not recapitulated with high confidence. In addition, there is no significant comparable overlap between BALF and PBMC cell transcriptome of COVID-19 patients. This could have facilitated in better understanding of transcriptome-wide differences. Also, a detailed temporal dataset of SARS-CoV-2 infection to death/recovery host transcriptome is lacking, which may provide immense clarity in activated regulators during different stages of infection and death/recovery. Finally, we may expect additional drug-protein interactions besides proposed in this study. Likewise, additional drug combinations may prove to be more effective than proposed.
