<p id="p0120">Another hallmark of viral pathogenesis is the dysregulation of the host cell cycle in order to create a conducive environment for their replication (
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Fan et al., 2018</xref>). For instance, some viruses suppress the functions of T or B lymphocytes to subvert the immune system, whereas carcinogenic viruses are known to promote cell cycle progression by antagonizing with cell cycle checkpoints (

 <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Tutuncuoglu et al., 2020</xref>). In the case of SARS-CoV-2, we identified three centriole assembly proteins, CEP350, CEP135, and CDK5RAP2, interacting with viral factors (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>E), indicating the importance of cell cycle progression in the pathogenesis of this deadly virus. The highly connected module pertains to eIF2 signaling and is comprised of protein translation-related proteins such as RPS and RPLs. Indeed, these ribosomal proteins have been shown to interact with viral RNA for viral proteins biosynthesis and are subsequently required for viral replication in the host cells (
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Li, 2019</xref>). Noteworthy, two ribosomal proteins, RPL36 and RPS20, were found to interact with several SARS-CoV-2 viral factors. Moreover, both of these proteins are also CSPs that harbor increased centrality measures (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>E). Intriguingly, RPS20 has been demonstrated to operate as an immune factor that activates a TLR3-mediated antiviral (
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Li, 2019</xref>). It remains to be addressed whether RPS20 is a “double whammy” target of SARS-CoV-2 for (1) hijacking this important factor for viral translation and replication and (2) suppressing a critical immune signaling pathway. Regardless, ribosomal proteins are critical targets of numerous viruses and play equally essential roles in developing antiviral therapeutics (
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Li, 2019</xref>). Another noteworthy module is the T cell receptor regulation of apoptosis. Indeed, it was recently reported that SARS-CoV-2 infection may cause lymphocyte apoptosis demonstrated by overall cell count and transcriptional signatures in PBMC of COVID-19 patients (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">Xiong et al., 2020</xref>). Taken together, our module-based functional analyses identified several novel molecular components, structural and functional modules, and overall provided insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.
