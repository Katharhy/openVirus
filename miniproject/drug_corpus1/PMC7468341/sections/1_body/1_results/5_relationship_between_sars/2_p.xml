<p id="p0085">Similarly, for eIF2 signaling/translation and protein ubiquitination pathways, we identified 10 significant TFs (E2F4, HEY1, BRCA1, IRF3, TAF7, RFX5, CHD2, NFYA, TAF1, and SP1) regulating these pathways over 24-h time course. Interestingly, we report that six TFs (CHD2, BRCA1, RFX5, IRF3, TAF7, and SP1) are a part of the CSI network and four of those TFs (BRCA1, IRF3, TAF7, and RFX5) are significantly expressed in Calu-3 SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome (

Although IRF3 is a direct target of SARS-CoV-2 protein, BRCA1 possesses 47 interacting proteins, indicating the significance of network centrality analysis in our study. Similarly, in the gene subset related to T cell receptor regulation of apoptosis, we identified a total of eight TFs (MYC, SIN3A, E2F1, MXI1, IRF1, GATA1, CCNT2, and E2F6) that are differentially expressed in Calu-3 SARS-CoV-2 infection. We report that six of these significant regulators (E2F1, SIN3A, IRF1, CCNT2, MYC, and E2F6) are a part of CSI. Specifically, MYC and SIN3A have 35 and 24 interactions, respectively, and E2F6 is the first neighbor of SARS-CoV-2 target protein (

Finally, for the hypoxia response pathway, eight significant regulators (GATA1, GTF2F1, hsa-miR-429, POU2F2, RDBP, TAF7, TAL1, and TBP) are regulating the response to hypoxia along with cell communication and signaling receptor binding process (

 <xref rid="mmc5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>). Furthermore, using the miRbase target prediction tool combined with the SARS-CoV-2 expression profile, we showed that hsa-miR-429 can potentially regulate over 750 genes involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection (
 <xref rid="mmc5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>). Intriguingly, 573 of these 752 hsa-miR-429 target genes are a part of CSI, further substantiating the importance of CSI involvement in the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.
