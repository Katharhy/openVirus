<p id="p0080">Next, we primarily focused on the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 transcriptional circuitry and five major pathways/signaling events enriched in CSI, i.e. cytokine storm with interferon signaling, eIF2 signaling/translation, protein ubiquitination pathway, T cell receptor regulation of apoptosis, and response to hypoxia. In the first example of cytokine storm and interferon signaling, we identified a total of 13 TFs (BATF, BCL11A, BRF2, IRF1, IRF4, STAT1, STAT2, SUZ12, POL2, TAF1, ZNF263, ZNF274, and ESR1) that act as significant regulators (

 <xref rid="mmc5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>). Predominantly, we found that six TFs (ZNF263, IRF1, ESR1, STAT2, SUZ12, and STAT1) and one master regulator (IRF1) are early transcriptional players activated at 12 h and 24 h postinfection. It is important to note that the majority of these genes/TFs are related to inflammatory/immune regulatory processes and display dissimilar expression in response to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (

 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>A). Furthermore, we found eight cytokine storm-related genes (IFNGR1, TNFAIP3, IL32, IL6, TNFRSF10A, TNF, IL7R, and CXCL1) that are a part of CSI indicating that members of CSI participate in a cytokine storm (

 <xref rid="mmc5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>). Moreover, we also observed significant transcriptional amplitude differences for these cytokine storm genes, particularly IL7R and TNFRSF10A in response to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (

 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref>B and 
 <xref rid="mmc5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>). Collectively, we showed that CSI nodes also participate in both cytokine storm and interferon signaling.
