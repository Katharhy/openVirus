<p id="p0100">Based on our interactome data as well as published investigations, SARS-CoV-2 proteins interact with human proteins resulting in significant alterations to signaling pathways, which provide conducive micro-environment for replication of SARS-CoV-2 (a purine biosynthesis enzyme IMPDH2 is one such example), activation of multiple protein degradation pathways (Cathepsin B/L, UBE2I etc.), and modulation in the human tissues' metabolic regulation (mTOR pathway and its direct/indirect regulators, e.g., AMPK) (
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>). These alterations are accompanied by the intense immune reactions manifested as concerted activation of multiple pro-inflammatory signals (epigenetic modifiers including bromodomain proteins, HDACs, ELF1, STATs, JUN, and SIN3A etc.), which could be the underpinning of the cytokine storm. Alterations in interferon response factors (IRFs), as observed here, could be of importance in regard to teasing out the complex underlying mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. For example, changes in IRF1/IRF3/IRF4 TFs may be related to the observed alterations in the expression of STATs and dependent signaling. Some of these pathways are also key in type I interferon induction (
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Hadjadj et al., 2020</xref>). Accordingly, we believe that effective and prompt therapeutic strategies for blocking SARS-CoV-2 infection are not straight forward. Notably, keeping in view the long asymptomatic latency of virus infection, single-agent treatment could at the most be marginally or partially effective, depending on the stage of the disease progression. However, combinatorial drug treatment approaches developed logically based on the potential inhibition of multiple molecular targets identified in our interactome analysis and other published data may prove highly efficacious in dampening the aggressive and lethal progression of the disease. A cocktail of three or four drugs is also used for the effective management of HIV-1 infection in humans (

 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Pirrone et al., 2011</xref>). We propose in our formula that the cocktail of therapeutic agents should include an antiviral drug combined with a protease inhibitor and a metabolic immune modulator/anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID). Because multiple proteases and protein degradative signaling pathways may be involved in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is hard to select one effective drug in this category. We observed in our analysis that calcium channel blockers may be more effective, as calcium is required for the activation of proteases and anti-hypertensive calcium channel blocker drugs may limit the cellular availability of free calcium. Thus, we propose that a cocktail of FDA-approved drugs (for other indications) such as Remdesivir, Verapamil, and Rapamycin may be one such potential combination. Other similar combinations of the FDA-approved drugs may also be contemplated. Interestingly, Massachusetts General Hospital has initiated a clinical trial of nitric oxide (NO;

Similar trials are initiated at other locations. These trials are based on the earlier success of NO in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Likewise, an iron chelator and antioxidant deferoxamine (phase I/phase II): (

Indeed, genes encoding proteins implicated in antioxidants and NO-related processes are also enriched in CSI (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>C). A number of clinical trials have recently been initiated employing anti-inflammatory drugs, naproxen (phase III): (

Therefore, it is likely that depending on the stage of disease progression, these drugs may manifest some advantage and drug combinations may also be modulated accordingly. Similarly, ACE2 inhibition is still considered of importance in the view of a recently initiated clinical trial of its inhibitor losartan (phase I): (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT04335123" id="intref0030" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">NCT04335123</ext-link>) in the COVID-19 patients. In addition, a class of phytochemical agents known as rocaglamides (
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Iwasaki et al., 2019</xref>), which are potent inhibitors of PHBs could be a new class of agents effective against SARS-CoV-2, particularly in combination with an antiviral. Finally, we observed that CSI proteins are related to signaling pathways that regulate metabolism. Thus, changes in cellular metabolism could play an important role in causing morbidity and mortality in these patients. Because caloric restriction and exercise are regulators of these pathways, careful and disease-stage-specific implementation of proper diet and exercise may show some complementary advantages.
