<p id="p0045">Likely, the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection can largely be determined by the interaction patterns of host proteins and viral factors. To build the human-SARS-CoV-2 interactome, we first assembled a comprehensive human interactome encompassing experimentally validated PPIs from the STRING database (
 <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Szklarczyk et al., 2015</xref>). Because the STRING database is not fully updated, we manually curated PPIs from four additional proteomes-scale interactome studies, i.e., Human Interactome I and II, BioPlex, QUBIC, and CoFrac (reviewed in (
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Luck et al., 2017</xref>). This yielded an experimentally validated interactome containing 18,906 nodes and 444,633 edges (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). Subsequently, we compiled an exhaustive list of 394 host proteins interacting with the novel human coronavirus that was referred to as SIPs (

 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>), whereas the remaining 62 host proteins interacted with the viral factors of other human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (
 <xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>), which could also be of significance in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. By querying these 394 SIPs in the human interactome, we generated a subnetwork of 12,852 nodes and 84,100 edges that covers first and second neighbors of 373 SIPs (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). Given that the SIPs-derived PPI subnetwork may not operate in all spatial or temporal conditions, coronavirus-specific expression data are used to filter the interactions in the context of COVID-19. Toward this, we took advantage of a high-resolution temporal transcriptome derived from human airway epithelial cells (Calu-3) treated with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 over time

 <xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). By integrating this Calu-3 expression data with SIPs-derived PPI subnetwork, we generated CSI that contains 214 SIPs interacting with their first and second neighbors, forming a network of 4,176 nodes and 18,630 edges (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B and 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). Moreover, we performed edge- and node-based comparative analysis to identify the shared and distinct interaction patterns regulating SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C and 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). Finally, we showed that CSI follows a power-law degree distribution with a few nodes harboring increased connectivity compared with a random network and thus exhibits properties of a scale-free network (

 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Becerra et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Bosl et al., 2019</xref>). Taken together, we constructed a robust, high-quality CSI that was further utilized for network-aided architectural and functional pathway analyses.
