  <p>SARS-CoV-2 Interacting Proteins (SIPs) Structural and Functional Properties in Calu-3-Specific Human-SARS-CoV-2 Interactome (CSI)</p>
  <p>(A) The average degree of SIPs (12.01) is significantly higher than other interacting proteins (8.78) in the CSI network (
   <italic>t</italic> test, P &lt; 4.93 × 10
   <sup>−3</sup>).
  </p>
  <p>(B) Average information centrality (IC) of SIPs (0.00038) is significantly heightened compared with remaining proteins (0.00034) in CSI network (t test, P &lt; 9.18 × 10
   <sup>−6</sup>).
  </p>
  <p>(C) SIPs exhibit significantly increased average betweenness centrality (BW; 0.0011) compared with other interacting proteins (0.00068) in the CSI network (t test, P &lt; 2.17 × 10
   <sup>−2</sup>).
  </p>
  <p>(D) SIPs are significantly enriched in CSI network than the human interactome (hypergeometric test, P &lt; 5.20 × 10
   <sup>−11</sup>).
  </p>
  <p>(E–L) CSI subnetworks of highly clustered modules were obtained with the application of MCODE Cytoscape app and 
   <italic>k</italic>-means clustering. The significant functional annotation was done by ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) (Red = SARS-CoV-2 targets, Green = CSI nodes).
