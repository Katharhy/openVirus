<p id="p0155">Next, we validated these two antibody-based antiviral assays by directly comparing them with other well-described assays. As shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> , similar EC
 <sub>50</sub> and EC
 <sub>90</sub> values were obtained using the in-cell western and HCI assays when compared to the interferon β promotor reporter assay, qRT-PCR assay, or yield reduction assay. Each of the previously reported assays has limitations. The interferon β promotor assay can be influenced by innate immune modulatory activity in addition to antiviral activity, while the reliability of the qRT-PCR assay can be affected by viral strain diversity. The yield reduction assay is labor-intensive. These two new YFV antibody based antiviral assays are thus additional tools to quantitatively analyze the molecular events occurring during YFV replication. They should accelerate the discovery of antiviral agents for all the druggable targets, including not only viral components but also cellular factors required for viral replication.
