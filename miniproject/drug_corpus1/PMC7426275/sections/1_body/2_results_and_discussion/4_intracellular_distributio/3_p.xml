<p id="p0135">In order to detect viral RNA synthesis 
 <italic>in situ</italic> in infected cells, the nascent viral RNA can also be metabolically labeled by incorporation of unnatural nucleosides, such as 5-ethynyl-20-uridine (EU), and detected by a click chemistry reaction (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Jao and Salic, 2008</xref>). This assay allows for the visualization of viral RNA replication foci and determine their spatial relationship with viral and cellular proteins. The experimental procedure is dipitcted in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B, upon the suppression of cellular RNA synthesis by actinomycin D treatment that specifically inhibits DNA-dependent RNA transcription, the RNA-dependent viral RNA synthesis can be specifically detected only in the cytoplasm of YFV infected cells. As anticipated, the cytosolic EU click signals, or the newly synthesized viral RNA, colocalized with NS4B protein (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C). Although the click chemistry technologies have been used for studying RNA-dependent viral RNA synthesis in the cells infected with Ebolavirus (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hoenen et al., 2012</xref>), chikungunya virus (
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Reid et al., 2015</xref>) or coronavirus (
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Hagemeijer et al., 2012</xref>), this is the first demonstration that this technology can also be used to visualize flaviviral RNA synthesis in infected cells. In conjunction with the immunofluorescent detection of viral nonstructural proteins, the click chemical visualization of intracellular viral RNA synthesis may not only reveal viral and host cellular proteins at viral RNA replication foci, but also provide a powerful tool for 
 <italic>in situ</italic> analyses of viral RNA replication and its inhibition by antiviral drugs.
