<p id="p0120">Sequence alignment of YFV 17D (X03700.1) and a wild-type Asibi strain (KF769016.1) indicated that there are 99% overall homology between the coding region of the two strains. Of the YFV proteins the set of antibodies raised against, the lowest homology is 97.6% in envelope protein, and the highest homology is 100% in capsid protein. To test whether the antibodies can also recognize the corresponding proteins of wild-type YFV, Huh-7.5 cells were infected with YFV Asibi strain at a MOI of 2.5 for 40 h. Flow cytometry using 4G2 antibody indicated that 47% of cells were infected (data not shown). Western blot assays using the cell lysates from uninfected and the wild-type YFV infected Huh-7.5 cells showed that similar to that observed in YFV 17D infected cells, all the antibodies specifically recognized the corresponding wild-type YFV proteins (
