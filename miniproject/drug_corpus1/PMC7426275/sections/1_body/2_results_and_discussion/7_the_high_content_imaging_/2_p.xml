<p id="p0160">The HCI assay was also evaluated for its performance as a high-throughput screening platform. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> A, while mock-treated wells have z-scores ranging from +2 to −2, the wells treated with BDAA have scores in the range of −8 to −9. Furthermore, using BDAA as a positive control and mock-treated cells as a negative control, the assay has a Z’ of 0.74 in YFV-infected Huh-7 cells in a 96-well format. The results suggest that the HCI assay using the YFV NS4B antibody can serve as a high-throughput antiviral screening assay with a cutoff z-score value of −3. As an application of performing the HCI assay in HTS format, we tested the synergistic effect of BDAA that targets YFV NS4B protein and Sofosbuvir, a known nucleoside analog that inhibits YFV NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The experiment was performed in five 96-well plates, with serials of nontoxic concentrations of each compound and their combinations in a two-dimensional 6 × 8 checkerboard matrix fashion, with 5 replicates. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>B, consistent with published in vitro antiviral data, Sofosbuvir inhibits YFV at EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 8.82 μM and EC
 <sub>90</sub> of 32.4 μM (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">de Freitas et al., 2019</xref>). Combination of Sofosbuvir and BDAA, resulted in significant synergistic effect of inhibiting YFV replication, at suboptimal doses of both compounds, between 0.07 and 0.3 μM of BDAA and 1.1–10 μM of Sofosbuvir. This result supports the notion of combination of antivirals targeting two distinct viral proteins to maximize therapeutic benefit.
