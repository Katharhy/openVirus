<p id="p0065">YFV 17D infected cells were lysed with 1 × NuPAGE™ LDS Sample Buffer (Invitrogen) containing 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol. YFV Asibi infected cells were lysed with 1 × NuPAGE™ LDS Sample Buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and the lysates were heat-inactivated at 70 °C for 15 min. Proteins in the cell lysates were separated on a NuPAGE Novex 4–12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and electrophoretically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen). The membranes were blocked with TBST containing 5% nonfat dry milk and probed with the indicated YFV antibodies at 1:1000 dilution. The bound antibodies were visualized with IRDye secondary antibodies (IRDye 800CW Goat anti-Rabbit IgG and IRDye 680RD Goat anti-Mouse IgG) and by imaging with the LI-COR Odyssey system. Mouse monoclonal antibody against β-actin was used as a loading control. A pre-stained protein size marker was purchased from Bio-Rad.</p>
