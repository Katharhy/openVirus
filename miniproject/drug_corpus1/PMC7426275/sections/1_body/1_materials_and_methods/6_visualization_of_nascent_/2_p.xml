<p id="p0080">Huh-7 cells were seeded on round coverslips (Neuvitro Corporation) in 24 well plate and infected with YFV at 1 MOI. At 24 h post infection, cells were treated with 20 μM actinomycin D for 2 h to inhibit the cellular DNA directed RNA transcription, followed by incubation with 1 mM 5-ethynyl uridine (EU; Invitrogen) in the presence of actinomycin D for 1 h. The nascent RNA labeled with EU were visualized by using the Click-iT™ RNA Alexa Fluor™ 594 Imaging Kit (Invitrogen, C10330). Briefly, after fixing cells with 3.5% paraformaldehyde and permeabilization with 1% Triton X-100, “click” reaction between Alexa Fluor labeled azide and EU modified RNA was performed in accordance to the manufacturer's instructions. Images were acquired on an FV1000 confocal microscope (Olympus) with a PlanApoN 60 × /1.42 numerical aperture objective (Olympus).</p>
