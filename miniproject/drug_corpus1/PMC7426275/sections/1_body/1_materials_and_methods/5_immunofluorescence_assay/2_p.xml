<p id="p0070">Huh-7 cells were seeded on round coverslips (Neuvitro Corporation) in 24-well plates and infected with YFV at 1 multiplicity of infection (MOI) for 24 h. The cells were either fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 20 min, or 95% ethanol and 5% glacial acetic acid at −20 °C for 10 min, followed by permeabilization with 1% Triton X-100. After blocking with 10% FBS and 2% BSA in PBS for 1 h, the cells were incubated with the corresponding primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. Subsequently, the cells were washed three times with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS (PBST) and stained with secondary antibodies. Cell nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Finally, the coverslips were placed on glass slides with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (ThermoFisher Scientific). Images were sequentially acquired on an FV1000 confocal microscope with a PlanApoN 60 × /1.42 numerical aperture objective (Olympus).</p>
