<p id="p0105">Huh-7 cells were cultured in 96 or 384-well plates overnight and infected with YFV at the indicated MOI. At 48 h post-infection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and probed with YFV NS4B antibody (GTX134030) at 1:500 dilution. Alexa Fluor Goat anti-Rabbit 594 IgG (H + L) was used as secondary antibody at 1:300. Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (1:1000). Nine fields per well in 96-well plate, or six fields per well in 384-well plate were taken and analyzed using CellInsight CX7 High-Content Screening Platform (ThermoFisher) to calculate average percent of NS4B positive cells or total immunofluorescence intensity.</p>
