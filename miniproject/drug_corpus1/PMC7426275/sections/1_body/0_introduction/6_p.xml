<p id="p0050">Like other flaviviruses, YFV has a single positive-strand RNA genome approximately 11 kb in length with a 5′ cap but no 3′-polyA tail. The genome encodes a polyprotein that is co-translationally processed by viral and host cellular proteases into three structural proteins (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, capsid (C), membrane (prM/M), envelope (E)) and seven non-structural (NS) proteins (
 <italic>i.e</italic>., NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5) (

Few reagents and research tools, particularly the antibodies against YFV proteins, are available for investigating the molecular mechanism of YFV replication and pathogenesis. Currently, the commercially available YFV antibodies are only limited to the envelope and NS1 proteins. A couple of epitope-mapped monoclonal antibodies specific for YFV envelope or NS1 protein were reported, but have not been made available commercially (

 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Ricciardi-Jorge et al., 2017</xref>). Polyclonal antibodies against capsid and NS1 have been developed as well, which were proposed for use in YFV research and for the development of novel diagnostic tests (
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Stock et al., 2015</xref>). Taking advantage of the recently available rabbit polyclonal antibodies against all three YFV structural proteins and five of the seven non-structural proteins (i.e., NS1, NS2B, NS3, NS4B and NS5) from GeneTex, Inc., we established several antibody-based assays and demonstrated their utility, in conjunction with viral RNA metabolic labeling, double stranded RNA staining and membrane floatation assays, in molecular and cellular analyses of viral proteins and RNA synthesis in YFV infection, antiviral drug discovery and mechanistic studies.
