   <bold>Detection of YFV proteins in YFV-infected cells by immunofluorescence assay</bold>. Huh-7 cells were seeded on 24-well plates and infected with YFV 17D at a MOI of 5 for 24 h. The cells were either fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 20 min and permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 (
   <bold>A</bold>), or 95% ethanol and 5% glacial acetic acid at −20 °C for 10 min (
   <bold>B</bold>). After blocking, the cells were incubated with the indicated primary rabbit polyclonal antibody (NS1 was detected with GTX134025, and NS3 was detected GTX133959) and Alexa Fluor Goat anti-Rabbit 594 IgG (H + L) secondary antibody. Cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Mock-infected cells serve as negative controls. Images were captured by confocal microscopy using a 20 × objective.
