   <bold>Membrane floatation assay to investigate YFV protein interaction and association with cellular membranes</bold>. HEK293 cells infected with YFV at 5 MOI for 24Â h were disrupted with hypotonic buffer and overlaid with sucrose gradient. Following centrifugation, 10 fractions were sequentially collected from the top. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Proteins extracted from each fraction were analyzed in a Western blot assay to detect indicated YFV envelope and nonstructural proteins, using calnexin and Hsp70 as controls for membrane associated host proteins. 
   <bold>(B and C)</bold> The fraction containing ER membranes (fraction 2) was collected and subjected to treatment with indicated detergents, followed by a second round of membrane floatation centrifugation in sucrose gradient. Proteins in each fraction were detected by Western blot assays.
