<p>In 2013, the International Encephalitis Consortium (IEC) suggested consensus criteria for case definition of encephalitis or encephalopathy of presumed infectious or autoimmune etiology

 </sup>. Neurologic dysfunction in the form of altered mental status lasting for over 24 hours without an alternative cause must be present. Minor criteria that must be present (two for possible and at least three for probable or confirmed) include “fever ≥38°C within 72 hours, seizures, new focal neurologic findings, CSF pleocytosis (≥5 white blood cells [WBCs]/μL), neuroimaging with brain parenchymal changes or electroencephalogram (EEG) consistent with encephalitis. Definite cases require pathologic confirmation on brain biopsy, evidence of infection with a microorganism associated with encephalitis, or laboratory evidence of an autoimmune condition associated with encephalitis”
