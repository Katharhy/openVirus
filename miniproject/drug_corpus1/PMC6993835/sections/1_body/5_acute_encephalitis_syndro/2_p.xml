In addition, selective testing for other agents were performed on the basis of clinical and epidemiologic features. Only 16% of patients had a 
 <italic>confirmed or probable</italic> etiologic agent identified, of which 69% were viral, 20% bacterial, 7% prion, 3% parasitic and 1% fungal. An additional 13% had 
 <italic>possible</italic> etiologies identified. In this group there were many agents not hitherto implicated as a cause of encephalitis. Autoimmune etiology was found in 8% which made it more common than any single infectious agent. The remaining 63% had no etiology identified”
