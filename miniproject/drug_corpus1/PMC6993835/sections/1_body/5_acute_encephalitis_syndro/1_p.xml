<p>The most important cause is infection—both viral and non-viral. Viral agents include primary neurotropic viruses such as arboviruses, herpesviruses, and rabies virus as well as other “incidental” nervous system pathogens such as entero, orthomyxo, paramyxo, and adenoviruses, which primarily cause disease elsewhere in the body and involve the central nervous system only occasionally

Non-infectious brain inflammation such as in AIE, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), and collagen vascular disorders is another group. In infectious encephalopathies, there is a systemic infection causing altered sensorium or convulsions without invasion of the brain, thus presenting with the clinical syndrome of AES
