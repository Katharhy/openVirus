<p>Though poorly understood for some etiologies, a variety of mechanisms contribute to encephalitis. Encephalitis may be (i) infectious, resulting from direct invasion of the brain, most commonly gray matter by the pathogen, and (ii) immune-mediated, caused by immune-mediated damage (commonly white matter). Within the infectious group, both neurotropic and non-neurotropic (incidental) pathogens can cause encephalitis. Neurotropic viruses can cause viremia, subsequently crossing the blood–brain barrier (for example, arboviruses), or enter the brain by retrograde axonal transport (for example, rabies virus). Neuronal infection causes release of cytokines leading to cytotoxicity, inflammation, and tissue damage
