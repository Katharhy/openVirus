<p>AIE includes two major categories: (i) classic paraneoplastic LE associated with autoantibodies against 
 <italic>intracellular neuronal antigens</italic> (for example, Hu and Ma2) and (ii) new-type AIE associated with autoantibodies to neuronal 
 <italic>surface or synaptic antigens</italic>. Paraneoplastic LE results from an immunological response to tumor antigens, which mimic 
 <italic>intracellular</italic> antigens in neurons. These are strongly associated with cancer, and prognosis tends to be poor because of irreversible neuronal killing by these mechanisms. The “new-type” AIE, of which anti-NMDAR induced is the commonest, occurs in association with pathogenic autoantibodies against membrane antigens or synaptic receptors. Binding of autoantibodies to their targets causes neuronal dysfunction, usually reversibly

 </sup>. An extracellular epitope in the GluN1 subunit of the NMDAR is recognized by these antibodies, which crosslink the NMDARs and promote internalization of the receptors. This decreases receptor density on neuronal surface and results in neuronal dysfunction. This dysfunction is reversible with removal of autoantibodies. Over a dozen new-type autoantibodies have been identified since the discovery of anti-NMDAR antibody by Dalmau 
 <italic>et al</italic>. in 2007

 </sup>. The same process is described for AMPAR encephalitis. Other autoantibodies may work through different mechanisms. For example, anti-LGI1 antibodies block binding sites of LGI1. Anti-GABAb R antibodies block the inhibitory effects of baclofen on the spontaneous firing of cultured neurons and influence receptor function
