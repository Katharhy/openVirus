 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). Out of 9761 genome sequences, 2301 complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were selected randomly, aligned and compared with Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512.2) reference genome. We have divided our dataset into 6 different geographic areas: Europe (20.31%), North America (21.13%), Asia (35.37%), Oceania (20.86%), South America (16.63%) and Africa (10.35%). The European group comprises of SARS-CoV-2 infected patient data from the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal,, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and United Kingdom. The North American group contains genomes from the United States and Canada. The Asian group comprises genomes obtained from patients located in China, Indonesia, Pakistan, Philippines, Taiwan, Turkey, Kuwait, Georgia, South Korea, Japan, Iran, India, Thailand, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam. The Oceanian group comprises genomes from Australia and New Zealand. South America includes Brazil, Peru, Chile, Colombia, Argentina, and Ecuador (Fig.
