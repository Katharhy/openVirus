<p id="Par43">Three antimalarial drugs were then selected to study their inhibitory actions on SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. We found, Artemisinin, a natural compound derived from Chinese herb Artemisia 
 <italic>annua</italic> produces the highest docking score (− 6.40 kcal/mol) as compared to O6K, chloroquine (-4.95 kcal/mol) and hydroxychloroquine (− 5.77 kcal/mol) anti-malarial molecules. Importantly, Artemisinin has demonstrated broad anti-viral activity against human cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus type 1, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and bovine viral diarrhea virus [
