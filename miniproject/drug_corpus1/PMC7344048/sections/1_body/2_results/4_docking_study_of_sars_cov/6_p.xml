<p id="Par45">The severity of antiviral therapy adverse events has led researchers to explore the potential of macro-, micro- and phytonutrients that can potentially promote an immune response and suppress viral induced effects. Vitamins are known to modulate the host immune functions by providing anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatory activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Therefore, we selected vitamins, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), cholecalciferol (vitamin D) and alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) to investigate their potential interactions with the enzyme SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. Our docking results interestingly, showed that vitamin D has the lowest binding energy and K

 <sup>pro</sup> showed hydrogen bond formation with vitamin D (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>d). Amino acid Thr is extensively involved in intracellular signalling changes through phosphorylation changes, and here we observed that cholecalciferol formed a strong hydrogen bond with Thr residues and could potentially block the phosphorylation of Thr residue in SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> enzyme. There is evidence that serious SARS-CoV-2 infected cases have reported severe vitamin D deficiency and thus therapeutic concentrations of this molecule could potentially be used clinically in SARS-CoV-2 cases [
