<p id="Par37">Recently, Pachetti et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] has reported eight novel recurrent mutations of SARS-Cov-2 that have been identified in positions 1397, 2891, 14,408, 17,746, 17,857, 18,060, 23,403 and 28,881 in Asian, Oceanic, European and North American outbreaks. However, SARS-CoV-2 mutations from South American and African patient isolates are not yet reported. We confirmed the occurrence of these mutations in South Americans and Africans located at positions 3036, 8782, 11,083,14,408, 23,403, 28,144 and 28,881 as reported in previous literature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Our study highlights the presence of additional “conserved mutations” in the South American and African communities, considering only those occurring ≥ 5 times in our database. We report here 12 new mutations that have evolved in the SARS-Cov2 sequence in South American and African populations. These are located at positions 14,805, 25,563, 26,144, 28,882, 28,883, 9477, 28,657, 28,863, 1059, 15,324, 28,878 and 29,742 sites. The high tendency of the virus to demonstrate genetic variability is evident from the fact that even within these variants, three variations 9477 (nsp4), 28,657 and 28,863 (ORF9, structural protein) were uniquely identified in isolates from South American patients while four novel mutations viz. 1059 (nsp2), 15,324 (RdRp), 28,878 (ORF9, structural protein), and 29,742 (stem-loop II-like motif) were detected only in isolates from African patient samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). Interestingly, some mutations were identified to be common between these two separate sets of sequences that have been reported from the two distinct geographical locations viz. 14,805, 25,563, 26,144, 28,882 and 28,883, belonging to gene ORF1ab (14,805 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), ORF3a (25,563 and 26,144 ORF3a protein) and ORF9, N gene (28,882 and 28,883 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein) sequences, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). An interesting finding of this analysis is the concurrence of 14,805 mutation with 14,808 mutation in the same locus. This double point mutation was observed in RdRp genome from isolates of both South American and African patients. In contrast, 28,882/28,883 mutation locus corresponded with another previously reported mutation 28,881, and this triple point mutation was also present in both the South American and African genomic sequences. Identification of point mutations at the same locus indicates the high susceptibility of these genetic regions to change as the virus evolves.
