<p id="Par30">Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of all nucleotide sequences were carried out in the EMBL-EBI Clustal Omega server to investigate sequence conservation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The Newick format for the multiple align sequence was used to generate phylogeny [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The phylogenetic tree was constructed in the Interactive Tree of Life (iTOL) online tool [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The iTOL server generate phylogeny trees in a circular (radial) and normal standard trees. The circular trees can be rooted and displayed in different arc sizes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].
