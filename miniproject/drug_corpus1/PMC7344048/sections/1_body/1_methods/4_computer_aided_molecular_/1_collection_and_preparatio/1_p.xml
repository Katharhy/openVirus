<p id="Par32">The dataset comprises of flavones and biflavanoids, anti-viral, anti-malarial and vitamins as SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In total 17 repurposed drugs were collected from the Pubchem database [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Two-dimensional (2D) structures were downloaded from the Pubchem database in.sdf format. The inhibitor energies were minimized using the Austin Model-1 (AM1) until the root mean square (RMS) gradient value became smaller than 0.100 kcal/mol Å and later re-optimization was done by MOPAC (Molecular Orbital Package) method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Later, all the inhibitors were converted to.pdb format in Open Babel software [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and submitted to molecular docking studies.
