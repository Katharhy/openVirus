<p id="Par46">The novel coronavirus termed “nCovid-19” is now known as the third large-scale epidemic coronavirus introduced into the human population in the twenty-first century. At the time of writing, more than 3.67 million confirmed cases globally, with nearly 250,000 deaths had been reported by WHO. Clinically, nCovid-19 is similar to SARS regarding its presentation, however the sheer capacity and speed of which nCovid-19 has spread to global pandemic levels have left researchers asking what makes this outbreak so similar in presentation, yet so different in its virulence to previous coronaviruses. Genome sequence analysis has looked to investigate similarities in the phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2, which like SARS and MERS, have now placed it in the betacoronavirus genus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The known severe and often fatal pathogenicity of betacoronaviruses has been highlighted in these previous epidemics and has reported higher transmission and pathogenicity than the milder and lesser known a-CoVs, which are often compared to the common cold [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Our study further compares the similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 using Clustal Omega alignment to show that of 918 SARS nucleotides, there was a similarity of approximately 95%. Furthermore, we report high amino acid sequence identity in both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 main protease 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, which regulates coronavirus replication complexes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Such highly conserved regions in both catalytic sites and the substrate binding regions of the enzymes has also been validated previously in studies by Huang et al. and Muramatsu et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. While this region provides an attractive target for anti-viral drug design, it also can begin to elucidate on viral origins and uncover its ease in transmission.
