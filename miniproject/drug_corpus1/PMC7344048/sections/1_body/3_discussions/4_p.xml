<p id="Par49">Drug discovery and vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2 infection require time and lengthy processes, however drug repurposing represents an alternative strategy in the current scenario. Some of these antivirals are currently being used clinically in SARS-CoV-2 treatment, including lopinavir [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], ritonavir [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], remdesivir [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], and oseltamivir [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. However, in the clinical setting, lopinavir/ritonavir, a 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> and RdRp inhibitors, showed no benefit in Covid-19 adult patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The double point mutation in RdRp gene identified in our study can potentially lead to a drug-resistance event. Moreover, other classes of drugs, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have shown antiviral properties by blocking viral entry into cells by inhibiting glycosylation of host receptors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. We observed no differences in the SARS-CoV-2 main proteinase, 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> genome sequences, but important differences in SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> with SARs-CoV protein, underlining the extreme need for identification of inhibitors to target the viral life cycle. It is not known whether these mutations induce any alterations in the gene transcription or localisation of affected proteins which can be investigated in near future using biochemical and immunological approaches [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>].
