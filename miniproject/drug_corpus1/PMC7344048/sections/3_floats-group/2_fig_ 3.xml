  <p>Graphical representation of SARS-CoV-2 mutation frequency in South American and African patient isolates. 
   <bold>a</bold> Five novel recurrent hotspots mutations (namely 14,805, 25,563, 26,144, 28,882 and 28,883) were subdivided into 2 geographical areas: South America (n = 307) and Africa (n = 191). Previously confirmed mutations at positions nt3036, nt8782, nt11083, nt14408, nt23403, nt28144 and nt28881 were also present in South American and African populations. We normalize the mutation frequency percentage by estimating the frequency of genomes carrying mutation and comparing it with the overall number of collected genomes per geographical area. The graph shows the cumulative mutation frequency of all given mutations present in South American and African regions. Mutation localisation in viral genes are reported in the legend as well as the proteins (i.e. non-structural protein, nsp) presenting these mutations. 
   <bold>b</bold> It is also evident that South American and African clusters show a differential pattern of novel mutations: mutation 1059 (black), 9477 (pink), 28,657 (green) and 28,878 (red) in South American, whereas mutation 1059 (black), 15,324 (orange), 28,878 (yellow) and 29,742 (magenta) are present with greater frequency in African patients
