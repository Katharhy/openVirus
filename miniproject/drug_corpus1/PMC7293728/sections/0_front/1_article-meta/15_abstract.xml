 <p>Influenza B virus (IBV) is one of the main pathogens of the annual influenza epidemic, and the disease burden is significant, especially among children and young teenagers. In this study, the antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects of a traditional Chinese medicine prescription, the Lianhua-Qingwen capsule, were evaluated. Our results showed that Lianhua-Qingwen capsule can inhibit both Victoria and Yamagata lineages, and the 50% inhibitive concentrations ranged from 0.228 ± 0.150 to 0.754 ± 0.161 mg/mL. The time course results demonstrated that IBV yields were reduced with treatment at 0–4 h after infection, and the mechanistic research verified that Lianhua-Qingwen capsule has hemagglutination inhibition activity against B/Guangzhou/0215/2012 but not A/California/04/2009. In addition to antiviral activity, Lianhua-Qingwen capsule can also inhibit excessive expression of RANTES, IL-6, IL-8, IP-10, TNF-

The in vivo results confirmed that orally administered Lianhua-Qingwen capsule (100–400 mg/kg/day) does not reduce IBV-induced lung viral load and mortality in mice. However, the pathological change in lungs was alleviated, and there were fewer inflammatory cells in the lungs of Lianhua-Qingwen capsule treated mice than those in controls. Further research confirmed that the combination treatment of 200 mg/kg/day of Lianhua-Qingwen capsule with 2 mg/kg/day of oseltamivir significantly reduced IBV infection over the individual administration of either alone in vivo. Our findings prove that Lianhua-Qingwen capsule could be used as an assistant medicine to enhance the effect of oseltamivir against influenza B virus infection.
