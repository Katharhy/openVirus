<p>To study the antiviral mechanism of LQ in pretreatment of virus, inhibition of HA was evaluated. The HA inhibition assay results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) showed that ≥0.313 mg/mL of LQ has HA inhibition activity against B/Guangzhou/0215/2012 but not A/California/04/2009. To confirm this result, indirect immunofluorescence microscopy of viral binding was performed, and there was a similar result (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(b)</xref>); that is, 0.6 mg/mL of LQ could inhibit viral binding to MDCK cells for B/Guangzhou/0215/2012 but not for A/California/04/2009.
