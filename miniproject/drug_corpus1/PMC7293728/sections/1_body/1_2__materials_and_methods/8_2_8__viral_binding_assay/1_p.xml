 <sup>3</sup> cells were seeded in 24-well culture plate with coverslips. The medium was removed after incubation for 18 h; cells were washed with cold PBS. The mixture containing a selected concentration of LQ and virus (10 MOI), which were incubated at 37°C for 1 h, was added to cells, and the cells were incubated at 4°C for 90 min. The mixture was removed; the cells were washed with cold PBS three times. The viral binding was measured using an immunofluorescence assay.
