<p>The cytotoxicity of LQ to MDCK cells was assessed via MTT assay, and 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells were seeded into 96-well plate. After incubation for 18 h, the culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with PBS. A series of 2-fold dilutions of concentrations of LQ (maximum concentration of 10 mg/mL) were then added to the wells, and the cells were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, for 48 h. The medium was replaced with 1 mg/mL of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)-PBS solution (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L/well). The plate was incubated at 37°C for 4 h, the solution was then replaced with DMSO, and the ODs value was measured in 570 nm of wave after a gentle shaking. Three independent MTT assays were performed. The 50% toxicity concentration (TC
 <sub>50</sub>) was obtained via linear regression, and the result is shown as the mean ± standard deviation (SD).
