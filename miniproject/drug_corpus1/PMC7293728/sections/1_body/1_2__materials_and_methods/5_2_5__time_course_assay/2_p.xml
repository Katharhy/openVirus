<p>In 
 <italic>Post-V</italic> model, MDCK cells were inoculated with B/Guangzhou/0215/2012 (MOI = 0.1) at 4°C for 2 h, and the viral solution was removed after washing twice with cold PBS. The medium containing 1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL TPCK treated trypsin was added, and the cell plate was transferred and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, which was defined as 0 h at this time. Then, 0.6 mg/mL LQ was added at 0 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, and 8 h; the supernatant was collected at 12 h, and the virus titer was detected subsequently in MDCK cells.
