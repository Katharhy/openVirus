<p>Although influenza B and influenza A are similar, there are many differences between them, particularly the efficiency of antivirus medicines, such as M2 inhibitors and NA inhibitors. This paper describes the effect of LQ against influenza B virus in vitro in a mouse model. We found that LQ has a wide spectrum of antiviral activity against different strains of influenza B virus, including Victoria and Yamagata lineages. Base on the results in vitro, three probable pathways might be deduced for anti-influenza B virus activity of LQ: (a) blockage of viral binding to host receptors; (b) reduction of viral replication; (c) reduction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines storm reduced by infection.</p>
