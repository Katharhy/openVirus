<p>Animal models are essential in the preclinical evaluation of potential antiviral compounds to investigate safety and efficacy. In contrast to influenza A virus, animal models for the study of influenza B infection are lacking. This lack of studies is due to the limitation of the influenza B host range [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], which is related to the NS1 protein [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and M1 protein [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To evaluate the efficacy of LQ in vivo, we screened the clinical influenza B virus strains and obtained a stable mouse lethal strain, B/Guangzhou/0215/2012 (B0215). In this study, the data of viral load in lungs and survival rates showed that orally administered LQ in the concentration of 400 mg/kg/d has no significant protective effect against 5-fold LD
 <sub>50</sub> B0215‐infected mice. However, the pathological change in the lungs was alleviated to a certain extent, and there were fewer inflammatory cells in lungs of LQ treated mice compared to mice treated with PBS. Based on our experience of LQ, its effects are multifunctional and mild. According to our previous study of LQ anti-influenza A viruses [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], lung virus titer was reduced under a high dose (1300 mg/kg/d) of LQ in a mouse model of severe pneumonia. In order to investigate the true effects of LQ on influenza B virus, we had developed a ferret model and tree shrew model of influenza B virus [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We will evaluate the antiviral effects of LQ through more indicators, such as fever, activity, and viral load of upper respiratory in the future study.
