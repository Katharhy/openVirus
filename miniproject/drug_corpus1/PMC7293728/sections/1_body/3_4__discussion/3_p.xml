<p>Virus entry is the first step of infection, and this process is essential and is mediated by surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza virus [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. There is inhibitory effect of LQ with pretreatment of virus, and it may affect virus HA, blocking virus binding to cell surface. Therefore, we tested whether LQ can inhibit the virus binding. The results clarified that LQ plays a role in the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) activity of influenza B virus (B/Guangzhou/0215/2012) but not influenza A virus (A/California/04/2009). To confirm this result, an immunofluorescence assay for viral binding was performed, and the viral binding of B/Guangzhou/0215/2012 to the MDCK cells surface was reduced by treatment with the LQ, but the same result did not occur in influenza A. The receptor binding site of influenza B virus HA has some significant differences from that of influenza A virus HA [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Also, influenza B virus HA binds to sialic acids with lower affinity than influenza A virus [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We assumed that the reason for this result is whether LQ affects the domain of influenza B HA, which is different from influenza A HA, or the weaker dynamics of influenza B HA. It needs more studies to investigate the mechanisms in the future.
