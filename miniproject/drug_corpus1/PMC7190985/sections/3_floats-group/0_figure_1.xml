  <p>Structural analogs of Retro-1 can inhibit VACV spread with minimal cytotoxicity. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Schematic representation of steps used to determine viral spread and cellular toxicity in the presence of Retro-1 analogs. The virus spread and cytotoxicity assays were performed twice for each compound, in duplicate. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Representative graph showing percent viral spread in the presence of a serial dilution series of five retrograde inhibitors. Values plotted represent the average of two independent experiments. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Representative graph showing percent LDH release in the presence of a serial dilution series of five retrograde inhibitors. Values plotted represent the average Â± SEM from two independent experiments.
