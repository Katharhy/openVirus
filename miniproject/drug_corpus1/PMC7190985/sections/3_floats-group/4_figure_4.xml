  <p>Inhibition of EV formation visualized by actin staining. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Confocal microscopy images of cells infected with VACV WR A4-YFP virus in the presence or absence of Retro-1 analogs PA63, PA24, and PA104. Few to no virus-loaded actin tails observed in the presence of Retro-1 analogs in comparison to virus-only treatment. Nuclei, actin, and VACV are stained blue, red, and green, respectively. Scale bars represent 5 μm. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Average number of virus-loaded actin tails per cell for each treatment. For each condition, virus-loaded actin tails from five to nine cells were counted (virus control: 9, PA24: 5, PA63: 9, and PA104: 7). Each dot represents one cell, and the average ± SEM for all four conditions are shown. Results of one-way analysis of variance and
