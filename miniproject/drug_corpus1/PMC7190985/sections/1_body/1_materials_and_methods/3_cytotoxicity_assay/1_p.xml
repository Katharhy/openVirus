<p>The potential cytotoxic effects of the retrograde inhibitor compounds were tested at a range of concentrations spanning 400–0.3 μM. HeLa cells seeded in 96-well plates were infected with a mixture of VACV WR (MOI 0.01) and serially diluted compounds at 37°C for 24 h. Each concentration was tested in duplicate. Supernatants were collected, and the levels of extracellular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released in the supernatants were quantified using the LDH Cytotoxicity Assay Kit (88953; Thermo Scientific Pierce, Waltham, MA, United States) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Cytotoxicity data were analyzed using a non-linear regression (curve fit) with the sigmoidal dose–response variable slope equation to determine the concentrations required for 50% LDH signal (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) relative to the positive control (lysed cells). This analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, v7). Values were determined based on two or more replicates from two independent experiments.
