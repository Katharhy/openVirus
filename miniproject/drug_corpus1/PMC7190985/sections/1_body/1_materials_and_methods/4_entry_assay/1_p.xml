<p>BSC40 cells were infected with VACV WR-Luc virus at MOI 3 for 1 h at RT. After infection, cells were washed three times with PBS to remove unbound virus. Retrograde inhibitor compounds diluted to 2.5 μM in DMEM-2 were added to cells and incubated at 37°C for 2 h. All compounds were tested in duplicate. Reporter lysis buffer was added to the wells to lyse cells, and luciferase activity was measured using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI, United States) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Luciferase activity was measured using an ENSPIRE plate reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, United States).</p>
