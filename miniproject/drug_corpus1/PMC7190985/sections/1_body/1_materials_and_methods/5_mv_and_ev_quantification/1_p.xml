<p>BSC40 cells were infected with VACV IHDJ virus at MOI 3 for 1 h at RT. The infected cells were washed three times with DMEM-2 to remove excess virus, and retrograde inhibitor compounds were then added to the cells at a concentration of 2.5 μM. Each compound was tested in triplicate, and the cells were incubated with the compounds for 24 h at 37°C. Supernatants were collected and frozen down to determine EV yield. To measure MV yield, cells were washed three times with PBS to remove any EV particles, collected using a cell scraper, and freeze-thawed three times to release MV particles. Extracellular virus and MV yield was quantified by titering the supernatants and cells, respectively, by plaque assay. The percent EV formation and EV inhibition were determined as follows:</p>
