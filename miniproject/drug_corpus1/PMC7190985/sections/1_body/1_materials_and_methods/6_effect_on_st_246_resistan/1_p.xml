<p>BSC40 cells seeded in 12-well plates were infected with approximately 100 plaque forming units (pfu) of VACV WR, RV1, or RV2 for 1 h at 37°C. The virus was removed and compounds PA24, PA63, and PA104 were added to the cells at a concentration of 10 μM, and ST-246 at 2 μM diluted in DMEM containing 2% carboxymethylcellulose. After a 72-h incubation with the inhibitors at 37°C, the cells were stained with crystal violet (CV) containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at RT. Post-CV staining, the plates were washed with water and imaged.</p>
