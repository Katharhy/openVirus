<p>BSC40 cells were infected with serially diluted culture material isolated from a 2009 PV patient (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Lederman et al., 2012</xref>) in the presence or absence of ST-246. Plaques observed in the presence of ST-246 were picked and reconstituted in DMEM-2. Plaque purification was performed by serially passaging single plaques grown in the presence of ST-246 four times. The isolated virus was grown in a six-well plate of BSC40 cells to create an RV1 viral stock. To confirm the presence of the previously characterized A290V mutation in RV1, the F13L gene was sequenced by Sanger sequencing.
