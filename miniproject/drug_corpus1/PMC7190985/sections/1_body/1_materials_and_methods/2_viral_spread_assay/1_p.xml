<p>The viral spread assay was performed as previously described (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Cryer et al., 2017</xref>). A serial dilution series of retrograde inhibitor compounds was mixed 1:1 (vol/vol) with VACV-WR-GFP virus diluted in DMEM-2 at multiplicity of infection (MOI) 0.3. The mixture was transferred to black 96-well, clear-bottom plates (06-443-2; Corning, NY, United States) containing HeLa cells. Each plate included four to eight wells of the following controls: uninfected cells, no treatment (virus only), and virus + AraC (cytosine arabinoside, 40 μg/mL), and each dilution series was tested in duplicate. The cells were infected with the virus + compound mixture at 37°C for 24 h. Following infection, the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature (RT). Cells were then washed with PBS and stained with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for nuclei visualization for 10 min at RT. The plates were imaged using the ArrayScan XTI High Content Screen (HCS) reader, and the percentage of GFP and DAPI positive cells was quantified using the HCS Studio Cell Analysis software as previously described (
