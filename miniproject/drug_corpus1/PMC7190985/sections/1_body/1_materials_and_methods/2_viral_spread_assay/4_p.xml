<p>Viral spread data were analyzed using a non-linear regression (curve fit) with the sigmoidal doseâ€“response variable slope equation to determine the concentrations required for 50% inhibition (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) and 90% inhibition (IC
 <sub>90</sub>) of viral spread relative to the no treatment control. Analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, v7, San Diego, CA, United States). Values were determined based on two or more replicates from two independent experiments.
