<p>BSC40 cells were seeded in 24-well glass- bottom tissue culture plates (MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA, United States) and infected with VACV WR A4-YFP (MOI 1) for 1 h at 37°C. The virus was removed, and compounds PA24, PA63, and PA104 were added to the cells at a concentration of 10 μM. After a 24-h incubation with the inhibitors at 37°C, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at RT. Cells were stained with Alexa Flour 594 Phalloidin (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, United States) for actin visualization and with DAPI for nuclei visualization. After staining, cells were mounted with Prolong Gold Antifade Mounting media (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, United States) and imaged using the LSM 710 inverted confocal microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Virus-loaded actin tails in infected cells were counted for each condition (number of cells counted per condition ranging between 5 and 9) and compared for statistical significance using a one-way ANOVA test.</p>
