<p>Vaccinia virus WR-GFP, VACV WR A4-YFP, VACV WR-Luc, and VACV IHDJ stocks were grown in BSC40 cells with Dulbecco modified eagle medium (DMEM) containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Two ST-246-resistant viruses were used in this study, each containing distinct mutations in the F13L gene: the first (A290V) was isolated from a 2009 human PV case (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Lederman et al., 2012</xref>) and thereafter passaged in our laboratory, and the second (N267D) was provided by SIGA Technologies (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2011</xref>). These two viruses will hereby be referred to as RV1 and RV2, respectively. All viral stocks were titered by plaque assay prior to use in experiments. BSC40 and HeLa cell lines were passaged in DMEM with 10% FBS and 10 units/mL of penicillin and 100 μg/mL of streptomycin (penicillin–streptomycin). For all experiments involving viral infection, DMEM containing 2% FBS, hereby referred to as “DMEM-2,” was used as a diluent or culture media.
