<p>The novel compounds in this study were synthesized in-house using diversity-oriented synthetic approaches. Our synthetic approach involved two different six- and four-step synthetic schemes that were utilized (based on synthetic limitations: cost, the scope of reactions, readily available starting materials) at different stages of the SAR. The specific retrosynthetic disconnections that were effected to access these molecules are shown below. The exact details of these reaction modules/improvisations and navigations of synthetic constraints will be presented in a subsequent publication. Meanwhile, additional information about the compounds can be made available upon request.</p>
