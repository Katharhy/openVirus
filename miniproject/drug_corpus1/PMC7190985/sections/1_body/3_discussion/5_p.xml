<p>In all, given its high SI (&gt;800), submicromolar effective concentration, and potent inhibition of ST-246-resistant viruses, PA104 emerges as a promising candidate for future 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> exploration. Further, PA104 targets a host-specific process rather than a viral protein, offering two additional advantages. First, the absence of a direct viral target reduces the probability of viral resistance to the compound (

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Kaufmann et al., 2018</xref>). Second is the possibility of broad-range applicability to other viruses and non-viral pathogens that utilize the retrograde pathway for entry or egress. We and others have previously shown that Retro-2 and its analogs can reduce 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic>, polyomavirus, and papillomavirus infections, as well as inhibit Shiga toxin trafficking in cells (

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Carney et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Craig et al., 2017</xref>). Recent reports have also investigated the effect of Retro-2 derivatives on HSV2 infections (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Dai et al., 2018</xref>). A majority of these studies have focused primarily on Retro-2 derivatives, and at present, less is understood about the antipathogenic potential of Retro-1 and its derivatives. To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide an in-depth, large-scale characterization of the inhibitory potential of compounds structurally related to Retro-1. As the retrograde pathway plays an important role for several pathogens and toxins, further characterization of compounds such as PA104 and exploration of their 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> activity could have important implications for the design of broad-spectrum therapeutics that have immense public health benefits. An in-depth structureâ€“activity relationship study of PA104 and other structural analogs of Retro-1 is in progress and will be reported in due course.
