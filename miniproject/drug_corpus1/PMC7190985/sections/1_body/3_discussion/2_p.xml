<p>In total, 83 compounds were tested for their ability to decrease VACV spread 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. We observed that 17 of these compounds had comparable or more potent anti-VACV activity than Retro-1 and Retro-2 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> and IC
 <sub>90</sub> values ≤ Retro-1 and Retro-2). We focused on three compounds with high potency and low cytotoxicity, PA24, PA63, and PA104, and subsequently tested their impact on VACV entry and EV/MV yield. The most potent inhibitor of VACV spread, PA104, caused an observable reduction in luciferase activity even at 2.5 μM. In contrast, PA24 and PA63 only appeared to affect entry at higher concentrations. All three compounds tested minimally impacted MV yield while considerably reducing EV yield, except for PA104, which caused a small reduction in MV yield in addition to decreasing EV formation. The spread assay, entry assay, and MV/EV yield data together suggest that while the main mechanism of viral inhibition by Retro-1 derivatives is the inhibition of EV particle formation, select compounds such as PA104 may impact viral entry when present at concentrations greater than their effective inhibitory concentrations. These findings aligned well with previous characterizations of Retro-1 and Retro-2 activity
