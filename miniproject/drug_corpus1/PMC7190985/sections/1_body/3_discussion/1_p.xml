<p>In this study, we describe the screening and characterization of a panel of compounds sharing the benzodiazepine scaffold of Retro-1. These efforts resulted in the discovery of three compounds, PA24, PA63, and PA104, with impressive antiviral activity against VACV, the most potent and promising of which is PA104. The structural differences between these analogs and their parent Retro-1 have been highlighted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS) data are provided in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Data Sheets S1, S2</xref>. We demonstrated the following: (i) Retro-1 derivatives potently inhibit VACV spread 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> with minimal cytotoxicity. (ii) The inhibitory effect was predominantly at a late stage of viral replication. (iii) EV formation is the main target of the analogs, which have little impact on MV yield. (iv) Retro-1 analogs can effectively decrease viral spread of ST-246-resistant viruses. In addition, we identified the Retro-1 derivative PA104 as a promising antiviral candidate with superior anti-VACV efficacy compared to the previously characterized Retro-1 and Retro-2, low cellular toxicity, and potent activity against ST-246-resistant viruses.
