<p>Vaccinia virus replicates in the cytoplasm of the infected cells, resulting in the formation of infectious, single-membrane MV particles at the site of replication (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Condit et al., 2006</xref>). Although infectious, these MV particles remain intracellular unless wrapped by two additional membranes of post-Golgi or endosomal origin to form EVs. Once the outer layer of the EV double membrane fuses with the plasma membrane, an EV can be propelled out of the infected cell by actin tails (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2002</xref>). Because viral spread and EV yield were greatly reduced in the presence of our panel of compounds, we visualized actin tail-associated EVs in infected cells using confocal microscopy. Fewer actin tails were detected in the presence of all three compounds tested, PA104, PA63, and PA24, with the greatest reduction observed in case of PA104.
