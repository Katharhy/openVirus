<p>In our efforts to develop new therapeutic strategies, we focused on the peculiar dependence of OPXVs on the retrograde transport pathway for EV formation. While several viruses (Simian virus 40, papillomavirus, and influenza) rely on retrograde transport for entry into a cell, OPXVs require retrograde transport for EV membrane wrapping, and consequently viral egress (

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Sivan et al., 2016</xref>). We and others have previously demonstrated that impeding the retrograde pathway by targeting the Golgi-associated retrograde protein complex can greatly reduce EV yield with minimal impact on MV formation in VACV and MPXV (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> by preventing the trafficking of the viral protein F13, which is required for membrane wrapping (

 <italic>in vivo</italic> yielded underwhelming results, with treated mice showing marginal improvement in signs of clinical disease and comparable lung viral titers compared to untreated mice (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Harrison et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, better clinical scores were only observed in animals pretreated with Retro-2, and not in mice treated only postinfection (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Harrison et al., 2016</xref>). Given the highly selective, potent anti-VACV activities of Retro-1 and Retro-2 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, we were interested in structurally optimizing these small molecule inhibitors to identify novel antivirals with greater inhibitory effect compared to the parent compounds 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, as well as better 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> therapeutic efficacy.
