<p>OPXVs are large double-stranded DNA viruses that have a complex life cycle, replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells, and generate two distinct virion forms: mature virus (MV) and extracellular virus (EV), differentiated based on the number of membranes surrounding the central DNA core (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Condit et al., 2006</xref>). Mature viruses consist of a viral core and a single viral membrane and harbor all the necessary proteins required for virus binding and entry. Although infectious, MVs remain inside an infected cell until lysis (

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Moss, 2006</xref>). Although EV particles constitute only 1â€“10% of MVs, they are essential for cell-to-cell and long-distance viral spread and therefore play an important role in OPXV pathogenesis (
