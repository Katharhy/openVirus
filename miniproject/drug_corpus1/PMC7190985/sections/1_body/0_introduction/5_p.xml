<p>To this end, we screened a diverse collection of greater than 80 compounds sharing a benzodiazepine scaffold like Retro-1 for efficacy in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-VACV assays. These efforts led to the identification of a potent antiviral we have named PA104. Like Retro-1 and Retro-2, PA104 can potently inhibit EV formation and VACV spread, while minimally impacting MV yield and causing little to no cytotoxicity. We also show that the reduction in viral spread by PA104 is attributable to inhibition of EV formation as evidenced by lack of virus secreted in media and impaired actin tail formation in infected cells. It is particularly noteworthy that PA104 also inhibits viral spread of two distinct ST-246-resistant viruses, establishing its potential for use in postexposure treatment in combination with ST-246. These observations warrant further investigation of PA104 and its efficacy as an antiviral agent.
