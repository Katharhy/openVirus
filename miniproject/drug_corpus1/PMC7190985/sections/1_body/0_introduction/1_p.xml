<p>The 
 <italic>Orthopoxvirus</italic> (OPXV) genus contains several human pathogens of public health concern, including variola virus (the causative agent of smallpox), monkeypox virus (MPXV), cowpox virus, and vaccinia virus (VACV, the virus that formulates the smallpox vaccine) (

In addition, the identification of several new OPXVs over the past decade demonstrates the ongoing circulation and maintenance of these viruses in animal reservoirs, and highlights the need for surveillance and development of better diagnostic assays and therapeutics (
