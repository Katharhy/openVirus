<p>The importance of EV formation for VACV pathogenesis is further highlighted by the fact that pharmacological intervention is efficacious in suppressing infection. At present, tecovirimat (ST-246) is the only US Food and Drug Administration-approved antiviral available for postexposure treatment against smallpox. ST-246 targets the viral envelope protein F13 required for EV formation, thereby decreasing viral spread and infection-induced pathology (
