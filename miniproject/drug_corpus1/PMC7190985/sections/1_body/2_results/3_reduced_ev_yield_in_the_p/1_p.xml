<p>Previous studies have shown that Retro-1 and Retro-2 can inhibit the retrograde pathway and cause a reduction in EV particle formation during VACV and MPXV infection (

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Sivan et al., 2016</xref>). To confirm that the decrease in viral spread observed earlier was attributable to a reduction in EV but not MV particle production, we infected cells with VACV IHDJ, a VACV strain that produces a relatively higher proportion of EV particles (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). We hypothesize that this reduction in MV production could be due to effects on viral entry (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). The reduction in EV yield among the compounds tested ranged between 54 and 89% (
