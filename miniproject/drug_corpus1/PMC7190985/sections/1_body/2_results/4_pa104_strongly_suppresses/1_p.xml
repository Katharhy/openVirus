<p>The double-membrane wrapping of MVs and subsequent formation of EVs in an infected cell triggers the polymerization of actin. This results in the formation of actin tails that can propel the EV particles to neighboring cells, causing cell-to-cell spread (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2002</xref>). Since we had observed a decrease in both viral spread and EV yield in the presence of Retro-1 analogs, we were interested in testing the effect of these compounds on the appearance of virus-loaded actin tails within cells. To this end, we infected cells with VACV in the presence or absence of PA24, PA63, and PA104 and visualized actin-associated virus particles using confocal microscopy. In the absence of the Retro-1 inhibitors, infected cells had several actin tails loaded with VACV at the tips (the viral particles appear as green dots due to the fusion of GFP with the core protein A4), which is characteristic of VACV infection (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). We enumerated the virus-loaded actin tails for each condition and found a significant decrease in virus-loaded tails in the presence of PA24, PA63, and PA104 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). In case of PA104, the reduction in actin tail staining was the most significant compared to the virus control. These data corroborate the results shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3B,C</xref>, demonstrating that fewer virus-loaded actin tails appear in the presence of retrograde inhibitors, which results in a lower EV yield overall.
