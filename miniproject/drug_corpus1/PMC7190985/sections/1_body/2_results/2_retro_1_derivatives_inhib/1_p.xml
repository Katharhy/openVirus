<p>Given the considerable reduction in viral spread described earlier, we checked the effect of PA24, PA63, and PA104 on VACV entry. We infected cells with VACV WR-Luc at RT, which allowed virus attachment but not entry, washed cells to remove unbound virus, and subsequently added the inhibitors (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>, input luciferase activity was very low, suggesting that the RLU values in our assay were largely attributable to viral entry and gene expression, rather than prepackaged luciferase.
