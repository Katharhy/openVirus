<p>We observed that PA24 and PA63 did not markedly decrease viral entry at the lower concentrations tested, corroborating the findings of a previous study that tested Retro-1 and Retro-2 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). To exclude the possibility that these compounds affect the enzymatic activity of luciferase, we added different concentrations of PA104 to lysed VACV WR-Luc-infected cells just before the addition of the substrate. We found no difference in luciferase activity between the treatment groups (
