<p>To identify new inhibitors of VACV infection, we quantified viral spread in the presence of diverse compounds sharing a core structure with Retro-1 using VACV WR-GFP as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>. A total of 83 compounds were tested, and the percentage of GFP
 <sup>+</sup> cells was determined by fluorescent imaging. We measured viral spread for each compound over a range of concentrations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) and determined the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) for all and the 90% inhibitory concentrations (IC
 <sub>90</sub>) for a subset of the compounds. Of the compounds tested, 52 showed &gt; 50% inhibition of VACV spread at concentrations ≤ 10 μM. Within this subset, 17 compounds showed greater inhibitory potency than Retro-1 and Retro-2 and had IC
 <sub>50</sub> and IC
 <sub>90</sub> values ranging between 0.5 and 2.0 μM and between 1.3 and 5.2 μM, respectively (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, data not shown). In addition to examining their effect on viral spread, we also assessed the cellular cytotoxicity of a subset of compounds by measuring cell-released LDH levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). We observed that a majority of potently inhibitory compounds exhibited low cytotoxicity even at 400 μM. Based on the viral spread screen of the Retro-1 like benzodiazepines, we narrowed our focus to three of the most potent VACV inhibitors: PA24, PA63, and PA104 (
