<p>ST-246, targets F13, a peripheral viral membrane protein, interfering with its intracellular localization (

To investigate whether the potent anti-VACV compounds identified in this study could inhibit ST-246–resistant virus, we infected cells with two different ST-246-resistant viruses in the presence of 10 μM PA104, PA24, and PA63. The two viruses used contained distinct resistance-conferring mutations; the first, hereby referred to as RV1, was isolated from the lesions of a PV patient by serial plaque purification in the presence of ST-246 (
