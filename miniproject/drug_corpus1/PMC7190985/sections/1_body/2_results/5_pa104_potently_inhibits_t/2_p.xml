<p>While both the ST-246-resistant viruses formed large plaques in the presence or absence of 2 Î¼M ST-246, a concentration of ST-246 over 50-fold higher than its IC50 value, treatment with PA104, PA24, and PA63 caused a considerable reduction in viral plaque size. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>, all three compounds substantially reduced the size of RV2 plaques. For RV1, on the other hand, PA104 was markedly more effective in reducing viral spread than PA24 and PA63 (
