 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Hyposmia is a common symptom of different neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and has been associated with levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), an inflammatory biomarker deeply investigated in brain disorders [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Of note, IL-6 action is blocked by tocilizumab, a drug currently used to inhibit cytokine storm in Covid-19 patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A recent study revealed c-reactive protein levels above the low-grade inflammation threshold (&gt; 3 mg/l) for three out of four patients presenting with loss of taste and olfaction, which were reported to be more intense and long-lasting than those in common cold disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Therefore, accumulating evidence suggests systemic inflammation may be a potential pathway to explain neurological sequelae of Covid-19, a hypothesis which should be investigated more in depth.
