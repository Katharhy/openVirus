 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], it is less so for disorders due to the accumulation of neurotoxic aggregates, like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease. Influenza epidemics are associated with neurological manifestations, and the H

 <sub>1</sub> virus reportedly induces Parkinsonian pathology in mice, both findings possibly explained by the activation of inflammatory pathways [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, the exact mechanisms of these effects and whether coronaviruses show a similar action remain unclear. The current Covid-19 pandemic provides an unprecedented opportunity to disentangle the link between viral/infectious diseases, inflammation, and the risk of brain disorders, as mentioned here below.
