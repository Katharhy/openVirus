<p id="Par6">To sum up, the current Covid-19 pandemic provides an extraordinary window to implement a worldwide collaborative effort, aimed at enlightening the largely unexplored relationship between viral infections, inflammation, and brain disorders. To this purpose, coordination of hospitals and general practice and public health institutions will be needed to collect, store, and allow access to electronic health records during and after the epidemic. We “call to arms” clinicians and researchers worldwide, to take an unexpected advantage from a painful event and make it an extraordinary opportunity to fight brain disorders, which represent a huge challenge and a heavy burden for national health systems.</p>
