<p id="p0010">COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-2019), a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2), has emerged as a rapidly spreading communicable disease affecting more than 100 countries across the globe at present. The disease is primarily spread through large respiratory droplets, though the possibility of other routes of transmission cannot be ruled out, as the virus has been found in stool and urine of affected individuals [

There are regional variations in the mortality rates and these estimates are rapidly changing as more data are becoming available. There were 95,333 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide with a mortality rate of 3.4% according to the situation report of World Health Organisation on March 5, 2020 [

The understanding of epidemiological characteristics of this infection is evolving on a daily basis as the disease is spreading to different parts of the globe.
