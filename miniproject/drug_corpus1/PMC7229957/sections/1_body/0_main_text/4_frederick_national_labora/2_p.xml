<p id="p0030">FNLCR recently worked closely with NIAID, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and several academic medical centers on the recent clinical trial of the antiviral remdesivir for patients who are seriously ill with COVID-19. NCI, in partnership with NIAID and the National Human Genome Research Institute, has also begun a series of genomics studies at FNLCR to identify genetic variants associated with outcomes in both cancer and non-cancer patients with COVID-19. The goal is to identify potential targets for new treatments and provide valuable insights that can be used for screening purposes.</p>
