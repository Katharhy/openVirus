<p id="p0060">Many NCI-designated cancer centers, on their own or in collaboration with other cancer centers, have also moved rapidly to launch novel therapeutic clinical trials involving cancer patients with COVID-19. One example is the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium led by the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center. Because cancer patients may be at increased risk of developing complications from SARS-CoV-2, Vanderbilt has galvanized a group of more than 80 cancer centers and other organizations that are collecting clinical data on cancer patients who have been infected with COVID-19. The intent is to accumulate data as rapidly as possible on this vulnerable population and disseminate the data immediately via an open-access database, since some of what is learned from the data may have practice-changing implications.</p>
