 </xref> At the time of this report, at least 1 correctional facility (J Clarke, RI DOC, personal communication, 2020) has separated individuals at risk for severe diseases from others as much as possible, yet the efficacy of this practice is still unclear. In addition to the measures taken inside correctional facilities, authorities must move quickly to reassess security and public health risks. Release of individuals who do not pose an immediate threat to public safety while reducing arrests and delaying sentencing is prudent. Individuals who are being held in jails because of their inability to afford bail or for minor infractions or violations should be released with support to ensure safe shelter. Similarly, those eligible for parole can and should be released. Already, it has been observed that SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in correctional settings spread quickly, with reports from Cook County Jail in Illinois going from 2 positive cases to more than 350 confirmed positive cases in slightly more than 2 weeks.

 </xref> The U.S., which has the highest worldwide incarceration rate and a disproportionally greater minority and disadvantaged population, must act swiftly to protect the health and safety of incarcerated individuals and the community at large.
