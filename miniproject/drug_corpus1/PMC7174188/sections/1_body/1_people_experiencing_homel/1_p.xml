<p id="para0003">Homeless shelters are minimally staffed and overcrowded with large fluxes of people and limited bathroom accessâ€”ideal for viral transmission. Amid this pandemic, shelters are reducing staffing and clientele while experiencing increasing demand for services. Consistent with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, symptom screening protocols are being implemented to identify individuals with fever or respiratory illness,

 </xref> and although facilities strive to isolate symptomatic individuals, they are often unable to do so owing to space limitations. The long incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 and the heterogeneous clinical presentation may render symptom screening to be a limited tool, especially given that individuals may be asymptomatic with SARS-CoV-2. Preliminary reports from post-exposure testing at a homeless shelter in Boston found a 36% case rate of SARS-CoV-2 from their cohort of 408 clients who received the polymerase chain reaction test, but only a small percentage had cough (7.5%), shortness of breath (1.4%), or fever (0.7%).

 </xref> New research suggests that the estimated cumulative frequency of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases among adults experiencing homelessness in Boston were 46.3 cases per 1,000 compared with 1.9 cases per 1,000 adults in Massachusetts over the same 15-day period.

 </xref> Without access to universal polymerase chain reaction testing for all individuals entering shelters and an ability to safely isolate individuals who are positive, SARS-CoV-2 transmission is likely to continue, and cities should prepare for the possibility of an increased burden of the disease among populations experiencing homelessness.
