<p>The SARS‐CoV‐2 genome encodes 11 genes (open reading frames), and the polyprotein from orf1ab is processed into 16 proteins (polypeptides) through cleavages by the papain‐like proteinase and 3C‐like proteinase activities [

 <xref rid="feb213806-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref>]. As a result of template search, the appropriate structural templates were found for 17 SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins among a total of 26, and their homology models were constructed (Table 
 <xref rid="feb213806-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The 9 unmodeled proteins included those from very short ORFs, namely Nsp11 (13 amino acid residues), ORF7b (43 residues), and ORF10 (38 residues) and probable membrane proteins (nsp6, ORF3a, ORF6, M, and ORF8), which were annotated by the SOSUI server [
