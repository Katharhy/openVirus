<p>The third region of papain‐like proteinase (nsp3), nsp4, 3C‐like proteinase, nsp9, endo‐RNAse, surface glycoprotein, envelope protein, and C‐terminal region of nucleocapsid phosphoprotein was modeled into homo‐multimer. As the hetero‐multimeric models, nsp7 and nsp8 were modeled into hetero‐16mer; RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase, nsp7, and nsp8 were modeled as hetero‐tetramer (1:1:2 stoichiometry); 3'‐to‐5' exonuclease and nsp10 formed hetero‐dimer; 2'‐
 <italic>O</italic>‐ribose methyltransferase and nsp10 also formed hetero‐dimer; and homo‐trimer of surface glycoprotein was modeled in complex with human angiotensin I‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Table
