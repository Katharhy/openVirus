<p>Since a considerable amount of structural studies have already been done for SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV proteins, most of the available templates were from these viruses, and they had high‐sequence similarity (more than 90%) to SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins. Two proteins, namely papain‐like proteinase (nsp3) and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, could not be modeled into a single structural model. As a result of homology search, template structures covering the entire protein were unavailable. Template structures were separated into 6 and 2 fragment/domain models, respectively. Consequently, the coverages of structural model were 56% and 69% of total residues for papain‐like proteinase (nsp3) and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, respectively (Table
