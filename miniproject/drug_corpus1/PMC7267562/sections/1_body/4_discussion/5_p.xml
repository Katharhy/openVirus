<p>The human ACE2 has been demonstrated to change its conformation from open to close forms (PDB IDs 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://1R4L" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://1R4L</ext-link> and 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://1R42" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://1R42</ext-link>, respectively) upon inhibitor binding [
 <xref rid="feb213806-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">59</xref>]. Thus, if this conformational change involves the interface to the RBD of surface glycoprotein, a drug bound to the drug‐binding site might interfere with the binding between ACE2 and surface glycoprotein indirectly. This allosteric inhibition mechanism, however, is not highly expected because no obvious conformational change was observed in the interface region when comparing the open and close conformations of ACE2. Most of the predicted drugs are targeted toward ACE (not ACE2), and ACE and ACE2 diverge considerably in their amino acid sequences (44% identity). The fitness of the drugs was evaluated to be lower than the specific inhibitor to ACE2. Therefore, effects of the predicted ACE drugs on preventing surface glycoprotein–ACE2 interactions would not be highly promising.
