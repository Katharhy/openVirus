<p>The complex models were constructed for several high‐scored and/or high‐ranked drugs. Unexpectedly, no drug was detected for one of the most promising drug targets, 3C‐like proteinase, with a similarity score higher than 0.8. In the previous study, the score more than 0.8 was suggested to be required for highly similar interactions between ligand and protein [

It is implied that the inhibitors bound to the 3C‐like proteinase in the known structures are considerably deviated from most of the approved protease‐targeted drugs. For example, the anti‐HIV drug lopinavir/ritonavir, which was expected to target SARS‐CoV‐2 3C‐like proteinase [

 <xref rid="feb213806-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>], showed only limited similarity (score 0.513) to the known ligand (ligand code AXP) of SARS‐CoV 3C‐like proteinase (Fig. 
 <xref rid="feb213806-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). One possible reason for the low similarity to drugs is that the protease inhibitors tend to have higher molecular weight and thus their molecular structures showed large variety. Another reason would be that a majority of the protease inhibitory drugs are targeted toward serine or zinc proteases [

 <xref rid="feb213806-bib-0069" ref-type="ref">69</xref>]. Also, the expected drug lopinavir/ritonavir has been designed for HIV protease, which is aspartic protease. These proteases are structurally distinct from 3C‐like proteinase known to be a cysteine protease. This observation implies that structure optimizations would likely be required for repurposed drugs for SARS‐CoV‐2 3C‐like proteinase. Consequently, the presented study suggested carfilzomib, which has been targeted toward threonine protease and approved for multiple myeloma treatment [

 <xref rid="feb213806-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">50</xref>], as a marginally resembling drug. The model showed, however, carfilzomib fits well (even better than the specific inhibitor N3, according to the DSX score) into the active site by forming considerable stabilizing interactions and no severe steric hindrance (Fig. 
 <xref rid="feb213806-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>).
