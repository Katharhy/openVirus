<p>Another potential target is the complex of surface glycoprotein and ACE2 to prevent virus entry into the cell [

Many hypertension drugs are targeted to ACE, and the presented study highlighted the approved drugs, namely lisinopril, enalaprilat, and captopril, as potential ligands for ACE2. An expectation in advance was to find a drug that bound to ACE2 and also interfered the interactions between surface glycoprotein and ACE2. However, as the models revealed, the drug‐binding site of ACE2 existed inside a deep cleft in the center of ACE2 molecule, and the ligands do not interact directly with the surface glycoprotein (Fig.
