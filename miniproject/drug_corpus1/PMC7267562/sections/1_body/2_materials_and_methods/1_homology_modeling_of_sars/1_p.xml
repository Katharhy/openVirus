<p>The amino acid sequences of SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins (Table 
 <xref rid="feb213806-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>) were retrieved from the RefSeq database at NCBI [
 <xref rid="feb213806-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref>], and structural modeling templates were sought with the SIRD system (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sird.nagahama-i-bio.ac.jp/sird/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://sird.nagahama-i-bio.ac.jp/sird/</ext-link>), which accepted multiple query sequences and sought for similar sequences (more than 30% sequence identity to query) with known structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [
 <xref rid="feb213806-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>] by using BLAST [
 <xref rid="feb213806-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref>]. This system also sought for the templates of protein complex structures, in which two or more proteins in the multiple query were associated or any ligand bound to query proteins. The coordinates of template structures were obtained from the PDB [
 <xref rid="feb213806-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>] and were rendered into the biological quaternary structures.
