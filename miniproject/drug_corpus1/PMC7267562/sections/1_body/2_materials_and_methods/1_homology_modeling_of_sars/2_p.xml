<p>Initial structural models were constructed by using 
 <sc>modeller</sc> [
 <xref rid="feb213806-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref>]. In some cases, the resultant models contain residues with rare dihedral angles (Ramachandran outliers), rare shape of side chains (rotamer outliers), and short atomâ€“atom distances (atomic crashes). Then, the models were further modified by iteratively applying molecular dynamics and geometry minimization procedures of 
 <sc>phenix</sc> [
 <xref rid="feb213806-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref>] to eliminate aforementioned outliers, and finally, manual model modifications with visual inspection on COOT for resolving rotamer outliers or atomic crashes [
 <xref rid="feb213806-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref>]. The model quality was evaluated with 
 <sc>molprobity</sc> [
 <xref rid="feb213806-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref>]. The percentages of rotamer outlier, Ramachandran outlier, and crash score were monitored for each model to achieve less than 2%, 0.05%, and 5, respectively.
