<p>Hydroxyurea demonstrated promising results in reducing HIV RNA viral loads in five placebo-controlled clinical trials. Among all the trials, hydroxyurea was combined with didanosine, a nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI). However, one should be reminded that decreased CD4 counts were noted in some studies. Therefore, close follow up of hematologic change is required in daily practice.
