<p>Tofacitinib, a JAK1 and JAK3 inhibitor, is indicated in rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and psoriatic arthritis. It is also used off label for vitiligo and alopecia areata. Tofacitinib treats inflammatory diseases by interfering with the activation of the JAK/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathway, which inhibits gene transcription, and cytokine production is thereby reduced.</p>
