<p>Infections are a common concern of immunosuppressive drugs. However, some immunosuppressants or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) show antiviral activity and may be safely used or even beneficial in patients with selected concomitant viral infections. Certain DMARDs may even be considered as an alternative treatment for recalcitrant infections. Moreover, the concomitant use of immunosuppressants and antiviral agents was proved to be more effective than antiviral agent monotherapy in some reports.

 </sup> The antiviral property of immunosuppressants may act through (a) direct virucidal activity, (b) blockage of receptors, (c) inhibition of necessary molecules for viral replication in the hosts, or (d) amelioration of inflammatory symptoms. Also, control of inflammation may decrease the susceptibility or enhance host ability to defend against viral infection. The following review focuses on the immunosuppressants/DMARDs which have antiviral potential through the first three mode of actions. Antiviral agents with immunosuppressive activity such as ribavirin

 </sup> are beyond the scope of this review. In view of the imperative demand to control the recently discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), DMARDs with treatment potential are covered in part I. For other viruses, including We also conducted a two-step research as follows: common ones in daily practice and those without specific target therapy, but life threatening, evidence is covered in part II.
