<p>HCQ had been reported to downregulate the expression of IFN genes and reduce the production of type I IFNs. This phenomenon was noted

 </sup> Since IFNs are crucial in innate immunity to defend viral infections, the usage of HCQ may raise concerns about the counter effects in viral control. Nevertheless, opposite results were also presented: HCQ activated IFN-Î² signaling pathways in cell studies of dengue virus.

 </sup> Furthermore, blocking type I IFN receptors attenuated the efficacy of HCQ in the treatment of dengue-virus-infected cells.
