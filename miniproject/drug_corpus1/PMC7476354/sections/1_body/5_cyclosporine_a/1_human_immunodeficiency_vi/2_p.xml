<p>A retrospective study included 27 HIV patients with CD4 T-cell counts 300–600/µl. After a median exposure time of 11 months on CsA (7.5 mg/kg per day), stable CD4 numbers were demonstrated, and none of the patients progressed to AIDS. Conversely, CD4 counts declined at a rate of 5 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> per year after cessation of CsA.

 </sup> Nevertheless, an RCT (
 <italic>n</italic> = 28) allocated HIV patients with CD4 numbers greater than 500/µl into a CsA 2 mg/kg per day group, or placebo group. The results demonstrated that CD4 numbers did not increase under low-dose CsA, but HIV RNA levels raised slightly (that was statistically significant) instead.
