<p>Moreover, melanoma-differentiation-activated protein 5 (MDA5), an RLR helicase and putative cytoplasmic receptor of SARS-CoV-2, is also the target antigen of clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis (CADM). Patients with MDA5 plus CADM have higher risks of developing rapidly progressive interstitial lung diseases and respiratory failure, while this could be reversed by calcineurin inhibitors. Based on these hypothetical functions, CsA was proposed as a modulator for cytokine storm syndrome in COVID-19 infections.
