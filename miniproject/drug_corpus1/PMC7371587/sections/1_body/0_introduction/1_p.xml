<p id="p0005">In December 2019, an outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease occurred in Wuhan, China that has subsequently been termed the Coronavirus Disease- 2019 (COVID-19). Like other coronaviruses, the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is primarily a respiratory pathogen and its clinical manifestations are dominated by respiratory symptoms, the most severe of which is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, COVID-19 has been increasingly recognized to cause an overwhelming inflammatory response and cytokine storm subsequently resulting in multi-systemic end organ damage

 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions have been observed to have a heightened cytokine storm leading to more significant cardiac injury and worse overall outcomes

Existing studies have proposed multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms for AMI in the setting of these viral infections. These include, inflammatory and increased shear stress causing plaque rupture leading to acute coronary event, aggravation of pre-existing coronary artery disease causing more severe cardiac injury and other direct and indirect causes of myocardial injuries (
