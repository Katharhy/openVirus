<p id="p0065">Improved understanding of underlying mechanisms by which COVID-19 causes myocardial injury will help thousands of individuals currently infected by the SARS-CoV2 to take preventive measures and follow up more intensively to achieve early detection, prevention and treatment of subsequent atherosclerotic disease and new onset myocardial injury. While it is known that repeated influenza infections cause proportionally increased risk of MI, it is yet to be determined if repeated infection with SARS-CoV2 is associated with increased risk of MI. However, based on the knowledge of common mechanisms by which systemic viral infections cause multi-organ damage, it is rational to assume that re-infection with SARS-CoV2 and subsequent infection with other viruses will lead to super-added myocardial injury. Therefore, further research is needed to study in detail, the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying this association and identify high risk groups that can possibly benefit from intensive cardiovascular screening and follow-up.</p>
