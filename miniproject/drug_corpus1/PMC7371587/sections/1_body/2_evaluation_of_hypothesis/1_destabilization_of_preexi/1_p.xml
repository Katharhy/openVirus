<p id="p0050">Most acute coronary syndromes occur due to thrombotic complications at the site of atherosclerotic plaque formation. Disruption of the plaque surface exposes underlying tissue factors, collagen and phospholipids which further causes platelet adhesion and formation of an acute or subacute thrombus. Systemic inflammation after acute viral infections plays a central role in triggering plaque disruption and causation of acute coronary syndromes. When compared to patients with stable coronary artery disease, those with acute coronary syndrome have higher inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, WBC and neutrophil myeloperoxidase across the entire coronary arterial network, in addition to the culprit lesion

As mentioned above, respiratory viruses lead to an increase in infiltration of inflammatory cells (macrophages, neutrophils and T cells) that ultimately produce cytokines, proteases, coagulation factors, oxygen radicals and vasoactive molecules that cause endothelial damage, disrupt fibrous cap and initiate the formation of thrombi
