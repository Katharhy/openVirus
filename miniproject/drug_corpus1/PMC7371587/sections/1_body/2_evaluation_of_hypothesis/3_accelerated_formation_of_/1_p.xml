<p id="p0060">Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory condition that begins with endothelial injury. A variety of stimuli are known to cause endothelial injury and help accelerate plaque formation. The inflammatory cells including mononuclear monocytes that arise from systemic viral infections induced chemokines and cytokines play a pivotal role in formation of lipid-laden foam cells. These lipid laden foam cells are hallmarks of atheroma formation. Furthermore, influx of CD4 + T-cells results in an increased production of cytokines that stimulate smooth muscle cells to migrate to the intima and generate collagen and other fibrous products 
 <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. There is a complex interplay in downstream biochemical processes between various inflammatory cytokines and tissue cells leading to the evolution of fatty streak to advanced atherosclerotic lesions. These lesions, formed during an incident event of COVID-19 can be further propagated during subsequent systemic viral illnesses leading to acute coronary syndrome and contributing to increased cardiovascular disease burden.
