<p id="p0055">A pivotal step in the evolution of acute coronary syndrome is the activation of platelets and formation of platelet thrombi. Platelets can be directly activated by pathogens which can in-turn augment the inflammatory process 
 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Acute infections such as influenza also cause coronary vasoconstriction and stimulate platelet activation via shear stress 
 <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Cytokine storm induced by respiratory viral infections also leads to increased secretion of tissue factor without consequential increase in counter-regulatory pathways such as anti-thrombin III activity, activated protein C and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 
 <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. This leads to the formation of new onset thrombi that can propagate in size causing myocardial ischemia. Furthermore, severe hypoxemia induced by respiratory viral infections, increased cardiac metabolic demands induced by the subsequent cytokine storm and the eventual decrease in mean arterial pressure owing to sepsis causes further development of myocardial ischemia 
 <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. There is some evidence suggesting presence of heightened plasma viscosity during fever 
 <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, which further increases the chances of myocardial ischemia.
