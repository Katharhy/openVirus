   <bold>Competing Interests: </bold>Clotilde El-Guerche Séblain is an employee of Sanofi Pasteur. She was the coordinator of the research project at Sanofi Pasteur, she helped define the study objectives, and critically revised the manuscript. When reviewing the manuscript, the revisions concerned the epidemiological findings of the study and not the public health findings or conclusions. This does not alter our adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. Cheryl Cohen has received grant support from Sanofi Pasteur, Advanced Vaccine Initiative, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and payment of travel costs from Parexel. All of the other authors declare that they have no conflict of interests to disclose.
