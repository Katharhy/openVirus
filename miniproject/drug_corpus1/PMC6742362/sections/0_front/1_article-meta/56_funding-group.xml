 <funding-statement>The study is supported by a research grant from Sanofi Pasteur: the ‘Global Epidemiology of Influenza B’ research project. The funder provided support in the form of salaries for two authors (CEGS and JP) but did not have any additional role in the data collection, analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. The specific roles of these authors are articulated in the “author contribution section”. None of the surveillance schemes in the participating countries was supported by this grant.</funding-statement>
