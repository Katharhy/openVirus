 <title>Data Availability</title>
 <p>The database of the Global Influenza B Study was created by collecting surveillance datasets from each of the participating countries. These national datasets are owned by the participating countries and thus cannot be shared publicly by the study group at NIVEL. Researchers interested in accessing the complete GIBS database can contact John Paget (
  <email>j.paget@nivel.nl</email>) or Saverio Caini (
  <email>s.caini@nivel.nl</email>): any request to access the GIBS database will need, however, to be approved by the study group at NIVEL and by contributors from each participating country. Researchers interested in obtaining the country-specific datasets may instead contact the individuals listed in the Supporting Information.
