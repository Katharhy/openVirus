<p>Similar to previous GIBS publications [

 <xref rid="pone.0222381.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0222381.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], the unit of analysis was the “season”: this corresponded to the calendar year in tropical countries and countries located in the Southern hemisphere, and was defined as the period between the 27
 <sup>th</sup> week of a year and the 26
 <sup>th</sup> week of the following year for countries located in the Northern hemisphere. As previously explained [
 <xref rid="pone.0222381.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], the purpose of this methodological approach is to give each “season” an equal weighting in the analysis, thus limiting the impact on results arising from any differences in reporting between countries (e.g. high- vs. low-resources countries) and over time within the same country (e.g. before vs. after the 2009 pandemic).
