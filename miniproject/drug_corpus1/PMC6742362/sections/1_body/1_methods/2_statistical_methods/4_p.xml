<p>We aimed to evaluated the frequency of influenza B lineage-level vaccine mismatch, which was defined as a mismatch between the lineage that caused the majority (&gt;50%) of influenza B cases in a given season and country, and the lineage included in the trivalent vaccine. Information on influenza vaccine formulation was retrieved from the WHO website [
 <xref rid="pone.0222381.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The above definition is straightforward for temperate countries in the Northern and Southern hemisphere, but much less so for countries of the inter-tropical belt. While the WHO issues recommendations on the composition of influenza vaccines to be used in tropical countries [
 <xref rid="pone.0222381.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], these countries often adopt either formulation based on local considerations or make no specific recommendations [
 <xref rid="pone.0222381.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. To cope with this and consider all possible scenarios (and also for consistency with previous GIBS publications [
 <xref rid="pone.0222381.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]), the frequency of B lineage-level vaccine mismatch in tropical countries was calculated by assuming that: (i) all countries situated north of the equator use the northern hemisphere vaccine, and all countries south of the equator use the southern hemisphere vaccine formulation; (ii) all countries use the northern hemisphere vaccine formulation; or (iii) all countries use the southern hemisphere vaccine formulation.
