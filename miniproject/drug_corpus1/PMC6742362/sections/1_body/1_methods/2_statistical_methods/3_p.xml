<p>We compared the timing of the primary peak of influenza A and B epidemics in each country using the EPIPOI software [
 <xref rid="pone.0222381.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. For this analysis, we excluded data from the 2009 season (2009â€“2010 in Northern hemisphere countries) because of the markedly atypical timing of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemics. Time series were first standardized by dividing the weekly number of influenza cases by the maximum weekly number (per country by defined season). Next, a periodic annual function (PAF) was generated by summing up the annual, semi-annual and quarterly harmonics (obtained by Fourier decomposition). The timing of the primary peak (defined as the month where the PAF reaches its maximum value) was then compared for A and B epidemics in each country.
