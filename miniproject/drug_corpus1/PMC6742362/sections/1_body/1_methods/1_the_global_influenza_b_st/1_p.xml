<p>The rationale and methodology of the Global Influenza B Study has been described in detail elsewhere [

 <xref rid="pone.0222381.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The GIBS database encompasses epidemiological and virological influenza surveillance data from thirty-one countries around the world (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222381.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Participating countries were classified as located in the Northern hemisphere (n = 11), inter-tropical belt (n = 15), or Southern hemisphere (n = 5) based on the latitude of the country’s population centre [
 <xref rid="pone.0222381.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Participating countries were required to make available influenza surveillance data for as many consecutive years as possible (from 2000 onwards). Data include the weekly number of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases broken down by virus type (A, B), type A subtype (H1N1, 2009 pandemic H1N1, H3N2, A not subtyped), and type B lineage (Victoria, Yamagata, B not characterized) and weekly influenza-like illness/acute respiratory infection rates (per 100,000 population or 100 consultations, depending on country). Information on age (exact age or age groups) was also available. In most participating countries, the influenza surveillance system covers the whole national territory, and a sample of influenza virus positive specimens or virus isolates is routinely sent to a WHO collaborating centre for further investigations. However, countries differ in other important aspects of their surveillance system, e.g. the clinical case definition in use, the distribution of outpatients and inpatients being sampled, and the availability of population denominators [

 <xref rid="pone.0222381.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], but was updated for the purposes of this paper with data until 2015 to 2018 (depending on the country) for twenty-five countries. The Netherlands joined the project in 2018, bringing the total number of participating countries to thirty-one.
