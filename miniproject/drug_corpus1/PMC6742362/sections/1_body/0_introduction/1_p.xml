<p>Influenza causes a major burden of disease on populations globally [
 <xref rid="pone.0222381.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The impact of seasonal and pandemic influenza on population health in high-income countries has been described extensively [
 <xref rid="pone.0222381.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In Europe, influenza ranks first among infectious diseases in terms of burden, accounting for 30% of the total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost due to infectious diseases annually [
 <xref rid="pone.0222381.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. More recently, evidence has been accumulating that the burden of disease associated with influenza is high in low- and middle-income countries as well [
 <xref rid="pone.0222381.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Type A viruses cause most influenza cases and are responsible for pandemics, but influenza B is an important cause of morbidity and mortality during interpandemic periods, and its prevention represents an important public health priority globally [
 <xref rid="pone.0222381.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0222381.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Influenza B viruses split into two antigenically distinct phylogenetic lineages (B/Victoria/2/87 representative, abbreviated B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata/16/88 representative, abbreviated B/Yamagata) in the early 1980s [
 <xref rid="pone.0222381.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Whilst the circulation of the Victoria lineage was geographically limited to eastern Asia for most of the 1990s, the two lineages have co-circulated globally in the 21
 <sup>st</sup> century [
