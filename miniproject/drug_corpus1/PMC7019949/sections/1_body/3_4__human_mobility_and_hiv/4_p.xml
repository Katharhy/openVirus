<p>Human migration also has a key influence on HIV transmission. In a study of HIV across Mesoamerica, human mobility in part due to economic migration likely bridged infected and susceptible populations resulting in transmission of HIV [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00067" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Wertheimâ€™s global look at the overall HIV transmission network found many links between persons from different nations, highlighting the role of travel or migration in the spread of the virus [
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-12-00067" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Several studies have also highlighted the onward transmission of non-B HIV-1 subtypes among migrants [

 <xref rid="B51-viruses-12-00067" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. As non-B HIV-1 is much more likely to have been acquired outside of the US and other western nations, these likely represent easily identified viral introductions crossing international borders [

 <xref rid="B51-viruses-12-00067" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Additional evidence for this comes from observations of new viral subtypes [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00067" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and circulating recombinant forms entering certain geographic regions [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00067" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Others have reported on how migration of infected persons into highly susceptible populations (e.g. injections drug users) can fuel new epidemics [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-12-00067" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00067" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. It is clear that human mobility and migration are important factors that must be accounted for in order to lower the burden of HIV infection [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00067" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and allow optimization of prevention efforts. Such pathways of viral dissemination warrant intervention strategies that address mobile populations.
