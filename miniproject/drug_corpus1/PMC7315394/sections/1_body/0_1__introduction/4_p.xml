<p>The S protein, a surface-located trimeric glycoprotein of CoVs, is the primary determinant of CoV tropism, as it binds to the membrane receptor on host cells, mediating viral and cellular membrane fusion [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The S protein of 2019-nCoV reportedly binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a homolog of ACE on host cell membranes, contributing to 2019-nCoV cell invasion [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Moreover, this particular S protein shows a higher binding affinity to ACE2 than the S protein of SARS-CoV, enabling 2019-nCoV to invade host cells more effectively [
