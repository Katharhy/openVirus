<p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) (corona: crown-like shape) are enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses that belong to the order 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic> in the subfamily 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>. CoVs are divided into four genera: alpha (
 <italic>α</italic>), beta (
 <italic>β</italic>), gamma (
 <italic>γ</italic>), and delta (
 <italic>δ</italic>) (

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Alpha- and beta-CoVs infect mammals, while gamma- and delta-CoVs primarily infect birds [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Before December 2019, six types of CoVs had infected humans, including two 
 <italic>α</italic>-CoVs (HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63) and four 
 <italic>β</italic>-CoVs (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV). The first two 
 <italic>β</italic>-CoVs (HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1) mainly cause self-limiting upper respiratory infections, while the other two 
 <italic>β</italic>-CoVs (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) are mostly associated with severe respiratory illness [

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Full-genome sequence analysis of 2019-nCoV confirms that it is a 
 <italic>β</italic>-CoV, distinct from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Investigations reveal that 2019-nCoV shares ~80% sequence identity with SARS-CoV while maintaining ~89% nucleotide identity to the SARS-like CoVs (ZC45 and ZXC21) from bats [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A recent report suggests that a bat CoV (RatG13) is 96% identical to 2019-nCoV [
