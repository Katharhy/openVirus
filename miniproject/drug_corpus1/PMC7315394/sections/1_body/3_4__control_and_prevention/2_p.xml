<p>Given the high transmissibility of COVID-19, its propensity for asymptomatic transmission, and its persistent nature, confirmed patients could only be quarantined and treated in adequately equipped facilities. This also applies to anyone who has come into contact with these patients. As such, contact tracing is still a mainstay for disease control. Confirmation can be achieved only when specific diagnostic methods have been employed. Chest CT imaging is useful as an initial evaluation for COVID-19, as CT confirmation is often possible even before symptoms appear; therefore, it is recommended for suspected COVID-19 cases [

Once a person is confirmed positive, tests such as C-reactive protein (CRP), complete blood count, urinalysis, biochemical indicators (i.e., liver enzymes, myocardial enzymes, and renal function), blood coagulation function, arterial blood gas analysis, and cytokine levels should be performed to monitor the patient's condition [
