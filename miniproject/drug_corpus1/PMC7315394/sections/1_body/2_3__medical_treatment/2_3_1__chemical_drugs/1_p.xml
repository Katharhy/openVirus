<p>There are currently no approved antiviral drugs to treat COVID-19, and patients must depend upon their immune systems to combat the infection. A full-fledged treatment plan has yet to emerge, and both academia and pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop new treatments and vaccines to address COVID-19. Research into the cellular and molecular pathogenesis of 2019-nCoV has provided essential insights with the hope of developing viable therapies. While researchers are working on cures or preventive measures for COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>], a more robust, efficient, and economical way to tackle the disease is to repurpose existing drugs into a viable therapeutic strategy. Drug repurposing, also termed drug repositioning, refers to the process of discovering new therapeutic applications for existing drugs. It offers various advantages over traditional de novo drug discovery, i.e., reduced cost and drug development time, established drug characteristics, and, most importantly, established safe dosages for human use [
