<p>When an infection occurs, the virus gains entry into a host cell by attaching itself to the host cell surface (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. This relies on numerous interactions between the virion surface and the specific proteins on the cell membrane. In general, these surface proteins have other functions but are serendipitously recognized by the virus as entry receptors [
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Molecules that prevent such recognition, either by competitive binding or by downregulating the receptors, are known as viral entry inhibitors (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9(a)</xref>). These inhibitors are valuable as therapeutics since blocking infection early in the life cycle reduces cellular and tissue damage associated with viral replication and production of viral progeny.
