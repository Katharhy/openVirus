<p>Lopinavir-ritonavir is a coformulated antiretroviral drug with excellent efficacy against HIV-1. The lopinavir has a core molecular structure identical to ritonavir. The 5-thiazolyl end group and 2-isopropylthiazolyl group in ritonavir are replaced by the phenoxyacetyl group and a modified valine, respectively, in which the amino terminus has six-membered cyclic urea attached. In brief, lopinavir is a potent protease inhibitor developed from ritonavir with high specificity for HIV-1 protease [
