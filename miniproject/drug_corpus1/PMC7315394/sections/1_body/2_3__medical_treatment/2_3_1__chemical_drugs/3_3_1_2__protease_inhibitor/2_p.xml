<p>Coronavirus S proteins can be primed by a multitude of proteases [
 <xref rid="B145" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. Hoffmann et al. demonstrated that the S protein of 2019-nCoV could be primed by serine protease TMRPSS2 [
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Similarly, both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can be activated by other TMPRSS family members [
 <xref rid="B145" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. TMPRSS family proteases are widely expressed in the respiratory tract [

 <xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>], which is likely the reason that coronaviruses cause acute respiratory distress syndrome. Upon successful priming, the viral genome encoding RNA and several nonstructural proteins, including coronavirus main protease (3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro), and RdRp, are released [

 <xref rid="B149" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. The single-stranded positive RNA is translated into viral polyproteins by ribosomes in the host cell cytoplasm. The polyproteins are then cleaved into effector proteins by viral proteases: 3CLpro and PLpro. PLpro also acts as a deubiquitinase that may remove specific host cell proteins (e.g., interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-

 <xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. Both host and viral proteases are essential therapeutic targets in the case of COVID-19.
