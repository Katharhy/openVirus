<p>Darunavir is another antiretroviral protease inhibitor drug effective against HIV-1. Darunavir is designed for multidrug-resistant HIV-1 protease variants, due to its molecular structure, which introduces more hydrogen bonds compared to conventional antiretroviral medicines. In general, changes in van der Waals and hydrogen bonding interactions between inhibitors and proteases affect the potency of antiretroviral drugs [
