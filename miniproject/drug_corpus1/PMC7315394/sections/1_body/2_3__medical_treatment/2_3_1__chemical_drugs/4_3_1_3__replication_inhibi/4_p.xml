<p>Favipiravir is a synthetic guanine analog frequently used for influenza treatment [
 <xref rid="B179" ref-type="bibr">179</xref>]. Structurally, favipiravir is closely related to ribavirin, in which it shares the same carboxamide moiety [
 <xref rid="B180" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>]. While ribavirin interacts with the viral polymerase directly, favipiravir must be phosphoribosylated by cellular enzymes to its active form, favipiravir-ribofuranosyl-5â€²-triphosphate (RTP) [
 <xref rid="B181" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B182" ref-type="bibr">182</xref>]. The viral polymerase mistakenly recognizes favipiravir-RTP for a purine nucleotide, thereby disrupting viral genome replication [
 <xref rid="B181" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B182" ref-type="bibr">182</xref>]. Favipiravir has not been used against SARS and MERS previously, but interestingly, it has been shown to reduce viral infection of 2019-nCoV [
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B183" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>]. In a clinical study involving 80 patients infected with 2019-nCoV, conducted in Shenzhen, China, favipiravir showed better efficacy than lopinavir-ritonavir in terms of disease progression and viral clearance [
 <xref rid="B183" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>]. Another clinical study involving 240 patients with COVID-19 conducted in Hubei Province, China, also demonstrated that those treated with favipiravir had a higher recovery rate compared to those treated with umifenovir (preprint) [
 <xref rid="B184" ref-type="bibr">184</xref>]. More clinical data are needed to validate favipiravir's efficacy and safety in 2019-nCoV treatment.
