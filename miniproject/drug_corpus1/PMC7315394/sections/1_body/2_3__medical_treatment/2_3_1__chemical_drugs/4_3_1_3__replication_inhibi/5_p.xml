<p>Remdesivir is a trial synthetic adenosine analog that has not yet been clinically approved [
 <xref rid="B185" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>]. It was synthesized and developed by Gilead Science in 2017 for Ebola virus infection [
 <xref rid="B186" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>]. Remdesivir needs to be metabolized into its active form, GS-441524, to initiate its activity. The active form of remdesivir inhibits viral RNA polymerase and evades proofreading by viral exonuclease, causing an interruption in viral RNA production [

 <xref rid="B185" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B186" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that remdesivir is effective against MERS-CoV infection 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 2019-nCoV 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> [
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B187" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>], showing great potential as a therapeutic agent for 2019-nCoV. The drug is currently being validated in clinical trials [
 <xref rid="B188" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>]. Given that antiviral drugs have previously demonstrated reasonable inhibition of coronaviruses and therapeutic efficacy against coronavirus outbreaks, umifenovir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir-ritonavir, and ribavirin have been recommended in the latest guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, updated on 17 February 2020 [
