<p>Stem cell therapy is a promising treatment strategy for degenerative diseases, including Huntington's disease, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, and chronic diseases such as cardiac failure and diabetes [

As H7N9 and 2019-nCoV share similar genome structures and corresponding infection mechanisms, as well as related clinical symptoms (lung failure), MSC-based therapy could be a possible alternative for treating COVID-19. Currently, stem cell-based therapy for COVID-19 is being conducted by different hospitals in China. Doctors from Baoshan Hospital (Yunnan province, China) used human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) to treat a 65-year-old critically ill woman with COVID-19. Two days after the 3rd injections of stem cells, the woman recovered, and the throat swab test for COVID-19 turned negative [

 <sup>âˆ’</sup> MSCs, all symptoms such as high fever, weakness, and shortness of breath disappeared in all seven patients without observed adverse effects, indicating that MSCs can cure or significantly improve functional outcomes [
