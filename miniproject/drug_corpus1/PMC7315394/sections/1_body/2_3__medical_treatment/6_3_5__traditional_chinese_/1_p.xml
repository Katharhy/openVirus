Single and combined Chinese medicines could mitigate the cytokine storm by clearing the heat and toxicity in the body. For instance, TCM approaches were adopted to prevent and treat SARS in 2003 and H1N1 influenza in 2009 [

Notably, in a trial of 102 cases with mild symptoms, TCM achieved remarkable therapeutic effects, demonstrated by faster clinical symptom disappearance and reduction of fever, shorter disease course, higher cure rate (by 33%), and lower rate of moderate-to-severe cases [
