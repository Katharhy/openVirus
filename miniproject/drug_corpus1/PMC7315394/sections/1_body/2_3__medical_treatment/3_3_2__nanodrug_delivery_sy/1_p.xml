 <xref rid="B202" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>]. The ease of modification of surface properties, large surface area [

 <xref rid="B204" ref-type="bibr">204</xref>] imbues nanomaterials with massive potential as highly efficacious COVID-19 therapeutic options. However, to the best of our knowledge, no nanoparticle treatment option has been applied to COVID-19. Nonetheless, results obtained from nanoparticle research against other viruses have shown promising potential. For example, Fujimori et al. utilized a CuI nanoparticle to treat H1N1 influenza through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that inactivate the virus [

 <xref rid="B206" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>]. The broad antiviral properties of silver nanoparticles and the generality of ROS inactivation suggest that these nanoparticles can be utilized therapeutically without any modifications. Nanoparticles could also be used for drug delivery. Recently, Herold and Sander demonstrated the use of pulmonary surfactant-biomimetic nanoparticles to encapsulate a stimulator of interferon gene (STING) agonist, 2′,3′-cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate, as an adjuvant in a variety of influenza vaccines [
 <xref rid="B207" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>]. Using nanoparticles as a delivery agent, immune cells were activated without excessive inflammation in the lung. This could provide a considerable benefit for use in COVID-19 vaccines in the future, but as the field is still relatively new, especially in medicinal applications, safety should remain a key consideration in the adoption of nanoparticles in humans.
