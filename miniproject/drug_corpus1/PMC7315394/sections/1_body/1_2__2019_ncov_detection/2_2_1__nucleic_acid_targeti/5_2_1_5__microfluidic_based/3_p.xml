<p>Digital LAMP is more compatible with microfluidics than digital PCR because it is executed at a moderate temperature. This simplifies microfluidic devices and reduces testing costs. Many microfluidic devices have been reported for nucleic acid detection using digital LAMP, such as self-digitization chips, self-priming compartmentalization chips, and droplet-generation chips [

Based on the established mathematical model, they fabricated a spiral chip with 1200 chambers (9.6 nL) for pathogen detection (

This spiral chip operated at 65°C without visible liquid evaporation and achieved a quantitative analysis of nucleic acids over four orders of magnitude in concentration with a detection limit of 87 copies per mL. This portable gadget shows significant promise in future point-of-care testing.
