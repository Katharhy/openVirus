<p>The abovementioned methods are based on relative quantification, because they require external calibration with genetic standards or inner reference DNA templates, resulting in unavoidable errors and other uncertainties. On the contrary, methods that do not need standard curves can provide a quantitative analysis of nucleic acids using absolute quantification of genetic copies. Recently, digital PCR and digital LAMP have been achieved with microelectromechanical and microfluidic technologies [
