<p>This NTS strategy detects 2019-nCoV with higher sensitivity (100-fold) than standard qPCR, simultaneously with other respiratory viruses within 6-10 h. Moreover, all targeted regions can be identified by NTS in higher copies of samples (1000-3000 copies/mL) within 10 min, indicating the potential for rapid detection of an outbreak in the clinic. For 1 h sequencing data, reads mapped to 2019-nCoV differed remarkably from those of negative controls in all targeted regions at concentrations ranging from 10 to 3000 copies/mL. Importantly, NTS can identify mutated nucleic acids. However, the NTS platform cannot readily detect highly degraded nucleic acid fragments that are less than 200 base pairs in length [
