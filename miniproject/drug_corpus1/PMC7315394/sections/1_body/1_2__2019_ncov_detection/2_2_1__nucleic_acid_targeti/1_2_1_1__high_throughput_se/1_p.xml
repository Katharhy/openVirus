<p>High-throughput sequencing (HTS) technology contains various strategies that depend on a combination of library preparation, sequencing and mapping, genome alignment, and data analysis [

 <sup>st</sup>-generation sequencing) [

 <sup>nd</sup>-generation sequencing has been widely applied in genome sequencing, transcriptional profiling (RNA-seq) disease mapping, and population genetic studies. The whole-genome nucleotide sequence of 2019-nCoV was identified and compared with the full-length genome sequence of coronavirus from bats [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] through HTS. HTS-based technology is also applied to detect 2019-nCoV. For example, Wang et al. developed a HTS method based on nanopore target sequencing (NTS) by harnessing the benefits of target amplification and long-reads for real-time nanopore sequencing [
