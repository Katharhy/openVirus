<p>RPA is an isothermal DNA amplification method that utilizes a specific combination of enzymes and proteins (recombinase, single-strand binding (SSB) protein, and strand-displacing DNA polymerase) to amplify target genes rapidly at a constant low temperature between 25 and 42°C in as little as 15 min [

RPA usually requires four steps to achieve DNA amplification: formation of a recombinase-primer complex, strand invasion, D-loop formation (stabilized by SSB, DNA polymerization through the use of strand-displacing DNA polymerase), and DNA amplification (

 <sup>™</sup> probes, or simply applied in lateral flow assays. Apart from DNA target amplification, RPA formats have been developed for the detection of RNA targets (RT-RPA) by adding a reverse transcriptase enzyme to reaction mixtures [

Because RPA- (RT-RPA-) based detection achieves more rapid and sensitive results and operates efficiently, it has been widely adopted to detect animal and human pathogens, such as hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), bovine coronavirus, or MERS-CoV [
