<p>The CRISPR/Cas13a system (specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking (SHERLOCK)) was developed by Zhang's group, based on the collateral effect of an RNA-guided and RNA-targeting CRISPR effector, Cas13a (

 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The detection system is highly sensitive and specific because it is capable of single-molecule nucleic acid detection. Subsequently, they developed an enhanced SHERLOCK version 2 (SHERLOCKv2) detection system with a 3.5-fold improvement in detection sensitivity and lateral flow readout. SHERLOCKv2 has been used to detect dengue and Zika virus single-stranded RNA or mutations in clinical samples, showing great potential for multiplexable, portable, rapid detection of nucleic acids [

 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The CRISPR diagnostics-based test can be conducted in 1 hour and can be read using a dipstick. The analysis is performed at 37°C and 42°C, and its detection sensitivity is ten copies per microliter of input, exhibiting unique advantages, such as high sensitivity, specificity, speed, and suitability for point-of-care testing. However, this approach needs to be validated using real patient samples.
