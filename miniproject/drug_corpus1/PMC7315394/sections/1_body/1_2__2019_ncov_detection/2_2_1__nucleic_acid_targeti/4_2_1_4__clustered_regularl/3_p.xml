<p>Unlike the CRISPR/Cas13a system, the CRISPR/Cas12a system is based on the collateral effect of Cas12a on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Chen and colleagues combined Cas12a ssDNase activation with RPA technology to create a new approach, named DNA endonuclease-targeted CRISPR trans reporter (DETECTR), with attomolar sensitivity for DNA detection (

 <italic>1b</italic>, and ORF
 <italic>1ab</italic> genes of 2019-nCoV using synthetic RNA fragments as samples [

 <italic>1ab</italic> was ten copies/
 <italic>μ</italic>L. The advantages of this method are its portability and low cost (~US$2 per reaction). But this proposed approach also needs to be validated with clinical samples before commercialization. Another DETECTR-based 2019-nCoV detection strategy was developed by Chiu's lab [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. They employed LAMP, CRISPR/Cas12, and lateral flow assay to detect the E and N genes of 2019-nCoV in clinical samples. This protocol supplied rapid (~30 min), low-cost, and accurate (100% specific vs. 90% specific for qRT-PCR) detection of 2019-nCoV in respiratory swab samples. Realistically, CRISPR/Cas-based 2019-nCoV detection technology is highly specific, rapid, and low cost, but the detection strategy also needs to be validated using clinical samples.
