<p>According to the

 <italic>19</italic> (7
 <sup>th</sup> edition), COVID-19 cases can be divided into suspected cases and confirmed cases [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Diagnostic methods for 2019-nCoV are determined by the intrinsic properties of the virus and biomarkers that hosts exhibit after infection. These biomarkers include viral proteins and nucleic acids, as well as antibodies induced in response to viral infection. The most common 2019-nCoV detection methods include viral nucleic acid detection and serum antibody (IgG or IgM) detection. A confirmed case should have at least one of the following criteria: (i) a positive result for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid, using real-time PCR tests from respiratory or blood samples; (ii) a high homogeneity between viral gene sequencing from respiratory or blood samples and known 2019-nCoV; and (iii) serum samples positive for IgM or IgG to 2019-nCoV, or seroconversion in IgG, or a fourfold or more significant increase in IgG antibody titer to 2019-nCoV in the recovery phase than in the acute phase [
