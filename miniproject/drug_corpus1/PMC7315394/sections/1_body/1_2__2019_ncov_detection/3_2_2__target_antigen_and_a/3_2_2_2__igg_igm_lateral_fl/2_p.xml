<p>Point-of-care lateral flow immunoassays are performed qualitatively to quickly determine the presence of 2019-nCoV by detecting anti-2019-nCoV IgM and anti-2019-nCoV IgG antibodies in human plasma, serum, or whole blood. A typical device is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(a)</xref>. Reddish-purple lines in the readout indicate the presence of 2019-nCoV IgM and IgG antibodies in the sample. LFA is based on the lateral chromatographic flow of reagents that bind and interact with the sample. As the sample flows through the test device, starting at the sample pad region, the anti-2019-nCoV IgM and IgG antibodies, if present, bind tightly to 2019-nCoV antigen-labeled gold nanoparticles, located on the conjugated pad. When conjugated products in the sample continue to move up the strip, anti-2019-nCoV IgM antibodies and anti-2019-nCoV IgG antibodies bind to anti-human IgM (M line) or anti-human IgG (G line), respectively. No visible lines can be seen when the specimen does not contain anti-2019-nCoV antibodies because no labeled complexes bind at the test zone. IgG-labeled gold colorimetric nanoparticles serve as the control when they bind to anti-rabbit IgG antibodies at the control line (C) (
