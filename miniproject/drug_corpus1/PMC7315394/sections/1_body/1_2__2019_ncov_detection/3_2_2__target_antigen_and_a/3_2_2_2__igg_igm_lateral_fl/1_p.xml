<p>Research has established that the presence of immunoglobulin M (IgM) indicates a primary defense against viral infections. This IgM defense occurs before the production of high-affinity and adaptive immunoglobulin G (IgG) that is critical for prolonged immunity and immunological memory [

Given that 2019-nCoV belongs to the same family of coronaviruses including MERS and SARS, 2019-nCoV should also generate IgM and IgG antibodies in infected humans. Therefore, the detection of IgM and IgG antibodies may provide epidemiologists with crucial information on viral infection of test subjects, allowing them to adjust policies to combat the pandemic more effectively.
