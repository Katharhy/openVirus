<p>As mentioned, one of the effects of coronavirus infection is the pro-inflammatory cytokine storm that occurs mainly in patients with severe respiratory conditions. The inhibition of the ubiquitin–proteasome system has proven effective in reducing the inflammatory response. In particular, a study by Moutzouris et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] evaluated the anti-inflammatory effect of UPS inhibition in an airway smooth muscle (ASM) cell line. Specifically, this study demonstrated that cells treated with the MG132 inhibitor showed a reduction in IL-6 levels and other cytokines like sICAM-1, IP-10, MCP-1, MIF, RANTES, but also in the upregulation of MKP-1, a negative regulator of the serine/threonine protein kinases MAPK, which, once activated, plays a crucial role in a wide variety of cellular functions, ranging from proliferation to migration and synthesis of fibrotic and inflammatory proteins, including cytokines. Therefore, MAPK inhibition has emerged as an attractive strategy for reversing inflammation and remodeling in a wide variety of chronic inflammatory conditions [
 <xref rid="B54-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Therefore, overall, the Moutzouris study suggests that UPS inhibition is an effective means of increasing the levels of the MAPK deactivator, MKP-1, and that, therefore, it could represent a possible therapeutic target in inflammatory conditions. Despite this, it is known that the ubiquitin–proteasome system is also important for the endocytosis and maturation of some viruses. Already in 2005, after the first SARS-CoV epidemic, in a study by Yi Yu et al. concerning the murine hepatitis virus (MHV-JHM strain, belonging to the Coronaviridae family), it was shown that the ubiquitin–proteasome system is involved in the release of the virus from the endosome to the cytosol during the virus entry phase. Proteasome inhibitors (lactacistin and MG132) inhibit MHV replication, demonstrating that the ubiquitin–proteasome system is involved in the early stages of virus replication, as the inhibitory effect was observed mainly from 0 to 6 h after treatment. It was stressed, however, that proteasome inhibition does not block the internalization of the virus. Furthermore, in the presence of MG132, most viruses remained in the vesicles, both endosomes and lysosomes, and therefore, are protected by RNase digestion [
 <xref rid="B55-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Therefore, although MHV can be internalized in the cell in the absence of a functional ubiquitin–proteasome system, viruses within endosomes or lysosomes cannot be released into the cytosol [
 <xref rid="B55-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Indeed, SARS-CoV, which binds to its functional receptor ACE2 [
 <xref rid="B56-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], is internalized by endocytosis, and viral RNA is released from the endosome [

 <xref rid="B57-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="B58-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="B59-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In the cytosol, the SARS-CoV genome is translated into two large polyproteins which are processed autocatalytically to produce nonstructural proteins (nsps), including all the nsps of the replicase viral complex [
 <xref rid="B60-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,
 <xref rid="B61-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,
 <xref rid="B62-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Protected by double membrane vesicles (DMV), most likely originating from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes [
 <xref rid="B63-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], the genome is replicated and, by generating specific sets of subgenomic mRNA, structural and specific accessory SARS-CoV proteins are produced [
 <xref rid="B61-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,
 <xref rid="B62-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. After assembly and budding processes in the endoplasmic reticulum of the Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) [
 <xref rid="B64-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,
 <xref rid="B65-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], mature virions are released by exocytosis. Proteasome inhibition by various chemical compounds (e.g., MG132, Eepoxomycin and VelcadeBortezomib) seems not only to compromise the entry, but also the synthesis of RNA and the subsequent protein expression of different CoVs (e.g., Hepatitis Virus of mouse [MHV], feline infectious peritonitis virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV) [
 <xref rid="B66-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. A 2010 study by Raaben et al. showed that in cells treated with UPS chemical inhibitors, the synthesis of the viral CoV RNA and the subsequent protein expression were strongly reduced in all experimental conditions, while the entry of the virus was influenced only by chemical proteasome inhibitors [
 <xref rid="B66-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In particular, the authors attempted to determine whether the inhibition of virus infection caused by MG132 was specific to this proteasome inhibitor or whether it was also observed when other proteasome inhibitors were used. Although MG132 has been shown to also inhibit proteases other than proteasome (i.e., cathepsin A and tripeptidyl peptidase II) [
 <xref rid="B67-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], Eepoxomomine, Llactacystine and Velcade Bortezomib affect the proteasome more specifically [
 <xref rid="B68-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,
 <xref rid="B69-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,
 <xref rid="B70-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Finally, a 2012 study showed conflicting data with previous work. Schneider et al. showed that the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 strongly inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV by interfering with the early stages of the viral life cycle, but other inhibitors (e.g., Lactacistin and Bbortezomib) only marginally affected viral replication, suggesting that the effect of MG132 is independent of proteasome inhibition, since MG132 also inhibits m–calpain. Interestingly, these authors observed that by using a calpain inhibitor (MDL28170), virus replication was inhibited, suggesting that MG132 does not inhibit SARS-CoV replication by ER stress induction, unexplained protein response or autophagy [
 <xref rid="B47-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Since few studies to date have demonstrated the effects on coronavirus replication, we hypothesize that proteasomal inhibitors may negatively modulate virus replication, primarily acting on blocking protein synthesis due to an increase in stress on the plasma reticulum, and therefore, on the activation of the UPS. In the few papers published, bortezomib did not show great efficacy, but we have new inhibitors, some of which have the ability to bind the proteasome in an irreversible way, such as Ccarfilzomib. Interestingly, Wang et al. performed a molecular dynamics simulation followed by binding free energy calculations, demonstrating that Carfilzomib presented the best binding free energy, and therefore supporting the possible use of this proteasome inhibitor against COVID-19 [
