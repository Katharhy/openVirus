<p>Since December 2019, infection with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a worldwide emergency (pandemic) for which a rapid action is required [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In particular, COVID-19 (the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2) is overwhelming even well-organized national health care systems on a global scale [
 <xref rid="B3-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Unfortunately, the symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection can vary in an unpredictable manner; there are asymptomatic cases as well as patients suffering from pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multisystem organ failure [
 <xref rid="B5-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Older patients and patients with preexisting respiratory or cardiovascular conditions appear to be at the greatest risk for severe complications and death [
 <xref rid="B6-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the absence of a proven effective therapy, current management consists of supportive care, including ventilation and treatment with antibiotics [
 <xref rid="B8-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, patients are often treated with off-label therapies, including antiretrovirals, anti-inflammatory compounds, antiparasitic agents, and in a few cases, plasma from recently cured patients [
 <xref rid="B10-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Antimalarial agents like chloroquine are used to block the virus entry, while new drugs like tocilizumab, anakinra or ruxolitinib [
 <xref rid="B14-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], directed against a specific key element of the inflammatory response, are used to switch off the cytokine storm [
 <xref rid="B15-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], as are antiviral drugs [
 <xref rid="B16-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Nevertheless, in the absence of long-term and controlled clinical trials, there is no consensus on a “state of the art” therapeutic approach. Indeed, the use of drugs to stall the virus attack, followed by blocking viral replication and, in patients with signs of higher cytokine/chemokine release, the “pre-emptive” use of anti-IL6 or anti-IL1 blocking antibodies could be proposed [

 <xref rid="B18-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Here, we review the potential role of proteasome inhibitors, based on previous studies showing that the ubiquitin–proteasome system is involved in the replication of a broad range of viruses.
