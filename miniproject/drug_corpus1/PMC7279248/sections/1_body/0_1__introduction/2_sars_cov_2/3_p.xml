<p>Angeletti et al. compared the gene sequence of SARSars-Cov-2 with that of SARSars-CoV. They analyzed the transmembrane helical segments in coded ORF1ab 2 (nsp2) and nsp3 and found that position 723 has a residue of serine instead of glycine, while position 1010 is occupied by proline instead of isoleucine [

At the protein level, no amino acid substitutions occur in rotavirus nonstructural protein families (NSPs), NSP7, NSP13, envelope, matrix or accessory proteins p6 and 8b, with the exception of NSP2, NSP3, spike protein, subdomain below, or RBD. Other recent research [
