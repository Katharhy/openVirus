<p>According to the evolutionary tree, SARS-CoV-2 is located close to the SARS-coronavirus group [
 <xref rid="B23-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Recent studies have indicated significant variations in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, such as the absence of protein 8a and the fluctuation in the number of amino acids in protein 8b and 3c in SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="B6-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Spike glycoprotein from the Wuhan coronavirus was modified by homologous recombination. Particularly, the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is a mixture of SARS-CoV bat and an unknown Beta-CoV [
 <xref rid="B24-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The SARS-CoV-2 genome is 29.9 kb [
 <xref rid="B25-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], while those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are 27.9 and 30.1 kb, respectively [
 <xref rid="B26-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The glycoprotein S comprises two subunits, S1 and S2 [
 <xref rid="B27-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. S1 determines the viral host flow rate and cell tropism with the key function domain–receptor-binding domain (RBD), while S2 mediates cell–cell membrane fusion through heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and 2 (HR2) [
 <xref rid="B28-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Starting from the viral RNA, the synthesis of two 1a/1ab polyproteins (pp1a pp1ab) takes place in the host [
 <xref rid="B30-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Transcription works through the replication–transcription complex (RTC), organized in double membrane vesicles, which continuously replicates and synthesizes subgenomic RNAs [
 <xref rid="B31-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and, in turn, encodes accessory and structural proteins. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi [
 <xref rid="B32-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], genomic RNA, N protein and envelope glycoproteins come together to form viral bud particles. The vesicles containing virions then merge with the plasma membrane and release the virus. Transcription termination occurs in regulatory transcription sequences, located between open reading frames (ORFs), i.e., models for the production of subgenomic mRNA. In CoV, there are about 6 ORFs, and a frame-shift between ORF1a and ORF1b drives the production of pp1a and pp1ab, while the other ORFs encode for structural proteins S, E, M, N [
 <xref rid="B30-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and accessory proteins that interfere with the host’s innate immune response [
 <xref rid="B2-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As mentioned, it has been suggested that SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV, uses the ACE2 receptor to enter the host cell [
 <xref rid="B33-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], but a N501T mutation in protein S of SARS-CoV-2 may result in a better binding affinity for ACE2 [
 <xref rid="B34-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Systematic detection of β-CoV receptors has shown that human cells expressing ACE2 have improved SARS-CoV-2 access [
 <xref rid="B35-ijms-21-03622" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].
