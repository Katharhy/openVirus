<p>Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family in the order of Nidovales. They are approximately 65–125 nm in diameter and are single-stranded RNA viruses (+ ssRNA). The Coronavirus family includes four subgroups: α-, β-, γ- and δ-; among them, α- and β-CoV are capable of infecting mammals (

Two well-known β-CoVs are SARS-CoV, responsible for the 2003 epidemic started in China (that caused 8000 infections and 800 deaths i.e., a 10% mortality rate), and MERS–CoV, which was responsible for the 2012 epidemic that began in Saudi Arabia (causing 2400 infections and 800 deaths i.e., a 35% mortality rate) [

The SARS-Cov-2 viral genome is complex and resembles that of other coronaviruses. In particular, 75% of the genome is related to viral replicase genes from two open reading frames (ORFs), i.e., ORF1a and ORF1b, encoding for two polyproteins, pp1a (486 kDa) and pp1ab (790 kDa).The 1 ribo-some frame-shift occurs immediately upstream of the ORF1a stop codon, which allows the continuous translation of ORF1b to occur, producing a large polypeptide (pp1ab, 740–810 kDa) which is divided into 15 nsps. Proteolytic cleavage is mediated by the viral proteases nsp3 and nsp5 which, respectively, host a papain-like placenta domain and a 3C-like protease domain. Moreover, at short motifs called transcription-regulatory sequences (TRSs) that are located immediately adjacent to ORFs, the protease domain contains a conserved 6–7 nt core sequence (CS) surrounded by variable sequences [

Coronaviruses exhibit a round morphology and are constituted of several components, such as glycoprotein S (Spike), organized in trimers on the external part of the virion resembling a crown, from which they take their name; this protein determines the virus specificity for epithelial cells. In fact, it has been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cell through the angiotensin-2 conversion receptor, ACE2, and CD26 (like SARS-CoV), expressed at both pulmonary and gastrointestinal levels (that’s why there are also symptoms at these compartments) [

HE protein, the hemagglutinin esterase, is important during the virus release phase inside the host cell. The Protein E helps protein S attach to the target cells membranes. Finally, RNA gives rise to 7 viral proteins and is associated with the N protein, which increases its stability (
