<p>A rather sinister complication of COVID-19 is the occurrence of seizures, which often heralds a grim outcome.

 </sup> Seizures can occur because of encephalitis, electrolyte disturbances and metabolic/hypoxic/toxic encephalopathy. Effects of COVID-19 on patients with epilepsy and whether it increases the risk of contracting infection remain unclear as of now. No definite association between epilepsy and COVID-19 has been reported. However, fever itself is known to lower seizure thresholds and hence can precipitate convulsions in a known patient with epilepsy syndromes.

 </sup> A study conducted by Lu et al.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="r100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>
 </sup> in the Hubei province, China, the epicentre of the ongoing pandemic, validates this point. Out of the selected 304 patients of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 84 (27%) showed evidences of systemic or direct cerebral involvement that increased chances of developing a new-onset seizure or status epilepticus, the most common etiology being hypoxemia (77%).

 </sup> However, clinical course of none of these patients was complicated by seizures.

 </sup> Mao et al.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
 </sup> reported only a single case with seizures in their study. Only three other case reports of convulsions associated with COVID-19 have been reported thereof.

  <xref rid="r101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>,
  <xref rid="r102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>
 </sup> The first is the case of a neonate with positive nasopharyngeal and anal swab tests for both SARS-CoV-2 and rhinovirus.

 </sup> Coronaviral RNA was however undetected in CSF, serum or plasma.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="r101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>
 </sup> Possibly, seizures resulted as a cause of febrile illness, although rhinoviral-induced pathology could not be ruled out with certainty.

  <xref rid="r102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>
 </sup> reported focal status epilepticus as the presenting feature of the second case, who incidentally was on antiepileptic drugs for a prior history of herpes encephalitis. Though she tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, no direct proof of CNS invasion by the virus could be ascertained.

 </sup> The most suitable rationale is that a mounting systemic response to the viral infection triggered this status.

 </sup> Non-compliance to medication could be a second probability.

 </sup> The third case was the previously mentioned case of encephalitis documented by Moriguchi et al.

 <sup>
  <xref rid="r103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>,
  <xref rid="r104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>
