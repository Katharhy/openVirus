<p>A potentially fatal presentation of SARS-CoV-2 is the development of encephalopathy. Symptoms may range from mere headache, fever and neck rigidity to more sinister signs of brain involvement like altered sensorium, agitation, seizures, coma or even focal neurological deficits. One of the first cases of viral encephalitis was reported from Japan,

 </sup> where a 24-year-old man presented with unconsciousness and generalized convulsions 9 d after he first sought medical care for non-specific symptoms of fever and fatigue. Brain imaging showed signs of right lateral ventriculitis and encephalitis, primarily centered on the right mesial temporal lobe and hippocampal region.

 </sup> Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in his CSF, but nasopharyngeal swabs remained negative.

 </sup> Encephalitis as a clinical manifestation of COVID-19 has been reported by many since then.

 </sup> Early in April 2020, a young female from Los Angeles was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 encephalitis.

 </sup> One putative mechanism of viral encephalitis could be a direct invasion of the CNS by the virus, where genomic sequencing has confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2.

 </sup> However, a direct invasion might not always be the case, and speculations have led us to believe a possible hypothesis of immune-mediated inflammatory injury and cerebral oedema to be responsible for such encephalopathic changes.
