 </sup> the principle behind this being an act of molecular mimicry between viral proteins and proteins on peripheral nerves (e.g. gangliosides). This subsequently leads to an immune dysregulation and a resultant autoantibody-mediated damage to myelin or axons of peripheral nerves. Since the reporting of the first case by Zhao et al.

 </sup> It is interesting to note that, in a handful of these cases, the supposedly autoimmune process overlapped with the viral infection, thus giving rise to ideas reckoning the para-infectious nature of the disease rather than it being post-infectious.
