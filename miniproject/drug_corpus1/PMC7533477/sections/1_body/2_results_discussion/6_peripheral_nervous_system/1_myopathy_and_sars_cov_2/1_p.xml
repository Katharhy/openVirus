<p>Skeletal muscle damage (myopathy) in association with SARS-CoV-2 infection has been observed to range from asymptomatic rises in creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase to rhabdomyolysis.

 </sup> Myalgia, weakness and fatigue are common symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 as with any other viral illness, reported in 11–70% of patients with COVID-19.

 </sup> Even though rare, instances of rhabdomyolysis have also been reported in this pandemic, one as a late complication of viral infection

 </sup>: (1) direct viral invasion via ACE-2 receptors, (2) damage to muscle cell membranes by circulating viral toxins and (3) a strong cytokine-mediated immune response (“cytokine storm”) causing muscle damage. Underlying hepatic and renal disease are a risk factor for skeletal muscle damage, and this damage further deters their functioning.

 </sup> It is important to treat rhabdomyolysis with adequate fluid resuscitation to prevent acute renal shutdown, keeping in mind that excessive fluid can worsen hypoxemia and respiratory failure.
