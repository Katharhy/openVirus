<p>Neurological manifestations in SARS-CoV-2 are diverse and heterogeneous, ranging from mild symptoms such as anosmia and hypogeusia/ageusia to more severe pictures such as stroke, seizures, ataxia, polyradiculoneuropathy, encephalopathy and movement disorders. However, it is yet to be established that whether these are only associations or having an etiological relationship with COVID-19. Studies are in the pipeline to unfurl the pathological and etiological relationship between COVID-19 and various documented neurological manifestations. Possible proposed pathological mechanisms range from a direct neuroaxial invasion to aberrant immunomodulation, endotheliitis and microthrombus generation.</p>
