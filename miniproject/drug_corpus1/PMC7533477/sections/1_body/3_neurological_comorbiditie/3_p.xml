<p>A fundamental area of concern for neurologists is how COVID-19 affects patients with an underlying neurological illness. Infections are known to unmask or exacerbate several autoimmune neuromuscular diseases, viz. myasthenia gravis, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, multifocal acquired demyelinating sensory and motor neuropathy and some degenerative disorders like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy. Patients with mitochondrial and metabolic myopathies are at an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis with fever and infection. The magnitude of these risks is yet to be studied on a large scale to outlay definite precautionary measures.</p>
