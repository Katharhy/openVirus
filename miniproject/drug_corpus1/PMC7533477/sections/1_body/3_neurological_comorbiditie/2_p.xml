<p>Due consideration needs to be given to the risk of patients contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection. The risk is underscored by increasing age, presence of associated comorbidities and use of IST or IMT. A multi-data-based study conducted in the Unites States showed patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) had a higher incidence of contracting infections compared to non-MS people.

 </sup> The crude rate of infections was higher in those taking interferon-beta and glatiramer acetate, and still higher in those taking fingolimod, natalizumab or rituximab.

 </sup> Consequently, COVID-19 infection was diagnosed in an MS patient under treatment with fingolimod in May 2020 from Iran.

 </sup> Severity of the underlying illness also contributes to this accentuated risk. Neuromuscular diseases not involving the respiratory muscles, for instance, seem to be at a lower risk. Patients with Alzheimerâ€™s disease and other types of dementia are at a greater threat, given their advanced age, coexistence of other comorbidities and poor cognition. They may fail to comply with the hygiene and sanitization standards set out by the guidelines; may not be able to acknowledge, appreciate or remember most of these recommendations; may be unable to self-monitor and report presence of symptoms; and may wander outside, compromising efforts to maintain isolation. Caregiver support is an important handicap to these patients under present circumstances.
