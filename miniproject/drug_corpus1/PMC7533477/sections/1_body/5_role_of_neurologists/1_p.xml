<p>We are still at an early stage to completely discern the heterogenous nature of this disease. By and large, it is a disorder involving the respiratory tract most often. However, growing evidences of extra-pulmonary conditions cannot be taken lightly. It is of prime importance that neurological features are examined and worked up thoroughly and more large-scale studies conducted to get a clearer picture. Reports distinguishing between the direct effects of the virus on the nervous system and the effects of systemic illness on the nervous system (hypoxia, sepsis, hypercoagulable states and disseminated intravascular coagulation) are still nebulous. The role of telemedicine comes forward in a big way in the care of those already living with a neurological disorder. However, a wide spectrum of issues is expected with up-trending telemedicine. Most prominent disadvantages are lack of accessibility, affordability, decay of doctorâ€“patient relationship, and lack of interpersonal communication leading to misadventures. It is of paramount value that chronic patients continue to get an undisrupted supply of medications and personal protective equipment to preclude the worsening of their conditions and curb the growing curve of infection. Emergency therapeutic interventions should be ensured to run in a smooth manner to prevent increases in mortality and morbidity of cerebrovascular events.</p>
