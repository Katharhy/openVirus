 </sup> Additionally, at-risk groups include patients contracting the disease and their relatives, children confined to their homes/quarantine centers for prolonged periods, elderly individuals, especially those in need of caregiver support or otherwise, women juggling between home-schooling, working from home and household tasks, and people already suffering from an underlying psychiatric problem. Apart from the pandemic-related psychological distress, the direct effects of SARS-CoV-2 itself and the resulting host immune response on the CNS and its neuropsychiatric sequelae should not be overlooked.
