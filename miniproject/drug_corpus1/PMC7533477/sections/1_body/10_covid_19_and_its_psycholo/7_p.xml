<p>On the other end of the spectrum lies the acute neuropsychiatric problems among those infected with COVID-19 and having neurologic complications. The wide gamut of neurological problems has already been discussed, and it is noteworthy that strokes and encephalopathies often have acute and subacute neuropsychiatric sequelae. Nearly one-third of patients admitted in the ICU are expected to develop delirium.

 </sup> from France, among the 14% of COVID-19 patients who developed neurologic complications, 33% were discharged with various executive dysfunctions, notably inattention, disorientation or poorly organised movements in response to commands. Long-term neuropsychiatric deficits following acute neurologic disorders are also not uncommon. Salluh et al.
