 </sup> The most common symptoms of presentation are fever, non-productive cough, fatigue, anorexia, myalgia and diarrhoea. Pulmonary, renal, gastrointestinal and hematological complications have been reported in severe cases, and, not surprisingly, nervous system involvement has been reported too.
