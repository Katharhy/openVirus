<p>The interaction between viral S protein and cell surface receptor ACE2 could activate the downstream renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system (RAAS) since ACE2 is one of the crucial components of RAAS (Figure 
 <xref rid="jcmm15364-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). RAAS could be involved in the COVID‐19 pathogenesis and could balance the RAAS by increasing ACE2 or blocking the interaction between AngII, and AT1/AT2 could be a potential therapeutic target for COVID‐19.
