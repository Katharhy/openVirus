Viral infectivity studies using HeLa cells with and without ACE2 expression from humans, Chinese horseshoe bats, civets, pigs and mice reveal that SARS‐CoV‐2 is able to use all ACE2 except that of mouse as an entry receptor.

 </xref> Surface plasmon resonance analysis reveals that the affinity of human ACE2 protein binding to the novel coronavirus S protein is 10‐ to 20‐fold higher than that of ACE2 binding to SARS‐CoV S protein, which results in a stronger SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission capacity.
