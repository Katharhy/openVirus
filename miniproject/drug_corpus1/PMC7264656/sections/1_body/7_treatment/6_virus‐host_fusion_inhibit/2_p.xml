 </xref> A recent small‐scale study of COVID‐19 found that most patients taking chloroquine cleared the novel coronavirus much faster than the control group and adding azithromycin to the medicine could significantly improve the efficiency of eliminating viruses.

Hence, nevertheless the proved in vitro efficacy, before clinical trials results publication and/or further clarification about COVID‐19 pathogenesis, clinicians should use it cautionally.
