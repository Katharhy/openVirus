  <p>The mechanism of SARS‐CoV‐2 and ACE2 interaction based on renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system (RAAS) and potential therapeutic strategies in COVID‐19. SARS‐CoV‐2 invades cells via ACE2 receptor, which may lead to the down‐regulation of ACE2 expression. The down‐regulation of ACE2 expression could destroy the balance between ACE/ACE2 and lead to the tissue injury. Potential therapeutic approaches include a SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein‐based vaccine and small‐molecule inhibitors to block the interaction between S protein and ACE2</p>
