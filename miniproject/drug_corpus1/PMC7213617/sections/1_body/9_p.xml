<p>We will compare the study endpoints among the three arms using time-to-event methods with the Cox proportional-hazards model. The different categorical variables will be analyzed using the one-way analysis of variance. To describe the efficacy and safety of the three antiviral regimens, Kaplan-Meier estimates and a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model will be used to compare mortality of patients and adverse events among the three arms during the study period at day 28. A 
 <italic>P-</italic>value of &lt;0.05 will be deemed to confer statistical significance.
