<p>Nanotechnology and nanoscience refers to the improvement, advancement or application of atomic/molecular structures with at least one dimension that is in the nanoscale range (1~100 nm) with variable composition, shape/morphology, size, or surface properties [

Over the decades, NPs/nanocarriers have been utilized in a diversity of new pharmaceutical applications, namely effective delivery of drugs to the targeted sites without exposing the healthy tissue cells, sensitive imaging to detect viral illnesses at early stages, and crossing these barriers (e.g., the epithelial/endothelial, immunological, or cellular barriers) to deliver nano-therapeutic molecules or nanovaccines to specific diseased organs or cell tissues as well as to interact with biomolecules in the blood or within organ tissues. Additionally, the inactivation of viruses by using engineered nanomaterials (acid functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotube comprising photo-activated molecules) and inhibition of viral binding with the host cell surface receptor are important examples of nano-based approaches against viruses (e.g., angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, especially in the case of SARS-CoV-2) (

Besides their nanoscale size, nanocarriers can efficiently deliver antigens owing to ease of surface functionalization and have capability to co-transport antigens accompanied by numerous adjuvants. One of the significant requirements for any efficient (nano)medicinal agent is the delivery to the proper place at the appropriate concentrations within a suitable time period [
