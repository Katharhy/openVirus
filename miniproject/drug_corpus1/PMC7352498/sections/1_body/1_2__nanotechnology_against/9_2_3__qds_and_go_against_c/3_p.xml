<p>The wide-spectrum antiviral activities of graphene oxide (GO) against the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV, an RNA virus) and pseudorabies virus (PRV, a DNA virus) have been evaluated; GO remarkably inhibited the infection of these viruses, at non-cytotoxic concentrations, for a 2 log diminution in virus titers [

Importantly, GO showed effective antiviral activities when linked with PVP, a nonionic oligomer, however not when linked with a cationic polymer, poly (diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA). Moreover, graphite and GO demonstrated poorer antiviral activity than monolayer GO and reduced graphene oxide (RGO), signifying that the nano-sheet constitution is crucial for antiviral characteristics. Importantly, GO incapacitated the viruses by structural damage before the virus could enter into cells [

In another investigation, Ag NP-modified GO nanocomposites, self-accumulated via electrostatic energy, were employed to inhibit entry into host cells for respiratory syndrome and porcine reproductive virus (~59% inhibition). Additionally, this nanocomposite prescription obstructed virus proliferation by accelerating the formation of IFN-stimulating genes (ISGs) and interferon-α (IFN-α) [
