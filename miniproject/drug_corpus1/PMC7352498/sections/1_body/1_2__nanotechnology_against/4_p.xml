 <xref rid="B59-nanomaterials-10-01072" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], and the improvement of MERS-CoV entrance inhibitors focusing on the S1 subunit can be deemed as a suitable antiviral practice. As of late, nanomaterials have attained favorable stature to alter the cycle of viral infection [
 <xref rid="B60-nanomaterials-10-01072" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The virus entrance into the host cells might be supported by multivalent connections. The similar trait of nanostructured materials possessing high surface to volume proportion and permitting the addition of ligands on their surfaces may thus meddle with viral connection and block its entrance into cells [
