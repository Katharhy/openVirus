<p>Innovative studies and further investigations are required to validate if CoV S NP vaccinations can block CoV pathogenesis and replication in vivo, and subsequent further evaluations could be undertaken in animal models [

In neutralization evaluations, low-level, non-specific neutralization activity of PBS-vaccinated mice was observed, although all adjuvanted MERS-CoV S NP vaccinated mice showed remarkably elevated corresponding activities. Additionally, Matrix-M1 adjuvant increased the anti-MERS-CoV S neutralizing antibody reaction in vaccinated mice. It was revealed that mice vaccinated with MERS-CoV S NPs with Matrix-M1 were capable of proficiently and entirely blocking MERS-CoV replication in lungs; the Matrix-M1 NP with MERS-CoV S was a major candidate in terms of additional advancements for applications in humans or camels [
