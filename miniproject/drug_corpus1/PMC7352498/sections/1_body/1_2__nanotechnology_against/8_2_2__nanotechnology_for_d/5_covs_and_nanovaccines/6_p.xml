<p>In the process of vaccination, the utilizing of vaccine adjuvants and follow-up evaluations are very critical. For instance, silver NPs can be deployed as an adjuvant in mucosal vaccines based on inactivated influenza virus, which stimulates the remarkable antigen specific IgA formation with low toxicity by stimulating bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) neogenesis [

Consequently, the immunization of mice was accomplished with more than 0.5 µg S protein without escape of adjuvant from SARS after infection with mouse-adapted SARS–CoV; however, eosinophilic infiltrations were detected in the lungs of the mice with immunization [

It was observed that gold NP-adjuvanted protein stimulated remarkable response of IgG but was unsuccessful in improving the efficiency of vaccine or reducing eosinophilic infiltration, due to significantly allergic inflammatory responses. While comparable virus titers have been detected in control animals and animals immunized with S protein with or without gold NPs, Type 1 interferon and pro-inflammatory replies were reasonable in the mice treated with S protein with and without gold NPs. Additionally, the Toll-like receptor agonist-adjuvanted vaccine triggered remarkable protective antibodies deprived of eosinophilic infiltrations, in addition to responses of Th1/17 cytokine [
