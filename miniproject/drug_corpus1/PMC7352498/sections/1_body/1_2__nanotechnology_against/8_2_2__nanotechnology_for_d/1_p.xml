<p>The disruptive outbreaks of fatal epidemics and respiratory infectious illnesses have greatly uplifted the progress of modern and effectual vaccine formulations to the status of a worldwide healthcare issue. It is generally known that prevention is invariably better than cure for the control of illnesses. Vaccination is still one of the most extraordinary tactics for preventing, controlling, or ameliorating infectious diseases, as well as administrating the antigenic materials to motivate an individualâ€™s immune systems to develop adaptive and protective immunity against a specific pathogen, especially viruses. To date, vaccination effectiveness has been extensively studied, and it has been authenticated that vaccines are responsible for the impressive control and even elimination of numerous potentially fatal illnesses, such as polio, smallpox, measles, hepatitis A, papilloma, etc. Despite numerous efforts, many other illnesses are still lacking therapeutic or effective prophylactic vaccines towards numerous clinically relevant viruses, e.g., HIV, Zika viruses, hepatitis C viruses (HCVs), influenza virus (e.g., H5N1, H1N1, etc.), cytomegaloviruses (CMV), Ebola viruses, RSV, and SARS-CoVs [

For HIV, in 1983 (the discovered year), only selected investigations that may be considered a major advance are shown. Similarly, 2003 illustrates the year H5N1 triggered several contagions, although H5N1 in humans was first registered in 1997.
