<p>Incorporation of antigens in various NPs may be achieved via conjugation (covalent modifications) and/or by encapsulation (physical entrapment); these NPs incorporating antigens could exert local depot effects for ensuring the presentation of a specific antigen to immune cells [
 <xref rid="B111-nanomaterials-10-01072" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Generally, the probability of drug encapsulation, modifications by polymers (e.g., polyethylene glycol (PEG), carbohydrates, among others), or modular functionalization by the fabrication of stable structures could all lead to improved drug delivery and optimized drug dosing via enhanced stability and drug retention times [

 <xref rid="B117-nanomaterials-10-01072" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Modifying the NPs/nanocarriersâ€™ surfaces with a diversity of directing moieties (e.g., antibodies) allows the transport of viral antigens directly to particular surface receptors, thus inciting specific and selective mucosal or robust immune reactions. Indeed, NPs coated with immune cell-targeting molecules, such as antibodies, peptides, and carbohydrates [

 <xref rid="B120-nanomaterials-10-01072" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>], can be targeted with these overexpressed receptors to increase the adjuvant delivery and antigen efficacy for the promotion of a specific and selective or robust immune response in prophylactic nanovaccines.
