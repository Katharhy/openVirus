<p>The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been generally deployed as a routine diagnosis method for the detection of CoVs [

Interestingly, in one study, a double-operational plasmonic biosensor merging the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) sensing transduction and the plasmonic photothermal (PPT) influence offered a promising substitute for the diagnosis of COVID-19, clinically. Delicate recognition of the particular arrangements of SARS-CoV-2 via nucleic acid hybridization has been accomplished using 2-D gold nano-islands decorated with complementary DNA receptors. The thermos-plasmonic heat was produced on the chip for improved sensing performance, whereby illumination at their plasmonic resonance frequency and the ensuing local PPT heat improved the in situ hybridization temperature and enabled the precise discernment of two similar gene sequences. This biosensor showed remarkable sensitivity for the examined SARS-CoV-2 sequences with a much lowered detection limit of 0.22 pM concentration and permitted specific target recognition in a multigene mixture [
