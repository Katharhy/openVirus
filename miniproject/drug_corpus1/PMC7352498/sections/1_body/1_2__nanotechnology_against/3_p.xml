<p>Other unmet enquiries in viral management options comprise the utilization of RNA-mediated interference technology, which is a promising molecular tactic for the handling of a variety of infectious illnesses [

Indeed, there are limitations that prohibit validity and clinical utility of small/short interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics, including the inability of RNA to traverse the membrane of a cell (owing to the big molecular weight and/or negative charge), as well as expeditious renal sanction, uptake, or poisonousness (owing to aroused immune reaction) [

 <xref rid="B28-nanomaterials-10-01072" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. To overcome such restrictions, the incorporation of siRNA within or onto the NPs/nanocarriers could attain successful viral replication inhibition; developments of efficient and novel treatment approaches are thus imperative. For instance, silver NPs with antiviral effects were green synthesized using curcumin as a reducing agent; curcumin modified silver NPs had a remarkable inhibitory effect against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection [
