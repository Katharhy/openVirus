<p>Nanomaterials can be considered as perfect candidates against viral infections, especially CoVs, because of their ability to enter cells easily and interact with viruses and avoid viral genome replication. NPs can be applied as a measure to revert antiviral resistance, which is a gradually developing challenge of conventional therapeutics presently available. Furthermore, improvements, especially enhancing the bioavailability and reducing the toxicity of conventional antiviral drugs, can be executed by using groundbreaking advancements in nanotechnology. Nowadays, researchers are focusing on high-level experimental studies to find innovative and smart nano/bio-materials and matrices for designing controlled release and targeted drug delivery systems; nanovaccines and nano/bio-sensors against pathogenic viruses, particularly for human and animal CoVs, need more exploration. In the history of mankind, different cases of epidemics and pandemics have claimed the lives of many people. In the meantime, however, power to control a crisis, innovative solutions, intelligent management, and the use of smart and modern technologies, especially exploiting the field of emerging nanotechnology, could be very effective in managing the current and future outbreaks.</p>
