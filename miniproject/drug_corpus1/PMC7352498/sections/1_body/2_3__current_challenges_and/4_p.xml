<p>Besides these, nanostructures possess other exceptional properties, namely their capability to deliver viral antigens in a controlled manner, their capacities to mimic the viruses in terms of structure or size without requiring a real infection, and their capabilities to activate follicular dendritic cells or B cells, antigen cross-presentation, as well as induce a humoral/cellular immune response. Collectively, the clinical applications of NP-based therapeutics are revolutionizing several medical fields, namely diagnosis, treatment, control/management, prevention, and detection, such as nanocarriers for viral infections and delivery of nanodrugs or bioactive compounds. Consequently, nanodrug delivery can be immensely improved by these nanostructures with the desired directing entities to enhance specificities for preferred target tissues, cell types, or subcellular compartments [

Indeed, some approved nanodrug delivery systems and nanovaccines are making an actual revolution in viral disease prevention, treatment, and management; nanotechnology offers new prospects towards the manufacturing of vaccine nanoformulations [
