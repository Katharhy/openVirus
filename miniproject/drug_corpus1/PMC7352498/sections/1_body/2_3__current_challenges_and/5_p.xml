<p>NP-based vaccines (or nanovaccines) are envisaged to be more effective, safe, economic, or convenient than subunit and conventional vaccines. Nanovaccines may provide an excellent future ahead if the following goals are attained: (i) stabilization at ambient temperature via encapsulation of vaccines in NPs, (ii) exploration of replaceable/interchangeable routes of administration, and (iii) facilitation of controlled/specific release at a particular location. They may be reinforced once, unlike conventional vaccines which are generally required to be reinforced many times. Indeed, nanotechnology platforms afford a new choice and a promising opportunity to improve cellular or humoral immune responses; nanovaccines may be induced either by cellular immunity (cytotoxic or helper T-cell responses) or humoral immunity (B-cell responses). The advantages are ascribable to the nanoscale particle size that can facilitate uptake via phagocytic cells and the mucosa/gut-associated lymphoid tissues, leading to efficient antigen processing and recognition.</p>
