<p>One of the probable methodologies could be based on the utilization of NP-based vaccination [
 <xref rid="B142-nanomaterials-10-01072" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. Nanotechnology presents diverse benefits in the areas of detection, management, and treatment, either via site-specific drug delivery or targeted delivery of particular medicines in a controlled manner. Nanoscience has been recently applied to improve and develop vaccine efficacy as well as optimization utilizing several advanced nanosystems to improve antigen delivery and efficient induction of humoral/cellular immunity [

 <xref rid="B144-nanomaterials-10-01072" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. One of the most crucial advantages of using NPs in vaccine systems is that they could deliver proteins and peptides to specific tissue cells and help them to produce a robust immune response [

 <xref rid="B145-nanomaterials-10-01072" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. Indeed, these NPs can protect the applied antigens from premature proteolytic or enzymatic degradation, control release, simplify antigen uptake, and are safe for human consumption. For some viruses, including SARS-CoVs, RSV, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), no effective vaccines are presently accessible making infection detection and treatment a critical necessity. Today, three viruses, namely MERS- and SARS-CoVs, and SARS-CoV-2, present key ultimatums for management since there are still no specific anti-CoV drugs accessible. Owing to the involvement of COVID-19, many facts regarding virulence, pathogenesis, and the real source of viral infection or mode of transmission still need to be addressed; some suggestions and potential alternatives for further evaluations, especially for SARS-CoV-2, include:

   <p>The effects of metallic NPs (e.g., silver, gold and copper NPs or hybrid nanomaterials) can be evaluated against SARS-CoV-2 [
    <xref rid="B17-nanomaterials-10-01072" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. For instance, silver NPs showed inhibition abilities against the viral entrance in host cells, for HIV-1 virus, as these NPs are capable of interacting with the cell receptors [

   <p>Biodegradable nanocarriers and carbon nanotubes can be proposed as potential antiviral agent carriers. For instance, antiviral drugs such as ribavirin and isoprinosine have been chemically linked on a single-walled carbon nanotube surface to transmit these antiviral compounds across biological membranes [

   <p>Importantly, multidrug NPs (with high biocompatibility and drug loading) for the mitigation of uncontrolled inflammation is very promising, especially in the case of COVID-19. In one study, NPs were produced by conjugating squalene, an endogenous lipid, with adenosine, an endogenous immuno-modulator, and then encapsulating Î±-tocopherol, a natural antioxidant [
    <xref rid="B150-nanomaterials-10-01072" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. By using the vascular endothelial barrier dysfunction at sites of acute inflammation, these multidrug NPs could transport the therapeutic agents in a targeted manner and confer remarkable survival advantages to the treated animals in lethal models of endotoxemia. The selective delivery of adenosine and antioxidants together could serve as an innovative method for the treatment of acute inflammation with reduced side effects and significant therapeutic potential, especially in the case of cytokine storm (hypercytokinaemia) ensued by COVID-19 [
