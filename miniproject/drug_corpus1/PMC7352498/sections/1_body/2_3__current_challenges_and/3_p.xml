<p>Nanomaterials have recently appeared to exert their antiviral activities against viruses by different mechanisms, making them attractive tools for viral treatment. All immunological assets and benefits of nanostructures can ensue from the combination of the following features: (i) surface charge tenability (that could assist cellular entrance/export through the cell membrane) [
