<p>The human respiratory mucosa is the most significant portal and the primary site of entry for incursion or infection by various viruses such as the influenza virus, the respiratory syncytial virus, and the parainfluenza virus, among others. These virulent pathogens initially infect the upper respiratory tract and then reach the lower breathing airways (or lower respiratory tract), leading to death. Lower respiratory tract illnesses explicate a leading cause of human morbidity and mortality with ~3 million deaths annually worldwide [
 <xref rid="B5-nanomaterials-10-01072" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These pathogens often enter the host via airborne transmissions (animal/human-to-human) and then spread through direct contact or droplets/aerosols, effectively replicate in the respiratory tract, and mostly cause clinical symptoms/manifestations, namely fever, dyspnea, cough, bronchiolitis, and/or pneumonia [
 <xref rid="B6-nanomaterials-10-01072" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Most respiratory tract infections are due to one of the numerous respiratory viruses, mostly influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), and severe/acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), infecting the personâ€™s lower respiratory tract [
