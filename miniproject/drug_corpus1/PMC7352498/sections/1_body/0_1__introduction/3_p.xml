<p>Respiratory viruses generally present a main health issue in infants, children, elderly people, and/or immunocompromised patients. Parainfluenza virus [

 <xref rid="B14-nanomaterials-10-01072" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] infections are the leading causes of hospitalization for acute respiratory illnesses in children, leading to 40% and 45% of pediatric hospitalizations, respectively. Among these viral infections, 3~5% of the lower respiratory tract illness cases in children are caused by adenovirus infections [

SARS, the most recent infectious illness, is generally an acute form of bronchopneumonia, which could be caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV). Astoundingly, CoVs are the main pathogens that primarily target the human respiratory system. The first emergence of “SARS-CoV” infections (8-month outbreak) had a fatality rate of ~10%, which resulted in over 8000 confirmed cases [

At the end of 2019, 2019-nCoV (emerging novel CoV), as a potentially deadly “SARS-CoV-2” (severe/acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2) presented a critical threat and a global concern to vulnerable populations within an extremely short time span [
 <xref rid="B16-nanomaterials-10-01072" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Astoundingly, these emerging SARS-CoVs are more likely to ensue in the elderly population, particularly those who suffer from hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular or coronary heart illness. At least half of these patients are tremendously susceptible to infection, which may turn into a cytokine storm, septic shock, metabolic acidosis coagulation dysfunction, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), heading to demise. We are today witnessing a global transmission of SARS-CoV-2 with more than 4,178,156 positive cases and at least over 286,353 deaths, transmitted from China to over 212 countries/regions. Now, various antiviral agents and proposed drugs are under clinical trial evaluations for their potential effects against SARS-CoV-2, but they are in the initial stages, and crucial issues, including pharmacokinetic characteristics, drugs availability, and potential side effects, should be analyzed astutely [
