<p id="p0150">For patients who meet specified criteria, in addition to testing for other respiratory pathogens, the CDC recommends collection of specimens to test for COVID-19 virus from the upper respiratory tract (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab) and, if possible, the lower respiratory tract (sputum, tracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage). Additional specimens (eg, stool, urine) can also be collected (

 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2020</xref>), which is based on the detection of unique sequences of viral RNA. In routine-based testing for COVID-19 patients, the presence of SARS-COV-2 is determined through the detection of viral genes namely

However, these methods require expert personnel and expensive laboratory equipment whereas, low viral load in the throat or nasal swab of patients may give false-negative results during RT- PCR-based detection (
