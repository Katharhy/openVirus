<p id="p0085">We generated a bioinformatic analysis for the coronavirus family to predict the potential origin of SARS-CoV-2. Gorbalenya et al., (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Gorbalenya et al., 2020</xref>), reported that the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 as a human pathogen may be perceived completely independent from the other SARS-CoV outbreak. Although, SARS-CoV-2 is indeed not a descendent of SARS-CoV, and the introduction of each of these viruses into humans was likely facilitated by independent unknown external factors. Our findings indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is most probably derived from bat coronavirus (BM48-31/BGR/2008 (Refseq ID: NC_014470.1, Taxonomy ID: 864596), which also comes from bat coronavirus BtCoV/279/2005 (GenBank ID:
