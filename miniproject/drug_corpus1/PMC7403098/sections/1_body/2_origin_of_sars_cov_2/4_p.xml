 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. (2020c)</xref>, analyzed 169 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and classified them into two major genotypes; type I and Type II. Type I is further sub-divided into type IA and IB. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis indicated that type IA is similar to the ancestral SARS-CoV-2, whereas type II was probably evolved from the type I and prevalent in the infections.
