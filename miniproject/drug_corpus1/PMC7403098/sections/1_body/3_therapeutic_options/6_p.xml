<p id="p0120">ACE2 negatively regulates the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by converting Ang II to Ang 1–7, where it functions as a carboxypeptidase. SARS-CoV-2 was found to attack cells using this type I integral membrane protein (
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Matsuyama et al., 2020</xref>). Depletion of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 inhibits the ACE2/Ang (1–7)/Mas receptor pathway, leading to disruption of the RAS, which then leads to the progression of acute severe pneumonia. Thus, inhibiting ACE2 may alleviate pneumonia in COVID-19 patients, provided that blood pressure is controlled (
