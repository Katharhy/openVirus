<p id="p0165">In addition, bio-nanotechnology approaches should be used to develop various nano architectural electrochemical immunosensors that can be utilized for the detection of pathogenic viral organisms. Electrochemistry guided immunosensors have become feasible because of their practical use, high sensitivity, and cost-effectiveness, and miniaturization opportunities. The immunosensors with various microchip electrodes were used to detect avian influenza A (H7N9) virus (
