<p id="p0060">SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> and subgenus 
 <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic>. The polyprotein 1 ab (pp1ab) that consists of nonstructural proteins 1–16 is similar to other members in the subgenus 
 <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic>. Analysis of the pp1ab protein from SARS-CoV-2 indicated that the protein sequence remained conserved in samples isolated from different regions during the outbreak. However, a remarkable deletion of eight amino acids in the virulence factor of the SARS-CoV-2 was identified in an isolate from an asymptomatic Japanese patient (

These data suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 might have emerged by genetic drift from a bat origin coronavirus (bat-SL-CoV-RaTG13), however, this conclusion requires further investigations for confirmation (
