<p id="p0065">Similar to SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell entry receptor to enter the cells by endocytosis (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> ), while other CoVs such as MERS-CoV uses the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) host cell receptor for entry (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al., 2013</xref>). A recent molecular dynamics simulation revealed that spike protein–ACE2 receptor interaction contains a higher number of contacts, a larger interface area, and decreased interface residue fluctuations in SARS-CoV-2 as compared to other coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63) (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Brielle et al., 2020</xref>). ACE2 plays a critical role in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and the discrepancy of ACE/Ang II/AT1R and ACE2/Ang (1–7)/Mas receptor can develop an inflammatory response. In addition, elevated ACE and Ang II are bad prognosis for severe pneumonia (
