  <p>The immune response to COVID-19 infection. Upon its entry, COVID-19 presents its antigenic peptide to the antigen presenting cells (APC) which play a crucial role in the antiviral activity in human. APCs, with the aid of major histocompatibility complex/antigen (MHC/Ag), induce Th
   <sub>0</sub> cells, which activate both Th
   <sub>1</sub> and Th
   <sub>2</sub>. When a cell is infected, the effector cells are stimulated by the function of major histocompatibility complex I/Ag complex, T-cell receptors (TCR) and its coreceptor CD8. With the aid of Th
   <sub>1</sub> cells, IL2, IL-12, interferon gamma (IFN-γ), and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-α), effector cells produce antibodies to destroy the infected cell. On the other side, Th
   <sub>2</sub> cells produce IL-1, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, TGF-α that trigger B cells to transform into memory cells carrying the viral antigen. Then plasma cells produce the viral antibody to defend the cells against the next viral attack. APC: antigen presenting cells, TCR: T-cell receptors, IL: Interleukin, CD: cluster differentiation, IFN-γ: interferon gamma, MHC: major histocompatibility complex, Ag: antigen, TGF-α: transforming growth factor alpha.
