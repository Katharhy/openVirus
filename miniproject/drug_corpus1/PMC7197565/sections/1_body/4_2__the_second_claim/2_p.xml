<p>First, the numbers in this figure do not make sense. According to the presented data, seven (synonymous) substitutions have a derived frequency of &gt;50 per cent, and four of these mutations have derived frequencies &gt;95 per cent in the population. A cursory glance at the tree in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="veaa034-F2">Fig. 2</xref> shows that this cannot be true. ‘
 <italic>Derived</italic>’ in this context should mean a sequence change away from the genome of the last common ancestor of the outbreak. For four mutations to have derived frequencies &gt;95 per cent, there would need to be a small number of samples which branch as a sister lineage to the rest of the outbreak tree. However, this is not the case.
