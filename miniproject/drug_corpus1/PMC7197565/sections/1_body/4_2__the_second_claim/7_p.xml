<p>In addition, the way these data are presented in Tang et al.’s 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="veaa034-F2">Fig. 2</xref> will falsely suggest that purifying selection is acting, even if their methodology was sensible, and there were no such selection. The height of the bars in their figure compares the raw numbers of mutations at each frequency without scaling the heights of the bars for the number of each class of mutation. Because there is a greater number of nonsynonymous substitutions than synonymous substitutions in the population, and as most substitutions are expected to be at low frequency in a population regardless of the action of natural selection (
 <xref rid="veaa034-B6" ref-type="bibr">Fay and Wu 2000</xref>), this presentation will always make it look like there’s proportionately more low-frequency nonsynonymous substitutions.
