<p>A recent paper has proposed three ‘types’ of SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="veaa034-B8" ref-type="bibr">Forster et al. 2020</xref>) and has also received substantial attention in the media. Although that paper does not make any claims of any functional differences among these ‘types’, many of the issues discussed above apply again to this work. The network Forster et al. produce uses the RaTG13 bat sarebecovirus sample to infer the ancestral state of the outbreak. By ignoring the temporal information given by the viral tree and the decades of evolution separating RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2, the inferred ancestor of the outbreak in this network is likely to be incorrect. The choice of which and how many clusters in the network were named was made on the basis of the number of samples belonging to, and surrounding, each node. This methodology means that the sampling biases described earlier are very likely to be driving this classification.
