<p>Tang et al. estimate the ancestral state for each mutation independently, ignoring the very informative phylogenetic tree of the current outbreak, and the temporal information associated with each sample. This method only makes sense when using a much more closely related outgroup species to infer the ancestral states of mutations in a freely recombinant species with unlinked mutations with independent ancestry. Additionally, such methods should incorporate the inherent uncertainty in inferring the ancestral state (e.g. est-sfs;
