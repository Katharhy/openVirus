<p>Implementing this flawed method of inferring ancestral states in a viral outbreak context, where we assume there is no recombination, means that ‘
 <italic>high-frequency derived mutations</italic>’ are actually just new mutations in the outbreak that have mutated back to the inferred ancestral state. This generates an evolutionarily meaningless definition of ‘
 <italic>derived</italic>’ mutations.
