<p>Tang et al. claim seven synonymous and one nonsynonymous substitutions have a derived frequency &gt;0.5. However, because synonymous sites are twenty times more diverged than nonsynonymous sites to the most closely related bat sequence RaTG13 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="veaa034-F3">Figure 3</xref>), the difference between these two ancestral states is much larger in synonymous sites. Therefore, synonymous substitutions are much more likely to be mispolarized than nonsynonymous ones. This is because new synonymous substitutions in the outbreak are much more likely to mutate back to this deeper ancestral state in the tree than new nonsynonymous substitutions. Therefore, using this flawed definition of ‘
 <italic>derived</italic>’, an artefactual excess of high-frequency synonymous substitutions resembling purifying selection will be observed, without any such selection having occurred.
