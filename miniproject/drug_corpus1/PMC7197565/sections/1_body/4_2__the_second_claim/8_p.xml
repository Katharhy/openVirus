<p>When interpreting their results, Tang et al. do not consider that sequencing error could be a driver of a relative excess of singleton nonsynonymous substitutions. This possibility is important because sequencing errors will be at low frequency as they are rare and cannot be transmitted, but real mutations can be at any frequency because they can be transmitted. Additionally, purifying selection can only act on real mutations, and not sequencing errors, so strongly deleterious/lethal nonsynonymous substitutions which cannot be observed as real mutations may appear as sequencing errors. Therefore, it is very possible that sequencing error mutations will have a higher nonsynonymous to synonymous ratio, and these mutations will be at low frequency. This pattern will mimic the action of purifying selection on circulating variation, suppressing the frequency of nonsynonymous substitutions.</p>
