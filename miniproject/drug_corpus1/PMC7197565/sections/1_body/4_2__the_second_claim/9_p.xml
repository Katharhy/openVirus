<p>On a more technical point, Tang et al. used the software PAML (
 <xref rid="veaa034-B31" ref-type="bibr">Yang 2007</xref>) to estimate selection parameters and look for evidence of positive selection in the divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and other related CoVs. PAML does not allow for synonymous rate variation, but they explicitly state in the paper they believe there are mutational hotspots. Recent work has shown that false positive rates of positive selection inference are unacceptably high when such synonymous rate variation occurs (
 <xref rid="veaa034-B26" ref-type="bibr">Wisotsky et al. 2020</xref>). Therefore, if there truly is synonymous rate variation, to reliably identify signatures of positive selection within the phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2, methods which model mutation rate variation must be used (e.g. provided by many of the models from the Hyphy package-
