<p>Any analysis of allele frequencies must also consider that the viral genomes which are sequenced are not a random sample of the global population, and are likely to be biased. In the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the sampling bias arises in two ways. First of all, the sampling of infections for sequencing is greatly biased by the country they occur in. For example, 80 per cent of confirmed COVID-19 cases up until 9 March 2020 came from China, but only 40 per cent of the SARS-CoV-2 full genome sequences derived from China. Second, as contact tracing is a significant driver of case detection, there will be a correlation between detected and sequenced samples, as they are often epidemiologically linked. This lack of independence between sampled genomes, in effect generates pseudoreplication of observed haplotypes. These factors combine to cause oversampling of particular genotypes and mutations, adding variance to the observed frequencies of mutations. This is likely to further exaggerate the variation in mutation frequencies driven by epidemiology, causing observed changes in mutation frequencies through time without any action of natural selection.</p>
