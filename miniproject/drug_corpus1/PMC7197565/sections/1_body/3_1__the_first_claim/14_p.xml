<p>A similar example can be found in the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak. In the initial phases of the outbreak, a 29 nucleotide (nt) deletion within open reading frame 8 (ORF8; the same ORF as the S84L replacement that was used to define S and L types in SARS-CoV-2) was identified, and viruses with this deletion subsequently became dominant within the outbreak (

 <xref rid="veaa034-B29" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al. 2018</xref>). However, experimental infection of one bat and two human cell lines showed that the 29 nt deletion significantly reduced the replicative capability of SARS-CoV-1 (

The spread of this apparently strongly deleterious mutation was hypothesized to be the result of a founder effect in the early period of the epidemic (
