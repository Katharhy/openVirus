<p>The abstract of the paper goes even further, stating outright that: ‘
 <italic>the S type, which is evolutionarily older and less aggressive…</italic>’. It is, however, important to appreciate that finding a majority of samples with a particular mutation is not evidence that viruses with that mutation transmit more readily. To make this suggestion would, at the very minimum, require a comparison to be made to expectations under a null distribution assuming equal transmission rates. As this has not been performed by the authors, there is insufficient evidence to make this suggestion, and therefore it is incorrect (and, we would argue, irresponsible) to state that there is any difference in transmission rates. Genome sequence analysis alone is insufficient to demonstrate a functional effect of a mutation on virus phenotype, without assessing the probable impact of the amino acid replacement, and careful experimentation assessing any functional effect. Differences in the observed numbers of samples with and without this mutation are far more likely to be due to stochastic epidemiological effects and biased virus genome sampling among locations.
