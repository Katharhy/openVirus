<p>One nonsynonymous substitution, particularly one which has not been assessed for functional significance, is not sufficient to define a distinct ‘type’ nor ‘major type’. As of the 9 April 2020, there are 2,334 nonsynonymous substitutions that have been identified in the outbreak, catalogued in the CoV-GLUE resource at 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk</ext-link> (
 <xref rid="veaa034-B19" ref-type="bibr">Singer et al. 2018</xref>). At present, there is no evidence that any of these 2,334 point mutations have any significance in the functional context of within-host infections or transmission rates. Additionally, if one chooses to define ‘
 <italic>types</italic>’ purely on the basis of two mutations, it is unsurprising that these ‘
 <italic>types</italic>’ then differ by those two mutations.
