<p>Basic evolutionary theory predicts that selectively neutral mutations change in frequency over time through the process of genetic drift (
 <xref rid="veaa034-B30" ref-type="bibr">Wright 1942</xref>). In a viral outbreak, each transmission event from one infected person to another is a random probabilistic event, with some infected individuals transmitting more or less often than others. Some infections may transmit at higher rates than others for a variety of reasons. These ‘super spreaders’ may have higher social contact rates or shed more virus for a longer period of time. These small-scale epidemiological phenomena add up over time to create substantial variation in the frequencies of mutations during an outbreak. It is also important to appreciate that the fewer infected hosts there are, the more these small-scale variations are likely to affect the frequency of mutations in the viral population. Given that the two mutations in question appear to have occurred very early on in the outbreak, when fewer individuals were infected, their frequency will very likely have been particularly influenced by genetic drift.
