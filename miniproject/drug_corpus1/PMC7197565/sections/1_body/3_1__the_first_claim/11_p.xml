<p>The A82V amino acid replacement in the GP protein from the 2013–16 Ebola outbreak illustrates the difficulty in demonstrating a functional effect of a mutation. Three new amino acid replacements in the Ebola outbreak rose in frequency to be found in &gt;90 per cent of all sequenced genomes: R111C in the NP gene, A82V in the GP gene, and D759G in the L gene. The A82V replacement was of particular interest as it was located on the receptor binding interface. However, this rise in frequency alone was insufficient to make firm conclusions about the functional significance of this mutation. To demonstrate the significance of the A82V replacement, 
 <xref rid="veaa034-B5" ref-type="bibr">Diehl et al. (2016)</xref> performed numerous additional analyses. These included: predicting the structural impact of the change on the protein in silico; modelling the effect of the mutation on case fatality rate, controlling for viral loads, geographic location and access to healthcare; and in vitro experimental infection of three different human, and nine different nonhuman cell lines using viruses with and without this mutation. Despite finding significant evidence that virus infections with the A82V replacement showed higher mortality rates, and that the mutation enhanced infectivity of human and primate cell lines, the authors were not able to conclude that this mutation contributed to greater transmission and severity of the outbreak:
