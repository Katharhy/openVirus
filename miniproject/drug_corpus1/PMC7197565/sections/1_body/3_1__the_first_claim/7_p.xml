<p>During a pandemic, as the virus spreads to new areas and countries that were previously uninfected, founder effects will have significant impacts on mutation frequencies. As a small number of virus copies spread into a local epidemic, any mutations present in the initial viral infections will rapidly become very common, even if they were rare in the particular geographical area which seeded the transmission. This is particularly likely to be the case in an outbreak caused by a novel virus such as SARS-CoV-2, as there are a large number of susceptible hosts for the virus, and numerous epidemics are being established around the world at different timepoints. These founder effects have also been observed in previous viral outbreaks for example, in chikungunya virus and multiple local HIV epidemics (
