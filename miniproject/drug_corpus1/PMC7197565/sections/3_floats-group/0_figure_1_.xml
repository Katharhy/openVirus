 <caption>
  <p>A visualization of the genetic variation observed in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic sequences up until the 12 March 2020. Nonsynonymous (pink) and synonymous (green) substitutions (with respect to Wuhan-Hu-1, GenBank accession number MN908947) are represented in colour in each row, with rows labelled with the genome position and corresponding ORF on the side. The mutations are plotted in a grid format where each column is a sample and each row is a unique mutation at a given genome position; mutations have been filtered to only display those observed in more than one sample (seventy-four nonsynonymous and forty-one synonymous). The genome positions of some of the most common mutations have been labelled directly on the plot. The plot was created using the d3heatmap package in R, and the sample columns are clustered using Wardâ€™s method.</p>
