<p>Meplazumab is a humanized anti-CD147 antibody. A recent study showed that SARS-CoV-2 can invade human host cells via a novel route of the CD147-spike protein (SP), [

The study also showed that meplazumab could competitively inhibit the binding of SP and CD147, and it could prevent viruses from invading host cells; this has provided a potential target for developing antiviral cures or protocols.
