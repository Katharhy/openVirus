<p>Bevacizumab is a recombinant, humanized monoclonal antibody that has been used in anti-tumor therapy for 16 years. It binds to and neutralizes vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), preventing its interaction with endothelial receptors, Flt-1 and KDR. The suppression of vascular permeability in patients with severe/critical COVID-19 is expected to reduce pulmonary edema. The autopsies of patients who died from COVID-19 have shown the significant exudation of the pulmonary mucus, more evident than infection with SARS [

Currently, the drug is being evaluated for its efficacy and safety in severe or critical patients with COVID-19 in a multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial [
