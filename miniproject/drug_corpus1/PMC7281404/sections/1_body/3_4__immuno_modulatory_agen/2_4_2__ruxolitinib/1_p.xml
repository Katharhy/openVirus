<p>Ruxolitinib is an orally available and potent JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor. It was the first drug for myelofibrosis to be approved by the FDA in November 2011 [
 <xref rid="B75-pharmaceuticals-13-00096" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. The pharmacokinetic analysis of ruxolitinib predicted that the unbound plasma concentration required to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis greatly exceeds the currently tolerated therapeutic dose [
 <xref rid="B73-pharmaceuticals-13-00096" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Therefore, viral infectivity at therapeutic doses is unlikely to decrease, but the drug may reduce the inflammatory response of the host by inhibiting JAK. Ruxolitinib is currently being studied to combine it with COVID-19 mesenchymal stem cell infusion (NCT04252118).
