<p>Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 binds first with its S glycoprotein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), a homologs enzyme to ACE expresses on the membrane of lung epithelial cells, which is followed by virus-cell fusion and viral entry; see

 <xref rid="B129-pharmaceuticals-13-00096" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. Angiotensin II (ANGII) is generated from angiotensin I (ANGI) after being cleaved by ACE. ANGII binds to angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) and functionally results in blood pressure elevation. ACE2 terminates the ANGII effect by degrading it into angiotensin-(1–7), which binds to Mas receptors on blood vessels, thus resulting in a vasodilator effect [
 <xref rid="B12-pharmaceuticals-13-00096" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Furthermore, ACE2 degrades ANGI into angiotensin-(1–9), which is later converted into angiotensin-(1–7) via ACE [

 <xref rid="B129-pharmaceuticals-13-00096" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. ANGII plays an important role in regulating ACE2. In the absence of abnormally elevated levels of Ang II, complex formation between angiotensin receptor (AT1R) and ACE2 on the cell membrane is predominant [
 <xref rid="B129-pharmaceuticals-13-00096" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. When ANGII levels increase, the AT1R/ACE2 complex is disrupted and triggers ACE2 cellular internalization, with subsequent lysosomal degradation via an AT1R-dependent pathway [
