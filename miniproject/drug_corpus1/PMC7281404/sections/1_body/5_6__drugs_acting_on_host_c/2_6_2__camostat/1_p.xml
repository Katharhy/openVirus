<p>In-vitro studies have shown that endosomal cysteine proteases, namely cathepsin B (CTSB) and L (CTSL), can activate the glycoproteins of filoviruses, SARS-CoV, other coronaviruses, Nipah virus (NiV), and Hendra virus (HeV) through a mechanism that facilitates virus entry into certain cell lines [
