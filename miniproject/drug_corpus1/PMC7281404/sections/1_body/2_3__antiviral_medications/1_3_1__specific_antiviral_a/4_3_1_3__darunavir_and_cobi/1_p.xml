<p>Another combination of protease inhibitors was previously reported to be bioequivalent to the lopinavir/ritonavir combination in healthy volunteers, with the advantage of avoiding the adverse effects of ritonavir [

Like ritonavir, it inhibits CYP2D6 and p-glycoprotein. Cobicistat also inhibits drug transporters, e.g., organic anion transport protein (OATP1B1) which is the main transporter for statins [
