<p>Several approaches have been suggested to target the current SARS-CoV-2 infection in moderate-to-severe cases in an attempt to control viral replication; these approaches include (1) the antiviral repurposing of drugs that were used in SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, including antiretroviral agents; (2) using immunoglobulins and convalescent plasma; and (3) the bioinformatics screening of chemical libraries for compounds/drugs that are likely to act on SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, a recent investigation by Klann et al. studied host cell proteomics and highlighted the metabolic pathways particular to the virus, and they came up with medications that are not classified as antiviral—like emetine, which inhibits 40S ribosomal protein S14, and cycloheximide, which is an inhibitor of translation elongation—as potential effective therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study is under review [
