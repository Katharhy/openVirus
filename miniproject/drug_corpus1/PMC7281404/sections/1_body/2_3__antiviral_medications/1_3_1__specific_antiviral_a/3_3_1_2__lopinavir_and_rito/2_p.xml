<p>Lopinavir undergoes extensive metabolism in the liver by microsomal enzymes “cytochrome 3A4 (CYP3A4)” and “CYP3A5.” Ritonavir inhibits the CYP3A4 enzyme and results in increased concentrations of lopinavir when the two drugs are co-administered [

Lopinavir/ritonavir combination is mostly eliminated by the fecal route, whereas the urinary excretion accounts for less than 2% of the eliminated drug. Lopinavir has a low transference across the human placenta; fetal exposure is increased with ritonavir. Based on information collected by the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry, the risk of teratogenic effects is not increased in patients receiving lopinavir. Adverse pregnancy outcomes may be linked to the use the antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy, including preterm delivery, stillbirth, low birth weight, and small for gestational age infants [
