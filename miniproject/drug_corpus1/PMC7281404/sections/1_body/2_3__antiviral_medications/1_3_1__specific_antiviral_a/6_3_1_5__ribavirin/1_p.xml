<p>The drug is an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor. The enzyme is crucial for the de novo synthesis of guanosine. The drug is mainly used for the treatment of viral hepatitis C. It has not shown a significant effect as a monotherapy in the treatment of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV [

Interestingly, ribavirin inhibited SARS-COV-2 replication at low concentrations in Caco-2 cells (in micromolar amounts) used as a model for the new viral infection of human cells in a study proposed by Klann et al. (this study is under review). The results of this study are concordant with previous reports of ribavirin effectiveness against other coronaviruses including HCoV-43, CoV-NL63, and MERS-CoV-16, but not SARS-CoV-126. Ribavirin is under investigation in COVID-19 in combination with interferon-α (NCT04254874; ChiCTR2000029308).
