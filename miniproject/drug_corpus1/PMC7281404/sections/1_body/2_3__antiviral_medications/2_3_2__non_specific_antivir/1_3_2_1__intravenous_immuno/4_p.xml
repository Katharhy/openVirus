The anti-S-IgG may alter the functional polarization of alveolar macrophages and enhance the accumulation of the proinflammatory monocyte/macrophage and the production of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and IL-8 in the lungs. The process starts with the binding of the virus-anti-S-IgG complex to the fragment crystallizable region receptor receptors (FcR) of monocytes/macrophages. Thus, blocking FcR decreases the production of inflammatory cytokines, (

The process of ADE enhances the cellular uptake of infectious virus-antibody complexes after their interaction with FcR or other receptors, leading to the exacerbation of target cell infection [
