<p>Previously, interferon treatment showed inconclusive activity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. IFNÎ²1 up-regulates CD73 in the pulmonary endothelium, leading to adenosine secretion. Adenosine is an anti-inflammatory molecule that supports the endothelial barrier. Thus, interferon treatment reduces vascular leakage in ARDS, [

One assumption of COVID-19-associated severe lung injury is that the virus infection provokes an exaggerated IFN-I-mediated response against the virus, leading to exuberant tissue damage (interferonopathy). Accordingly, IFN-I should be judiciously used by expert specialists. IFN-1 may be administered to patients in the early phase of the disease [
