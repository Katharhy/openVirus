<p>IFN-I is one of the first cytokines released in the context of viral infection. The IFNAR receptors recognize it on the plasma membrane in most cells. Upon interaction with its receptors, interferons induce signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) phosphorylation. STAT1 then translocates to the nucleus to activate interferon-stimulated genes (ISG). The ISGs interfere with viral replication and spread by several mechanisms such as the modulation of cell metabolism or cytokine release, finally activating the adaptive immunity. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are a subgroup of the ISG. PRRs increase the cellular response to pathogens. The ISGs also include proteins that decrease membrane fluidity, thus suppressing the membrane fusion and the egress of the virus. ISGs also comprise antiviral proteins that specifically inhibit steps of the viral cycle [
