In this study, the use of azithromycin in combination with HCQ was apparently associated with a more rapid decline in viral RNA; however, the control groups for the study were a concern, and the biologic basis for using azithromycin in this setting is unclear. Another small observational study in patients with more severe illness did not suggest rapid viral RNA clearance with the combination [
