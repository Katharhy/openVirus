<p>CQ and HCQ, as weak bases, exert their antiviral mechanism by affecting the acid vesicles, which leads to the disruption of enzymes required for the post-translational modifications of proteins. Both drugs concentrate in the acidic cell organelles, thus inhibiting virus replication by preventing endosome/lysosome trafficking. Another potential mechanism is the intervention with the viral protein maturation during virion maturation [
