<p>Respiratory failure was obviously a major cause of death in previous viral pandemics, including Spanish flu in 1918 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, and this is also the case in the new COVID-19 [

Besides conventional treatment, antiviral therapy (both classic and novel repurposed medications) may shorten the course of the disease and improve its outcome. However, there is currently no supporting evidence for these therapies apart from small studies or case series. Severe cases of COVID-19 may need assisted ventilation through various modalities [
 <xref rid="B4-pharmaceuticals-13-00096" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A high number of severe cases (especially elderly) may progress to acute severe lung injury and/or multiple organ failure due to a deranged immune response or a “cytokine storm,” the treatment of which may involve immunomodulators. This review covers the key medications suggested as potential agents under investigation in registered clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19. Broadly, they are either repurposed antiviral, other anti-infective, or immunomodulatory agents, in addition to drugs that act on host cell receptors. The ventilatory and hemodynamic support of critically-ill COVID-19 patients has been reviewed elsewhere [
