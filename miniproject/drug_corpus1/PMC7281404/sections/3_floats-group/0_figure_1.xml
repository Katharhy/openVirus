  <p>Virus entry into the host cell. The attachment protein “-spike glycoprotein” of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses a cellular attachment factor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)) and uses the cellular protease TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease serine 2) for its activation. ACE2 can be activated via either losartan or recombinant human ACE 2 (rhACE2). Potential pharmacotherapeutic approaches include the use of camostat mesylate (which is a TMPRSS2 inhibitor) to block the priming of the spike protein, increasing the number of ACE2 receptors via losartan, and the use of soluble recombinant human ACE2 (which should slow viral entry into cells via competitive binding with SARS-CoV-2). The structure of SARS-CoV-2 is shown in the upper right.</p>
