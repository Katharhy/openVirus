<p id="p0020">There has also been increased media coverage for “alternative” remedies to prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. For example, it is common in China to use of herbal plants to fight the virus including jinhua qinggan capsules, lianhua qinwen capsules, and shufeng jiedu capsules [
 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These herbal formulas contain a combination of many herbs and the exact proprietary mixture is not available, posing a major health risk to patients due to their potential toxicity, contamination, or adulteration [
 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Although traditional medicine techniques were widely used during past epidemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 influenza, a Cochran Review found that Chinese herbs combined with western medicine did not decrease mortality versus western medicine alone [
 <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Use of Chinese herbal products for treating viruses is not guided by viral pathology, rather herbs are prescribed by herbalists according to Chinese diagnostic patterns (inspection, listening, smelling, inquiry, and palpitation) [

 <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The implications of medicating with herbal-based formulas are serious and dangerous because there is no scientific evidence suggesting that these alternative remedies can prevent or cure COVID-19. There are several adverse effects noted with herbal medications, such as hepatotoxicity, and there have been numerous reports of toxic contaminants, including pesticides and heavy metals [
 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Furthermore, although supplementing with vitamins and minerals may improve immune function, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of any supplement will prevent or cure COVID-19. Similarly, “cures” spread by social media accounts (which include gargling vinegar and rosewater or salt, and drinking concoctions of mint or white willow with saffron, turmeric, and cinnamon) are not evidence-based, though they may have other nutritional benefits [
 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Medicating with these herbal formulas or supplements may lead to adverse health effects due to imprecise dosing of the supplement or herb, inherent toxicity of the herb itself, or toxicity of the contaminants in the product, thus complicating the clinical picture.
