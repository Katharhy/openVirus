<p>Inhibition of helicase or primase activities has been pursued as an antiviral approach in the past and has been reviewed in detail elsewhere.

 </sup> Importantly, herpes simplex virus (HSV) helicase UL5 is a member of the same helicase super family 1 (SF1) as SARS-CoV-2 nsp13. In 2002, Boehringer-Ingelheim

 </sup> independently reported on inhibitors of the HSV helicase–primase complex that were comparative to approved antivirals for HSV. Boehringer-Ingelheim’s aminothiazoylphenyl-based inhibitors of HSV helicase–primase, namely, BILS 179 (

 <bold>1</bold>), exhibit nanomolar antiviral activity and are selective for HSV infection in mouse models. The clinically used amenamevir (
 <bold>2</bold>), another herpes antiviral, also targets in the helicase–primase at nanomolar concentrations.

 </sup> The most promising inhibitor of SARS-CoV-1 helicase, SSYA10-001 (
 <bold>3</bold>), which shows micromolar activity against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infections in vitro, was awarded a US patent in 2014.

 </sup> Given the conservation of helicase sequences in SARS-CoV-1 and CoV-2, this inhibitor will likely serve as a useful starting point for future design of coronavirus helicase modulators.
