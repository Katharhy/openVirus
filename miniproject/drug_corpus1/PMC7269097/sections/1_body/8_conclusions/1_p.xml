<p>We envision that in the coming months and years, there will be three phases of therapeutic intervention for COVID-19: (1) repurposing of existing drugs as treatments and prophylactics; (2) the development of vaccines; and, (3) as the threat of a mutated virus looms large, the development of an arsenal of compounds that are available against other targets to sustain a defense against widespread infection. The reservoir of targets and available compounds against this and related viruses described in this perspective is a resource that medicinal chemists are encouraged to explore further.</p>
