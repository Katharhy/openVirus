<p>The S proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and CoV-2 share 76% overall sequence identity, yet the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the latter has 10–20-fold higher affinity to the human ACE2 receptor protein.

 </sup> After the RBD binds ACE2, two heptad repeat domains, HR1 and HR2, interact to form a six-helical bundle, and in so doing bring the viral and host membrane proximal to one another resulting in fusion. This fusion process is essential for viral entry. Design of “coiled coil” heptad repeat-based peptides provides an avenue for drug design that can easily be tailored to respond to mutations that will arise in future S proteins. Using a recently solved crystal structure of the HR1 and HR2 domains of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, lipidated peptide fusion inhibitors have been designed that inhibit pseudovirus infection of cells with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values in the single-digit nanomolar range.

 </sup> Targeting membrane fusion with peptide-based inhibitors offers opportunities and flexibility for entry inhibition in future coronavirus strains, but the cost and possible side effects may be a deterrent for widespread global use.
