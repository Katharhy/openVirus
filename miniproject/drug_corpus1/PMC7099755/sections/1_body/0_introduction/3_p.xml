<p>The expert consensus put forward herein is primarily based on the epidemiology and disease burden associated with influenza and pneumococcal diseases, and the evidence of vaccine safety and effectiveness. The evidence cited in this consensus report is mainly derived from relevant recently published literature and related documents issued by several vaccination authorities, including the World Health Organization (WHO), the National Health and Wellness Committee, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Herein, influenza and
