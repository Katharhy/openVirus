<p>The transmission of 
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> mainly occurs via direct respiratory droplets or infection caused by bacterial colonization in the respiratory tract. It spreads locally to the sinuses and middle ear, or is inhaled into the lower respiratory tract, which can lead to pneumonia. Invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPDs), such as meningitis, streptococcal pneumonia, and bacteremia, occur when the bacteria invade the bloodstream; these diseases are associated with high mortality. 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> results in bacteremia pneumonia in approximately 20% of cases. Reportedly, up to 30 
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> serotypes are responsible for more than 80% of IPDs in all age groups globally. Although IPD cases are not as common as non‐IPD infections, an etiological diagnosis is more accessible in cases of IPD. Accordingly, the incidence of IPD is often considered an important indicator of 
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> serotype distribution and disease burden.
