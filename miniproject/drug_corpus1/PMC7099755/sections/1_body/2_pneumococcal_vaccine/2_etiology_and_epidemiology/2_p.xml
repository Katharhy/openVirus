 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, also known as pneumococcus, is a gram‚Äêpositive encapsulated diplococcus bacterium. It is ubiquitous in the natural environment and humans are its primary natural host. The polysaccharide capsule of the bacterium is an essential virulence factor, and more than 90 serotypes have been defined based on differences in capsule compositions. The serotype spectrums vary in different age groups and different seasons and regions, but the general distributions of the most common pathogenic serotypes are the same throughout the world.
