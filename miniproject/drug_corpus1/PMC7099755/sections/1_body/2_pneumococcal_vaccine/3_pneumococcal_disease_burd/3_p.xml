<p>The antimicrobial resistance surveillance report on 
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> derived from the China Antimicrobial Resistant Surveillance System states that the respective resistance rates to penicillin, cefuroxime, and erythromycin are 53.6%, 46.4%, and as high as 94.2% in elderly people aged ≥ 65 years.

 </xref> Pneumococcal vaccines, such as the 23‐valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV) known as PPSV23, can control the prevalence of pneumococcal diseases by reducing transmission, thereby alleviating its resistance to antibiotics, which reduces the emergence of drug‐resistant strains and prevents the resistance rate from rising.
