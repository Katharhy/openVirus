<p>Adults aged ≥ 60 years should receive one dose of PPSV23. Revaccination is generally not recommended in immunocompetent people, but it is now recommended that elderly people who have a high risk of severe pneumococcal infection and who have been vaccinated more than 5 years previously be revaccinated. People aged ≥ 65 years who have not been vaccinated within 5 years (including those who were aged &lt; 65 years at the time of their last vaccination) can be revaccinated. Because data on the safety of administering PPSV23 three or more times are insufficient, additional vaccinations after the first revaccination (that is, two vaccinations in total) are not routinely recommended.</p>
