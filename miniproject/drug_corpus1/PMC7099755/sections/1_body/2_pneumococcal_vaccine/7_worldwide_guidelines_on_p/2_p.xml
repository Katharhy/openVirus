 </xref> The Australian and New Zealand Society for Geriatric Medicine, the European Union Geriatric Medicine Society, and the International Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics‐European Region all recommend PPSV23 for adults aged ≥ 65 years. Revaccination should be considered only 5‐6 years after the first vaccination, and no more than two vaccinations should be administered.

 </xref> The ACIP recommends that people aged ≥ 65 years who have not previously received a pneumococcal vaccination or are not sure whether they have should be vaccinated with one dose of PCV13 first, followed by a dose of PPSV23 (PCV13‐PPSV23 sequence). The recommended interval between the PCV13 and the PPSV23 is at least 1 year for immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 65 years. Those who have chronic cardiovascular disease (excluding hypertension), chronic lung disease, chronic liver disease, diabetes, and/or alcohol or smoking habits should receive another dose of PPSV23 at least 5 years later. It is recommended that adults aged ≥ 65 years with immunocompromising conditions, functional or anatomic asplenia, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, or cochlear implants receive one dose of PCV13 first, followed by PPSV23 ≥ 8 weeks later, then another dose of PPSV23 ≥ 5 years after that. People aged ≥ 65 years who have a history of PPSV23 vaccination should receive a dose of PCV13 at least 1 year after their last dose of PPSV23.
