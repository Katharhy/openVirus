<p>The first pneumococcal vaccine was a whole‐cell preparation. The first clinical trial of a pneumococcal vaccine was conducted in 1911 in native workers at gold and diamond mines in South Africa.

 </xref> The immunogenicity of PPSV23 was weak in recipients aged &lt; 2 years, leading to the development of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), which is generated by combining pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide with a carrier protein. A 7‐valent PCV (PCV7) covering seven serotypes was introduced and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2000, and administered to children aged &lt; 5 years.

 </xref> To cover more serotypes, PCV10 and PCV13 have been developed in the past decade. PCV10 was approved in Canada in 2008 and was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2009. PCV13 was first approved in Chile in 2009 and was subsequently licensed by the FDA to prevent pneumococcal disease in young children.
