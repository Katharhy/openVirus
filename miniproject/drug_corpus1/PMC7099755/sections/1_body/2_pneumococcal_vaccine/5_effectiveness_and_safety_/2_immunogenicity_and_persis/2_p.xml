<p>Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine containing only polysaccharide antigen, which is a T cell‐independent antigen, can induce serotype‐specific immunoglobulin (Ig)A, IgM, and IgG (mainly IgG2 subclass) antibodies and promote the killing of 
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> by leukocytes and phagocytic cells, thus inducing specific protective effects. Immune responses to capsular polysaccharide are age‐dependent and serotype‐dependent.
