<p>Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine can elicit interaction between T‐helper lymphocytes and B lymphocytes, and induce strong immune responses and immunological memory. PCV13 can reportedly induce higher levels of antibody in elderly people than PPSV23.

 </xref> reported that in a randomized double‐blind study involving 936 adults aged ≥ 70 years, the opsonophagocytic activity titers were significantly greater in a PCV13 inoculation group than in a PPSV23 group for 10 of the 12 serotypes common to both vaccines and serotype 6A, which is unique to PCV13. Opsonophagocytic activity responses after a follow‐on dose of PCV13 a year later demonstrated that a prior dose of PPSV23, but not PCV13, diminished the response to a subsequent administration of PCV13, which indicates better immunogenicity of PCV13.
