 </xref> and reported in 2015, a strategy involving country‐wide vaccination of all adults aged 60 years with one dose of PPSV23 avoided 7810 hospitalizations and 514 deaths, and saved 3787 years of life. The total costs of its implementation were US $31 507 012 to the health system and US $44 548 180 from a whole societal perspective. Hypothetically, the strategy resulted in respective incremental cost‐effectiveness ratios of US $1297 and $904 per life year for the health system and from the whole societal perspective, respectively, compared with current practice (vaccination of institutionalized elderly people and elderly people with underlying diseases).
