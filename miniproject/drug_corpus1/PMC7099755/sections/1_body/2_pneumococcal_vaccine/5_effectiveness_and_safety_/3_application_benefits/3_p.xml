<p>The combined administration of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination and influenza vaccination has a partially additive benefit. A meta‐analysis on data derived from people aged ≥ 65 years reported in 2016 indicated that combined pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination and influenza vaccination was associated with lower pneumonia and all‐cause mortality than influenza vaccination alone.

 </xref> followed up elderly people diagnosed with chronic lung disease for three influenza seasons. In that study, influenza vaccination alone was associated with substantial reductions in hospitalization (52%) and mortality (70%), and pneumococcal vaccination alone was also associated with reductions in hospitalization (27%) and mortality (34%)—but receiving both vaccinations resulted in partially additive benefits, including a 63% reduction in hospitalization and an 81% reduction in mortality. The results indicated that receiving both vaccines conferred additive clinical benefits in patients with chronic pulmonary diseases. In summary, previous studies have shown that simultaneous administration of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines in elderly people is effective and safe, and is not associated with increased side‐effects.
