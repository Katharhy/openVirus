<p>Adjuvants and high‐dose influenza vaccines have been explored to improve vaccine immunogenicity. Adjuvants can enhance immune responses to influenza‐specific antigens, producing stronger immune effects than the antigens alone. Compared with a standard‐dose vaccine, high‐dose IIV3 (IIV3‐HD) improves antibody responses to influenza in adults aged 65 years or older.

The WHO recommends that influenza vaccine components be updated annually because of the ever‐changing antigenic nature of influenza virus. To provide maximum protection for the vaccinated population, it is still recommended that recipients vaccinate again in the current influenza season, as the antibody titers in most vaccine recipients decline substantially after a year, even if the antigenic influenza vaccine components are exactly the same as those in the previous season.
