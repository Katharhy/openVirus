<p>Influenza vaccination can induce humoral and cellular immune responses in humans. In humoral immunity, influenza vaccines mainly induce the production of antibodies against influenza virus surface glycoproteins. Serum antibody levels usually peak within 2‐4 weeks after influenza virus infection or vaccination, but in elderly people it can take more than 4 weeks.
