<p>People should inform the doctor of any immunodeficiency conditions they have or immunosuppressant medications they are taking before influenza vaccination. To prevent allergic reactions after vaccination, appropriate monitoring and emergency rescue measures should be prepared in advance. Vaccination can prevent infection by influenza strains contained in the vaccine from 2 to 3 weeks after vaccination. Notably, however, people may still develop influenza if they are exposed to the virus before or immediately after vaccination because the influenza incubation period is typically several days. Different injection sites should be used when influenza vaccination is administered in conjunction with other vaccines. Vaccination should be postponed if the intended recipient has a fever, acute infection, or an acute attack of chronic disease. Influenza vaccination should also be administered with caution in patients who have developed Guillain‐Barré syndrome within 6 weeks of a previous influenza vaccination. All vaccine recipients should be kept under observation for 30 minutes after immunization.</p>
