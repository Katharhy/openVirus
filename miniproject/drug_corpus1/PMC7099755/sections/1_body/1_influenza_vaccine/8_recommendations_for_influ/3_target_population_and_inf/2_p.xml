<p>Adults aged &gt; 60 years should receive an annual TIV before the influenza season starts. To achieve better protection, elderly people should be vaccinated annually because influenza viruses are prone to rapid antigenic mutation. When vaccine supply is limited, priority should be given to: adults with cardiovascular (excluding isolated hypertension), chronic pulmonary, hepatic, renal, hematologic, neurologic, neuromuscular, or metabolic disorders; adults who are immunocompromised; and medical staff working in health institutions, nursing homes, and sanitariums. Vaccinating health‐care workers against influenza not only protects them and keeps health services running during the influenza season, it also reduces the chances of them transmitting the virus to people at high risk.</p>
