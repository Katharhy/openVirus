<p>Most influenza vaccines are manufactured via virus propagation in eggs or are cultured by Madin‐Darby canine kidney cells or Vero cells. Although the whole‐virus vaccine is still used in some countries, the split vaccine has become mainstream since the first split virion influenza vaccine was launched in 1968. Since then, a subunit vaccine has been obtained by purifying and removing the endoantigen on the basis of the split vaccine. To increase the immunogenicity of subunit vaccines, some manufacturers have also developed adjuvant influenza vaccines. In 2009, high‐dose inactivated influenza vaccines were first used in the United States for vaccination for adults aged 65 and over.

 </xref> Influenza vaccines that are currently available internationally include inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV), recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV), and live attenuated influenza vaccine, all of which are available in trivalent or tetravalent formulations. The IIVs include three types: whole‐virus vaccine, split‐virus vaccine, and subunit vaccine. The influenza vaccines currently used in China are all trivalent IIVs (TIVs).
