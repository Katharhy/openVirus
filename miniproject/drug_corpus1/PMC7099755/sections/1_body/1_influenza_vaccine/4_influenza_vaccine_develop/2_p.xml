<p>Influenza vaccine development has involved the isolation of influenza viruses, identification of changes in circulating strains, and refinement of viral culture techniques. In 1933, scientists at the National Institute of Medical Research in London began to develop the first live attenuated influenza vaccine by successfully isolating the first influenza virus. The United States and the United Kingdom subsequently successfully developed the first monovalent type A (H1N1) inactivated influenza vaccine. Since then, influenza vaccine development has progressed remarkably rapidly. In 1942, a bivalent influenza vaccine was developed after the detection of influenza B virus. In 1978, when influenza A virus (H1N1 and H3N2) and influenza B virus were simultaneously prevalent, a trivalent influenza vaccine type A(H1N1)/A(H3N2)/B was introduced.

 </xref> In the late 1980s, two strains of influenza B virus were discovered, Victoria and Yamagata, which were alternately prevalent. The WHO recommended a trivalent component vaccine containing only one component from each strain, but there is no cross‚Äêprotection between the two strains, which can lead to a mismatch between the actual circulating strains and vaccine candidates for influenza B vaccine strains in component vaccines.

 </xref> Therefore, since 2012, recommendations issued by the WHO with regard to influenza vaccine composition have included both the Victoria and Yamagata strains, and two components that are updated annually, which constitutes a tetravalent vaccine.
