<p>Influenza can result in serious complications, including viral pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, encephalitis, and myocarditis, all of which can aggravate underlying medical conditions and lead to severe clinical outcomes or death.

 </xref> Because of factors including their reduced immune responses, lung compliance, muscle strength, and coughing reflexes, as well as a disproportionate likelihood of multiple complications and malnutrition, elderly people are a high‐risk population for influenza virus infection. Influenza infection in elderly people is associated with prolonged hospitalization and high influenza‐related mortality.

 </xref> conducted a survey investigating annual influenza‐associated excess mortality in urban populations in China, which indicated that excess mortality from respiratory and circulatory diseases was 12.4 (range 7.4‐22.2) deaths per 100 000 people in the northern cities and 8.8 (range 5.5‐13.6) deaths per 100 000 people in the southern cities. Approximately 86% of deaths associated with influenza reportedly occur in people aged ≥ 65 years. The economic burden in adults aged &gt; 60 years is significantly higher than that in those aged &lt; 60 years, and the mean respective costs per episode in those age groups are US $2735 and $1417‐1621, respectively. In China, the influenza‐associated economic burden of inpatients aged &gt; 60 years is 1.14 times the annual per capita income.
