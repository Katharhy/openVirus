<p>Influenza viruses belong to the family 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic>. Based on their viral nuclear proteins and matrix protein antigens, they are divided into types A, B, C, and D. Type A influenza viruses are further divided into various subtypes based on differences in the surface antigens hemagglutinin (H1‐H18) and neuraminidase (N1‐N11). Type B influenza and two influenza A subtypes, A/H3N2 and A/H1N1, are considered the main pathogens responsible for human influenza epidemics.

 </xref> The epidemiological characteristics of influenza viruses include their capacity for antigenic variability and sudden outbreaks that spread rapidly, and accordingly they cause seasonal epidemics every year. Influenza outbreaks often occur in places with high population density, such as schools and nursing homes.
