<p>The dominant strains and activity intensity of influenza viruses in different periods and regions exhibit distinct characteristics. Climate factors are the strongest predictors of influenza seasonality, including the lowest temperature, hours of sunshine, and maximum rainfall. Low temperature is a predictor of winter influenza occurrence and annual cyclical intensity in northern China, whereas in southern China, influenza activity is related mainly to rainfall. That knowledge can be drawn upon when devising strategies for determining the optimal times for influenza vaccination. In 2013, Yu et al

Epidemics peak in January and February in northern China, northeastern China, northwestern China, and the part of Qinghai located in the Qinghai‐Tibet area (latitude ≥ 33°N), and from April to June in southern China and Yunnan Province (latitude ≤ 27°N). Eastern China, central China, and most of the southwestern regions (latitudes 27.4‐31.3°N) experience dominant semi‐annual influenza A periodicity with peaks in January and February, and from June to August. Conversely, influenza B activity predominantly occurs in the colder months throughout most of China.
