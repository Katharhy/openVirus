<p>Since its discovery, PI has proven to be lifesaving for many acute infections. Even though COVID-19 might be different, PI experiences provide relevant historical precedents that are both reassuring and useful as humanity now confronts this pandemic. Different analyses demonstrated that the viral load and mortality rate were significantly reduced by using CP for the treatment of COVs infections, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, especially if it was introduced early after symptom onset. With the current deterioration of global health systems, we believe that PI deserves the clinical evaluation as a method for treating COVID-19.</p>
