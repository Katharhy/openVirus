<p>Before COVID-19, there have been two other CoVs epidemics: SARS-CoV in Guandong, China, and MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia. Since these CoVs have a zoonotic origin and host jump to infect humans, we did not have any registered medication or a vaccine against these diseases, leading to the option of using PI. The effectiveness of the PI technique has been exemplified in a report by Soo et al. in which their results showed good clinical outcomes as patients were discharged by day 22 following the onset of symptoms. The patients in the CP group had a significantly shorter hospital stay and lower mortality rate than other groups [

This distinction is further exemplified in studies using CP therapy, such as studying the efficacy of CP therapy in the treatment of patients with SARS-CoV that was performed on 80 SARS-CoV patients who were given CP at the Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong in 2003, where the higher discharge rate was observed among patients who were given CP before day 14 of the illness [

The study reported that all infected HCW who were infected with SARS-CoV and failed to respond to the available treatment, survived after transfusion with CP obtained from three recovered patients. The findings showed that CP transfusion may be considered a very good option in treating SARS-CoV patients [
