<p>While neutralizing antibodies are critical for antibody-mediated protection against viral infection, the impact of CP on resolution of active infection remains incompletely understood. However, beyond direct neutralization of the virus, other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, may also play a role in the ability of C19-CP to aid in the clearance of an active infection. Such considerations may be especially important in infants with developing or suppressed immune systems that may attenuate the ability of other antibody effector systems to effectively clear COVID-19 following C19-CP therapy. While we were unfortunately unable to acquire neutralizing titer data from the patient prior to C19-CP administration to determine potential changes in antibody levels prior to and following administration of the first dose of C19-CP, data obtained following serial SARS-CoV-2 NAT evaluation provides uncommon insight into the temporal relationship between C19-CP and its potential impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, this is a single case, and understandable uncertainties remain. Future studies will certainly be needed to fully define the efficacy of C19-CP in this vulnerable patient population.</p>
