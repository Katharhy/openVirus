<p>Factors influencing high anti-SARS-CoV-2 titers with effective characteristics remain incompletely understood. Severe illness would be presumed to correlate with higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. However, even though neither C19-CP donor was hospitalized, donor 1 possessed higher titers than donor 2, whose titers were below the limit of detection. This variability illustrates the challenge of current C19-CP transfusion practice, making it difficult to determine the potential benefit without adequate testing prior to C19-CP transfusion in place.</p>
