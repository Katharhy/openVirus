<p>A 3.1-kg term 9-week-old female with trisomy 21 and unrepaired balanced complete atrioventricular canal defect with baseline mild to moderate common atrioventricular valve regurgitation (AVVR) presented in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to progressive decompensated heart failure. Notable findings included lymphopenia, Î²-natriuretic peptide of 530 pg/mL (reference range &lt;100 pg/mL), worsened AVVR (moderate to severe), and cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. Initial treatment, including bilevel noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, milrinone infusion, and IV diuretics, resulted in restoration of organ function. By hospital day 8, her common AVVR returned to baseline; she transitioned from milrinone to captopril, carvedilol, and IV diuretics and had weaned to high-flow nasal cannula; and she was transferred to the general cardiology floor.</p>
