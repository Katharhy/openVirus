<p>Despite completion of remdesivir, on hospital day 25, she required endotracheal intubation for worsening respiratory failure. Repeat investigation was notable for persistent lymphopenia, persistent SARS-CoV-2, CRP 7.7 mg/dL, but no evidence of new secondary infection or macrophage activation syndrome was found. Milrinone was reinitiated in addition to IV diuretics. Given her lack of response to remdesivir and deteriorating clinical status, 2 aliquots of CP (10 mL/kg per aliquot) from 2 COVID-19 recovered donors (C19-CP) were transfused in accordance with the World Health Organization guidelines for Ebola CP treatment in children

Daily surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 NAT by NP swab was performed, and the results were negative following the second aliquot from donor 1 (

The infant tolerated all transfusions without anaphylaxis, transfusion-related circulatory overload, transfusion-related acute lung injury, or hypercoagulability. The results of daily NP swabs were intermittently positive before becoming persistently negative (

The patient had an uneventful complete repair 47 days (hospital day 91) after SARS-CoV-2 infection resolution and is doing well.
