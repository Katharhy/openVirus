<p>On hospital day 12, she developed acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and decompensated heart failure, with atelectasis on chest X-ray and new rhinorrhea requiring bilevel noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. The result of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing (NAT) (DiaSorin Molecular Simplexa direct real-time PCR of viral RNA, Cypress, CA) on a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab was positive; a residual sample from a respiratory viral panel performed on hospital day 5 for intermittent desaturations was retested for SARS-CoV-2 and likewise had a positive result (

While the mother and siblings were asymptomatic, they were quarantined for 14 days after infection was identified in the patient but never tested. Nosocomial infection is certainly possible but less likely, as the hospital had very few infected patients, none of those infected were in the cardiac intensive care unit, and there was no shortage of personal protective gear at the hospital prior or following the patientâ€™s infection. Additional investigation did not reveal macrophage activation syndrome or new bacterial or viral infection. As her prolonged QTc prohibited use of hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir (5 mg/kg per day on hospital day 15 and 2.5 mg/kg per day on hospital days 16-25) was given. Her hospital course was complicated by staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, treated with nafcillin, and stage II necrotizing enterocolitis (Bell criteria), treated with piperacillin-tazobactam (

Throughout this time, she continued to have persistent lymphopenia, a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 5 mg/dL (reference range, &lt;1.0 mg/dL) with normal fibrinogen, and a common AVVR that remained unchanged with preserved biventricular function managed with IV diuretics.
