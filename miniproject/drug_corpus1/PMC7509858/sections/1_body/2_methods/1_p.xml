<p>The patient is blood group O RhD negative. Donor 1 is a 63-year-old male who donated 35 days following COVID-19 symptom resolution and is blood type A RhD positive. Donor 2 is a 56-year-old male who donated 55 days following COVID-19 symptom resolution and is blood type O RhD negative. Both had mild COVID-19 infection, and neither was hospitalized. The plasma donor units were transfused without prior characterization per emergency use. To understand the impact of C19-CP treatment, both donor units were tested for titers of IgG against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Emory University and Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA), which has been shown to correlate with neutralizing titers,

 </sup> Donor 1 had an immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer of 1:12 724 and neutralizing titer of 1:126. Donor 2 had an IgG titer of 1:816 and a neutralizing titer of &lt;1:50 (
