  <p>mRNA vaccine-mediated antigen presentation via MHC-I and MHC-II pathways. When an mRNA vaccine is taken by APCs, the antigenic proteins are translated in these cells. These proteins become endogenous proteins and are degraded by the proteasome into small peptides. The peptides are transported to the endoplasmic reticulum and loaded onto MHC-I molecules, and then activate CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cells through the MHC-I pathway. In the endoplasmic reticulum, MHC-II molecules are protected by an invariant chain (Ii) to prevent them from binding to endogenous peptides. The MHC-II-Ii complex is exported to the fusion vesicle through the Golgi apparatus, and then the invariant chain is replaced by exogenous antigenic peptides. When the vaccine is taken by non-APC cells, it will express and secreted antigenic proteins. These exogenous proteins enter APCs through endocytosis and activate CD4
   <sup>+</sup> T cells through the MHC-II pathway.
