  <p>Immune response to an Ad vector vaccine. When the Ad vector vaccine infects non-APCs, the infected cells express and secrete antigenic proteins, which are taken by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and B cells. The antigenic proteins are degraded into antigenic peptides. APCs present exogenous antigenic peptides to CD4
   <sup>+</sup> T cells through MHC-II. Cytokines produced by activated CD4
   <sup>+</sup> T cells contribute to the activation of CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cells. B cells present antigenic peptides to follicular T helper cells through MHC-II, thereby promoting further B cell differentiation into long-lived antibody-producing plasma cells. When the Ad vector vaccine infects APCs, the vaccine expresses the antigen protein which is subsequently digested into antigenic peptides. The antigenic peptides are then presented to CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cells through MHC-I. In this way, both T cell subsets are activated.
