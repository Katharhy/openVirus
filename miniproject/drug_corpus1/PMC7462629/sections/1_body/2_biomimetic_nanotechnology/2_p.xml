<p id="para0017">Although conventional viral vaccines have delivered considerable success, their ability to generate strong antiviral responses is limited and great challenges remain in achieving effective responses to sudden epidemics. Further, traditional vaccine preparation methods cannot produce vaccines against viruses with high antigen diversity and mutation rates, thereby limiting the development of vaccines. To address these obstacles with conventional vaccines, many researchers have turned to nanotechnology to design and produce nanoparticle vaccines with good effectiveness, specificity and long-lasting antiviral response. Taking the VLP vaccine as an example, highly conserved antigens shared by different virus subtypes can be inserted into VLPs as potent antigenic proteins
