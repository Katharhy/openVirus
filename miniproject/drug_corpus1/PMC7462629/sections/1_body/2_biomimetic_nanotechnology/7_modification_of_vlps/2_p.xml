<p id="para0027">Researchers are attempting to modify the surface of VLPs with small molecules or chemical groups to protect the “cargo” from the negative effects of enzymes or serum proteins and increase the targeting accuracy 
 <xref rid="bib0121" ref-type="bibr">[121]</xref>. This approach has been evaluated in tumor therapy. However, the necessity of surface modification to VLP-based vaccines remains controversial. VLPs have a unique repetitive surface structure that is easily recognized by the innate immune system. This structure is the basis of VLPs’ strong immunogenicity because it induces the opsonization of antigen-presenting cells 
 <xref rid="bib0121" ref-type="bibr">[121]</xref>. Moreover, this structure promotes B-cell activation, resulting in a stronger humoral immune response, as well as enhanced T-cell stimulation and cellular mediated immunity 
 <xref rid="bib0122" ref-type="bibr">[122]</xref>. Therefore, it may be unnecessary to increase the uptake of VLPs by modifying the surface of VLPs.
