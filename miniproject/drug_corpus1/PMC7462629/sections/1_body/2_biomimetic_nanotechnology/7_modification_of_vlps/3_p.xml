 <xref rid="bib0123" ref-type="bibr">[123]</xref>. Cytidine monophosphate guanosine oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG or CpG ODN) are a class of DNA analog composed of unmethylated cytosine. As a robust adjuvant, CpG-ODN binds to TLR9 to trigger the maturation of antigen presenting cells, resulting in the promotion of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses, as well as B cell activation and proliferation. Consequently, both T cell response and antibody production are conferred to provide comprehensive protection of immunized individuals from virus infection
