 <sup>+</sup> T cells can be detected in the body for up to 6 years and exert a strong antiviral effect on various subtypes of viruses [
 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Live-attenuated vaccines are capable of inducing the formation of memory T cells. However, the potential risk of restoration of virulence hampers the application of conventional coronavirus vaccines in clinical trials. Therefore, non-live virus vaccines that robustly induce memory T cells are in great demand.
