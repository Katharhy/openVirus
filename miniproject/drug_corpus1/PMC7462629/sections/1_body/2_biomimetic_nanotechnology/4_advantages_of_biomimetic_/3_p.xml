<p id="para0020">As next-generation medical agents, biomimetic nanoparticles simulate the physiochemical nature of the pathogens while retaining the surface features of nanoparticles 
 <xref rid="bib0078" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. Biomimetic nanoparticle vaccines usually consist of three elements: viral antigen molecules, adjuvants and a protein scaffold. The viral antigens induce the adaptive immune response, and the adjuvants enhance innate immune response

 <xref rid="bib0084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>. This vaccine type is safer and more effective than conventional vaccines. Biomimetic nanoparticle delivery not only protects the adjuvant from degradation but also protects the body from systemic toxicity caused by free adjuvants, which may cause side effects such as fever, drowsiness, diarrhea, and nausea 
 <xref rid="bib0086" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>. Current biomimetic nanoparticles available for vaccine preparation include virosomes, VLPs, self-assembling protein nanoparticles and synthetic nanoparticles, with sizes ranging from 10 to 200 nm [
 <xref rid="bib0076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. VLPs are the most frequently used biomimetic nanoparticles in vaccine preparation. VLPs carry both antigens and adjuvants 
 <xref rid="bib0088" ref-type="bibr">[88]</xref>, and prime immune cells to induce immune responses after vaccination.
