<p id="para0018">Biomimetic nanoparticle technology, a novel type of nanotechnology, is a rapidly developing field that has undergone tremendous advances in the last decade. Taking advantage of the specific delivery and translocation mechanisms adopted by pathogens, bioinspired nanoparticles have been produced with diverse functions, good biocompatibility, extended circulation time and enhanced accumulation at the infection sites 
 <xref rid="bib0076" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. Biomimetic nanoparticles have unique antigenic characteristics and immunostimulatory properties and have been used to design more effective vaccine formulations. This strategy directly uses the principles of natural design to manufacture multifunctional and multi-antigen nanosystems that may play an important role in the future [
