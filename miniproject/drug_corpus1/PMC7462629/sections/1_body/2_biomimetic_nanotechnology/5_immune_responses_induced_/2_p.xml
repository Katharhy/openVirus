<p id="para0021">VLP vaccines are capable of conferring humoral immune responses and triggering the production of neutralizing antibodies (
 <xref rid="fig0003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> ). B cells specifically bind to the antigens carried by VLPs through B cell receptors (BCRs) and internalize VLPs. The recognition and internalization of VLP vaccines provide signals for B cell activation. Consequently, activated B cells initially differentiate into plasmablasts and ultimately into plasma cells to produce antibodies
