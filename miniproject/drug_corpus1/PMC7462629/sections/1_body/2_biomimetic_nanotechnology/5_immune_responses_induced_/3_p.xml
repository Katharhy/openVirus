 <xref rid="fig0003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) is critical to successfully trigger cellular the immune response induced by a vaccine. DC maturation requires both antigen presentation and co-stimulatory molecules. Antigens are engulfed and processed by DCs, subsequently, the antigenic peptide binds to MHC molecules and is presented on the surface of DCs. T cells will be activated by recognizing the antigenic peptides presented by MHC molecules, as well as by binding to c molecules on DCs. The adjuvants in biomimetic nanoparticle vaccines act as costimulatory molecules, whereas viral proteins provide antigens. These interactions between VLP vaccines and DCs induce maturation of DCs and the subsequent T cell activation [

 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Activated Th cells induce cytokines to promote antiviral immunity and to upregulate the expression of costimulatory molecules for B cell activation and differentiation into plasma cells. CTLs inhibit virus replication by lysing infected cells to release the virus and neutralizing antibodies to destroy the virus.
