<p id="para0024">VLPs are the noninfectious protein shells or capsids conjugated with virus-derived structural proteins that are modified to be of use in nanotechnology. The structure of VLPs is similar to natural viruses but has no viral genome. VLPs are strongly immunogenic and biologically active 
 <xref rid="bib0096" ref-type="bibr">[96]</xref>, capable of inducing both cellular and humoral immune reactions [
 <xref rid="bib0097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. VLPsâ€™ sizes range from 20 to 100 nm 
 <xref rid="bib0099" ref-type="bibr">[99]</xref>. In comparison with conventional virus vaccines such as inactive or live-attenuated vaccines, VLPs are much safer and can be more easily produced at a lower cost. VLPs have more diverse immunogenicity than subunit vaccines and nucleic acid vaccines [
