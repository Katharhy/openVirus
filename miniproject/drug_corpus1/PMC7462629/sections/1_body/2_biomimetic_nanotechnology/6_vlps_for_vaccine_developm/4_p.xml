<p id="para0026">VLPs vaccines are considered to be a powerful candidate for the prevention of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. VLP-based coronavirus vaccines have previously been developed using a variety of antigen combinations or expression systems. These vaccines are reported to inhibit coronavirus infections and are thus promising or future clinical applications

A research team uses its proprietary recombinant protein nanoparticle technology platform to develop a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate containing the coronavirus S protein. They recommend utilizing its proprietary Matrix-Mâ„¢ adjuvant to enhance immune responses during the vaccination with the vaccine. It is expected to advance the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate to Phase I clinical testing in May or June
