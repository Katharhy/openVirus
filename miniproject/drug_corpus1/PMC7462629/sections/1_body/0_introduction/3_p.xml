<p id="para0003">Coronavirus is a type of single-stranded RNA virus that contains four main structural proteins including a phosphorylated nucleocapsid (N) protein, two types of spike (S) proteins, a membrane (M) protein, and an envelope (E) protein 
 <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. SARS-CoV-2 S proteins bind to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter human cells [

 <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A recent study revealed the high-resolution structure of SARS-CoV-2 S proteins 
 <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, and has therefore provided valuable clues for the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and therapies. Owing to the similarities of the structure of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV as well as common symptoms of the patients infected with these viruses, studies on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may support future studies on SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Researchers have proposed several SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccine candidates including inactivated vaccines, live-attenuated vaccines, and viral-vector vaccines, etc. 
 <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> (
 <xref rid="tbl0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ). Importantly, emerging genetic engineering methods and nanotechnology have revolutionized vaccine development. Biomimetic nanoparticle-based vaccines have become attractive, alternative strategies for the prevention of diseases. We analyzed conventional coronavirus vaccines against COVID-19, and have discussed the possible application of biomimetic nanoparticles such as VLPs in the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
