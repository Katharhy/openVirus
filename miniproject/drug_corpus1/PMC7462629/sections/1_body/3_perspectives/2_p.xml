<p id="para0029">We have proposed a promising strategy for the development of a novel SARS-CoV-2 vaccine: biosynthetic SARS-CoV-2 VLPs combined with CpG (termed CpG-VLP SARS-CoV-2 vaccine). Most vaccines consist of antigens and immune adjuvants, it is the spatial colocalization of these two components that ensures a prompt immune response against the antigen of interest 
 <xref rid="bib0132" ref-type="bibr">[132]</xref>. VLP-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may show advantages in the induction of persistent immune reactions for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the face of a rapidly emerging epidemic, reduction of vaccine development time and costs is important. Existing vaccine technology cannot quickly respond to new virus outbreaks; thus, further developments are required to address practicality at the industrial scale. VLP platform technology has the potential to address the rapid spread of emerging viruses.
