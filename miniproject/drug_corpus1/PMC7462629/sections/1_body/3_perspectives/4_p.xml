<p id="para0031">The clinical transformation of vaccines depends on the mature vaccine production process to ensure a stable and reliable vaccine supply and to expand vaccine production in a safe, effective, and cost-effective manner. As a non-infectious universal vaccine platform, VLPs are easy to standardize in the production process of vaccines and to minimize the unstable factors in the production process to achieve the rapid production of safe and cheap vaccines. Regulatory agencies manage each stage of vaccine production to ensure high-quality and consistent products. In the future, mechanistic studies should be conducted to examine the biological mechanism and the

There is still a need to explore better-optimized expression systems and purification methods to actualize high-throughput production. Standardized work processes also need to be consistent with good manufacturing practices to meet the quality requirements approved by regulatory authorities. Simultaneously, VLP characterization is a key step to ensure the stability and effectiveness of VLP vaccines. The development of rapid analysis methods that can support the analysis of a large number of VLPs will help more effective vaccine development.
