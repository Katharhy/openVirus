<p id="para0007">Live-attenuated vaccines are created by weakening infectious organisms that can still replicate and induce protective immune responses, but do not cause disease in the host. The live-attenuated vaccine against coronavirus may be generated by depleting or mutating virulent genes in the viral genome. These live-attenuated vaccines diminish virulence while maintaining immunogenicity. Live-attenuated vaccines are good at driving both innate and adaptive immunity with long-term immunological memory. Furthermore, these vaccines can be produced quickly and at a low cost, thus, they are ideal for responding to coronavirus outbreaks
