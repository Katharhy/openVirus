<p id="para0012">A subunit vaccine is a vaccine produced from selected viral antigenic protein subunits. Thus, this type of vaccine has a lower risk of adverse reactions compared with a whole virus vaccine. Subunit vaccines for the S protein fragment of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been reported previously [
 <xref rid="bib0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. However, the MERS-CoV S protein likely contains non-neutralizing epitopes, which may hinder the production of neutralizing antibodies and the anti-MERS-CoV immune responses. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the critical neutralizing epitopes in the MERS-CoV S protein and exclude non-neutralizing epitopes without the expense of domain integrity and stability in the design of the subunit vaccine for inducing the host immune response

Currently, the neutralizing epitopes and functional mechanisms of monoclonal antibodies including 4C2, 2E6, 7D10, D12, m336, MCA1, MERS-27, JC57-14, CDC-C2, MERS-4, and MERS-GD27 were elucidated at the atomic level by structural and functional studies

 <xref rid="bib0057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>. These antibodies target the receptor-binding subdomain of MERS-CoV and overlap with the DPP4 binding surface. These studies are the basis for the development of subunit vaccines.
