 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. On April 12, 2020, the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine developed in Wuhan, China was approved for clinical trials, it is the world's first inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to enter clinical trials 
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is currently in Phase II clinical trials.
