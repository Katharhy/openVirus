<p id="para0005">Inactivated vaccines are viral particles killed by irradiation or chemicals. Their production is relatively easy, and they induce a robust immune response owing to the multiple epitopes on the viral surface

 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Studies have shown that SARS-CoV N protein vaccination enhances the immunopathological changes in the lungs. SARS-CoV N protein-specific T cells and Th2-skewed cytokine profile may be the cause of adverse reactions [

 <xref rid="bib0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Therefore, it is necessary to find methods to enhance the protective S-specific immune response while minimizing the potentially pathological anti-N response. We should keep in mind that the side effects of inactivated vaccines must be intensively evaluated before clinical application. Furthermore, most research on coronavirus must be performed cautiously in biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) laboratories, which has hindered the development of coronavirus vaccines.
