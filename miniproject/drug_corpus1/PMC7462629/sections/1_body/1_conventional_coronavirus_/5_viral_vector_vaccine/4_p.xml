<p id="para0010">However, adenovirus infection induces a strong innate and adaptive immune response and establishes long-term immune memory. Ad5 is a common human serotype and has a high infection rate, as such, anti-Ad5 antibodies may already be present in the human body, especially in individuals in developing countries

 <xref rid="bib0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>. Thus, the immunogenicity and clinical utility of the Ad5 vector vaccine is limited. Research has shown that a homologous priming-boosting regimen with an Ad-5-type vaccine at 6-month intervals was able to elicit strong antibody responses with a longer duration 
 <xref rid="bib0049" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. The results supported the use of an immunization strategy to implement a booster injection to effectively overcome the effect of pre-existing immunization on vaccine efficacy. This indicated that the clinical trial of Ad5-nCoV may also require a strategy that uses a booster injection.
