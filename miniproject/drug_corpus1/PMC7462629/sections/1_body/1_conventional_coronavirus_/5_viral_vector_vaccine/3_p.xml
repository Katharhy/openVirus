<p id="para0009">Adenovirus vectors are the most commonly used vectors in clinical trials 
 <xref rid="bib0041" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. They are widely used in gene therapy, vaccination and other fields. It is one of the best candidates for vaccine development, mainly owing to its low pathogenicity, genetic safety, lack of host genome integration steps in its replication cycle, and induction of strong humoral and cellular immune responses. Adenovirus type-5 (Ad5) vector is the most commonly used vector. Ad5 vector vaccines against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and Ebola virus have been investigated in Phase II clinical trials to verify their safety and effectiveness [
