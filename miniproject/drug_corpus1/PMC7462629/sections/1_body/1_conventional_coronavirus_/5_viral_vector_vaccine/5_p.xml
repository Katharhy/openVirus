<p id="para0011">Existing immunity to Ad5 in humans is highly prevalent, consequently, this has led to the development of vectors derived from rare Ad serotypes. Ad26 vectors have been proven to have the highest immunogenicity of the rare serotype Ad vectors studied, which has shown the potential of the Ad26 as a vaccine vector in developing countries 
 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Another company has developed a vaccine based on Ad26 vector, the company expects to initiate human clinical studies of its lead vaccine candidate by September 2020 at the latest and anticipates the first batches of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine could be available for emergency use authorization in early 2021 
 <xref rid="bib0051" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. The company's research strategy is promising.
