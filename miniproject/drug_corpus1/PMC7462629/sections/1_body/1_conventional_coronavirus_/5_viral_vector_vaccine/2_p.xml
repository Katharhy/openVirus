<p id="para0008">Viral vector vaccines use live recombinant viruses to deliver DNA into human cells. The DNA sequences loaded into the viral vector vaccines encode one or more antigens. After these vector vaccines infect cells, the antigen protein is expressed in the cells, and the antigen is processed to activate the subsequent immune response (
 <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> ). Several viral vectors have been used to construct coronavirus vaccines, including measles virus, vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), and recombinant adenovirus vectors (ADVs). The genes encoding the N protein and the S protein have been loaded into the viral vectors to trigger anti-coronavirus immunity in the host [
