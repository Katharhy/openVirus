<p id="para0013">Nucleic acid vaccines include DNA vaccines and mRNA vaccines. After nucleic acid vaccines are inoculated into the cells, the antigenic proteins encoded by the vaccines are expressed on the cells, and the immune system in the host stimulates specific immune reactions

 <xref rid="bib0062" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Application of a DNA vaccine encoding the MERS virus S protein is successful in Phase I clinical trial. Vaccine-induced humoral and cellular responses have been detected in the trial [

Consequently, nucleic acid vaccines may be ideal for the fast, inexpensive and large-scale preparation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. The DNA vaccine platform was one of the first technologies to receive support from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) to accelerate SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development. The SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate (INO-4800) is in Phase I/II clinical trials in South Korea and the United States
