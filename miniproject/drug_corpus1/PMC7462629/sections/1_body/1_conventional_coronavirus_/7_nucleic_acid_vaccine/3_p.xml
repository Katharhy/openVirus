<p id="para0014">Over the past decade, significant technological innovations and research investments have made mRNA a promising therapeutic tool in the field of vaccine development and protein replacement therapy 
 <xref rid="bib0066" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. mRNA is the intermediate molecule between DNA and proteins. The mRNA vaccine aims to deliver antigen-encoding mRNA into the ribosome to produce viral antigens 
 <xref rid="bib0067" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. The mRNA vaccine is taken by different types of cells and activates the immune system through the MHC-Ⅰ pathway and the MHC-Ⅱ pathway after vaccination (
 <xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> ). When the mRNA vaccine is taken by APCs, APCs processes and express the target protein as an endogenous antigen, and then activates CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells through the MHC-Ⅰ pathway. When the mRNA vaccine is taken by non-APCs, the cells translate and secrete the target protein which is then taken by APC. The APCs subsequently activate CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells through the MHC-Ⅱ pathway. Exogenous antigens can also be processed and loaded onto MHC-Ⅰ molecules through cross-presentation 
 <xref rid="bib0068" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. mRNA-based vaccines are a promising new platform that is highly versatile, safe, effective, simplified, scalable and cheap, has the potential to be free of cold chains [

 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Importantly, mRNA-based vaccines can meet the requirement for rapid and large amounts of effective vaccines against emerging pandemic infectious diseases 
 <xref rid="bib0067" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. This multi-functional RNA vaccine platform can increase the speed and cost of vaccine development and quickly produce effective vaccines for new epidemics 
 <xref rid="bib0071" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. By optimizing the mRNA manufacturing platform and the design of intracellular delivery methods, the clinical transformation of mRNA therapy has been improved
