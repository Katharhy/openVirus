<p id="Par44">The expression of both ERα and ERβ has been identified in human immune cells, including B and T lymphocytes, mast cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, monocytes, and natural killer cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. The expression of ERs have been shown to be cell specific as ERα was found to be the predominant form in CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, and ERβ was the predominant form in B cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Sex- and age-specific expression of ERα has been identified in human monocytes with higher expression in post-menopausal females and males than pre-menopausal females [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. However, sex-dependent ER expression was not observed in B cells and T cells. Since there was no difference in ER expression in male and female T and B cells, the authors argued that the sex differences in immune response may not be a direct effect of estrogen but could be indirect through gonadotropin-releasing hormone [
