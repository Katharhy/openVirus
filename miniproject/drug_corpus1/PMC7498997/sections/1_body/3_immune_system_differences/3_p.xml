<p id="Par36">Females show higher antibody response to vaccines, and consequently, vaccine efficacy is high in females [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. For instance, the protective antibody responses against the measles vaccine were twice as high in females compared to males of 11–22 years of age [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Although females respond better to vaccination, they also show higher adverse reactions including pain, fever, and inflammation to vaccines [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. This sex-specific differences in immune response in this early stage could be due to differences in immune cell types as young males are known to have a higher percentage of natural killer cells while females have higher CD3 and CD4 cell counts [
