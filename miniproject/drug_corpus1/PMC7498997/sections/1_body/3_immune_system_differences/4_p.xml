<p id="Par37">Sex chromosome constitution could also play an important role in disease outcome. Females have two copies of X chromosomes while males have one. The X chromosome contains a high density of immune-related genes. Numerous genes that are present on X chromosome include pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as 
 <italic>toll-like receptor 7</italic> (
 <italic>TLR7</italic>), 
 <italic>TLR8</italic>, and interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase 1 (
 <italic>IRAK1</italic>). Other genes include CXCR3, NFκB essential modulator (NEMO), GATA1, FOXP3, IL-2R γ chain, IL-3R α chain, and IL-13 α chain [

TLRs can bind to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 have been shown to provide protection against virus by recognizing viral RNA and DNA while TLR2 and TLR4 provide protection against bacteria by recognizing the PAMPs on cell wall [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. This gene diversity in males and females may be one of the factors for modulating sex differences in immune responses to pathogens.
