<p id="Par41">In the case of SARS-CoV and MERS, increased level of proinflammatory cytokines was observed. Cytokines including IL-1B, IL-6, IL-12, IFNγ, putative internal head protein 10 (IP10), and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) were increased in SARS-CoV patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] while IFNγ, TNFα, IL-15, and IL-17 were increased in MERS patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. The immunopathology of COVID-19 is not fully understood, and most of the knowledge is based on SARS-CoV and MERS. Analysis of COVID-19 patients revealed that IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, granulocyte stimulating factor, interferon γ inducible protein 10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α, and tumor necrosis factor α were increased [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Among these immune system modulators, IL-6 and IL-10 showed a positive correlation with mild COVID-19 group while IL-6 showed a good correlation with severe cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Hence, blocking IL-6 activity to reduce COVID-19 severity has been proposed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>] and clinical trials are ongoing to analyze the efficacy of therapeutic antibodies against IL-6 (siltuximab) or IL-6 receptor (tocilizumab and sarilumab) [
