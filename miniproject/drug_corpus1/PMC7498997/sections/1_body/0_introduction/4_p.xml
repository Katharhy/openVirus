<p id="Par22">To date, there is no specific therapy to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Different drugs that were designed for other diseases including HIV, Ebola, and malaria have been tested to treat COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The lack of vaccines and other specific drugs against COVID-19 has contributed to the high mortality. As of July 28, 2020, according to John Hopkins University database, 188 countries have shown infections; 16,481,230 confirmed cases and 654,052 mortality have been recorded. Interestingly, COVID-19 has shown clear sex-specific mortality with higher death rate in males compared with females (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). An analysis of COVID-19 data from the other 29 countries that were not included in this study also showed male-biased mortality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections differed across the age groups between males and females. While females in the age group 10 to 50 years showed higher incidence, males before 10 and after 50 years were more susceptible [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Analysis of viral RNA in COVID-19 patients indicated that the males show delayed viral clearance as the SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected for a longer time in males compared with females [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, there is no clear understanding of why males are showing higher mortality compared with females. Hence, this review will highlight different theories/sex differences to understand the COVID-19 male-biased death rate. Understanding of sex differences could further help in understanding the disease outcome and therapeutics for COVID-19 and other new emerging diseases.
