<p id="Par50">In another study, coronavirus genetic material was detected in the semen samples of males infected with coronavirus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. Analysis of RNA sequencing data obtained from the NCBI database [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>] showed that both 
 <italic>ACE2</italic> and 
 <italic>TMPRSS2</italic> were highly expressed in the testis compared to the ovary (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). This supports the observation that the coronavirus may enter the human testis. The sex hormones in males were also altered following infection with SARS-CoV-2. Analysis of 81 infected men with SARS-CoV-2 showed increased luteinizing hormone (LH), but the ratio of testosterone to LH and follicle stimulating hormone to LH was decreased [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. Although coronavirus RNA was detected in semen samples, active viral particles have not been isolated from testis so far. Hence, the theory of involvement of testis in delayed viral clearance and high mortality in men [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] should be taken with caution.
