<p id="Par24">The S2 domain contains fusion peptide (FP) and heptad repeat (HR) 1 and 2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Following binding of RBD to ACE2, the S2 domain undergoes conformational changes to facilitate membrane fusion and these events facilitate virus entry into target cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The importance of S protein, especially the RBD region, makes it a potential target for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and antibody-based drug development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].
