<p id="Par28">In patients with heart diseases, the level of plasma ACE2 is high [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] but unable to provide protection against COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This suggests that ACE2 is important for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry but that its expression levels do not correlate with the degree of infection and viral load [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The equilibrium between soluble and membrane-bound ACE2 should also be analyzed as it might influence the COVID-19 pathogenesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].
