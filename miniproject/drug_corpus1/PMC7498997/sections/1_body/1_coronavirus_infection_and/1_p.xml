<p id="Par23">Coronaviruses are pleomorphic, enveloped, single positive stranded RNA virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The viral membrane contains transmembrane (M) glycoprotein, spike (S) glycoprotein, and envelope (E) protein [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The spike protein forms the coronal fringe around the virus, and it facilitates viral entry into human cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The S protein contains the S1 and S2 subunits where the S1 domain is linked to receptor binding and the S2 domain is required for cell membrane fusion. The S1 subunit of the S protein contains the N-terminal domain (NTD) and a receptor binding domain (RBD) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The RBD binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and uses it as the entry receptor [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Apart from ACE2, the human serine protease, transmembrane protease/serine subfamily member 2 (TMPRSS2), is also critical for virus entry into the host cell as it is involved in S protein priming [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Serine proteases on the surface of target cell cleave the S protein at the S1/S2, S2 cleavage site, and given its important role in viral entry, TMPRSS2 is considered a potential therapeutic target to control coronavirus infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. TMPRSS2 inhibitors including nafamostat and camostat are undergoing clinical trials to determine their efficacy against COVID-19 [
