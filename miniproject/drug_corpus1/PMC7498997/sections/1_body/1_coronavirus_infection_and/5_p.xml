<p id="Par27">Different ACE2 variants are reported that show sex-specific expression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Since ACE2 is an X chromosome encoded gene, the presence of disease or risk variants in men will be more detrimental [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. It is suggested that the missense ACE2 variants could influence binding with spike proteins and this, in turn, will affect the progression of COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, in another study, the analysis of ACE2 variants in an Italian population indicated that there was no association with COVID-19 severity and sex-biased mortality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. A wider analysis of data from different countries may further help to know whether ACE2 variants can affect the COVID-19 pathogenesis.
