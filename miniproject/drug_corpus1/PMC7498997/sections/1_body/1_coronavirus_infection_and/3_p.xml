<p id="Par25">Analysis of RBD region of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 sequence using CLUSTLW showed that there is only 46.5% homology (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Despite the low sequence homology, the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 was found to be higher than SARS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Different research groups, using protein-protein interaction studies, have identified the binding mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD to human ACE2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Nine residues (L455, F456, S459, Q474, A475, F486, F490, Q493, and P499) critical for RBD affinity to ACE2 have been identified [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. When these nine residues were mutated and changed to those of the SARS-CoV sequence, reduced binding affinity was observed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Out of these nine residues, six residues (L455, F456, A475, F486, F490, Q493) were also shown to be important by other groups [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Apart from these nine residues, another 12 residues (L417, G446, Y449, y453, N487, Y489, G496, Q498, T500, N501, G502, Y505) have been identified to be important for RBD contact with ACE2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. These studies show that the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 binding mechanisms to the ACE2 receptor are similar. When the RBD from either SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 was injected in mice, a strong clade-specific neutralizing antibody production was initiated. However, a weak cross-neutralizing activity was observed, which suggested that the RBDs of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have unique antigenic features [
