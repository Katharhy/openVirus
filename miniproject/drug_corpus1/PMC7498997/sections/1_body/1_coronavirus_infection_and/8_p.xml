<p id="Par30">Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is being considered as a therapy to control SARS-CoV-2 infection. The idea is to use the soluble rhACE2 as a decoy receptor to bind SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the viral load and infection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], but clinical trials for rhACE2 showed fast clearance rates [

The pharmacological problems with rhACE2 have led to another novel approach where immunoglobulin is combined with rhACE2 (extracellular domain) to generate a fusion protein. This approach has shown promising pharmacological properties in animal models and suggested to be a good system for diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 [
