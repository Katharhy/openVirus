  <p>Differential expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. The RNA sequencing data was obtained from the NCBI database (Bioproject, PRJEB4337) submitted by a previous study [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. The raw reads were aligned to the human genome, and differential gene expression was determined using Partek Flow Software. The parameters were as follows: 
   <italic>p</italic> value 0.05, false discovery rate 0.05, and fold change Â± 2
