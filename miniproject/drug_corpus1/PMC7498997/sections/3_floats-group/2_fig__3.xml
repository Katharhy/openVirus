  <p>Spike protein of coronavirus. The schematic diagram shows the coronavirus structure (
   <bold>a</bold>). The spike protein (S) has S1 and S2 domains. The S protein has receptor binding domain (RBD) and the receptor binding motif (RBM) and within RBD binds ACE2. S1/S2 and S2â€²cleavage sites are acted by protease to assist viral fusion. RBM sequence between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 showed 46.5% identity, and the nine residues that increase RBM affinity to ACE2 are indicated in red (
   <bold>b</bold>). NTD, N-terminal domain; RBD, receptor binding domain; RBM, receptor binding motif; FP, fusion protein; HR1, heptad repeat 1; HR2, heptad repeat 2; TM, transmembrane domain; CT, cytoplasmic tail
