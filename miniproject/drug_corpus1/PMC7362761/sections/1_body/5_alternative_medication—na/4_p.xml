<p>On the basis of these observations, other specific triterpenoids have also been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, especially secoiridoid and its glycosides from 
 <italic>G. scabra</italic> extract (
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>). Two other specific polysaccharide-containing fractions from 
 <italic>D. polystachya</italic> tuber extracts were reported to remarkably increase the GM-CSF promoter activity in improving the regeneration of bone marrow cells, and exerted anti-inflammatory effects through the inhibition of NF-κB-mediated iNOS and COX-2 expressions (
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>–
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>). The inflammatory pathways involving COX-2 may correlate with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and other antiviral activities (

 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>). Similarly, emodin, a trihydroxyanthraquinone obtained from rhubarb, buckthorn, and Japanese knotweed, exhibited antiviral activity against SARS-CoV. It inhibited the viral entry into host cells by binding with the spike proteins and interfering with the SARS-CoV-23CL protease activity (
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>). Likewise, luteolin and quercetin could also interfere with the viral entry to its host cells (
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>). Furthermore, tetra-
 <italic>O</italic>-galloyl-β-d-glucose (TGG) and luteolin showed anti-SARS-CoV-2activities; TGG exhibited prominent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 4.5 μM. These reports suggest that specific glycosylated flavonoids may play an effective role in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2replication activity. In summary, natural small molecules may be excellent opportunities for further optimization and potential clinical use against SARS-CoV, especially targeting 3CL protease. Additionally, traditional and alternative medicine may be explored for future drug development processes (
 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>). A recent review highlighted that a good number of medicinal plants and their herb-derived constituents have shown potential anti-SARS-CoV activity (non-clinical and pre-clinical study). Such agents are not only important to combat SARS-CoVs, but also play an important role in preventing viral attacks. However, there is a lack of adequate research on the development of anti-nCoV-19 agents from such natural products (
