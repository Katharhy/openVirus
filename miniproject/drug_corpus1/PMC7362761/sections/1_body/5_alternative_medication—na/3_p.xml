<p>Along this line, an in-depth study evaluated more than 200 herbal extracts from TCM for antiviral potentials against SARS-CoV-2 on Vero E6 using a cell-based assay cytopathogenic effect (
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>). Among these, six herbal extracts of plants and plant parts 
 <italic>Gentiana scabra</italic> Bunge (the dried rhizome), 
 <italic>Dioscorea polystachya</italic> Turcz. (the tuber), 
 <italic>Senna tora</italic> (L.) Roxb. (the dried seed), 
 <italic>Taxillus chinensis</italic> (DC.) Danser (the dried stem with leaf), and 
 <italic>Cibotium barometz</italic> (L.) J.Sm. (the dried rhizome) were found to be potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations ranging between 25 and 200 μg/mL. Similarly, two extracts of 
 <italic>C. barometz</italic> also showed notable inhibition of SARS-CoV-23CL protease activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 39 and 44 μg/mL, respectively (
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>). These herbal extracts inhibited replication and 3CL protease activity of SARS-CoV, thus suggesting that such specific herbal extracts may be potentially utilized as drug targets for future antiviral drug development against SARS-CoV. 
 <italic>G. scabra</italic> was also reported for its hepatoprotective effect because of the triterpenoids of secoiridoid and its glycosides (
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>) which adds to liver-protection during hepatic failure due to viral proliferation.
