<p>Drug development, together with vaccine development and epidemiological research into viral infection, is an essential element in understanding and controlling SARS-COV-2. Interim results of clinical trials will be published in the coming months, and patients will be able to benefit from final results and approvals in the coming months, with the support of the relevant authorities. In addition to studying therapeutic molecules in this emerging infection, an important step in the management of SARS-COV-2 is the approval of possible treatments.
