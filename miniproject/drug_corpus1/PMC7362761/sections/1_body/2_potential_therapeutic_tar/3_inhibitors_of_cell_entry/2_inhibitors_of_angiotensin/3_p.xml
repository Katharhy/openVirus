<p>Chloroquine [(N4-(7-Chloro-4-quinolinyl)-N1,N1-diethyl-1,4-pentanediamine)], a conventional drug for the treatment of malaria, has been applied in several studies against CoVs. In an early report, chloroquine was found to be effective in preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Chloroquine was assumed to elevate endosomal pH and to interfere with terminal glycosylation of the ACE2 receptor (

 <sub>50</sub> effective concentration of 0.306 μM and an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 419 μM (
