 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). First, drugs can change the pH of the surface of the cell membrane and thus inhibit the fusion of the virus with the cell membrane. Besides, they can also inhibit nucleic acid replication, glycosylation of viral proteins, virus assembly, transport of new virus particles, and release of the virus from the infected cell (
