<p>Another way to act on the viral receptor is with the help of recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2), a molecule studied in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), due to the high level of ACE2 in the lung. The study aims to study the effects of rhACE2 in patients with COVID-19, which could be beneficial both by lowering viremia (due to limited binding to the ECA2 receptor) and by protecting the lung from ARDS, which is one of the complications of COVID-19 with frequent fatal consequences (
