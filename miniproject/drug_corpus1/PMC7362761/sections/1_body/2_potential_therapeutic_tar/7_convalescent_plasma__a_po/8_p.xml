<p>Several countries, such as the United States (

 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>), have announced initiatives to treat patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The priority sampling procedure is plasmapheresis, but whole blood sampling can also be used, with subsequent separation of the plasma from it. Plasma is tested for HIV, HBV, HCV, and anti-HLA antibodies (in some donors), and administered to patients with severe forms of COVID-19 hospitalized in ATI, with rapid disease progression of&gt; 50% in 24â€“48 h (with lung damage, mechanically ventilated or requiring mechanical ventilation soon, due to dyspnea, tachypnea, and low oxygen saturation).
