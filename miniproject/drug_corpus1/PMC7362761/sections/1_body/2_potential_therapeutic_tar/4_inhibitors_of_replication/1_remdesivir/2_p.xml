<p>Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized the use of remdesivir in infections with SARS-CoV-2, through the Special Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). This approval allows physicians to administer remdesivir to patients with a suspected or confirmed severe form of the infection (those who have blood oxygen saturation SpO2 â‰¤ 94%, require oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane-ECO oxygenation/ECMO), even outside of clinical trials. However, EUA is not a complete approval, as further studies are needed to confirm the effectiveness of this treatment.</p>
