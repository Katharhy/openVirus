<p>The SIMPLE study, organized by Gilead (the company that produces remdesivir) was a phase III trial without a control group in which patients received a remdesivir treatment for 5 or 10 days. Results showed that clinical improvement was similar in the two groups. Half of the patients showed an improvement in the disease in the first 10 days, in the case of 5-day treatment, and in the first 11 days with the 10-day treatment; after 14 days, 60% of patients receiving remdesivir for 5 days were discharged, and 52.3% of those receiving 10 days were discharged (
