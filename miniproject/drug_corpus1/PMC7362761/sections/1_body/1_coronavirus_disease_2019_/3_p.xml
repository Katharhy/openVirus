<p>SARS-COV-2 may be manifested as an asymptomatic infection or mild to severe pneumonia (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). COVID-19 patients may experience abnormal respiratory findings, higher leukocyte numbers, and increased levels of plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines. It may also cause leucopenia, increased C-reactive protein, a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines [i.e., IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1α, and TNFα; (
