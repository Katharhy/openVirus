<p>As there is a huge volume of therapeutic approaches for COVID-19, we may not cover all available therapeutic approaches. In addition, research results are dynamic and change as new evidence emerges. Second, only data based on the adult population and not the pediatric population were included in this review. Third, only articles/publications/translations from English were analyzed so some relevant international data might be missing.</p>
