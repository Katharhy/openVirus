<p>Kentucky Bioprocessing (KBP) is developing a possible vaccine for COVID-19, currently in the pre-clinical testing phase (
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>). The developing vaccine uses a BAT technology for rapid growth of the tobacco plant, with several advantages over the conventional vaccine production technology: (i) It is potentially safer, given that tobacco plants cannot harbor pathogens that lead to human disease; (ii) It is faster because the vaccine elements accumulate in tobacco plants much fasterâˆ’6 weeks in tobacco plants compared to several months when conventional methods are used; (iii) the vaccine formula developed by KBP remains stable at room temperature, as opposed to conventional vaccines, which often require refrigeration; and (iv) it has the potential to deliver an effective single-dose immune response.
