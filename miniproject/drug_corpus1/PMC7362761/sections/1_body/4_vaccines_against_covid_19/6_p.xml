<p>Vaccine development is a complex and time-consuming process that differs from conventional drug development. Indeed, vaccines are intended for use in healthy people as a preventive measure, while conventional medicines are geared toward treating a disease. Clinical studies to demonstrate the efficacy of a vaccine focus on demonstrating that it can prevent the disease, which implies the need for a greater number of subjects than in the case of traditional drug studies. Before a vaccine is approved and brought to market, it goes through a long and rigorous research process, followed by many years of testing to meet stringent regulatory requirements. Thus, clinical trials for vaccines are carried out in three research phases. Phase I involves a small number of volunteers (20–50 people) and aims to evaluate safety, determine dosage, and identify potential adverse reactions. In phase II of the clinical studies about 100–300 volunteers are involved, the purpose being to analyze in more detail the safety and immunogenicity, the necessary dosage, and to identify the administration schedule. Phase III studies include 3,000–50,000 volunteers, being the last phase to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the large-scale vaccine and to analyze the concomitant administration with other vaccines and treatments. After the testing phase, the vaccines must be approved by the regulatory agencies, in our case by the European Medicines Agency, and only then can they reach the doctors and the population (
