<p>Other candidate vaccines are currently in the preclinical study phase. Johnson &amp; Johnson initiated research efforts for the various potential candidate vaccines in January 2020, as soon as the new coronavirus sequence (COVID-19) became available. Janssen research teams, in collaboration with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, part of Harvard Medical School, have developed and tested several vaccine candidates using Adansac® Janssen technology (

Following this approach, Johnson &amp; Johnson has identified a prime candidate for the COVID-19 vaccine (with two spare variants), leading to the first stages of production. With an accelerated track record, the company intends to launch the Phase 1 trial in September 2020, and clinical safety and efficacy data are expected to be available by the end of the year. This process would allow vaccine availability for emergency use in early 2021. For comparison, the usual process of developing a vaccine involves a number of different research stages, over a period of 5–7 years, before a candidate could be considered for approval (
