<p>Immunity is the successful defense of the body against a pathogen. When the body has produced a sufficient number of antibodies to fight the disease, this immunity results, providing protection against the disease for many months, years, or even life. If a person subsequently comes into contact with the same pathogen, the immune system will be able to rapidly produce the same type of antibody that prevents the disease from developing or decreases its severity and allows it to remove the pathogen from the body. By “immunological memory,” it is estimated that the immune system can remember or effectively recognize and fight hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of different foreign organisms (
