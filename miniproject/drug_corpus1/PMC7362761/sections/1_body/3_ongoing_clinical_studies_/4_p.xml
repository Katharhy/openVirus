<p>COVACTA is a new study that aims to identify a potential treatment against SARS-COV-2. The drug that will be investigated is tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits interleukin 6 receptor and is used in rheumatology. The study will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III trial that will track the benefits of tocilizumab added to the standard of care (ventilator support). The study will include 330 patients worldwide and will follow their clinical status, along with the proportion of patients requiring intensive care, mechanical ventilation, or developing severe forms of SARS-COV-2, which evolves with death (

This study is the result of case studies, where it has been observed that tocilizumab improves the clinical status in severe cases of SARS-COV-2, with advanced pulmonary inflammation. This use is based on the approval of tocilizumab as a treatment in cytokine release syndrome (CRS), an inflammatory manifestation throughout the body, which may be an adverse reaction to CAR-T cell immunotherapy. In the case of SARS-COV-2, the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 into the body stimulates an immune response, with cytokine release (including IL-6), which stimulates fever, inflammation, and pulmonary fibrosis. Studies of SARS-COV-2 cases have shown that elevated levels of IL-6 in patients' serum are statistically significantly correlated with the severe evolution of the infection (
