<p>When the 
 <sup>13</sup>C‐APT NMR spectrum of compound 
 <bold>6</bold>  
 <bold>b</bold> is investigated, the peak of the carbons in the 
 <bold>C</bold>=O group in the imide ring (C1 and C8) is observed at δ 173.9 ppm. The peak of the carbonyl carbon (
 <bold>C</bold>=O) in the amide group (C9) is observed at about δ 164.2 ppm. The peaks in the range of δ 129.4‐138.1 ppm region belong to aromatic Ar−C (C10, C11, C12 and C13) carbons. The peak of carbons C4 and C5 is observed at δ 136.8 ppm. The peaks of carbons C3‐C6 and C2‐C7 are observed at δ 80.9 and δ 45.5 ppm, respectively.
