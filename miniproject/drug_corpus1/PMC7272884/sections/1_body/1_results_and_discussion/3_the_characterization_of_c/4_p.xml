<p>The single peak at δ 11.40 ppm corresponds to hydrogen (
 <italic>N</italic>‐H) (1) in the amide group. The double peaks appearing at δ 7.93 and 7.64 ppm belong to the hydrogens bound to the C8 and C9 carbons in the aromatic ring. Since the aromatic ring is para‐substituted, the peaks are seen as doublet of doublet. The single peaks at δ 6.43 and δ 5.25 ppm belong to the hydrogens on the C4‐C5 and C3‐C6 carbons, respectively. The peaks of the hydrogens on the C2 and C7 carbons are observed singlet at about δ 3.17 ppm.
