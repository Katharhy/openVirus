<p>The structures of the norcantharimide derivatives that we synthesized in our study are similar. Among these molecules, 
 <bold>6</bold>  
 <bold>b</bold> was chosen as the model molecule. When the IR spectra of the synthesized compounds were investigated, characteristic bands of the expected functional groups were seen. When the FTIR spectrum of the compound 
 <bold>6</bold>  
 <bold>b</bold> given the structure formula in Figure 
 <xref rid="slct202001123-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> is examined, the presence of a single and strong N−H band (∼3330 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) confirms the presence of the amide. The aromatic C−H band was observed at about 3010 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. There are two carbonyl stretches in the spectra of cyclic imides corresponding to in‐phase and out of phase stretching of two C=O groups. These usually appear from 1730 to 1680 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. In the phthalimide molecule, the splitting between the symmetric and anti‐symmetric stretching modes is 42 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, with the υ
 <sub>s</sub>(C=O) and υ
 <sub>as</sub>(C=O) appearing as absorptions of medium and very high intensity at 1769 and 1727 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively.
