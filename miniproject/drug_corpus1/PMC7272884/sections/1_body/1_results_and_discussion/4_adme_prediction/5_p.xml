<p>The online program displays whether the compounds are suitable for oral administration with the bioavailability radar panel containing physicochemical properties such as flexibility, insolubility, lipophilicity, size, and polarity. Molecules with oral bioavailability have shown in the colored region (Figure 
 <xref rid="slct202001123-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Results obtained from computational methods showed that our molecules are suitable for oral application like norcantharidin. Except for NO
 <sub>2</sub> groups, other groups slightly decreased the absorption rate of the modified compounds in the small intestine. The absorption compounds from the small intestine are above 80 %, except for the 
 <bold>6</bold>  
 <bold>a</bold> compound. Therefore, the absorption potential of the compounds has very high.
