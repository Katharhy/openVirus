<p>Blood‐Brain Barrier (BBB) diffusion of CNS‐inactive compounds due to toxicity is a crucial parameter. The fact that newly synthesized compounds do not cross the blood brain‐barrier makes them a good drug candidate. Cytochromes P450 (CYP) are the major enzymes involved in the metabolic drug elimination.
 <xref rid="slct202001123-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref> Their inhibition leads to toxic or other undesirable adverse effects because of the lower clean up and collection of the drug or its metabolites.
 <xref rid="slct202001123-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref> Five major isoforms (CYP1 A2, CYP2 C19, CYP2 C9, CYP2D6, CYP3 A4) are responsible for the elimination of the majority of therapeutic molecules.
