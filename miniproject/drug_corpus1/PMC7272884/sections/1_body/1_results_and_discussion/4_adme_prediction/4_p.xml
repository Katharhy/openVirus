 <xref rid="slct202001123-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> Our compounds have an acceptable pharmacokinetics profile given these drug‐likeness rules than norcantharidin. Quantitative classes of solubility in the water is defined as insoluble&lt;−10&lt;poorly&lt;−6&lt;moderately&lt;−4&lt;soluble&lt;−2&lt;very&lt;0&lt;highly. According to the results, molecule 
 <bold>6</bold>  
 <bold>e</bold> and 
 <bold>6</bold>  
 <bold>f</bold> with the result of −1.89 is the most soluble in water and is very soluble. Other molecules were classified as soluble with results in the −2, −3 range. Adding benzene ring to norcantharidin reduced the water solubility of the synthesized compounds. Substitution −Cl, −Br, and −OCH
 <sub>3</sub> decreased the solubility of the compound 
 <bold>6</bold>. The −F and −NO
 <sub>2</sub> groups did not affect the water solubility of this compound.
