<p>In this study, 6 new compounds, which are Norcantharimide analogs were synthesized. The structures of the synthesized compounds were elucidated in detail by the spectroscopic methods (FTIR, 
 <sup>1</sup>H‐ and 
 <sup>13</sup>C‐APT NMR) and elemental analysis. According to the results of ADME, new molecules have the necessary properties for oral administration. Docking analyses demonstrated that these compounds can interact with COVID‐19 M
 <sup>pr</sup>°. Interactions between the COVID‐19 M
 <sup>pr</sup>° and the molecule are changed with the exchange of substituted groups. Therefore, we believe that they can be used as leading molecules in further research to develop new molecules that affect COVID‐19 M
 <sup>pr</sup>° activity.
