 <xref rid="slct202001123-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> Norcantharidin and norcantharimide, which are derivatives of cantharidin, have gained a great interest due to their less toxic effect.
 <xref rid="slct202001123-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> Norcantharidin (
 <bold>2</bold>) is the demethylated form of cantharidin. Demethylation reduces not only liver toxicity of cantharidine, but also the biological activity of the obtained norcantharidin. Cantharidin and its analogs are potent inhibitor of serine / threonine protein phosphatase 1 and 2 A (PP1 and PP2 A).

 <italic>vitro</italic> and showed anticancer activity against various cancer cells. Also, current research results show that norcantharimides or isoindole‐1,3‐dion derivatives have a much higher anti‐cancer activity on many other types of cancer. For example, Kose et al. synthesized new norcantharimide derivatives and investigated the cytotoxic activities of these compounds. They reported that the new norcantharimide derivatives show high anticancer activity in lung and breast cancer.
