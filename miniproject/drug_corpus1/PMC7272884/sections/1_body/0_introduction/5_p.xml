<p>Computer models provide information about the possible effects of the compounds on metabolism and whether they are suitable for begin used as medicine without performing experimental studies. Cheminformatics allows us to understand its pharmacokinetic, physicochemical, solubility, absorption, and similar properties from the chemical structure of a molecule. Many new molecules are synthesized every year in the world. Testing the bioactivity of these molecules as in vitro and in vivo results manifest very high costs. Therefore, ADME and predicting the targets of the molecule have become essential for those sectors in which these molecules can be used.
