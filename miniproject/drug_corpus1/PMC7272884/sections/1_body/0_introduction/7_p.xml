<p>The COVID‐19 has infected more than to million people and is spreading at a rapidly speed. Many efforts have been performed by the scientists to develop treatment methods. With this study, we have aimed to contribute these efforts by investigating the interactions of the new norcantharimide derivatives with the potential target protein COVID‐19 M
 <sup>pr</sup>°. COVID‐19 M
 <sup>pr</sup>° has the main role in the replication and transcription of the Corona virus in the cell. Inhibition of this enzyme may stop the replication and transcription of the corona virus. This development is an important step in the battle against the virus.
