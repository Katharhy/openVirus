<p>In this study, novel norcantharimide analog compounds were synthesized. The structures of the synthesized compounds were characterized using spectrometric methods (
 <sup>1</sup>H, 
 <sup>13</sup>C‐NMR, IR and Elemental Analysis). Besides, investigation of the physicochemical, pharmacokinetics and Drug‐likeness properties of the synthesized molecules for oral administration was aimed.
