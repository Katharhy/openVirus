 <p>A series of new novel Norcantharimides have been synthesized and their absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) properties were investigated. The results obtained in silico showed that these molecules can be considered orally active drug candidates, taking into account their physicochemical properties. In addition, placement studies have shown that all derivatives exhibit good theoretical affinity with the 124–138 MolDock Score against the main protease of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID‐19 M
  <sup>pr</sup>°), which causes worldwide outbreaks.
