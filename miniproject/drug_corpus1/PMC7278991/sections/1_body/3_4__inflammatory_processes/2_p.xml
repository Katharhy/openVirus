<p>The onset of inflammatory processes is a key pathological feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The massive release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in COVID-19 patients was first reported by Huang and colleagues, showing in particular higher levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα in the peripheral blood of intensive care unit (ICU) patients compared to non-ICU patients [

The role of the cytokine storm in SARS-CoV-2 infection is attracting great attention as a crucial phase to investigate in order to clarify the disease’s pathogenic process (e.g., to elucidate the role of Th1 and Th2 responses) and to identify new therapeutic targets (see the published results and the ongoing clinical trials with Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the IL-6 pathway) [

 <xref rid="B143-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. Sex hormones have been suggested as potential mediators of the reported sexual dimorphism by virtue of their ability to modulate innate and adaptive immunity, as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B144-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>] and as described above. However, since sex dimorphism observed in several inflammatory diseases, including respiratory pathologies, has also been confirmed in studies dealing with pre-pubertal cohorts [

 <xref rid="B147-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>], there is growing consensus on the need to consider additional factors/variables that may occur. Similarly, there is growing evidence suggesting that the X-chromosome and X-linked genes are the main determinants of the reported sex dimorphism in disease susceptibility and prognosis [

 <xref rid="B148-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. The X-chromosome carries about 1,200 genes [
 <xref rid="B149-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>] including cytokines/cytokines receptors, toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated signaling pathway genes, NF-kB and MAPK signaling genes, genes involved in apoptosis, genes involved in redox balance, and other immune-modulators such as CD40 ligand and FOXP3, as recently reviewed [
