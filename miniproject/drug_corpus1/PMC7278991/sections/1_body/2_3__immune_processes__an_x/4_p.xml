<p>With regard to the mechanism of escaping silencing, it seems that about 15% of X-linked genes can escape inactivation, so that they are expressed by both X-chromosomes in female cells, whereas a further 10% vary among individuals for their silencing behavior. The level of expression is, however, always lower in the escaped gene [
