<p>In humans, na√Øve mature B and T cells were demonstrated to lack XCI on some genes (H3K27me3, H2A-ubiquitin, H4K20me and macroH2A), which are again partially silenced (H3K27me3 and H2A-ubiquitin) when lymphocytes are activated [

 <xref rid="B117-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. In particular, the distal end of Xp and PAR regions, which contain the highest number of immune-associated genes on the X-chromosome, have a higher chance of escaping XCI [
