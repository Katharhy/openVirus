<p>Finally, strong results have recently been found in favor of an exceptionally high basal level of ACE2 in Asian females than in other ethnic groups and an age-dependent decrease more significant in men than women [

Nevertheless, the tissues they have tested are not those of the upper respiratory tract, with the exception of the lung (and blood vessels) which only show a moderately higher ACE2 expression in East Asian females. The authorsâ€™ conclusion that Asian women are more protected against CoVs than men is based on the hypothesis that ACE2 repression induced by SARS-CoV2 might be counteracted by high basal levels of ACE2 induced by higher levels of sex hormones (which decrease with age) and reduced by systemic inflammation [
