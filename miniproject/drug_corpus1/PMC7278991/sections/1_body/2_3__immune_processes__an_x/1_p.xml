<p>Sex-disparities have been often observed in response to communicable diseases [

 <xref rid="B117-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. In viral infections, sex differences in term of intensity, prevalence, severity, and mortality have been reported depending on the etiological agent, as reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B118-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. The general tendency in females is, however, to show a greater humoral and cell-mediated immune response to infection [

 <xref rid="B119-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. Consequently, females clear infections more quickly and more effectively than males [

 <xref rid="B121-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. Sex hormones can be partly responsible for this phenomenon: by binding to specific receptors on immune cells, they can trigger their activity (estrogen) or suppress it (testosterone) [

 <xref rid="B122-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>,
 <xref rid="B123-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. However, sex differences may also be due to an imbalanced expression of genes on the X- and Y-chromosomes, since immune-related X-linked genes appear to be more activated in female immune cells.
