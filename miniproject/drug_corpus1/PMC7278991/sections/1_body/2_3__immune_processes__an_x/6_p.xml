<p>Accordingly, in the 
 <italic>ACE2</italic> gene maps of the Xp-region and in a study carried out without distinguishing between male and female cells [
 <xref rid="B39-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] it was demonstrated that 
 <italic>ACE2</italic> is abundantly present in human lung epithelia and small intestine enterocytes, while another study [
 <xref rid="B36-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] has shown that the expression of the ACE2 receptor is higher on oral mucosa and tongue epithelial cells. A systematic survey of XCI that integrated transcriptomes with genomic data [
 <xref rid="B127-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>] identified 
 <italic>ACE2</italic> as a tissue-specific escape gene that showed moderate male-biased expression in lungs, higher male-biased expression in the small intestine, and weak male-biased expression in Epsteinâ€“Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphocytes. This finding may be suggestive of lower 
 <italic>ACE2</italic> expression in females due to the combination of the two X-linked genes compared to the expression arising from the X-linked and a Y homologue in males [
 <xref rid="B127-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. Nevertheless, in another recent study [
 <xref rid="B129-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>], no sex-mediated differences in expression were found between the sexes. Alternatively, the predominant male-biased expression of 
 <italic>ACE2</italic> might be explained by increased 
 <italic>ACE2</italic> activity in males partially driven by sex hormones [
 <xref rid="B127-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>], as it has recently been demonstrated in mice kidneys [
 <xref rid="B130-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>].
