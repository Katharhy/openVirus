<p>Skewed X-chromosome inactivation appears when one X-chromosome is favored over the other for XCI. This may result in 75â€“90% of cells with the same parental X-chromosome silenced. This predominance of one Xi also causes unbalance of the allelic dosage and of X-linked transcription. This loss of mosaicism may lead to a reduced plasticity of the immune system and a loss of immunological memory [
