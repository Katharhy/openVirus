<p>Part of the present findings were already known from previous SARS epidemics, but the pandemic proportions of COVID-19 have led researchers and clinicians to fight together more than during previous SARS-CoVs infections. Accordingly, some aspects such as the sex gap in favor of the females, particularly for prognosis and survival, have been greatly deepened and investigated through epidemiological studies. Different sex and age groups have strongly different susceptibilities to infection and mortality, considering male-sex, old age, and comorbidities as the most affecting variables. In addition, genetic predispositions or inherited protective mechanisms have been speculated to explain some controversial data. Considering individual genetic susceptibility to virus infection and progression, heterogeneous geographical distributions are now emerging not only among different populations and countries, but also between close geographic regions.</p>
