<p>SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Î²-coronavirus family and the associated severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), like the previous SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), it may cause life-threatening diseases [

 <xref rid="B2-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,

 <xref rid="B6-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Data from past epidemiological studies match with emerging observations, indicating a large, sex-dependent gap in disease infection and outcomes for SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) as for previous SARS [
 <xref rid="B7-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Moreover, people aged 60 and over suffer worse outcomes with mortality rates above 50% [

 <xref rid="B10-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and sex differences in incidence and higher fatality rates in males compared to females were also peculiar to earlier SARS. Conversely, infants and children experience mild symptoms and a better prognosis, without sex differences, and with a mildly elevated proinflammatory cytokines-storm in the early phase of the illness [

 <xref rid="B12-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Accordingly, thrombosis due to coagulation unbalance or inherited or acquired thrombophilia is a rare event among children [
 <xref rid="B13-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,

 <xref rid="B17-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and this could in part account for the micro-thromboembolic events or cardiac injury found in the elderly severest cases as well the rarer disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [
 <xref rid="B18-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], strongly substantiating heparin-based anticoagulant treatments in the selected severe cases [
 <xref rid="B18-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. On the other hand, the severity of COVID-19 worsens with advancing age for both sexes, possibly due to a dysregulation of the immune response, a difference in sex-hormones that has become less evident with age between sexes, or a considerable unbalancing in the coagulation/fibrinolytic system and endothelial dysfunction with aging [
 <xref rid="B23-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Accordingly, in a mouse model, gonadectomy did not affect disease outcome in male mice, whilst ovariectomy or estrogen receptor antagonists caused increased mortality in females after SARS-CoV infection [
 <xref rid="B7-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This observation also strongly agrees with the fact that females mount stronger innate and adaptive immune responses and are relatively more resistant to virus infections than males. The difference in the copy number of X-linked genes involved in the immune response and the presence of genes dedicated to disease susceptibility in males and females may account for any other possible sex advantage [

 <xref rid="B30-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. As concerns sex hormones, testosterone suppresses innate immune responses, whilst estrogens have immune-suppressive effect at higher levels and immune-stimulant activity at lower levels [

 <xref rid="B33-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], with peculiar functions to contrast virus replication in selected tissues such as nasal epithelial cells in humans [
