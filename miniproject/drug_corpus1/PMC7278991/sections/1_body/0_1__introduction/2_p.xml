<p>Less investigated, is whether differences in the efficiency of the SARS-CoV-2 cell-entry might account for at least part of the observed sex-gap. It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells using the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 and a specific transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) for the spike (S) protein priming [

 <xref rid="B37-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It has been described how a modest ACE2 expression characterizes the upper human respiratory tract and that this should limit the receptivity of the virus [

 <xref rid="B39-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. It is controversial whether Metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM17, also known as TNFÎ±-converting enzyme, TACE), involved in the ACE2 ectodomain shedding, by increasing the amount of soluble ACE2 might or might not counteract the virus entry and/or exclusively contribute to ACE1/ACE2 unbalancing, inflammation and thrombosis [
 <xref rid="B40-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Furthermore, estrogens increase ADAM17 and ADAM10 expression levels, two putative shedders also responsible for many ectodomain cleavages in atherosclerosis [
