<p>Most likely, it is plausible that a combination of the mechanisms described above might influence the multistep pathogenesis and the age/sex-gaps of such a complex infection and progression, considering also that 
 <italic>ACE2</italic> (locus Xp22.2) and Ang-II receptor type 2 gene (
 <italic>AGTR2</italic>, alias 
 <italic>AT2</italic>, locus Xq23) are both located on the X-chromosome. Essentially, X-linked heterozygous alleles could activate in females a mosaic advantage and a greater sexual dimorphism that might counteract viral infection, local inflammation due to cytokine storms and severe outcomes.
