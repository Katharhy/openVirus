<p>Finally, considering individual genetic susceptibility or environmental influences on virus infection and/or SARS progression, a wide and heterogeneous geographical distribution of absolute numbers and percentages of infected cases is now emerging. Different clinical phenotypes and symptoms characterize not only different populations and countries, but also close geographic regions in which opposite situations may coexist. As a paradigmatic example, according to data from “
 <italic>Dipartimento Protezione Civile COVID-19 Italia</italic>” [
 <xref rid="B178-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>], our region, Emilia Romagna, is the second area of Italy for absolute number of SARS-CoV-2 infections (26,487 confirmed cases/4,452,638 habitants; male/female ratio 48.6/51.4). It accounts for an overall infection rate of about 0.59%, characterized by 3,366 deaths (14.2% death rate), considering 217,039 performed tests and 1899 total recovered patients (7 May 2020, 7:00 PM). Among the towns belonging to the same region, Ferrara shows the lowest percentages (960 confirmed cases/346,975 habitants; male/female ratio 48.1/51.9) accounting for an overall infection rate of about 0.27%, compared with the town of Piacenza (less than 200 Km far from Ferrara) which has the highest rate (4300 confirmed cases/286,781 habitants; male/female ratio 48.9/51.1) accounting for an overall infection ratio of about 1.5% (Ferrara vs. Piacenza; 
 <italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.00001; Ferrara vs. rest of the region; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.00001). Obviously, other variables also need to be analyzed, first the local containment actions, the number of tests performed and then the geographic locations. In this regard, Piacenza is very close to the most critical hot-spot of the infection in Italy [region Lombardia (0.83%); Lodi (1.43%), Codogno area (red zone)] and other additional parameters such as population density may account for local differences in terms of viral spreading (Ferrara: 325 habitants/Km
 <sup>2</sup> vs. Piacenza 880 habitants/Km
 <sup>2</sup>). Genetic selection pressure by previous epidemics, such as the long-lasting malaria epidemics in the Po river area where the city of Ferrara is located, cannot be excluded. This is in line with some publications reporting that endemic malaria seems to protect from COVID-19 outbreak and that genetic variations associated with malaria (e.g., 
 <italic>ACE2</italic> and 
 <italic>ABO</italic> genes) may play protective roles [
