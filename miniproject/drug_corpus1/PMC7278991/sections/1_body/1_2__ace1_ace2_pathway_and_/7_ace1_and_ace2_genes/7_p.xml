<p>Noticeably, it emerges that an overly activated RAS, exacerbated by genetic predispositions affecting the ACE1/ACE2 balance and in combination with advanced age and classic acquired cardiovascular risk conditions, might lead to systemic disorders and/or severe local disturbances of the normal tissue homeostasis. Overall, this condition can establish a complex multistep mechanism (
