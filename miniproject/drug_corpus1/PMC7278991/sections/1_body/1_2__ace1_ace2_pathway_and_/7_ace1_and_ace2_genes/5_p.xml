<p>The 
 <italic>ACE2</italic> gene maps on chromosome Xp22.22, is 41.04 kb long, and contains 18 or 19 exons in two isoforms (Genbank, NT 011757), which differ in the presence of an extra exon in the longer isoform at the 5â€²-end [
 <xref rid="B51-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The ACE2 and ACE1 catalytic domains share 42% homology in their amino acid sequence and have a similar exon/intron organization, indicating a common ancestor. Among the several gene variants [
 <xref rid="B94-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>], particular attention has been paid to the transition G8790A (rs2285666) in intron 3 of the 
 <italic>ACE2</italic> gene, previously investigated in association studies with hypertension, although some issues remain almost inconclusive [

 <xref rid="B96-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Unlike autosomal genes (i.e., 
 <italic>ACE1</italic>), X-linked genes (i.e., 
 <italic>ACE2</italic>) cannot show in males any advantageous heterozygous condition in case of mutations or polymorphic at-risk conditions. Accordingly, in the presence of a lower activity of the 
 <italic>ACE2</italic> gene, as for the one associated with the 8790 G-allele [

 <xref rid="B98-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>], male-carriers are certainly hemizygotes unable to compensate with the 8790 A-allele counterpart. 
 <italic>ACE2</italic> G8790A is located at the beginning of the intron 3, theoretically affecting gene expression with alternative splicing mechanisms [

 <xref rid="B100-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>], also having a strong linkage disequilibrium with other SNPs (rs1978124 intron 1 and rs714205 intron 16) in the 
 <italic>ACE2</italic> gene [
