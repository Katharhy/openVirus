 <italic>The ACE1</italic> gene maps on chromosome 17q23.3, is 21.32 kb-long, and comprises 26 exons (Genbank, NT 010783). NCBI records (
 <uri xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?locusId=1636" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?locusId=1636</uri>) include hundreds of intragenic gene variants: most of them are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), a minor part of which are located in the coding region, and few of them are missense mutations. Interestingly, the gene encodes two isoforms of ACE1 with two different promoters and alternative splicing, and the structure of the 
 <italic>ACE1</italic> gene may be the result of a duplication of an ancestral gene [
