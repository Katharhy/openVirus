<p>Among the several gene variants, the more investigated is an insertion/deletion (I/D) defined by NCBI [
 <xref rid="B79-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] as a sequence of 287-bp I/D in the 
 <italic>Alu</italic>-sequence of intron 16 in the 
 <italic>ACE1</italic> gene and is represented by four individual SNPs (rs4646994, rs1799752, rs4340 and rs13447447). It is generally associated with the expression level of ACE1 [
 <xref rid="B80-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], with the D/D genotype having the highest serum/tissue ACE1 levels, the I/D genotype showing intermediate levels, and the I/I genotype the lowest levels [
 <xref rid="B81-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Interestingly, the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), a catalogue of human genes and genetic disorders particularly focused on geneâ€“phenotype relationships, reports that this gene may be associated with SARS progression, assuming that the D-allele can be considered a genetic predisposition affecting the progression from pneumonia to SARS, as reported in a study with Vietnamese SARS patients [
 <xref rid="B82-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Other studies have confirmed these outstanding data [
 <xref rid="B82-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>,
 <xref rid="B83-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,
 <xref rid="B84-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], although current conclusions are still controversial [
 <xref rid="B43-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B85-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>,
 <xref rid="B86-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>].
