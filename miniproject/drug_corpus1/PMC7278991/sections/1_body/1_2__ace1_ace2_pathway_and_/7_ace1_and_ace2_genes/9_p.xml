<p>Finally, the surface of SARS-CoV-2 interacts specifically with ACE2 through its receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S-protein, which is critical to the success of the viral infection. The affinity between ACE2 and the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 is 10–20 times higher than that of previous SARS-CoVs, which also explain its higher aggressive performance [

 <xref rid="B105-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Moreover, the ACE2 peptidase domain (PD), normally deputed to Ang-I to Ang 1–9 cleavage, also makes available a direct binding site for SARS-CoV-2 S-proteins. In addition to the PD domain, a neck domain is also crucial for the ACE2 dimerization process and stability. Extensive polar interactions have been recognized in the neck domain of ACE2, and the complex network of polar interactions between amino acid residues ensures a stable and functional dimer assembly. Several gene polymorphisms have been listed among those amino acid residues suggested to be crucial for dimer stability in the PD and neck domains of the

 <italic>ACE2</italic> genes within the two different X-chromosomes, a condition that may give rise to a greater structural variability in females, who potentially assemble “hetero-dimers”, particularly in the presence of a skewed X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), in comparison to males who necessarily assemble “homo-dimers”. Obviously, XCI is not the same in every female, being potentially advantageous or not in terms of virus cell entry. Moreover, a difference in the open or closed conformation of the ACE2 receptor together with the glycosylation rate of some amino acid residues in the PD domain could affect ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 interaction [

Accordingly, we have previous experience of dimeric/tetrameric molecules in which selected SNPs seemed to have higher detrimental effects on the molecule structure and activation when combined heterozygous haplotypes were co-inherited in the same carrier rather than in homozygous polymorphic individuals [
