<p>An interesting recent paper investigated the

 <italic>ACE2</italic> G8790A transition in hypertensive population. The authors hypothesized that patients characterized by higher ACE1 activity (i.e., D/D-genotype) in conjunction with reduced ACE2 activity (i.e., GG-females or hemizygous G-males) could account for increased susceptibility to hypertension mainly in association with classical cardiovascular risk factors such as old age, dyslipidemia, and diabetes [
