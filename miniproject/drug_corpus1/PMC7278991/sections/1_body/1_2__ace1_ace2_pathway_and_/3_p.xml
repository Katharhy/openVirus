<p>ACE2 is a key molecule for the tuning of the RAS pathway under both healthy and pathological conditions. It has been recently demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor (ACE2) as SARS-CoV to enter cells in combination with the action of the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S-protein priming [

 <italic>ACE2</italic> is expressed in several tissues, including endothelium, lung, heart, intestine, and kidney and, as recently demonstrated, on the epithelial cells of oral mucosa and the tongue [
 <xref rid="B36-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], sharing both tissue expression sites and high sequence identity with the homologue

 <xref rid="B51-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Anomalous tuning of the ACE1/ACE2 pathway contributes to the development of several complex pathological conditions such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, thrombosis, heart or kidney failure, and severe acute respiratory distress [

 <xref rid="B57-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. During acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a local RAS unbalance cannot maintain appropriate oxygenation, thus inducing pulmonary edema, inflammation, and hyper-proliferation, establishing in turn severe pulmonary shutdown [
