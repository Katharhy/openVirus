<p>The reninâ€“angiotensin system (RAS) acts as a homeostatic regulator of the vascular function, including blood pressure and volume control, starting with renin (REN) mediating the transformation of angiotensinogen (AGT) to angiotensin I (Ang-I). Indirectly, RAS is also responsible for local tissue homeostasis by anti-inflammatory, anti-coagulant, anti-proliferation, anti-fibrosis, anti-apoptosis of epithelial cells, and anti-oxidative stress activities, also controlling the local trophic responses to a range of stimuli, viruses included [
