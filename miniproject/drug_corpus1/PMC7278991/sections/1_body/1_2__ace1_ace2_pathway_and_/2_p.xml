<p>The angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE1) and the more recently discovered homologue ACE2 [

 <xref rid="B51-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], are two antagonist enzymes of the RAS pathway that act and counterbalance each other [
 <xref rid="B52-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The main role of ACE1 is the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II (Ang-I &gt; Ang-II), the latter being a powerful peptide causing complex processes such as vasoconstriction, inflammation, fibrosis and proliferation via the AT1-receptor. Conversely, ACE2 firstly converts Ang-I to Ang 1–9, that is then converted by ACE1 in the vasodilator peptide Ang 1–7. Moreover, ACE2 directly converts Ang-II to Ang 1–7 and this latter by acting on MAS-receptor exerts organ protection, antagonizing the biological effects of Ang-II [

 <xref rid="B52-ijms-21-03474" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Moreover, a high ACE2/ACE1 ratio protects against endothelial dysfunctions and vascular pathologies, exogenous ACE2 activation promotes antithrombotic activity, and the known antithrombotic properties of captopril (ACE inhibitor) and losartan (AT1-receptor blocker) are attenuated by a selective Ang 1–7 receptor antagonist [
