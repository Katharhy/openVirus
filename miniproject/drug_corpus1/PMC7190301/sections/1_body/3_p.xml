<p id="para40">The success of convalescent plasma therapy hinges on the donation of plasma by people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have high concentrations of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and on the safe preparation of serum to eliminate potential risk factors, such as the transmission of viruses via transfusion. Many donors are needed, as the plasma from one donor can only be used to treat a few patients. In the USA, the Red Cross—in collaboration with the FDA—

An additional use for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies isolated from plasma is the development of a concentrated therapy known as hyperimmune globulin, in which the antibodies from many donors are pooled. Such hyperimmune therapies could offer a more consistent and predictable therapeutic option, with companies such as Takeda and CSL Behring planning to test these therapies in clinical trials.
