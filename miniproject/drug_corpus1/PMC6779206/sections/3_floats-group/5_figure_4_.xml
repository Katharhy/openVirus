  <p>Phylogenetic tree of a local molecular evolution database constructed by the envelope (E) gene in Guangdong since 2005. Genotypes I, IV, and V were detected in 88 E genes of DENV1 strains covering every epidemic year. Genotype I extensively circulated in Guangdong and covered every epidemic year. The genotype branched into four molecular evolution lineages with temporal continuance. Genotype IV was only detected in 2007 and 2010. Genotype V circulated from 2009 to 2011 and then, after a 2-year silence, reappeared in 2014. The colored sequence represents DENV1 in Guangdong Province. The same color in genotype I represents the viral sequences cluster into the same lineage. Yellow and blue represent genotypes IV and V, respectively.
