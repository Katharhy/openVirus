  <p>Phylogenetic analysis of DENV1 detected from the 2014 outbreak in Guangdong. Fifty-six envelope gene sequences were isolated in our study. These and 19 reference sequences from GenBank were used to construct the phylogenetic tree. Asian genotype I and American/African genotype V were involved in this outbreak. Forty-seven sequences identified as genotype V clustered into the same clade, whereas genotype I was divided into Lineages I and II. Thirteen sequences from Shanwei (blue circles), Chaozhou (green circles), and Huizhou (violet circles) all belonged to genotype V.
