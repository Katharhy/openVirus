<p>A prediction of the algorithm of the secondary structure of proteins suggests that it is closely related to the distribution of protein epitopes. The high chemical bond energy of the α-helix and β-sheet enables folding of the protein, making it difficult to bind to the antibody, whereas the β-turn and coil, because of their loose structure, are easily displayed on the surface as antigenic epitopes, facilitating binding of the antibody.

 </sup> Only two substitutions causing changes in the secondary structure from the β-sheet to coil were observed in our study, suggesting that its antigenicity was enhanced. However, E171 (T → S) located on the surface is more likely to be associated with protein function than E114 (I → L), which was located inside the protein. Although DI, the structure found in the central region of the E protein, was not significantly related to the protein function, in our study, majority of the AA substitutions were observed (5/8), and most of them were located on the surface of its 3D structure. Even E161 (T → I) and E171 (T → S) were found in the binding interface between genotype I and GRP78 but not genotype V, further suggesting that the substitution of E171 (T → S) may be playing a key role in the binding of the E protein of genotypes I and V to the receptor.

 </sup> also observed the presence of a bundle structure consisting of four polar AA residues at the interface between DI and DIII, of which HIS-282 and HIS317 were unique to DENV1, implying that the change of DI conformation will also affect the realization of DIII function. Domain III has an immunoglobulin-like structure and a functional region where DENV binds to a cellular receptor. Drumond et al.

 </sup> predicted the structure of the DENV1 E protein in Brazil and observed that the substitution of E306 (S → F) can reduce its interaction with several residues (SER305, LYS307, LYS325, VAL380, VAL324, ILE335, TYR326, and GLY381), resulting in a change in the folding of the area, whereas genotypes I and V of DENV1 in Guangdong have a unified mutation in E324 (I → V). The residue QHG at position E314–E316 of the E protein of DENV2 and 3 is highly conserved, and docking by the ZDOCK method showed that it possibly interacts with the membrane receptor protein TIM-1
