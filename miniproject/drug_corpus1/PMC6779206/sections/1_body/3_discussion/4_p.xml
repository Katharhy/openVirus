<p>Three genotypes (I, IV, and V) in DENV1 from a variety of origins were identified. Data obtained from the characterization of local or imported viruses with similarity in lineages found in Guangdong demonstrated that these viruses, which were identified based on their molecular evolutionary analysis, were also present in many other countries, particularly those neighboring China. Continuous occurrences of the epidemic in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore were consistent with the outbreaks in our country. The epidemiological data demonstrated that the early imported cases in Guangdong had high correlation with those found in the neighboring countries, which indicated that these countries might be the source for the migration of DENV1 to Guangdong.

 </sup> However, specific switches in different genotypes were observed, which are as follows: Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos for genotype I; the Philippines for genotype IV; and India and Maldives for genotype V. The outbreaks of severe epidemics over the years in the neighboring countries and frequent mobility of their populations to China may be able to explain the pandemic pattern of the spread of DENV, which began with its spread to Guangdong Province and then broke out in other parts of the country. A similar conclusion was presented in the study conducted by Sun et al.

 </sup> regarding the epidemiological characteristics and genetic diversity of DENV in Guangdong in 2014. Nevertheless, since 2012, with an extremely high incidence of cases, DENV spread more rapidly and affected a wider range of populations. The co-epidemic between other countries and Guangdong and the dissemination of different genotypes and serotypes in multiple regions might not align totally with the theory that only the imported cases caused the epidemic. Lee et al.

 </sup> reported a theory which stated that multiple factors are involved in addition to the ones described in in situ evolution that can explain this phenomenon. However, we still need more evidence to prove the applicability of this hypothesis to the epidemic outbreaks in Guangdong Province.
