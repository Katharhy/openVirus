<p>The distribution characteristic of DENV1 in Guangdong was determined from its long-term epidemic history. Dengue virus 1 was first detected in Zhongshan, Guangdong Province. Since then, DENV1 epidemics have occurred sporadically in specific regions over 2â€“3 years.

 </sup> Until 2006, DENV1 was the leading serotype, which triggered massive outbreaks in Guangzhou.

 </sup> Thereafter, DENV was circulated continuously across multiple geographies in Guangdong, and the isolated strains branched into several stable molecular evolutionary clades.

 </sup> Since 2009, it has spread to different provinces of Guangzhou, and imported cases were no longer primary. At present, imported and local cases are equally responsible for the DENV outbreaks, which have occurred with a complex pattern wherein all four serotypes have emerged, with DENV1 being the primary. Meizhou was the only city in Guangdong Province in which no cases of DENV were detected since 2005, indicating the criticality of the occurrence of the DENV epidemic in this region.

 </sup> Analyses of the epidemiological trends suggest that the severity of DENV outbreaks has increased since 2012. The rising number of cases and extension of the pandemic to widely distributed areas characterized the large outbreak in 2014, which marked the top of the periodical DENV infections and transmission. With an increase in the number of cases reported between 2016 and 2018, it can be speculated that, in 2019, the severity of the epidemic might increase and require our attention.
