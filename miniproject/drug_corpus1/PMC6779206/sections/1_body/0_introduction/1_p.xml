<p>Dengue virus (DENV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, is transmitted primarily by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, causing an acute infectious disease named dengue fever (DF),

 </sup> With the recent revision of the WHO dengue classification scheme, dengue patients are classified as having either dengue or severe dengue. The former refers to patients who recover without major complications, whereas the latter points to those who have any of the following conditions: plasma leakage resulting in shock, accumulation of serosal fluid sufficient to cause respiratory distress, or both; severe bleeding; and severe organ impairment.

 </sup> Before 1970, only nine countries had experienced severe dengue epidemics, but the disease is now endemic in more than 100 countries.

 </sup> In recent decades, the spreading disease causes rapid upsurge in morbidity. One recent estimate indicates 390 million dengue infections per year, of which 96 million manifest clinically.

 </sup> Hence, wasting a lot of health resources and causing the growing global burden of disease, DF is regarded as the most widely distributed vector-borne disease with the highest morbidity and great harm.
