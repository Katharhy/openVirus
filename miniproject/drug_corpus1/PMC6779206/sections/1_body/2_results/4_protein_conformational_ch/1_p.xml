<p>A total of eight uniform AA substitutions in the ectodomain of the E protein were mainly concentrated in domains I (five substitutions) (DI) and III (two substitutions) (DIII) between genotypes I and V, whereas domain II (DII) has only one. Among them, two substitutions caused the protein’s secondary structure to change from β-sheet to coil, E114 (I → L) in DII and E171 (T → S) in DI, whereas only E37 (D → N), E155 (S → T), E161 (T → I), and E171 (T → S) of DI were observed on the 3D conformation surface of the protein (

We found three identical docking sites of DIII in the binding interface of the two genotypes: 331A-332P, 359T-360D, and 362E-363K (
