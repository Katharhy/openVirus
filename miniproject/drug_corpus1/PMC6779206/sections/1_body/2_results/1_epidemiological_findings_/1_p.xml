<p>Since 2005, epidemics of dengue in Guangdong have been characterized by periodic outbreaks, the coexistence of importation and localization, and the significantly increased number of indigenous cases compared with that of imported cases (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A and C</xref>). The incidence peaked in 2006 and 2014. Especially, during the large outbreak in 2014, a total of 45,236 cases of dengue were reported. In 2017, 1,650 cases were reported, with a continuous rising trend in comparison to 544 cases in 2016 (

Among them, 257 cases were imported, which was 50.3% higher than those in the same period in 2017; 2,578 cases were local cases, which was 115.2% higher than those in the same period in 2017. Based on the map of Guangdong Province, we diagrammed the distribution of the cumulative number of cases since 2005. This showed that Guangzhou, Foshan, Zhongshan, and Chaozhou were the main epidemic areas. The trends of the epidemics were anastomotic, with periods of fluctuation in Guangdong Province (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). After 2010, the epidemic trend featured the gradual coexistence of various serotypes, with up to four serotypes emerging in recent years. Each DENV serotype was identified. Dengue virus 1 was the major cause of the outbreak of 2014, and it continued to be detected in Guangdong Province as the primary serotype, except in 2015. It is worth noting that the proportion of dengue 2 virus in the total cases also gradually increased (
