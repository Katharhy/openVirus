<p>We downloaded E gene sequences since 2005, comprising 187 from Guangdong and 1886 from other countries. Databases of E gene molecular evolution were created via a screening process based on epidemiologic and phylogenetic methods. Among them, 81 strains in Guangdong constituted the local database, whereas 403 strains in other countries made up the imported database.</p>
