<p>Based on the evolutionary lineage of DENV1 detected in 2014 in Guangdong, seven sequences (P1023, P1078, P1258, P1277, P1278, P1306, and P1344) were added to the local database for phylogenetic evolution analysis. Distribution of the collection date of DENV1 strains used for analysis was highly consistent with the dengue epidemic, with a low prevalence in 2005, 2008, 2009, and 2011. Genotypes I, IV, and V were detected since the 2005 dengue epidemic. Genotype I, which had extensively circulated in Guangdong and was detected in every year of an epidemic, was branched into four molecular evolutionary lineages. During the outbreak in 2006, three lineages were first formed as the basis of circulation. Over the next decade, sequences in other prevalent years were included into these branches in close relationship, with 2006–2008–2010 for Lineage I, 2006–2011–2012 for Lineage II, and 2006–2009–2013–2014–2015 for Lineage III. Sequences in 2007 formed a branch named Lineage IV for 2007–2010–2014–2015–2016, whose prevalent trend was clearly on the rise. Outbreak sequences in Chaozhou in 2008 individually formed a clade between Lineages II and III. Interestingly, concerning the recent severe DENV epidemic, since 2006 or 2007 (the previous circulation), Lineages II–IV had not spread continuously, but instead had circulated locally and consecutively every year after several years. It is unclear whether the subsequent lineages originated from strains in 2006 or 2007, or were imported from neighboring countries in that year. In addition, genotype IV was detected only in 2007 and 2010, whereas genotype V circulated from 2009 to 2011, and then, after a 2-year silence, reappeared in 2014 (
