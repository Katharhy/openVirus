<p>Dengue virus RNA samples (
 <italic>n</italic> = 29) were obtained from the Guangdong Provincial Maternal and Child Care Service. All samples were extracted from patients suspected of dengue and were confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using specific primers. The steps included an initial denaturation (94°C, 2 minutes); 35 cycles of denaturation (94°C, 30 seconds), annealing (60°C, 30 seconds), and extension (72°C, 1 minute); and a final extension (72°C, 10 minutes) (

Another two serum samples from individuals suspected of having dengue were provided by the Health Care Center of Guangdong International Travel. Twenty-five DENV strains were isolated by the Guangdong CDC on C6/36 cells. The strains obtained were amplified on C6/36 cells maintained in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. After complete cytopathic effects were observed, the culture supernatants were collected.
