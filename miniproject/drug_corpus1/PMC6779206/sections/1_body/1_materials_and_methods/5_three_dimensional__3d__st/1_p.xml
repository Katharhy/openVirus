 </sup> through the homology modeling method based on the MODELER program. The optimal protein 3D model was selected by combining the Probability density function and discrete optimized protein energy, and the reliability of the model was evaluated using the Ramachandran plot and Profile-3D. The optimal protein structure model was used to perform protein docking calculations with the GRP78 protein (PDB number: 3LDP) using the ZDOCK algorithm in DS2.5, and RDOCK was used to further optimize the docking configuration to minimize energy. Finally, we analyzed AA sites in the binding interface of the optimal docking model.
