<p>Two phylogenetic trees for the E gene and one for the complete genome of DENV1 were established. The main focus was the analysis of the molecular characterization during the dengue outbreak in Guangdong, China, in 2014. For this, contemporaneous E gene sequences in other countries were added to make a comprehensive evaluation of the epidemiological situation and molecular evolution in the large 2014 dengue outbreak in Guangdong. At the same time, E gene sequences of DENV1 since 2005, comprising 187 sequences from Guangdong and 1,886 from other countries, were downloaded from GenBank. After excluding several sequences with uncertain epidemiological data, representative epidemic strains in every lineage were screened using phylogenetic methods. Since then, a molecular evolution database for the DENV1 E gene in Guangdong and other countries has been established. Based on representative strains of the E gene in lineages of the 2014 outbreak, as well as the molecular evolution database, we analyzed molecular characterization and possibility of local circulation for DENV1 since 2005 in Guangdong.</p>
