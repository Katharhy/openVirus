<p>Viral RNA was extracted from 140 μL of serum sample or culture supernatant using the QIAamp
 <sup>®</sup> Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). A PrimeScript
 <sup>™</sup> II First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (TaKaRa Bio, Shiga, Japan) was used for the transcription of DENV RNA. Type-specific primers (
 <xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were used to confirm the serotype through RT-PCR using the LightCycler480
 <sup>®</sup> instrument (Roche Diagnostics, Roche Instrument Center AG, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Targeted fragments of approximately 856 bp and 1,028 bp were used to amplify E gene cDNA using two pairs of primers (
 <xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). After DNA sequencing, two targeted fragments with overlapping sequences were spliced into a complete E gene sequence. The amplification process for the E gene involved an initial denaturation (94°C, 2 minutes); 40 cycles of denaturation (94°C, 30 seconds), annealing (58°C, 30 seconds), and extension (72°C, 1 minute); and a final extension (72°C, 10 minutes). After sequencing performed by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China), data were uploaded to the GenBank database.
