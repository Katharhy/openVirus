<p id="Par10">All these sequence and structural modelling evidences strongly support the concept that the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp is much more similar to the one from HCV than the one from negative-sense Influenza and Ebola RNA viruses. Therefore, repositioning of Sofosbuvir (Sovaldi®; Epclusa® by Gilead), the inhibitor of the HCV NS5B RdRp protein, as antiviral in the treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 infection has an extremely high potentiality of success, as recently postulated by others [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and is suggested as a potential drug for the treatment of COVID-19 in the very recent EASL-ESCMID position paper [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This is further supported by the great diversity between the molecular structure of the Sofosbuvir and the inhibitors of Influenza and Ebola viruses currently evaluated in clinical trials (Fig.
