<p id="Par50">Two main points need to be discussed on this topic. First, the effect of RAAS inhibitors on ACE2 is controversial
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>
 </sup>. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, the targets of ACE and ACE2 are different despite high structural similarity between the two enzymes. ACE converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, whereas ACE2 degrades angiotensin II to angiotensin (1–7). ACE inhibitors prevent the conversion from angiotensin I to angiotensin II, whereas ARBs inhibit the angiotensin II receptor type 1, which is downstream of angiotensin II
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, neither class of drugs affects ACE2 directly. Although some animal studies have shown that treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs can increase the expression of

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">129</xref>
 </sup>), findings from other preclinical studies were more mixed

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">130</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">132</xref>
 </sup>. In clinical studies, long-term exposure to the ACE inhibitor captopril

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">133</xref>
 </sup> or the ARB olmesartan
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">134</xref>
 </sup> was associated with increased plasma levels of angiotensin (1–7) or urinary levels of ACE2, respectively, indicating increased ACE2 activity. However, other studies have not shown evidence of upregulated ACE2 by RAAS inhibitors in patients with heart failure
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">135</xref>
 </sup>, aortic stenosis
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">136</xref>
 </sup>, atrial fibrillation
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">137</xref>
 </sup> or coronary artery disease
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>
 </sup>. These inconsistent results are likely to be attributable to the indirect effects of ACE inhibitors or ARBs on ACE2, which depend on conditions such as baseline expression levels of ACE2, dosing and treatment periods. Second, whether potential upregulation of ACE2 is harmful or protective is uncertain. Even if ACE inhibitors or ARBs can upregulate ACE2, no direct evidence has been found to show that upregulation of ACE2 affects susceptibility to viral infection
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>
 </sup>. Furthermore, as shown in 
 <italic>Ace2</italic>-knockout mice
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>
 </sup> and rhACE2 studies
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>
 </sup>, ACE2 is considered to be protective rather than harmful in settings of lung injury and CVDs
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>
 </sup>. Together, these findings indicate no benefit of withdrawal of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in protecting against COVID-19.
