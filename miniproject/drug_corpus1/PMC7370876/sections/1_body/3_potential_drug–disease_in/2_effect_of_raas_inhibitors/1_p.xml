 </sup>. Given that both ACE inhibitors and ARBs are commonly used worldwide for the treatment of hypertension and other CVDs, whether these drugs should be discontinued during the COVID-19 pandemic has become a pertinent question. Importantly, indiscriminate withdrawal of these drugs could harm high-risk patients. Several medical societies including the ACC, AHA, Chinese Society of Cardiology, ESC and the Heart Failure Society of America have issued statements recommending continuation of RAAS antagonists for those who are currently prescribed these agents

 </sup>, the use of RAAS inhibitors was not associated with a positive COVID-19 test, suggesting that these agents do not affect susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, the use of these agents was not associated with a substantial increase in the risk of severe or fatal illness among patients with COVID-19 (refs
