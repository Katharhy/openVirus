 </sup>. In a cohort study of 90 patients with COVID-19 who received hydroxychloroquine (withÂ or without azithromycin), those who received a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin had greater QT interval prolongation than those taking hydroxychloroquine alone

 </sup>. Furthermore, in a retrospective cohort study of 1,438 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in New York, treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin or both was compared with neither treatment

 </sup>. Given that some patients with COVID-19 might have impaired renal function owing to systemic illness, frequent electrocardiographic evaluation should be strongly considered in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin.
