<p id="Par52">Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been widely touted as potential treatment strategies for COVID-19 (refs

 </sup>). Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can potentially block virus entry into cells, particularly via the endosomal pathway, by inhibiting the glycosylation of host receptors, proteolytic processing and endosomal acidification

In a randomized study involving 62 patients with COVID-19 in China, patients in the treatment group received hydroxychloroquine (400 mg per day) for 5 days, whereas patients in the control group received standard treatment (oxygen therapy, antiviral agents, antibacterial agents and immunoglobulin, with or without corticosteroids)

 </sup>. Hydroxychloroquine improved the time to clinical recovery, body temperature recovery time, cough remission time and pneumonia-related symptoms compared with standard treatment alone. Furthermore, in a retrospective study from Wuhan involving 550 critically ill patients with COVID-19, mortality was significantly lower among patients treated with hydroxychloroquine plus standard treatment (which included other antiviral drugs and antibiotics) compared with standard treatment alone (18.8% versus 47.4%)

 </sup>. However, in a large observational study involving 1,376 patients from New York City, hydroxychloroquine treatment did not alter the risk of the composite end point of intubation or death

 </sup>. These inconsistent results show that the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine is still controversial and needs to be validated in large, randomized studies
