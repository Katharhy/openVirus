<p id="Par57">Several hurdles need to be overcome in the study of the mechanisms underlying COVID-19. First, biological experiments using SARS-CoV-2 can be performed only in laboratories with a biosafety level 3 rating

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">162</xref>
 </sup>. Second, the use of animal models to mimic the disease process is associated with numerous challenges
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">163</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">165</xref>
 </sup>. Given that cellular or tissue tropism is likely to be an important factor contributing to the diverse phenotypes of COVID-19 (ref.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>), mouse or rat models are not ideal to study host tropism because they are not as susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 as humans owing to differences in the amino acid sequence of ACE2 (ref.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">166</xref>
 </sup>). To use mice or rats, human 
 <italic>ACE2</italic> needs to be introduced artificially. Transgenic mice expressing 
 <italic>ACE2</italic> infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported to show signs of pneumonia, but the overall symptoms experienced by these mice are much milder than those in humans

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">163</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, alternative platforms might involve genome-edited mouse or rat models in which 
 <italic>Ace2</italic> is replaced by human 
 <italic>ACE2</italic>, other animal species that are naturally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (such as ferrets, hamsters and non-human primates)
