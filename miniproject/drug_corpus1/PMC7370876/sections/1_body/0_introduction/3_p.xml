 </sup>. A high prevalence of pre-existing CVD has been observed among patients with COVID-19, and these comorbidities are associated with increased mortality

 </sup>. Furthermore, COVID-19 seems to promote the development of cardiovascular disorders, such as myocardial injury, arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and venous thromboembolism

 <xref rid="Glos4" ref-type="list">Kawasaki disease</xref>, including cardiac dysfunction and coronary vessel abnormalities
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>. Together, these data indicate the presence of a bidirectional interaction between COVID-19 and the cardiovascular system, but the mechanisms underlying this interaction remain elusive. The high burden of systemic inflammation associated with COVID-19 has been proposed to accelerate the development of subclinical disorders or cause de novo cardiovascular damage

 </sup>. ACE2, which is a key surface protein for virus entry and part of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), is also thought to be involved in this interaction on the basis of findings from animal models
