<p id="Par13">Of note, several limitations of this Review need to be acknowledged. First, given the fast-moving nature of this research field, we will discuss and cite data from preprint reports on bioRxiv or medRxiv in addition to peer-reviewed articles that have cited preprint reports. These findings need to be interpreted with care and require validation in larger studies. Second, the majority of clinical COVID-19 data mentioned in this Review are from China, given their early experience with the disease. Finally, the clinical data on COVID-19 are predominantly derived from non-randomized studies. Therefore, potential biases and confounding factors associated with observational data, such as differences in patient background, diagnostic methods and health-care systems, should be taken into account.</p>
