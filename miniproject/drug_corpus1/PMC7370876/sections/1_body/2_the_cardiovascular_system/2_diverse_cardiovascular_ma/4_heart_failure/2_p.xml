 </sup>. Given that patients with COVID-19 are likely to be older and to have pre-existing comorbidities such as coronary artery disease, hypertension and diabetes, heart failure might be the result of an exacerbation of these pre-existing conditions, whether already diagnosed or unknown, or the uncovering of subclinical cardiac dysfunction. In particular, elderly patients with reduced diastolic function might develop heart failure with preserved EF during the course of COVID-19, which can be triggered by high fever, tachycardia, excessive hydration and impaired renal function

 </sup>). Acute myocardial injury and ACS triggered by COVID-19 can also aggravate pre-existing heart disease or provoke contractile dysfunction. In the advanced stages of COVID-19, the response of the immune system to infection might trigger the development of stress-induced cardiomyopathy or cytokine-related myocardial dysfunction, as with sepsis-associated cardiac dysfunction
