<p id="Par34">Clinical observations of increased thromboembolic events in patients with COVID-19 suggest the presence of a hypercoagulable state. Venous thromboembolism, which includes deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is a common complication in critically ill patients with COVID-19. An autopsy study revealed that deep vein thrombosis was present in 7 of 12 patients who died with COVID-19 in whom venous thromboembolism was not suspected before death, whereas pulmonary embolism was identified in 4 of the 12 patients
