<p id="Par19">CVD is a common comorbidity observed in patients infected with SARS or MERS (with a prevalence of 10% and 30%, respectively)

 </sup>. A series of reports on the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have also described similar findings
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>. Early reports from China found that CVD and its risk factors, such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus, were common pre-existing conditions in patients with COVID-19, but the definition of CVD used in each study was vague

 </sup> (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In an early report from Wuhan involving 41 patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19 by 2 January 2020, the prevalence of any comorbidity was 32% and the most common underlying diseases were diabetes (20%), hypertension (15%) and other CVDs (15%)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>. The high prevalence of these comorbidities was confirmed in subsequent studies
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>
 </sup>. Importantly, the prevalence of these pre-existing conditions was higher in critically ill patients (such as those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU)) and in those who died. In a single-centre cohort study of 138 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Wuhan, 46% of patients had any comorbidity (72% of patients in the ICU), 31% of patients had hypertension (58% of patients in the ICU), 15% of patients had other CVDs (25% of patients in the ICU) and 10% of patients had diabetes (22% of patients in the ICU)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>. Similarly, in a multicentre cohort study involving 191 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Wuhan, 48% of patients had any comorbidity (67% of those who died), 30% of patients had hypertension (48% of those who died), 19% of patients had diabetes (31% of those who died) and 8% of patients had coronary heart disease (24% of those who died)
 <sup>

 </sup>. Furthermore, in a report involving 1,099 patients with COVID-19 from mainland China, 24% of patients had any comorbidity (39% of critically ill patients), 15% of patients had hypertension (24% of critically ill patients), 7% of patients had diabetes (16% of critically ill patients) and 3% of patients had coronary heart disease (6% of critically ill patients)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
 </sup>. The overall 
 <xref rid="Glos9" ref-type="list">case fatality rate</xref> of COVID-19 reported by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention as of 11 February 2020 was 2.3% (1,023 deaths among 44,672 confirmed cases)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>
 </sup>. The individual case fatality rate of patients with CVD was 10.5% (highest among those with any comorbidities, including chronic respiratory disease (6.3%) or cancer (5.6%)), the case fatality rate of patients with diabetes was 7.3% and that of patients with hypertension was 6.0%
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>
 </sup>. Of note, these early approximations of case fatality rate are likely to be overestimated given that the estimates did not account for the many people who had the virus but were not tested.
