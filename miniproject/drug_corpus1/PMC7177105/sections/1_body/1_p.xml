 </xref> The high pathogenic tendency of coronaviruses, to affect humans, were considered, only with the emergence of two life threatening epidemics, SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in 2002â€“2003 in China and approximately ten years later MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) in the Middle Eastern Countries.

 </xref> Both SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are considered to have their origin from bats. The genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to be 79.6% identical to that of SARS-CoV and 96% identical to a bat coronavirus.

 </xref> Despite the initial zoonotic nature of COVID-19, now the rapid spread is by human to human contact with the typical clinical features of fever, cough which is mostly nonproductive, malaise, dyspnoea and pneumonia.

 </xref> Therefore, besides the spread of the virus through oral and nasal secretions, a possibility of a fecal-oral transmission has been implicated. Few cases of acute myocardial injury and chronic cardiovascular damage have been reported in patients with COVID-19 as the disease progresses.

 </xref> Transmission can also occur early in the disease process, even before the symptoms set in, highlighting the transmission potential of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients.
