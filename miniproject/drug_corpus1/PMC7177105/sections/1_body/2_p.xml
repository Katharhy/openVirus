 </xref> The structural proteins include the spike surface glycoprotein (S), small envelope protein (E), matrix protein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N).
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>11</sup>
 </xref> It is the spike surface protein that plays a crucial role in binding of the virus to the host cell receptors. SARS-CoV primarily binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the host cell.
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>11</sup>
 </xref> CD209L has also been implicated as a possible second receptor. MERS-CoV uses dipeptidyl peptidase 4 as the main receptor. In case of SARS-CoV-2, it has been confirmed that human ACE2 is the main receptor for viral entry into the host cell.
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>12</sup>
 </xref> The entry of coronavirus into the host cell is a multi-step process using multiple distinct domains in the spike protein that facilitates attachment of the virus to the surface of the cell, engagement of the receptor, processing of proteases and membrane fusion. Genomic analysis of the SARS-CoV-2, also reveals the presence of an activation site on the spike protein, which is activated by furin, an enzyme which is found abundantly in many human tissues, the presence of which can be attributed to its rapid spread.
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>13</sup>
 </xref> Following viral attachment to the host cell receptor, the entry of the virus into the cell, additionally requires the priming of the spike protein by cellular proteases, which is responsible for cleavage of the spike protein and subsequent fusion of the viral and cellular membranes.
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>14</sup>
 </xref> As mentioned earlier, the SARS-CoV uses ACE2 as the receptor for viral entry and TMPRSS2 for priming of the spike protein.
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>14</sup>
 </xref> The spike protein of MERS-CoV is activated by cellular proteases furin (a proprotein convertase present predominantly in golgi apparatus and cell surface), cathepsin L (an endosomal cysteine protease) and TMPRSS2 (a type II transmembrane serine protease).
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>15</sup>
 </xref> The priming of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-19 also has been reported to be carried out by TMPRSS2.
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>14</sup>
 </xref> The confirmed cases of COVID-19 and the mortality caused already surpass that of SARS and MERS.
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>1</sup>
 </xref> This is a cause of great concern and warrants the need for prompt diagnosis, early intervention and adequate measures to contain the rapid pandemic spread.
