 </xref> reported that ACE2 is abundantly expressed in the epithelial cells of the oral mucosa, with higher expression in the tongue, in comparison to the buccal and gingival tissues. These findings suggest that the oral cavity has high susceptibility to COVID-19 infection. Moreover, analysis of the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) also provides a non-invasive diagnostic method. GCF can be collected by various techniques, but most studies use the absorption technique by employing paper strips or points.

 </xref> GCF samples have been studied to isolate and assess Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) and human cytomegalovirus (CMV) earlier.

 </xref> Therefore, assessing the presence of COVID-19 virus in the GCF, will be yet another convenient, non-invasive method, to isolate the virus and additionally, to confirm the pathway of entry into the oral cavity.
