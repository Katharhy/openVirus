<p id="p0030">The data is separately trained on three different train and validation splits and hyperparameters with minimum validation root mean squared error (RMSE). The hyperparameters we specifically focus on tuning are the 
 <italic>lookback</italic> and 
 <italic>lookahead</italic>. The split of train and test data for the tuned model is approximately maintained at an 80:20 ratio based on the initial 
 <italic>lookback</italic> and 
 <italic>lookahead</italic> of 1 and 1 respectively, although the model is capable of handling other splits based on the data. The smaller splits of train and validation sets are approximately maintained at a 60:20 ratio. Intuitively, an increase in the 
 <italic>lookback</italic> and 
 <italic>lookahead</italic> parameters reduces the number of training samples and testing samples respectively and leads to erroneous results. For experimentation purposes, we test 
 <italic>lookback</italic> in the range of 1 and 7 and 
 <italic>lookahead</italic> in the range of 5 and 7 for reasonable future predictions, while adhering to the index constraints on individual train, validation, and test data.
