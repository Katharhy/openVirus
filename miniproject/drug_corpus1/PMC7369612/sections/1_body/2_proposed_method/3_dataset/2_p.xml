<p id="p0028">For the purpose of training, validation and testing, we utilize data from the Johns Hopkins University repository 
 <xref rid="bib0037" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. For experimental purposes, we consider data over the period from January 22, to June 30. The dataset provides time-series data of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. We separately consider each of these scenarios, as well as look into more fine-grained data at the county-level in order to analyse the effectiveness of mitigation measures.
