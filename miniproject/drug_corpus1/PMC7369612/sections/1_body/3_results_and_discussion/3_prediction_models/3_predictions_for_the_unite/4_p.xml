The LSTM predictions show similar flattening trend compared to the actual cumulative COVID-19 cases that implies the mitigation measures have been successful. The LSTM model is capable of predicting the flattened curve as achieved by Italy. The deaths in Italy show a similar trend as that of the cases. The small deviation in the predictions shows that mitigation measures may still need to be enforced.
