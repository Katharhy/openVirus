 <xref rid="fig0012" ref-type="fig">Figs.Â 12</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig0013" ref-type="fig">13</xref> show predictions for COVID-19 cases and deaths respectively in Los Angeles, California. The cases and deaths depict an increasing trend that is also indicated by the predictions. In this situation however, there is a small divergence between the predicted and actual curves, which shows that more mitigation measures may need to be introduced.
