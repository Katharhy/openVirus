<p id="p0035">We discuss our results on two levels: country-level and county-level data on COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. In addition to plotting the predicted values and actual values, we also plot a baseline in all figures that is calculated as the moving average over the actual values in the 
 <italic>lookback</italic> window. Overall, it was observed that it was harder to predict the number of comfirmed cases compared to the number of deaths. It was also observed in general that shorter values of 
 <italic>lookback</italic> and 
 <italic>lookahead</italic> resulted in lower values of both the train and test RMSE. However, in the present situation, it is of more interest to discuss the interpretation of what the LSTM predictions are indicative of instead of purely focusing on the values of the RMSE.
