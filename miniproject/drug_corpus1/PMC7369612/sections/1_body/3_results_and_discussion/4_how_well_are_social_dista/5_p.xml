<p id="p0054">The slope indicates the trend of the mitigation measures â€“ a positive value of slope indicates that the current mitigation and social distancing are not working as expected while a negative value of slope indicates that the current mitigation and social distancing are working well. In other words, a positive slope indicates an increase in the rate of infections or deaths while a negative slope indicates a decrease in the rate of infections or deaths. The intercept gives an approximation of the increase/decrease in the rate of infections or deaths depending on a positive/negative value. The RMSE gives an estimate of the stabilization of the rate of infections/deaths.</p>
