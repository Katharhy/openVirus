<p id="p0055">Mitigation measures did not work in Los Angeles, California as rate of infections is increasing even though the rate of deaths shows a downward trend. Similarly, mitigation measures did not work in Hillsborough, Florida and Fulton, Georgia because of the rising infection rates even though the death rates show a trend of slowing down. Similar trends are also seen in New York City, New York and Cook, Illinois, which show a rise in infection rates. King, Washington, shows an increasing trend for infection rates even though the death rates appear to have stabilized. Although Dallas, Texas and Maricopa, Arizona show downward trends for infection rates, the rising trends for death rates show that mitigation measures are yet to work.</p>
