<p id="p0051">We now aim at understanding how well the current mitigation measures are working. Various countries placed nationwide lockdowns, while others implemented phased strategies based on affected individual locations. The goal is to understand how social distancing had made the situation better or worse. The analyses provided are based on our proposed LSTM model. In order to do this, we consider a shorter and longer window size. In this context, we fix the 
 <italic>lookback</italic> parameter as 1 and use the line of best fit on the rate of change of the difference between the smaller 
 <italic>lookahead</italic> parameter of 1 and a larger 
 <italic>lookahead</italic> parameter of 5. The analyses can also be carried out on individual parameters, however, for experimental purposes we choose to compute the rate on the difference in order to obtain a smoother curve for the purpose of this work. Again, the model can be used for this type of analyses for the near future as well, which will be valuable for nations or specific locations to decide whether to tighten or loosen restrictions based on the trend of how well their mitigation policies will work in the near future.
