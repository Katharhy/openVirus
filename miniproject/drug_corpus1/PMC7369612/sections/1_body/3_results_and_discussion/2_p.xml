<p id="p0034">Our analyses based on our proposed LSTM model are divided into two main parts: the prediction models that show predictions of COVID-19 confirmed cases/deaths and evaluations on how well social distancing/mitigation measures are working in the present scenario. In all our plots, dates in January, February, March, April, May, and June are prefixed with ‘J’, ‘F’, ‘M’, ‘A’, ‘MA’, and ‘JU’ respectively followed by the day of the month. As aforementioned, all modeling is carried out based on the data provided for a specific location.</p>
