<p id="p0026">In the present work, we explore the possibilities of using an LSTM-based approach to learn patterns in COVID-19 data. Statistical learning models require thorough understanding of data and coefficient tuning in order to fit models suitable for prediction. However, compared to statistical learning, machine learning approaches involve allowing the model to automatically learn complex patterns from the data based on the model constructed and tuned hyperparameters. This is particularly useful for handling epidemiological time-series data like that of COVID-19 where the cumulative curves of infections and deaths vary with respect to time and place.</p>
