 <xref rid="bib0034" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> have proposed a deep learning framework ‘COVID-19 detection neural network’ or ‘COVNet’ to distinguish CT scans of COVID-19 patients from those of ‘CAP (Community Acquired Pneumonia)’ and other non-pneumonia diseases. They have proposed a three-dimensional model involving ResNet50, max-pooling, and a fully connected layer to identify the presence of COVID-19 in the images.
