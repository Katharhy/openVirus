 <xref rid="bib0027" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> proposed a machine learning model based on stacked auto-encoders to forecast cumulative COVID-19 cases in China till April 2020 based on past cumulative data. They also grouped the cities and provinces in clusters based on the features extracted from their proposed auto-encoder model. Similar LSTM approaches have also been explored in order to understand patient related data
