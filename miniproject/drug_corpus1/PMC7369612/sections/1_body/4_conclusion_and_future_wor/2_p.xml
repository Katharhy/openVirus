<p id="p0059">The COVID-19 pandemic affected countries globally and led to an unprecedented number of infections and deaths. Countries took vital steps in mitigating the pandemic by enforcing lockdowns, social distancing, and a variety of other mitigation measures. In this paper, we propose an LSTM based learning model that can learn from the cumulative rise in COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths and provide valuable insights on how well mitigation measures are working quantitatively in terms of the rate of infections and deaths. The predictions of the model can be helpful for countries deciding to make important decisions regarding the effects of currently implemented mitigation measures and aid in making plans for reopening various places. We provide analyses at both the country and county levels.</p>
