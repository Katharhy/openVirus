<p>Influenza virus is one of the major causes of contagious respiratory disease. Annual influenza epidemics can claim up to 650,000 lives every year, causing a heavy burden to the healthcare system. Genome of influenza A virus consists eight segments of single stranded, negative sense viral RNA (vRNA) which is packaged into a rod-shape viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex scaffold [

 <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This complex is assembled by multiple nucleoproteins (NPs) and a heterotrimeric RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). Transcription and replication of the vRNA are sophisticatedly controlled by the interaction between the RdRP subunits and NP [
