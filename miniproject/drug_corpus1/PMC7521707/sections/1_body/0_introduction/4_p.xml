<p>X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy have demonstrated inter-subunit interactions within the RdRP to high resolution [

 <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, NP-PB2 interaction is to-date not clearly defined, Three independent regions of NP (aa 1–161, 255–340, 340–465) were found to bind PB2 [
 <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] while two fragments of PB2 (aa 1–269 and 580–683) were shown to interact with NP [
 <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], D605 of PB2 ‘627-domain’ was later mapped to interact with NP where V606 of PB2 also showed a weak binding with NP [
 <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. On the other hand how the N-terminal fragment of PB2 interacts with NP is not clear. 
 <italic>In silico</italic> docking suggested the interaction occurred in the first 24 amino acids [
 <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study claimed PB2 interacts with NP via its N-terminal 269 residues [
 <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This report aims at revealing how NP interacts with the N-terminal region of PB2.
