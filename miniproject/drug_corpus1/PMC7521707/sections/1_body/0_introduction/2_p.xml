<p>RdRP of influenza A virus is composed of subunits PA, PB1 and PB2. PB1 forms the core and is wrapped by PA C-terminal domain and PB2 N-terminal domain [
 <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The catalytic site of the RNA polymerase resides in PB1 which contains the finger, palm and thumb subdomains. N-terminal domain of PA subunit is responsible for endonuclease activity [
 <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and it is connected to a large C-terminal domain by a linker [

 <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Other than forming the polymerase core with PB1, PB2 subunit consists of several domains serving multiple purposes. Host range determination of influenza A virus is achieved by a well-studied residue at position 627 of PB2, which gives the name of PB2 ‘627-domain’ (amino acids 538–693) [
 <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Polymerase variants without ‘627-domain’ maintained its functions 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> but not in cells [
 <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], suggesting its role in host cell interaction. The cap-binding domain of PB2 (aa 320–483) is involved in the cap-snatching process. It binds host 5’ capped RNAs for later cleavage by the PA endonuclease to produce capped RNA fragment used as primer for the initiation of transcription of viral genome [
