<p>0.125 μg each of pcDNA-PA, pcDNA-PB1, pcDNA-PB2 or mutants and pcDNA-NP, pPOLI-Luc-RT and pEGFP plasmids were diluted to 12.5 μl in OptiMEM (Life Technologies) and added to another 12.5 μl OptiMEM with 1.05 μl of Lipofectamine 2000. pcDNA3 empty vector was used to replace as pcDNA-PB2 negative control. The transfection mixture was incubated for 20 min in a 96-well plate before adding 75 μl 1x10
 <sup>5</sup> HEK 293T cell suspension in DMEM to the well. At 48 h post-transfection, GFP fluorescent signal was measured by microplate reader (BMG labtech) at excitation wavelength of 470nm and emission wavelength of 515nm. Subsequently, cells were lysed by Steady-Glo assay reagent (Promega) for 5 min before luminescence signal was measured. The polymerase activity was expressed as a ratio of luminescence to GFP signal.
