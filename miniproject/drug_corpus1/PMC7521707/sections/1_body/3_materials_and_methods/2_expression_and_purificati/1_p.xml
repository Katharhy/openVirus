<p>Plasmids were transformed into BL21 (DE3) pLysS competent E. coli. 0.4 mM IPTG was added to the bacterial cultures when OD
 <sub>600</sub> of the cultures reached 0.6–0.8 for induction of protein expression. Bacterial cultures were incubated overnight at 18°C and 21°C for PB2 cap-binding domain and NP respectively. Proteins were purified as described previously [

 <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Cells were harvested and lysed by sonication, His-tagged proteins expressed were captured by Ni-sepharose (GE Healthcare) and further purified by size exclusion chromatography.
