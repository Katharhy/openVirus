<p>Purified PB2 cap-binding domain was immobilized on NHS-activated sepharose (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, BSA was immobilized in negative control. 50μM wild-type purified NP and 10μM 24-nucleotide long 2’-O-methylated RNA (RiboBio) were added accordingly for 1-hour incubation in buffer (50mM Tris–HCl pH 8, 300mM NaCl). The beads were then washed with the buffer and eluted in 1.5M NaCl. The eluted fractions were analysed in 12% SDS-PAGE, proteins were stained and visualized by coomassie blue.</p>
