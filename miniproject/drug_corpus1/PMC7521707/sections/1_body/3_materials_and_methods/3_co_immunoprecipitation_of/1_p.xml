 <sup>6</sup> HEK 293 cells were seeded in 6cm dish 24 hours before transfection. 4μg of myc-tagged wild-type or PB2 fragment encoding plasmids and 1μg of pcDNA-NP were transfected with lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in IP buffer (50mM Tris pH 7.6, 150mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) 48 hours after transfection. Cell lysate was centrifuged at 18000g, 4°C for 10 minutes to remove cell debris. The supernatant was incubated with anti-myc antibodies (Cell signaling) and 10U RNase A (Sigma Aldrich) when appropriate for overnight at 4°C. Protein A agarose (Sigma Aldrich) was added to each sample for further incubation at 4°C for 1.5 hours. The beads were washed with IP buffer before boiled in SDS loading buffer and analysed by Western blot. For co-immunoprecipitation of RNP complex, 8x10
 <sup>5</sup> HEK 293T cells were seeded in 6 well plate 24 hour before transfection. 1 μg of each plasmid encoding myc-tagged PA, untagged PB1 D446Y mutant, PB2 wild-type or mutant, NP were transfected into the cells with pPOLI-NA-RT. Cells were harvested and analysed as mentioned above.
