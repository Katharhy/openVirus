<p>Virus strain used in this study was A/Hong Kong/156/97. HEK 293 cells (Catalogue number: CRL-1573) and HEK 293T cells (Catalogue number: CRL-11268) were obtained from ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA and maintained under 37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies) with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (Life Technologies). Anti-NP serum was prepared from NP immunized rabbits by Guangdong Medical Laboratory Animal Centre, specificity of the anti-serum was tested (

Anti-PB1 antibodies were obtained from bei resources (Catalogue number: NR-31691) and anti-PB2 antibodies were purchased from GeneTex (Catalogue number: GTX125926-S). Plasmids pcDNA-PA, pcDNA-PB1, pcDNA-PB2 and pcDNA-NP encoding sequences of influenza strain A/Hong Kong/156/97 RNP subunits were kind gifts from Prof. Ervin Fodor (University of Oxford) and was described previously [
 <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. While pPOLI-Luc-RT, pEGFP and pPOLI-NA-RT were received from Prof. L.L.M Poon (The University of Hong Kong). Plasmids encoding myc-tagged PA, PB2 were generated by inserting the corresponding sequences into vector pcDNA3.1/myc-his A (Invitrogen) by T4 DNA ligase (ThermoFisher) after the inserts and vectors were digested by restriction enzymes (NEB). PB2 fragment sequences were generated by PCR with forward and reverse primers amplifying the fragment regions. Sequences with point mutation were produced by overlap extension PCR. Sequences were also inserted into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) or pcDNA3.1/myc-his A. Plasmids for expression of NP and PB2 cap-binding domain in
