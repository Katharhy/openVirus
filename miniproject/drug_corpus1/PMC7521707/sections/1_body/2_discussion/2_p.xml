<p>In our study, mutating basic residues K331, R332 and N429 to alanine on PB2 CBD led to a reduced RNP activity, which implied a role of these residues in replication or transcription of influenza viral genome. In fact, Hara et al. also showed reduced polymerase activity with K331A/R332A double mutations on PB2 [

Our work shows that K331 reduced NP binding upon mutation to alanine, disrupted NP-PB2 cap-binding domain interaction and also the formation of the RNP complex. As such, we have illustrated the importance of NP-CBD interaction in the RNP formation which is likely mediated by K331 in PB2.
