<p>In our previous work [
 <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] we identified that PB2 627-domain interacted with NP and the interaction was mediated by PB2 D605. Here in this work we showed that PB2 also interacts with NP via its cap-binding domain, mediated by RNA. Since PB2 ‘627-domain’ adopts radically different conformations during RNA synthesis [
 <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], NP-‘627-domain’ interaction could be important in supporting the dynamic replication and transcription activities. Recent structural work provided a ‘sliding’ model that the transcribing polymerase slides on the chain of NP oligomers [
 <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This ‘sliding’ process may likely be supported by the flexible and protruding ‘627-domain’ of PB2 as the radically rearranging ‘627-domain’ interacts with NP oligomers and may drive the polymerase to slide along the chain of NP oligomers. The cap-binding domain on the other hand is capable of 
 <italic>in situ</italic> rotation during the transcription process which is relatively less flexible. It is possible that the cap-binding domain anchors both NP and the vRNA or cRNA during their formation. Our observation that K331A disrupted vRNP formation provides support to this postulation. Taken together, our work provides a more in-depth understanding on the different NP-PB2 interaction for the function of the RNP.
