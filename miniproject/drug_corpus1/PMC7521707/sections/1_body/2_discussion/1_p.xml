<p>The current study reveals a novel interaction between NP and PB2 cap-binding domain. In a previous study, residue 1–320 of PB2 expressed in 
 <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes was found to bind GST-NP in GST pulldown assay [
 <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However in this study, we showed that this PB2 fragment precipitated NP very weakly in co-immunoprecipitation experiment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239899.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). In contrast, the interaction between PB2 cap-binding domain and NP was much stronger (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239899.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Focusing on the CBD, we further defined important residues for NP-binding and delineated the underlying mechanism. In fact our result differs from the finding of Poole et al. who showed no interaction between GST-NP and PB2 aa 283–590 [
 <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] which contained the CBD residues. This discrepancy is probably due to the fact that aa 283–590 of PB2 is not a well-defined region. According to the recently published structures, the PB2 fragment used by Poole et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] comprises part of the mid domain (aa 247–319), the cap-binding domain (aa 320–483), the cap-627 linker (aa 484–538) and part of the 627 domain (aa 539–680) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239899.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). As a result, this multi-domain fragment might not be properly folded for the PB2-NP interaction.
