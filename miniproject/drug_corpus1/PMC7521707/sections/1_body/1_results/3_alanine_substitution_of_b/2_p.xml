<p>We postulated that RNA-mediated NP-CBD interaction could be important for the formation of a functional vRNP. As such, we attempted to reconstitute the RNP complex with a replication mutant PB1 D446Y [

Employing PB1 D446Y mutant instead of wild-type PB1 eliminated any possible effects due to variation in the replication efficiency of the RdRP and allowed us to compare vRNP formation on the basis of a fixed amount of vRNA. We co-transfected into HEK 293T cells plasmids expressing PB1-D446Y, PB2 (wild-type or mutants), NP, myc-tagged PA and a pPol-NA-RT plasmid which provided the genomic vRNA of segment 6 serving as template. In the context of PB2 K331A, about 50% less NP was co-immunoprecipitated, compared to the wild-type PB2, while such decrease was not observed by PB2 R332A or N429A mutations (
