<p>We then attempted to identify residues on PB2 CBD which may be important in mediating NP binding. As RNA is involved in the interaction, basic residues around the cap binding site of PB2 cap-binding domain may be involved in binding RNA and NP. Residue K331, R332, K339, K353, N429 and H432 on the surface of the cap-binding pocket were found to bind or are in close proximity of the capped RNA primer of a transcribing polymerase [
