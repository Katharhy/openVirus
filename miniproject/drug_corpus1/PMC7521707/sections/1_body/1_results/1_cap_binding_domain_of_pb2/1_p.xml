<p>We first set forth to identify and confirm the regions on PB2 interacting with NP using a co-immunoprecipitation assay. PB2 truncation mutants were generated by deletion mutagenesis and tagged with myc peptide. Myc-tagged PB2 deletion mutants and NP were co-expressed in HEK 293 cells by transfection. Consistent with previous findings, full-length PB2 could efficiently precipitate NP and PB2 fragment 1–483 could precipitate comparable amount of NP as full-length (

This fragment was then further divided into two regions, PB2 fragment 1–320 and cap-binding domain (aa 320–483), to locate the NP-binding region. Fragment 1–320 interacted very weakly with NP despite this fragment contained the N-terminal 269 residues which was proposed for NP binding [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239899.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, lane 5–8). Which was comparable to the amount precipitated by full-length PB2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239899.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Hence, the major NP-binding region resided within the PB2 N-terminal in the cap-binding domain (aa 320–483).
