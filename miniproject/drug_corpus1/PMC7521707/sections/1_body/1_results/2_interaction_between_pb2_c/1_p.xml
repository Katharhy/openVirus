<p>Cap-binding domain of PB2 was reported for its cap-snatching activity during transcription of the influenza viral genome [
 <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This domain is responsible for binding the 5’ methyl cap of the host mRNA and thus facilitating cleavage by PA endonuclease. After cleavage, the domain rotates 
 <italic>in situ</italic> to direct cleaved mRNA to the PB1 active site for priming transcription reaction. RNA binding activity of the CBD has been reported and at the same time, NP also has a high affinity to RNA [
 <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We then therefore investigate whether RNA play any roles in mediating NP-CBD interaction. To this end we added RNase A into the cell lysate lysate to remove endogenous RNA before co-immmunoprecipitation. After RNA cleavage, cap-binding domain became unable to pull down NP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239899.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). This observation suggested the requirement of RNA in the interaction between NP and PB2 cap-binding domain. We then tested whether the interaction must be mediated by a capped, primer-like RNA. Thus we co-expressed a cap-binding domain variant E361A with NP in HEK 293 cells and repeated the co-immunoprecipitation analysis. E361A mutation was previously reported to reduce the affinity of cap-binding domain to 7-methylguanosine 5’-triphosphate (m
 <sup>7</sup>GTP), a structural analogue of eukaryotic cellular mRNA caps, by more than 8 folds [
 <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Comparable amount of NP was co-immunoprecipitated by E361A and wild-type PB2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239899.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), suggesting the cap of RNA is not needed for the interaction. We also investigated whether the sequence of RNA is important for the interaction. NP and PB2 cap-binding domain were individually expressed in 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>coli</italic> and purified for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> binding test. A short synthetic 2’-O-methylated RNA of 24 nucleotides long was added. NP was detected in the elution only when the synthetic RNA was added (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239899.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), suggesting that NP-PB2 cap-binding domain interaction is independent of the sequence of RNA. Taken together, our results showed that NP-CBD interaction requires the presence of RNA but not a 5’methyl cap or a specific sequence.
