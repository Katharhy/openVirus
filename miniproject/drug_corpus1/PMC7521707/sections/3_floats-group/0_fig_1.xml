  <title>Co-immunoprecipitation analysis of NP and PB2 N-terminal fragments.</title>
  <p>(A) Expression of NP, PB2 and PB2 truncation mutants. Full length PB2 and three truncated constructs (aa 1–483, 1–320 and CBD) of myc-tagged PB2 were co-transfected with NP into HEK 293 cells. Total cell lysate was collected after 48-hour incubation to detect NP and myc-tagged PB2 fragments expression by Western blotting analysis. (B) Co-immunoprecipitation of NP and PB2 or PB2 fragments. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed with overnight incubation of anti-myc antibody with cell lysate, protein A agarose was used to precipitate the antibody. Amount of NP precipitated was detected by anti-NP serum, and the amount of myc-tagged PB2 and PB2 fragments were detected by anti-myc antibody. FL: Full-length PB2. CBD: Cap-binding domain.</p>
