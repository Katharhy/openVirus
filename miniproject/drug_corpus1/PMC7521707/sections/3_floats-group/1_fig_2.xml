  <title>Characterization of cap-binding domain-NP interaction.</title>
  <p>(A) Co-immunoprecipitation of NP and myc-tagged PB2 cap-binding domain with and without addition of RNase A. The bar represents the mean ratio ± standard errors from two independent experiments. *The p-values are smaller or equal to 0.05 in two-tailed Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test. (B) Expression of NP, PB2 cap-binding domain and E361A variant. Wild-type cap-binding domain (CBD WT) or E361A mutant was co-transfected with NP into HEK 293 cells. Protein expression was detected by anti-NP serum and anti-myc antibody. (C) Pull-down assay investigating NP-PB2 cap-binding domain binding. NHS-activated sepharose was used to immobilize 50μM PB2 CBD, BSA was immobilized as control (sample 4). Purified NP and 24-nt 2’-O-methylated RNA were added accordingly, the mixtures were washed extensively after 1 hour incubation. 1.5M NaCl was used to elute the protein captured by CBD. Samples of wash and elution fractions were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and detected by coomassie blue staining. WT: Wild type.
