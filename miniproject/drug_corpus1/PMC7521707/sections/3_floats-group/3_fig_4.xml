  <title>Effects of PB2 variants on NP-polymerase interaction.</title>
  <p>(A) Co-immunoprecipitaion of NP-polymerase. Plasmids encoding myc-tagged PA, PB1, PB2 or its variants, pPOLI-NA-RT were co-transfected with NP into HEK 293T cells, myc-tagged empty vector was used as negative control. Cells were harvested after 48-hour incubation. Cell lysates were incubated overnight with or without anti-myc antibody. Amount of NP co-immunoprecipitated with PB2 variants were compared to that precipitated from the wild-type. The bar represents the mean ratio ± standard errors from three independent experiments. *The p-values are smaller or equal to 0.05 in two-tailed Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test. (B) Expression of RNP subunits. Levels of expression of RNP subunits were detected by corresponding anti-bodies.
