  <title>Structure of PB2 and PB2 cap-binding domain.</title>
  <p>(A) Schematic of multiple domains of PB2. Schematic of NP was added to indicate NP binding site. Studied regions (aa 1–320, CBD and aa 1–483) were highlighted. (B) (Left) Structure of PB2 from crystal structure of influenza polymerase (PDB ID: 4WSB). Structure showed that domains of PB2 are joined by several flexible linkers and suggested a high degree of flexibility. Studied region was indicated by arrow and studied amino acids of the cap-binding domain were indicated in red. (Right) Structure of PB2 cap-binding domain. Basic residues around the exit of cap-binding pocket (K331, R332, K339, K353, N429, H432) were indicated in red. (PDB ID: 4CB4).</p>
