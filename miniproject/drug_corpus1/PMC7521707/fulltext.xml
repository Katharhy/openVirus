The helical scaffold of RNP is maintained by nucleoprotein (NP). Previous studies have revealed that NP interacts with both PB2 N-terminal and C-terminal regions, with both regions sharing similar affinity to NP as revealed in co-immunoprecipitation assay. Our work here suggests that the interaction between NP and PB2 N-terminal region lies in the cap-binding domain (residue 320&#x02013;483). By co-immunoprecipitation assay, the interaction was found to involve RNA. On the other hand, the cap-binding activity was not essential in the interaction. As shown by the NHS pull-down assay, a specific RNA sequence was not required. Among the cap-binding domain, residues K331 and R332 of PB2 play a role in RNP function so that polymerase activity was reduced when these residues were mutated, while K331 was found to be more crucial in the NP interaction. Collectively, our findings suggest a new binding mode between NP and PB2 which was mediated by RNA, and such interaction may provide a novel interacting site for influenza drug development.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>PC Shaw received a grant (Project number: 14113114) from the Research Grants Council <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/rgc/">https://www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/rgc/</ext-link> and a Theme-based Research Grant (Project number: T11-705/14N) from Hong Kong SAR. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/rgc/funded_research/layman/theme/themes.html">https://www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/rgc/funded_research/layman/theme/themes.html</ext-link> The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Influenza virus is one of the major causes of contagious respiratory disease. Annual influenza epidemics can claim up to 650,000 lives every year, causing a heavy burden to the healthcare system. Genome of influenza A virus consists eight segments of single stranded, negative sense viral RNA (vRNA) which is packaged into a rod-shape viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex scaffold [<xref rid="pone.0239899.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0239899.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This complex is assembled by multiple nucleoproteins (NPs) and a heterotrimeric RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). Transcription and replication of the vRNA are sophisticatedly controlled by the interaction between the RdRP subunits and NP [<xref rid="pone.0239899.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. NP oligomer is arranged in a double helical conformation to coat vRNA while the RdRP binds the 3&#x02019; and 5&#x02019; termini of the vRNA [<xref rid="pone.0239899.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>RdRP of influenza A virus is composed of subunits PA, PB1 and PB2. PB1 forms the core and is wrapped by PA C-terminal domain and PB2 N-terminal domain [<xref rid="pone.0239899.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The catalytic site of the RNA polymerase resides in PB1 which contains the finger, palm and thumb subdomains. N-terminal domain of PA subunit is responsible for endonuclease activity [<xref rid="pone.0239899.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and it is connected to a large C-terminal domain by a linker [<xref rid="pone.0239899.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Other than forming the polymerase core with PB1, PB2 subunit consists of several domains serving multiple purposes. Host range determination of influenza A virus is achieved by a well-studied residue at position 627 of PB2, which gives the name of PB2 &#x02018;627-domain&#x02019; (amino acids 538&#x02013;693) [<xref rid="pone.0239899.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Polymerase variants without &#x02018;627-domain&#x02019; maintained its functions <italic>in vitro</italic> but not in cells [<xref rid="pone.0239899.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], suggesting its role in host cell interaction. The cap-binding domain of PB2 (aa 320&#x02013;483) is involved in the cap-snatching process. It binds host 5&#x02019; capped RNAs for later cleavage by the PA endonuclease to produce capped RNA fragment used as primer for the initiation of transcription of viral genome [<xref rid="pone.0239899.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>NP is the most abundant protein in the RNP complex, NP monomers are linked together by insertion the tail-loop of one NP protomer to its neighbouring molecule. NP oligomerization provides a RNA-binding surface for vRNA and complementary RNA (cRNA) [<xref rid="pone.0239899.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Previous studies show that NP interacts with all three polymerase subunits [<xref rid="pone.0239899.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0239899.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Earlier studies suggested that NP served as a switch between transcription and replication [<xref rid="pone.0239899.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0239899.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], which was challenged by a more recent evidence showing that NP is recruited as an elongation factor during vRNA and cRNA synthesis but not as a switch [<xref rid="pone.0239899.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy have demonstrated inter-subunit interactions within the RdRP to high resolution [<xref rid="pone.0239899.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, NP-PB2 interaction is to-date not clearly defined, Three independent regions of NP (aa 1&#x02013;161, 255&#x02013;340, 340&#x02013;465) were found to bind PB2 [<xref rid="pone.0239899.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] while two fragments of PB2 (aa 1&#x02013;269 and 580&#x02013;683) were shown to interact with NP [<xref rid="pone.0239899.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], D605 of PB2 &#x02018;627-domain&#x02019; was later mapped to interact with NP where V606 of PB2 also showed a weak binding with NP [<xref rid="pone.0239899.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. On the other hand how the N-terminal fragment of PB2 interacts with NP is not clear. <italic>In silico</italic> docking suggested the interaction occurred in the first 24 amino acids [<xref rid="pone.0239899.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and <italic>in vitro</italic> study claimed PB2 interacts with NP via its N-terminal 269 residues [<xref rid="pone.0239899.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This report aims at revealing how NP interacts with the N-terminal region of PB2.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Cap-binding domain of PB2 interacts with NP</title><p>We first set forth to identify and confirm the regions on PB2 interacting with NP using a co-immunoprecipitation assay. PB2 truncation mutants were generated by deletion mutagenesis and tagged with myc peptide. Myc-tagged PB2 deletion mutants and NP were co-expressed in HEK 293 cells by transfection. Consistent with previous findings, full-length PB2 could efficiently precipitate NP and PB2 fragment 1&#x02013;483 could precipitate comparable amount of NP as full-length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239899.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;4). This fragment was then further divided into two regions, PB2 fragment 1&#x02013;320 and cap-binding domain (aa 320&#x02013;483), to locate the NP-binding region. Fragment 1&#x02013;320 interacted very weakly with NP despite this fragment contained the N-terminal 269 residues which was proposed for NP binding [<xref rid="pone.0239899.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The cap-binding domain (CBD) precipitated significant amount of NP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239899.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, lane 5&#x02013;8). Which was comparable to the amount precipitated by full-length PB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239899.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Hence, the major NP-binding region resided within the PB2 N-terminal in the cap-binding domain (aa 320&#x02013;483).</p><fig id="pone.0239899.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0239899.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Co-immunoprecipitation analysis of NP and PB2 N-terminal fragments.</title><p>(A) Expression of NP, PB2 and PB2 truncation mutants.

Total cell lysate was collected after 48-hour incubation to detect NP and myc-tagged PB2 fragments expression by Western blotting analysis. (B) Co-immunoprecipitation of NP and PB2 or PB2 fragments.

This domain is responsible for binding the 5&#x02019; methyl cap of the host mRNA and thus facilitating cleavage by PA endonuclease. After cleavage, the domain rotates <italic>in situ</italic> to direct cleaved mRNA to the PB1 active site for priming transcription reaction. RNA binding activity of the CBD has been reported and at the same time, NP also has a high affinity to RNA [<xref rid="pone.0239899.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We then therefore investigate whether RNA play any roles in mediating NP-CBD interaction. To this end we added RNase A into the cell lysate lysate to remove endogenous RNA before co-immmunoprecipitation. After RNA cleavage, cap-binding domain became unable to pull down NP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239899.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). This observation suggested the requirement of RNA in the interaction between NP and PB2 cap-binding domain. We then tested whether the interaction must be mediated by a capped, primer-like RNA. Thus we co-expressed a cap-binding domain variant E361A with NP in HEK 293 cells and repeated the co-immunoprecipitation analysis. E361A mutation was previously reported to reduce the affinity of cap-binding domain to 7-methylguanosine 5&#x02019;-triphosphate (m<sup>7</sup>GTP), a structural analogue of eukaryotic cellular mRNA caps, by more than 8 folds [<xref rid="pone.0239899.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Comparable amount of NP was co-immunoprecipitated by E361A and wild-type PB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239899.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), suggesting the cap of RNA is not needed for the interaction.

Employing PB1 D446Y mutant instead of wild-type PB1 eliminated any possible effects due to variation in the replication efficiency of the RdRP and allowed us to compare vRNP formation on the basis of a fixed amount of vRNA. We co-transfected into HEK 293T cells plasmids expressing PB1-D446Y, PB2 (wild-type or mutants), NP, myc-tagged PA and a pPol-NA-RT plasmid which provided the genomic vRNA of segment 6 serving as template. In the context of PB2 K331A, about 50% less NP was co-immunoprecipitated, compared to the wild-type PB2, while such decrease was not observed by PB2 R332A or N429A mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239899.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). These results suggested a disruption of RNP formation when K331 was mutated.

In a previous study, residue 1&#x02013;320 of PB2 expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes was found to bind GST-NP in GST pulldown assay [<xref rid="pone.0239899.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However in this study, we showed that this PB2 fragment precipitated NP very weakly in co-immunoprecipitation experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239899.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). In contrast, the interaction between PB2 cap-binding domain and NP was much stronger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239899.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Focusing on the CBD, we further defined important residues for NP-binding and delineated the underlying mechanism. In fact our result differs from the finding of Poole et al. who showed no interaction between GST-NP and PB2 aa 283&#x02013;590 [<xref rid="pone.0239899.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] which contained the CBD residues. This discrepancy is probably due to the fact that aa 283&#x02013;590 of PB2 is not a well-defined region. According to the recently published structures, the PB2 fragment used by Poole et al. [<xref rid="pone.0239899.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] comprises part of the mid domain (aa 247&#x02013;319), the cap-binding domain (aa 320&#x02013;483), the cap-627 linker (aa 484&#x02013;538) and part of the 627 domain (aa 539&#x02013;680) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239899.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). As a result, this multi-domain fragment might not be properly folded for the PB2-NP interaction.</p><fig id="pone.0239899.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0239899.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Structure of PB2 and PB2 cap-binding domain.</title><p>(A) Schematic of multiple domains of PB2.

In fact, Hara et al. also showed reduced polymerase activity with K331A/R332A double mutations on PB2 [<xref rid="pone.0239899.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However the authors did not demonstrate the cause of this reduction in activity. Our work shows that K331 reduced NP binding upon mutation to alanine, disrupted NP-PB2 cap-binding domain interaction and also the formation of the RNP complex. As such, we have illustrated the importance of NP-CBD interaction in the RNP formation which is likely mediated by K331 in PB2.</p><p>In our previous work [<xref rid="pone.0239899.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0239899.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] we identified that PB2 627-domain interacted with NP and the interaction was mediated by PB2 D605. Here in this work we showed that PB2 also interacts with NP via its cap-binding domain, mediated by RNA. Since PB2 &#x02018;627-domain&#x02019; adopts radically different conformations during RNA synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0239899.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], NP-&#x02018;627-domain&#x02019; interaction could be important in supporting the dynamic replication and transcription activities. Recent structural work provided a &#x02018;sliding&#x02019; model that the transcribing polymerase slides on the chain of NP oligomers [<xref rid="pone.0239899.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This &#x02018;sliding&#x02019; process may likely be supported by the flexible and protruding &#x02018;627-domain&#x02019; of PB2 as the radically rearranging &#x02018;627-domain&#x02019; interacts with NP oligomers and may drive the polymerase to slide along the chain of NP oligomers. The cap-binding domain on the other hand is capable of <italic>in situ</italic> rotation during the transcription process which is relatively less flexible. It is possible that the cap-binding domain anchors both NP and the vRNA or cRNA during their formation. Our observation that K331A disrupted vRNP formation provides support to this postulation. Taken together, our work provides a more in-depth understanding on the different NP-PB2 interaction for the function of the RNP.</p><p>The interaction between NP and PB2 cap-binding domain contributes to the transcription activity of RNP, and is a potential drug target for developing anti-influenza agents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Biological materials</title><p>Virus strain used in this study was A/Hong Kong/156/97.
