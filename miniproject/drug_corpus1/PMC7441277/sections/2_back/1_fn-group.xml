  <p>This kind of analysis was also common on social media like Twitter. Pulitzer Prize‐winning journalist Nikole Hannah‐Jones, for example, published a series of well‐referenced posts that tied together the synergistic effects of (a) social conditions that make Black Americans more likely to get infected with SARS‐Cov‐2 (eg, higher rates of employment in service sectors where contact with strangers is routine and working from home is not an option, lower rates of home ownership resulting in increased housing density) and (b) underlying health conditions (particularly hypertension and diabetes) that make COVID‐19 more dangerous once infected.

  <p>An alternative hypothesis is that hypertension and diabetes are overrepresented in people who are hospitalized or die due to COVID‐19 because those conditions are associated with age, not because they are involved in the pathophysiology of COVID‐19.</p>
