<p>A related conceptual challenge, which again has methodological implications, concerns the level of analysis at which interactions take place. Like other frameworks for population health, syndemic theory is inherently multilevel. It proposes that large‐scale, political‐economic forces, which often play out over centuries, have embodied consequences for individual health (cf. Gravlee, 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). This proposition makes syndemic theory a logical fit for multilevel analyses, which incorporate population‐level and contextual effects, but existing syndemic studies have measured only individual‐level factors (Tsai, 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). This focus may result, in part, from the emphasis on biological interactions between disease states. After all, to borrow an example from Singer et al. (
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), the pathogen‐pathogen interaction that makes co‐infection with HIV and Hepatitis C more lethal than infection with Hepatitis C alone occurs in individual bodies. These interactions matter, but they are also captured by the concepts of co‐ or multimorbidity. The utility of syndemic theory is that it directs attention to possible interactions not only between

 <italic>epidemics</italic> (at the population level), taking social context and political‐economic inequities into account.
