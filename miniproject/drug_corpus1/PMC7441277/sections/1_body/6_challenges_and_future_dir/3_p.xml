<p>Yet recent commentaries highlight shortcomings in the burgeoning literature about syndemics. A key conceptual issue, which has methodological implications, is the distinction between syndemics and overlapping epidemics that merely co‐occur or are mutually causal (Tsai et al., 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). The defining feature of a syndemic is disease 
 <italic>interaction</italic> in addition to disease 
 <italic>concentration</italic>. That is, true syndemics have synergistic effects that can be traced to biological interactions between disease processes (bio‐bio) or between biological processes and social conditions that harm health (biosocial). Such interactions, which need to be tested explicitly, are thought to exacerbate the toll of epidemics through multiplicative, not just additive, effects.
