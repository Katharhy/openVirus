<p>Most studies that purport to be about syndemics do not provide evidence of such interactions. In a recent scoping review, Singer, Bulled, and Ostrach (
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) identified 188 articles about syndemics that were published during 2015 to 2019 and found that only 12% (23 articles) met the full definition of a syndemic, including evidence of disease interaction. Tsai and colleagues (Tsai, 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Tsai &amp; Venkataramani, 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) identified the analytical problems, and Mendenhall and Singer (
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) outlined research strategies that researchers are beginning to adopt to measure synergistic effects. For now, however, the central proposition of syndemic theory remains largely untested. COVID‐19 presents an urgent case for specifying testable hypotheses about interactions with chronic cardiometabolic diseases that exacerbate pre‐existing inequities. The model in Figure 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> is meant as a framework for developing such hypotheses as we learn more about COVID‐19.
