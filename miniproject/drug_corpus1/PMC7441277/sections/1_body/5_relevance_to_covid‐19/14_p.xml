<p>All population health frameworks draw attention to the social production of health inequities. The value added by a syndemic perspective is that it also highlights how biosocial interactions move in both directions. Not only do social inequities shape the risk of COVID‐19; COVID‐19 is also likely to exacerbate social inequities, further harming health. For example, devastating job losses during the pandemic have disproportionately affected Black Americans (Gould &amp; Wilson, 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), and the economic fallout from COVID‐19 has magnified racial inequities in income and housing (Greene &amp; McCargo, 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Likewise, the online transition of K‐12 and university teaching threatens to widen racial inequities in educational opportunities, given that federal policies subsidize internet access in disproportionately white, rural contexts but not in cities where residents are disproportionately Black and other people of color (Siefer &amp; Callahan, 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Further, in regions where COVID‐19 is concentrated, the strain on healthcare systems may compound pre‐existing inequities in access to care (Williams &amp; Rucker, 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0069" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). Already we see evidence of racial inequities in COVID‐19 treatment (Eligon &amp; Burch, 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), and we know that discrimination in healthcare settings adversely affects management of chronic conditions like diabetes (Peek, Wagner, Tang, Baker, &amp; Chin, 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>).
