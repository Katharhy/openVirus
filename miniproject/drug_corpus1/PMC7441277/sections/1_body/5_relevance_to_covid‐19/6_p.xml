 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), the endothelium (Sardu et al.,

 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Because these systems are also involved in diabetes and hypertension, researchers are pursuing the hypothesis that those conditions interact with COVID‐19 to make infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 more deadly.
