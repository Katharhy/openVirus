<p>Emerging evidence suggests that COVID‐19, in turn, may exacerbate the risk of cardiometabolic disease. Rubino et al. (
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) propose that SARS‐CoV‐2 may have pleiotropic effects on glucose metabolism that could complicate pre‐existing diabetes and lead to new onset of diabetes in people with COVID‐19. Other coronaviruses, including the one that caused the original severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS‐CoV), are known to have long‐term effects on cardiovascular health. People who survived SARS in 2002 to 2003 exhibited altered lipid metabolism 12 years later (Wu et al.,

It is too early to know whether COVID‐19 will have similar effects, but it is possible that people who recover from the new coronavirus may experience long‐lasting damage that increases the risks associated with hypertension and heart disease.
