<p>COVID‐19 has made these ideas feel urgent from the start. In early March, for example, the

 <italic>Time</italic> predicted that people with low incomes—disproportionately Black, Indigenous, or other people of color—would face higher exposure to the virus (because they are less likely to be able to work from home, more likely to work in service sectors where contact with strangers is routine, more likely to live in multi‐family apartment buildings) and had less access to sick leave and medical care if they did become sick (Vesoulis, 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). In mid‐May, when the New York City Health Department first released data on COVID‐19 deaths by ZIP code, the prediction had borne out: the highest death rates were in low‐income neighborhoods with disproportionate numbers of Black and Latinx people (Schwirtz &amp; Cook,
