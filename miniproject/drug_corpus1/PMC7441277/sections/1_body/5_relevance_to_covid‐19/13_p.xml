<p>Still other pathways have both COVID‐19 and cardiometabolic disease as endpoints. For example, air pollution increases the risk of hypertension and diabetes (Coogan et al.,

 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0065" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>), and nonincarcerated Black people living in neighborhoods with high rates of incarceration have higher rates of cardiometabolic disease, independent of individual‐ and neighborhood‐level factors like poverty and rates of crime (Topel et al.,
