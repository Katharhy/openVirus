<p>The left side of Figure 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> specifies some of the noxious social conditions. It delineates systemic racism as a set of policies and structures that spawn toxic environments and identifies behavioral and physiological pathways that mediate the social and spatial concentration of disease. Here the model departs from other conceptual diagrams of syndemic interactions, which often focus only on overlapping epidemics, “without reference to the social forces conditioning exposure” (Tsai, Mendenhall, Trostle, &amp; Kawachi, 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>, p. 978; see also Singer, 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">1996</xref>). The reason for this departure is that lack of specificity about how large‐scale, political‐economic forces translate to individual biology impedes progress in testing the theory. My goal in specifying the conditions that shape exposure across multiple levels of analysis is to stimulate further development of testable propositions and research questions that advance the state of syndemic theory beyond a useful heuristic.
