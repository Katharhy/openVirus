<p>As we learn more about COVID‐19 and its long‐term sequelae, Figure 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> provides a framework to develop specific hypotheses about how it interacts with chronic conditions like hypertension and diabetes. The simultaneous attention to disease interaction and disease concentration keeps in the foreground that physiological dysregulation and possible interactions between COVID‐19 and cardiometabolic disease are socially patterned. Indeed, the same physiological systems that are the focus of interactions among hypertension, diabetes, and COVID‐19 are also involved in the pathways that link neighborhood disadvantage, racial discrimination, and poverty to racial inequities in hypertension and diabetes (Cobb, Parker, &amp; Thorpe,

It is plausible, therefore, that the COVID‐19 pandemic in the U.S. involves both kinds of interactions put forward by syndemic theory: (a) biological interactions between overlapping diseases (ie, diabetes, hypertension, and COVID‐19) and (b) biosocial ones between noxious social conditions and the biological processes involved in progression of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection to COVID‐19 risk.
