<p>These accounts by journalists and others paint a compelling picture. The challenge for researchers is to incorporate such observations into a theory that generates testable propositions about the links between systemic racism, chronic disease, and risk of mortality from COVID‐19. That work has already begun. Social scientists and public health researchers have drawn attention to the structural conditions that shape the 
 <italic>concentration</italic> of COVID‐19 in communities already facing higher burdens of poverty, racial inequity, and disease (Khazanchi et al., 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Laster Pirtle, 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Williams &amp; Cooper, 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Medical scientists and clinicians have emphasized the 
 <italic>interactions</italic> among comorbid conditions that are overrepresented among COVID‐19 hospitalizations and deaths—particularly hypertension (Pranata, Lim, Huang, Raharjo, &amp; Lukito, 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), diabetes (Kreutz et al., 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), and obesity (Akoumianakis &amp; Filippatos, 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Syndemic theory draws together both approaches, bridging the population‐ and individual‐level perspectives of the social and medical sciences, and it adds new questions about possible interactions between COVID‐19 and pre‐existing social inequities that may exacerbate suffering from chronic diseases like hypertension and diabetes.
