<p>For example, race‐based residential segregation, a result of deliberate social policy (Rothstein, 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), has far‐reaching consequences for health. It shapes the social and spatial distribution of both risks and resources, including the quality of schools, employment opportunities, density and quality of housing, availability of healthy food, exposure to pollution, threat of police violence, and access to quality health care (Williams &amp; Collins, 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0066" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). These aspects of the social environment, in turn, have implications for cardiometabolic conditions through unequal nutritional status, inflammation, and physiological dysregulation (eg, Lei et al., 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Morenoff et al., 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). Some of these pathways (eg, inflammation) may also increase susceptibility to COVID‐19, while other aspects of residential segregation may increase exposure, rather than susceptibility, to the novel coronavirus in the first place (eg, density of housing or inability to follow social‐distancing guidelines leading to higher viral load).
