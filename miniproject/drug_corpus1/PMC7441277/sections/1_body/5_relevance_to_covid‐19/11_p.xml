 <xref rid="ajhb23482-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> identifies systemic racism (Feagin, 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>) as a fundamental cause of racial inequities in disease concentration. This perspective sees the social patterning of hypertension, diabetes, and now COVID‐19 as culminating from a system of racial oppression that has developed and morphed over four centuries—from settler‐colonialism and chattel slavery to race‐based residential segregation and mass incarceration. Systemic racism constitutes a fundamental cause (Phelan &amp; Link, 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) in the sense that it shapes the risk of risk through multiple, interchangeable pathways (see also Laster Pirtle, 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Some of those pathways lead to increased risk of diabetes, some to hypertension, some to COVID‐19—and some to combinations of the three.
