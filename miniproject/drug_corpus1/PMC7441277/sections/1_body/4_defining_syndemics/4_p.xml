<p>Neither disease concentration nor disease interaction is unique to syndemic thinking; the uniqueness lies in their integration. Attention to disease concentration is a common feature of most frameworks for population health, including fundamental cause theory (Link &amp; Phelan,

 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>), and the concepts of structural violence (Farmer, 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>) and structural vulnerability (Leatherman,

 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Indeed, more than half a century ago, Cassel (
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">1964</xref>) argued for the relevance of social‐science theory to epidemiology by highlighting social processes that lead to the clustering of seemingly unrelated diseases (in his case, tuberculosis and schizophrenia). However, like Cassel, most models of population health frame the co‐occurrence of epidemics in terms of the cumulative burden of disease. What the syndemic framework adds is the prediction that overlapping epidemics are more than the sum of the parts. Both (a) biological interactions between epidemics and (b) biosocial ones between epidemics and the social conditions that shape them can result in more suffering and death than would be expected in models that treat each disease in isolation.
