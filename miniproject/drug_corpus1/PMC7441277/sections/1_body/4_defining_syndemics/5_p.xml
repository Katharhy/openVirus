<p>The focus on disease interaction also has deep, historical roots, stretching back at least to Scrimshaw, Taylor, and Gordon's (
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">1959</xref>) work on synergism and antagonism between nutrition and infection (see also Scrimshaw, 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). Disease interaction is usually described in terms of comorbidity and multimorbidity (van den Akker, Buntinx, &amp; Knottnerus, 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">1996</xref>). These concepts, which have gained wider currency in the context of COVID‐19, draw attention to common etiological pathways across disease states and to the complexity of care for patients with more than one chronic disease. Comorbidity and multimorbidity are most salient in clinical medicine but are also relevant to epidemiology and health services research (Valderas, Starfield, Sibbald, Salisbury, &amp; Roland, 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). Even when invoked in epidemiology, however, the focus is on the distribution of comorbid conditions (and predisposing social conditions or risk factors) at the level of the individual (Barnett et al., 
 <xref rid="ajhb23482-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). If syndemic theory were concerned only with biological interactions at the individual level (eg, for people who were infected with both HIV and TB), it is not clear what value it would add beyond the framework of multimorbidity. The promise of the theory lies in raising questions 
 <italic>across levels of analysis</italic> about interactions among clustered epidemics and the underlying social conditions that drive them. This unique perspective is what makes syndemic theory relevant to the COVID‐19 pandemic.
