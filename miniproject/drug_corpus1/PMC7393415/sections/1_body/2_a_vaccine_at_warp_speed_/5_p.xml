<p id="p0070">OWSVI uses an “all-in” commercial investment strategy very early in development, and by multiple companies for multiple vaccines. This means that the investors, both government and private, incur very significant financial risks for these products, over 90% of which will almost certainly fail. Those risks involve not only research dollars, but also the proactive building and scaling up of manufacturing and distributing entities prior to completion of clinical studies. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, for example, has committed to build factories for 7 global candidate vaccines. “Even though we’ll end up picking at most two of them, we’re going to fund factories for all seven, just so that we don’t waste time,” Bill Gates said during a recent interview (

It is virtually a given that developers will be granted accelerated regulatory pathways, allowing innovative and blended trial designs, rather than traditionally designed randomized controlled trials, as well as biomarkers and other novel endpoints to prove efficacy. Developers are also overlapping clinical trial phases in new ways, blending trials, or at the very least providing significant funding for overlapping recruitment for later-phase trials while earlier trials are ongoing, to save time.
