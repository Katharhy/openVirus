<p id="p0055">OWSVI partners with the Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, FDA, National Institutes of Health, Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), Department of Defense, and various other agencies, as well as private firms. It will begin mass production of multiple vaccines based on preliminary evidence (i.e., prior to complete clinical trials and FDA approvals), so that once 1 or more of the vaccines proves clinically effective, distribution can begin immediately without a delay to gear up manufacturing facilities and distribution pathways (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The program expects that some of these vaccines will not prove safe or effective. Indeed, the 
 <italic>vast majority</italic> of vaccines initially tapped for the program will likely fail, and therefore the development of a COVID-19 vaccine will certainly be much costlier than a typical vaccine.
