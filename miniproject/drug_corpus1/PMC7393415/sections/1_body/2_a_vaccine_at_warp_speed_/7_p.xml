<p id="p0080">It is early in the pandemic, but research timelines have accelerated dramatically. Although the time from viral sequence selection to first human injection of a putative vaccine for SARS was 20 months, it was just 65 days for COVID-19 (

A massive influx of investment dollars not only promoted rapid preclinical testing, but also is now allowing researchers to organize and recruit large numbers of subjects for human trials. The University of Oxford Virus Group (working with AstraZeneca) announced on May 22 that they were initiating recruitment of over 10,000 patients for what appears to be a type of blended phase II/III trial process while still completing phase I (

Normally, commercial developers would wait to see full results of a phase I study and FDA review before investing in phases II or III, the most expensive phases of development, or before manufacturing more drug than is needed for such studies. Recruitment of large numbers of study subjects usually takes significant time. A more rapid recruitment of sufficient numbers of subjects for late-phase trials is likely to be facilitated by global public motivation to find a vaccine. Manufacturing is motivated by the promise of future government purchasing contracts, together with an immense, global target population. If a vaccine is developed and distributed for COVID-19 by January 2021, it will be as much due to unprecedented government and commercial financial investments and a highly motivated public as to new changes in FDA regulations.
