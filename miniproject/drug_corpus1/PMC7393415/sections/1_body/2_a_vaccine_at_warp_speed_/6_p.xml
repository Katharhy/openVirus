<p id="p0075">COVID-19 was declared a public emergency by the Secretary of Health and Human Services on February 4, who also confirmed that circumstances existed to justify Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for drugs and biological products that allow a product to proceed to clinical use once efficacy has been shown in phase II (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Such EUAs have authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, convalescent plasma, hyperimmune globulin, remdesivir, and Fresenius Propoven (propofol) 2% for treatment of COVID-19. EUAs can be issued by the FDA very quickly: automatic authorization occurs if the FDA does not object within 30 days of application, but the FDA can approve sooner, whenever review is complete. After the public health emergency ends, marketing of the drug or vaccine will require completion of a full investigational new drug application, if the drug is not already subject to one, and then a new drug application—although expanded access can be granted under a widespread expanded access treatment application for continued use until full approval is obtained. These accelerated programs have been available since 2012.
