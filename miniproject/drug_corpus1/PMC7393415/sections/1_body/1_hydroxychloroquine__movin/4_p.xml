<p id="p0030">Results of clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 were published quickly, sometimes in “preprint” form (pending complete peer review). The first studies failed to demonstrate efficacy of the drug. Then, a study involving an astounding 96,000 patients was published in 
 <italic>The Lancet</italic> indicating that COVID-19 patients who received hydroxychloroquine had significantly higher mortality than did those who did not. The results were swift: funding agencies stopped or paused many of the 131 registered hydroxychloroquine COVID-19 trials that were underway, and the World Health Organization halted its own trial.
