<p id="p0015">Hydroxychloroquine was proposed as a treatment for COVID-19 prior to the pandemic’s arrival on U.S. shores, based on proven action against another coronavirus in vitro. It has long been U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved as a treatment for malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus. Although not approved at the time as a treatment for COVID-19, it could be legally used “off-label,” provided firm scientific rationale and sound medical evidence supported it. It has a complete supply chain in place and could be rapidly deployed. However, its toxicities include retinopathy, cardiomyopathy, seizures, liver failure, and fatal cardiac arrhythmias. Thus, it is a drug to be used with caution, particularly off-label, when risks are so significant and benefits are entirely unknown.”</p>
