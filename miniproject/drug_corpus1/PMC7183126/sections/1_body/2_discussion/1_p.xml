<p id="Par68">This systematic review and meta-analysis will contribute to update the knowledge on integrase resistance-associated mutations found in Sub-Saharan African countries and understand difficulties that may arise with the use of integrase inhibitors before the massive initiation of patients on DTG-based regimens. Our results will firstly be useful for appropriate and contextual management of patients under DTG-based regimens. They would also help to design new strategies in order to improve the care of people living with HIV and reduce the transmission of resistant viruses in the advent of new HIV-infection. This review will thus be highly relevant to inform health system interventions and HIV prevention and treatment strategies in Sub-Saharan Africa, and resource-limited settings in general. As potential limitations of this review, we may be confronted with important study heterogeneity and incompleteness, but these will be considered in statistic models during meta-regression analysis; if not perform, studies incompleteness at least would be solve by contacting study authors. Another limitation may be at the level of reviewing and including studies. In effect, in the process of resolving disagreements while reviewing articles, all team members will be included in the decision-making process or at least aware of the disagreements being discussed. We will try as much as possible to have a consensus decision for each disagreement. Important protocol amendments will be documented, taken into consideration while analyzing the data, and discussed consequently in the final paper. Our findings will be published in a peer-review journal and subsequently disseminated to policy-makers first at the national level through the submission of a governmental notice, and at the international level through conferences and stakeholder meetings.</p>
