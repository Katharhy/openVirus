<p id="Par30">Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in particular carries the greatest burden of HIV infection (70% of the global HIV epidemics) with increasing drug resistance burden (about 1/3 of patients). Also, SSA has a very broad HIV genetic diversity (including both types 1 and 2), with an important predominance of HIV-1 non-subtype B viruses that might affect the clinical outcomes in patient management [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Several findings support that early treatment with DTG may reduce the emergence of HIV-1 drug resistance (HIVDR) in resource-limited settings (RLS) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These evidences are in line with the WHO recommendations on transitioning to DTG-based regimens for initial option or alternative ART in case of multi-resistance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Up-to-date, few African countries carried out studies on INSTI-resistance. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic review has been done previously to assess the level of resistance to integrase inhibitors across the continent. There is henceforth a need to synthesize the entire knowledge available on integrase resistance-associated mutations found in SSA before the massive adoption of DTG-based regimens. This would help identify the gaps and actions to be undertaken for improved care, follow-up and management of people living with HIV in SSA. The aim of this systematic review is to highlight integrase resistance-associated mutations (i.e., mutations conferring a poor response to an INSTI-based regimen) commonly found in SSA in patients under DTG (or INSTI)-containing regimens. We will first examine the therapeutic outcomes of DTG-use (e.g., viral suppression and immunological response) and the rate of resistance to INSTI among non-suppressive patients. Secondly, we will evaluate (a) the rate of viral suppression according to clinical and biological parameters, (b) the effects of adherence and adverse events on viral suppression, (c) drug resistance and viral susceptibility to each INSTI, and (d) HIV genetic diversity and its effects on acquired INSTI resistance.
