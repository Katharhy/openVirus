<p id="Par29">The “Consolidated guidelines on the use of antiretroviral drugs for treating and preventing HIV infection” published in 2016 by the World Health Organization (WHO) clearly recommends early treatment initiation and the use of better-tolerated regimens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, the ability of HIV to mutate in the course of a failing ART prompts the development of HIV drug resistance and the need of new/more active antiretrovirals such as INSTI. In spite of these benefits, INSTIs and especially DTG are also known to be subject to viral resistance. Of note, more than 40 substitutions have been associated with the development of resistance to INSTIs in HIV-1 B subtypes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The most prevalent mutations are at positions 66, 92, 143, 147, 148, and 155 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] in the integrase coding region of HIV-1. Of note, G118R is a mutation that has rarely been observed in subtype B viruses, and could have an alternative pathway for DTG-resistance selection in non-subtype B viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Furthermore, R263K is preferentially selected among subtype B viruses as compared to other viral subtypes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As viral subtypes (especially B and C) are known to have differential mechanisms in the selection of drug resistance mutations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], natural polymorphisms in the integrase region may influence the development of resistance against integrase inhibitors in different HIV-1 subtypes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].
