<p id="Par28">Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTI) are the latest approved drug class to treat human immune-deficiency virus (HIV) infection. INSTI stop antiretroviral activity by blocking the integration of HIV proviral DNA into the genetic material of host cells. There are currently five drugs in this class; raltegravir (RAL), elvitegravir (EVG), dolutegravir (DTG), cabotegravir (CAB), bictegravir (BIC) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These INSTIs are highly effective in both treatment-naïve as well as in treatment-experienced individuals who may harbor multi-drug resistance to other drug classes, with a superior efficacy of DTG, CAB, and BIC both in vitro and in vivo [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These latter molecules are known as second generation while RAL and EVG are first-generation INSTI [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In the group of second-generation INSTI, BIC has been recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and exist only as part of the fixed dose combination bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/3TC/TAF) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. CAB on its part exists in several formulations and co-formulations and is still in the process for FDA approval [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. DTG revealed however a slight greater efficacy over other INSTI, due to its low minimal inhibitory concentration, limited risk of cross-resistance with RAL and EVG, better drug tolerance, fewer drug interactions, higher potency, and genetic barrier to resistance than first-generation INSTI [
