<p id="Par65">Two reviewers (ENJS and NAD) will assess eligible studies using ROBINS-I [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], a tool for assessing risk of bias in non-randomized studies of interventions. ROBINS provides a systematic way to organize and present the available evidence related to risk of bias in these studies. ROBIS [RoB 2.0] [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] will be used in parallel for randomized studies, which include randomized controlled trials. Risks of bias in cohort and case-control studies will be assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. These tools will help assess studies but not their outcomes, and will be adapted to the context of this systematic review.
