<p id="Par63">Subgroup and additional analyses will be conducted following the stratification of the study participants. Results will then be sorted according to age (adults/adolescents vs. children [&lt; 10â€‰years]), sex (male vs. female), baseline viremia, level of CD4 following treatment, INSTI-based regimens, adherence level, and adverse reactions. This will allow us to adjust for potential confounders, to better estimate the effect of each variable on the observed outcomes. If data permits, meta-regression will be performed and summary estimates will help explore the relationship between study-covariates and effect size, in order to highlight any statistical significance.</p>
