<p id="Par47">We will develop a data extraction sheet to guide data extraction. The sheet will be pilot-tested by two reviewers (VNN and JF) on a random sample of 05 articles and revised as needed. Two reviewers will independently read each eligible full-text article and extract the relevant data. Both sets of data will be entered into Microsoft Excel (version 2016 for Windows, Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA). Any discrepancies in the extracted data will be resolved by consensus, in discussion with a third reviewer (DT or JF) if necessary.</p>
