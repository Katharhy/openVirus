 </xref> Liver abnormalities in COVID-19 patients may be due to liver cell dysfunction or other causes, such as drug toxicity and systemic inflammation. In a cohort of 1099 patients with COVID-19, abnormal liver function tests including elevated aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and total bilirubin were found in 168 (168/757, 22.2%), 158 (158/741, 21.3%), and 76 (76/722, 10.5%) of patients, respectively.

 </xref> Another study that included 333 COVID-19 cases with liver function tests was recently reported in a Wuhan medical center. The incidence of liver injury was 39.6% (132/333) with the majority (71.2%, 94/132) being mild elevation in liver enzyme tests. Total bilirubin was elevated in only13 patients (13/333, 3.9%). Regarding underlying liver conditions, 12 patients had a history of chronic hepatitis B and 2 patients had a history of chronic hepatitis C, but the detection of viral nucleic acid showed no active hepatitis.
