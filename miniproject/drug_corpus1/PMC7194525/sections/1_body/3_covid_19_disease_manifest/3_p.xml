<p id="p0065">Data regarding the macroscopic changes of the GI tract in patients with COVID-19 are scarce. In the only case who underwent endoscopy because of upper GI bleeding from a cohort of 73 patients with COVID-19, no abnormalities were observed in the stomach, duodenum, colon, or rectum, with the exception of multiple bleeding ulcers (4â€“6 mm in diameter) in the esophagus by endoscopy. Histology showed numerous infiltrating plasma cells and lymphocytes as well as interstitial edema in the lamina propria of the stomach, duodenum, and rectum.

 </xref> Autopsy studies are important to help investigate the histopathologic changes in the GI tract in COVID-19. Currently, there is only 1 published autopsy report of an 85-year-old man with COVID-19, which showed segmental dilatation and stenosis in the small intestine.
