<p id="p0055">Although respiratory tract manifestations such as fever and cough are the most common reported symptoms in patients with COVID-19, symptoms within the GI tract have also been reported. A study of 138 confirmed patients with COVID-19 showed that the major symptoms included fever (98.6%), fatigue (69.6%), cough (59.4%), myalgia (34.8%), and dyspnea (31.2%); GI symptoms included abdominal pain (3.6%), diarrhea (10.1%), and vomiting (3.6%). It is worth noting that 14 cases (10.1%) had initial symptoms of diarrhea and nausea, then fever and dyspnea.

 </xref> This finding is important for gastroenterologists for screening and identifying COVID-19 cases. However, the disease course and outcomes in these subgroups of patients requires further investigation. Another retrospective analysis of 1099 patients with COVID-19 showed that the main symptoms were fever (87.9%) and cough (67.7%); diarrhea (3.7%) and vomiting (5.0%) were less frequent. Among GI symptoms, the incidence of diarrhea and abdominal pain in patients with severe COVID-19 was higher than that in patients with mild COVID-19.
