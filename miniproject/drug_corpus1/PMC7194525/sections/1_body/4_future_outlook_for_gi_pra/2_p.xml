 </xref> In China, we have a large population of patients with digestive disorders, including chronic liver disease and GI cancer, and an increasing number of patients with IBD. However, whether these underlying conditions could increase the risk of COVID-19, and their impact on prognosis of COVID-19 remain unknown.

  <sup>13</sup>
 </xref> For this reason, several national registry studies including COVID-19 risk in IBD, which is similar to the model of Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion in the United States, are ongoing to evaluate these questions. This will greatly facilitate our GI practice and care for our patients.
