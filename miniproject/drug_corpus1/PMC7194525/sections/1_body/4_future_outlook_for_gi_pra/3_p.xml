 </xref> Although virus detection in the stool does not necessarily equate to virus infectivity and direct evidence of fecal transmission of COVID-19 has yet to be identified, the implementation of high-level disinfection for surfaces potentially contaminated by feces is strongly recommended. Emerging evidence shows persistence of SARS-COV-2 virus RNA in stool samples or rectal swabs even after respiratory specimens tested negative.

 </xref> In a recent landmark clinical investigation of 10 pediatric COVID-19 cases in China, 8 persistently tested positive on rectal swabs even after nasopharyngeal testing was negative, suggesting that the GI tract may continue to shed the virus.

 </xref> The updates criteria for hospital discharge of COVID-19 patients includes resolution of fever and respiratory symptoms, improvement in acute exudative lesions on chest computed tomography scans, as well as 2 consecutively negative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test results of respiratory samples with interval of â‰¥24 hours.

 </xref> Whether fecal or rectal swab reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction results should also be included in future discharge criteria needs to be further investigated.
