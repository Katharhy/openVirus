<p id="p0035">As the authorized academic association of gastroenterologists in China, we follow the guidance and recommendations of relevant government authorities. Several actions have been taken in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.

As a response to the increasing concern and inquiry about COVID-19 risk from the community of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in China, the Chinese IBD Committee affiliated with the CSG has issued timely recommendations for managing IBD patients in early February 2020, which is probably the first guideline regarding IBD and COVID-19 in the global community.
