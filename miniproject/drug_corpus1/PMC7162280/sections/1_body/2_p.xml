<p>I do not mean to compare directly the disasters of a cholera epidemic with the actual COVID‐19 epidemic (or pandemic if the WHO scales COVID‐19 up after I have finished this editorial). Luckily, the mortality of this coronavirus is not as disastrous as that of cholera. But when reading the events of the 19th century, I found some interesting parallels on both the local and global scales. Signs of hysteria are obvious now, clearly triggered by the immediate access to information (real and fake). Most evident for everyone is panic buying, in China but also in Europe. Yesterday (March 2), I went to the store in my small hometown and found that rice, noodles, cereals, and—noteworthy—toilet paper were more or less sold out. It does not make much sense: given that, so far, there are only 17 confirmed cases in the northern part of Germany, we should not expect to run short of nutrients but that is group behavior.
