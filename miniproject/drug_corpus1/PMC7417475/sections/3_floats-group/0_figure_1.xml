  <p>ZY13 inhibits ZIKV infection

   <bold>(A)</bold> qPCR analysis of ZIKV in U251 cells after 24 h infection with ZIKV (MOI = 1) alone or in combination with ZY13, Scr-ZY13 and 5 μM of Amodiaquine (AQ). The IC
   <sub>50</sub> of ZY13 against ZIKV infection is 1.06 ± 0.13 μM in U251 cells. Results are presented relative to those of human 
   <italic>Hprt</italic> and compared to Scr-ZY13 group (negative control). 
   <bold>(B)</bold> ZIKV titration in the supernatants of U251 cells after infection with ZIKV (MOI = 1) alone or in combination with ZY13, Scr-ZY13 and 5 μM of Amodiaquine (AQ). ZY13 administration at a concentration of 0.8 μM significantly reduced the production of infectious virions of ZIKV. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> qPCR analysis of ZIKV in Vero cells after infection with ZIKV (MOI = 0.5) alone or in combination with ZY13, Scr-ZY13 and 5 μM of Amodiaquine (AQ). The IC
   <sub>50</sub> of ZY13 against ZIKV infection is 1.81 ± 0.34 μM in Vero cells. Results are presented relative to those of monkey 
   <italic>Hprt</italic> and compared to Scr-ZY13 group (negative control). 
   <bold>(D)</bold> ZIKV titration in the supernatants of Vero cells after infection with ZIKV (MOI = 0.5) alone or in combination with ZY13, Scr-ZY13 and 5 μM of Amodiaquine (AQ). ZY13 administration at a concentration of 0.8 μM significantly reduced the production of infectious virions of ZIKV. Data represent 3 independent experiments and are presented as mean ± SEM. *
