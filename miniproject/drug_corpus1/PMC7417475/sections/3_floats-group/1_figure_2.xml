  <p>ZY13 directly inactivates ZIKV virions. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> A schematic diagram showing the experimental process (left). To determine the ZY13 mediated ZIKV inactivation, peptides at various concentration were added to ZIKV (1 × 10
   <sup>6</sup> PFU/ml) followed by incubation at 37°C for 1, 2, and 4 h. After incubation, the mixtures were diluted 200 times to keep the final concentration of the compounds below 0.1 μM. qPCR analysis of ZIKV genes in U251 cells after infection with ZIKV (diluted 200 times, about 0.05 MOI) pre-incubated with or without ZY13 and SnPPIX at the indicated time and concentrations. ZIKV pre-incubation with 20 μM ZY13 for 4 h significant decreases in about 70% the infectivity of ZIKV (right). Results are presented relative to those of human

   <bold>(B)</bold> A schematic diagram showing the experimental process (left). Assays were performed as described in 
   <bold>(A)</bold>. The diluted supernatants or peptide-ZIKV mixtures were applied for plaque forming assay immediately. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> A schematic diagram showing the experimental process (left). Assays were performed by pre-incubating U251 cells with ZIKV (MOI = 1), ZIKV + peptides or ZIKV + Suramin at 4°C for 1 h. The attached ZIKV were detected by qRT-PCR after washing the cells three times with DMEM. Data represent 3 independent experiments and are presented as mean ± SEM. *
