  <p>ZY13 suppresses the ZIKV induced expression of 
   <italic>Socs1</italic> and 
   <italic>Socs3</italic> at early phase of infection. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Cells were infected with ZIKV at 1 MOI with or without ZY13 administration. Expression analysis of 
   <italic>Socs1-5</italic> genes in U251 cells with ZIKV alone or in combination with ZY13 were performed at 6 h post infection; results are presented relative to those of human 
   <italic>Hprt</italic>. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Immunoblot analysis of phosphorylation of STAT1 and protein level of SOCS1, SOCS3 and STAT1 at 12 h post ZIKV infection (MOI = 1). β-actin was used as the loading control. The intensity of signaling was quantified (right). The Scr-ZY13 at a concentration of 0.8 μM was added as control. Data represent 3 independent experiments and are presented as mean ± SEM. *
