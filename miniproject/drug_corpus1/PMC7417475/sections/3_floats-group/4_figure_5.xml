  <p>ZY13 restricts ZIKV infection in mouse pups. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> One-day-old Balb/c mouse pups were intraperitoneally injected with 5 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg of ZY13, 20 mg/kg of Scr-ZY13, 30 mg/kg of AQ or an equal volume of the solvent per day following ZIKV infection. The body weights of the mice were monitored for 14 days post infection. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> About a quarter of the brains of the mice at 14 days post infection were weighted before being homogenized in PBS for plaque-forming assays. ZY13 treatment reduces approximately90% (5 mg/kg) to 99% (20 mg/kg) infective ZIKV virions production in the mouse brain. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> The pathological changes of the mouse brain were evaluated by histological scoring after H&amp;E staining. Data represent 2 independent experiments and are presented as mean Â± SEM. *
