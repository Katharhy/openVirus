<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) is a single-stranded RNA virus and predominantly transmitted by the widely distributed Aedes mosquitoes in nature (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Barrows et al., 2018</xref>). In the past decade, the epidemic potential of ZIKV likely increased with its emergence in the Pacific, Americas, and Asia (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Baud et al., 2017</xref>). ZIKV can be classified into the African lineage and the Asian lineage and the latter is the recent epidemic strain (

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). It is reported that a spontaneous mutation of NS1 protein from a clinical ZIKV isolate of the Asian lineage enhanced the infectivity of ZIKV in

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Beaver et al., 2018</xref>). However, it should be noted that ZIKV infection can cause severe neurological symptoms in fetuses, neonates, and adults (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Baud et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, ZIKV can be detected in humans body fluids and may be transmitted through sexual activities (

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Allard et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that ZIKV can induce inflammation in the mouse testis and leads to male infertility (

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, controlling ZIKV epidemics is a daunting challenge.
