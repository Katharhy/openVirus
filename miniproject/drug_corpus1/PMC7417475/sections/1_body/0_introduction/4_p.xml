<p>Cathelicidins are evolutionarily conserved HDPs and play critical roles in the battle against pathogens. Cathelicidin-BF (BF-30), a defensive peptide identified from 
 <italic>Bungarus fasciatus</italic> snake venom, has been shown to have strong activities against 
 <italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic> and Influenza A virus infections in previous studies (

 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Xu J. et al., 2019</xref>). Our previous work indicated that BF-30 is an excellent template for applicable peptide design (

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Xu C. et al., 2019</xref>). As previously reported, ZY13 is a peptidic analog derived from BF-30 and has been shown to have therapeutic potential for vaginitis (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2016</xref>). Recently, BF-30 and its analogs were approved for phase I-III clinical study (CXHL1700235) to develop vaginal effervescent tablet for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis based on its excellent characteristics. Based on the reported anti-RNA virus activity of BF-30, we assumed that the analogs of BF-30 may have potential antiflavivirus effects. In this study, we found that ZY13 inhibits ZIKV infection by directly inactivating ZIKV particles and strengthening the host antiviral immune responses. Additionally, ZY13 has shown efficiency on ZIKV-infected mouse pups. These findings may provide important strategies for developing animal derived peptides specific antiviral drugs.
