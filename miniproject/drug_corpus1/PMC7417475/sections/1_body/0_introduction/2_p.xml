<p>However, there is no approved specific drug and vaccine for ZIKV (

Although vaccination is the primary strategy for preventing ZIKV infections, antivirals may also play an important role in controlling ZIKV infection and transmission. After the emergence of ZIKV in Brazil in 2015-2016, more efforts are directed at discovering specific anti-ZIKV drug candidates (

The good news is that with the increasing understanding about ZIKV infection and host antiviral mechanism, more anti-ZIKV compounds can be discovered. For example, following the discovery that ZIKV induced RNAi-mediated antiviral immunity, the antibiotic enoxacin has been found to prevent ZIKV infection by enhancing RNAi (
