<p>U251 cells (human glioma cell line), C6/36 cells (
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> cell line) and Vero cells (African green monkey kidney epithelial cell line) were obtained from Kunming Cell Bank, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. U251 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium: Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM/F-12) (Gibco, Waltham, MA, United States) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37°C. Vero cells were cultured in DMEM medium (Gibco, Waltham, MA, United States) with the same supplements in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37°C. C6/36 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, Waltham, MA, United States) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 28°C. ZIKV (SZ01, KU866423.2) and DENV-2 (New Guinea-C, KM204118) were kindly provided by Prof. Cheng-feng Qin (Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology) and were propagated in C6/36 cells.
