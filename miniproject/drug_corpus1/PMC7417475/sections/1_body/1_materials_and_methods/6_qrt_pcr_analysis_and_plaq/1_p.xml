<p>Total RNA was isolated from cells and tissues by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, United States). cDNA was reverse-transcribed by using random primer and M-MLV reverse transcriptase (M1705, Promega, Madison, WI, United States). Real-time qRT-PCR was performed on the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR Systems (Thermo, Waltham, MA, United States) with TB Green
 <sup>®</sup> Premix Ex Taq
 <sup>TM</sup> II (RR820Q, Takara, Beijing, China). For qRT-PCR run, the following protocol was followed: 95°C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 s, 60°C for 30 s. Human or mouse 
 <italic>Hprt</italic> gene was used as a reference gene for relative quantification. Primer sequences are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. The virus stocks, the supernatants of the cells, the SnPPIX-ZIKV mixtures or the peptide-ZIKV mixtures were applied for plaque forming assay to determine the virus titer as previously described (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Vicenti et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, Vero cells were seeded on 12-well plates (2.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) before incubation with samples. The diluted supernatants or peptide-ZIKV mixtures were incubated with Vero cells for 2 h at 37°C and washed with DMEM. These cells were cultured in solid DMEM containing 1% low melting agarose and 2% FBS for 6 days in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37°C. The plaques were counted after fixing and crystal violet staining.
