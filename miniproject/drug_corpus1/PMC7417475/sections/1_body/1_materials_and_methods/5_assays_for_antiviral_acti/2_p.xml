<p>To determine the ZY13 mediated ZIKV inactivation, peptides at various concentration were added to ZIKV (1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU/ml) followed by incubation at 37°C for 1, 2, and 4 h. The peptide and ZIKV mixtures were then diluted 200 times in DMEM for further infectivity analysis. Considering 200 times dilution cannot remove peptides from the mixture, the equivalent amounts of ZY13 without pre-incubation were applied as control.
