<p>U251 cells or Vero cells were infected with ZIKV or DENV-2 at indicated MOI and time with or without ZY13, Scr-ZY13, 50 μM of Suramin (574625, Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), 20 μM of Tin protoporphyrin IX dichloride (SnPPIX, 0747, Bio-Techne, Minneapolis, MN, United States) and 5 μM of AQ administration (

 <sup>5</sup>/well) and incubated with ZIKV in serum- and antibiotic-free cell culture medium for 1h with or without ZY13 and Scr-ZY13. Then the cells were washed and the supernatants were replaced with medium containing 2% FBS with or without ZY13 and Scr-ZY13. After incubation for 24 h, cells were lysed in TRIzol reagent for RNA isolation or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for immunofluorescence staining. The supernatants of the cells were also collected.
