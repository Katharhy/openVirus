<p>For hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining, half of the brains of mice were fixed in 10% formalin and 5 Î¼m sections were stained and examined by microscope. Selected slides were scored into five degrees on a scale from Grade 0 to Grade 4 (based on the pathological changes such as focal necrosis and immune cell invasion: 0, none; 1, subtle; 2, mild; 3, moderate; 4, marked) by two pathologists independently. The wet tissues were weighted and homogenized in PBS for plaque-forming assays as described above. Mouse experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines and were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (SMKX-20190513-01).</p>
