<p>To test the toxicity of ZY13 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, one-day-old Balb/c mouse pups were injected intraperitoneally with 40 mg/kg of ZY13 daily and monitored for 3 weeks. As previously reported, one-day-old Balb/c mouse pups were injected intraperitoneally with 50 Î¼l 0.9% NaCl solution with or without 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU of ZIKV one hour before treatment (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). Mice were then intraperitoneally injected 5 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg of ZY13, 20 mg/kg of Scr-ZY13, 30 mg/kg of AQ or an equal volume of the solvent per day following the infection. The body weights of the mice were monitored for 14 days post infection. Mice were euthanized at day 14 post infection, and major organs, especially the brain and the spinal cord, were collected for further analysis.
