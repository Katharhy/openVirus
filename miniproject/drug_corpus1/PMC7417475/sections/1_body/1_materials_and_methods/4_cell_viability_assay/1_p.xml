<p>Cell viability was evaluated by conventional 3-(4, 5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction assays in 96-well plates. After a 24 h treatment by testing sample, MTT was added to each well to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and incubated at 37Â°C for 4 h. The MTT solution was then removed and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to solubilize the MTT-formazan crystals in living cells. The absorbance of the resulting solution was measured at 570 nm.</p>
