<p>Anti-SOCS1 (3950S, CST, Danvers, MA, United States), anti-SOCS3 (52113, CST, Danvers, MA, United States), anti-p-Stat1 (9167, CST, Danvers, MA, United States), anti-Stat1 (9172, CST, Danvers, MA, United States) and anti-β-actin (3700S, CST, Danvers, MA, United States) were used in this study. The secondary antibodies are HRP-labeled anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies (CST, Danvers, MA, United States). The total proteins were separated by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and electro-transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Roche, Germany). The PVDF membrane was blocked with TBST (2.42 g/L Tris base, 8 g/L NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.6) containing 5% non-fat dried milk (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, United States) at room temperature for 2 h. After washing three times with TBST, the membrane was incubated overnight with primary antibodies at 4°C, and incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with TBST, the membrane was developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (TIANGEN, Beijing China) in a dark room. The intensity of signaling was quantified by ImageJ 1.8.0 software (National Institutes of Health, United States).</p>
