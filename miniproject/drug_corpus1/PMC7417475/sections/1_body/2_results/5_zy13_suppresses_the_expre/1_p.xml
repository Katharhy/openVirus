<p>Several studies have shown that AXL inhibits IFNAR signaling through the suppressor of cytokine signaling protein 1 (SOCS1) in a negative regulation manner (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Rothlin et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). To further examine whether SOCS proteins play roles in ZY13-mediated induction of type I IFN signaling during ZIKV infection, we first analyzed the expression of 
 <italic>Socs</italic> genes. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, the expression of 
 <italic>Socs1</italic> and 
 <italic>Socs3</italic> were significantly reduced after ZY13 administration but not that of 
 <italic>Socs2</italic>, 
 <italic>Socs4</italic> and 
 <italic>Socs5</italic>. Furthermore, immunoblot analysis showed that the protein level of SOCS3 was significantly reduced whereas the phosphorylation of STAT1 was increased with ZY13 co-administration (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Additionally, the protein level of SOCS3 and the phosphorylation of STAT1 were not significantly altered with Scr-ZY13 co-administration (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). The expression of 
 <italic>Socs1</italic> and 
 <italic>Socs3</italic> were analyzed at 12 hours post infection and only the expression of 
 <italic>Socs3</italic> was reduced after ZY13 administration (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). These findings collectively suggest that ZY13 interacts with the AXL-SOCS negative regulation pathway of type I IFN signaling during ZIKV infection and thus enhancing the hostâ€™s immune response to ZIKV infection.
