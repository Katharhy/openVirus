<p>To determine the antiviral activity of ZY13 against ZIKV infection, we analyzed the replication of ZIKV by qRT-PCR at 24 h post infection. We found that ZY13 inhibited ZIKV infection in U251 cells in a dose-dependent manner with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of 1.06 ± 0.13 μM (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). It should be noted that ZY13 administration at a concentration of 0.8 μM significantly reduced the ZIKV infection (approximately 50%) in U251 rather than its scrambled control peptide Scr-ZY13 (less than 10%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A,B</xref>). We also used the Vero cells to test the anti-ZIKV activity of ZY13. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1C,D</xref>, ZY13 showed remarkable inhibitory effect on the replication (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.81 ± 0.34 μM) and virion production of ZIKV in Vero cells. No effect on cell viability was observed for the used peptide concentrations (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> and may interact with the viral particle or other factors. To determine whether ZY13 can inhibit other flavivirus infection, we tested the antiviral activity of ZY13 on DENV-2. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>, ZY13 showed weakened effect on the replication of DENV-2 comparing to ZIKV.
