<p>To further determine the antiviral mechanism of ZY13, we tested different treatments using the peptide. Interestingly, the results show that pre-incubation with ZY13 decreases the infectivity of ZIKV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). According to the results shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, pre-incubation with 20 μM ZY13 for 4 h led to a significant decrease in infectivity of ZIKV. Following this, we performed viral inactivation assays to investigate whether ZY13 could directly act on the ZIKV virions. We found that ZY13 pre-incubation inactivates ZIKV particles and leads to remarkable lower plaque forming units (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). ZIKV pre-incubation with 20 μM of ZY13 for 1, 2, and 4 h significantly reduced over 95% of the plaque forming units whereas pre-incubation with 0.8 or 4 μM of ZY13 were not that obvious. Next, we investigated whether ZY13 treatment inhibits the initial attachment of ZIKV according to the scheme shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>. The results indicated that ZY13 did not affect the virus attachment even at the relatively high concentration of 4 μM (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). It is reported that a certain number of antivirals can directly inactivate the viral particle (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2018</xref>). These data suggested that ZY13 exerts anti-ZIKV activity by directly inactivating ZIKV infectious virions. Meanwhile, the different antiviral efficacy shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> indicated that other antiviral mechanisms of ZY13 may also exist.
