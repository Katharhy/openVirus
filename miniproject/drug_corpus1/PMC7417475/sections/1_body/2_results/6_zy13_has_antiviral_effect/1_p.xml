<p>Despite some immunodeficient ZIKV mouse models, an immunocompetent mouse model of ZIKV infection is more appropriate for evaluating antiviral drugs (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Gorman et al., 2018</xref>). And as has been well documented, ZIKV infection of 1-day-old mouse pups may be similar to that later in pregnancy (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). More importantly, no toxicity was observed in 1-day-old Balb/c mouse pups when injected intraperitoneally with 40 mg/kg of ZY13 daily. Thus, we used ZIKV infected mouse pups to further evaluate the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antiviral effects of peptide ZY13. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, treatment with ZY13 and AQ improved the ZIKV affected body growth. To further assess the anti-ZIKV efficiency of ZY13 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we analyzed the infectious viral titers in the main organs of the mice. Of note, the viral burdens in the brains were significantly lower after ZY13 and AQ treatment at 14 days post infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Additionally, there were fewer focal necrosis and immune cell invasion in the brain sections of ZY13 treated group than of ZIKV group at 14 days post infection as quantified by histological scoring (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that ZY13 can restrict ZIKV infection and improve the growth defects of ZIKV-infected mice.
