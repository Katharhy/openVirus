<p>Interferon signaling plays a key role in restricting ZIKV infection and cells lacking IFN-α/β are more permissive to infection with ZIKV and other flaviviruses. Interestingly, we found that ZY13 exhibited different antiviral effects compared with AQ in BMDM cells from WT mice and

  <sup>–/–</sup>
 </italic> mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). In BMDM cells from WT mice, 0.8 μM of ZY13 significantly decrease the infectivity of ZIKV. However, the same dose of ZY13 administration was less effective in BMDM cells from 
 <italic>Ifnar
  <sup>–/–</sup>
 </italic> mice. The results shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref> indicated that the antiviral activity of ZY13 may rely on the presence of type I IFN. As it was reported that AXL can attenuate type I IFN antiviral signaling (

 <italic>Oasl, Cxcl10</italic>, and 
 <italic>Ifitm3</italic> at 6 hours post ZIKV infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). These results suggested that ZY13 can strengthen the host antiviral immune responses shortly post-ZIKV infection.
