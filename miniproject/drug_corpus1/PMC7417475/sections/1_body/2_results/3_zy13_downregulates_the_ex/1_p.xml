<p>According to previous studies, AXL was considered as a candidate entry factor for ZIKV infection (

 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Nowakowski et al., 2016</xref>). However, recent studies argue against the role of AXL as an entry receptor (

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Instead, it was reported that the presence of AXL attenuated the ZIKV activated type I interferon (IFN) antiviral signaling (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). In brief, the AXL receptor is identified as ZIKV entry receptor and/or antiviral immune modulator and may play an important role during ZIKV infection in a cell-type-specific manner (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Strange et al., 2019</xref>). In order to elucidate the mechanism by which ZY13 suppresses ZIKV infection, we analyzed the expression of relevant genes with or without ZY13 administration in U251 cells post ZIKV infection. We found that ZY13 significantly reduced the expression level of
