<p>Our previous work established that BF-30 and its analogs show effective broad-spectrum antimicrobial abilities and therapeutic potential for pancreatic cancer (

 <sub>50</sub> of 1.06 ± 0.13 μM in U251 cells and IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.81 ± 0.34 μM in Vero cells. Meanwhile, ZY13 shows relatively weaker effect on the replication of DENV-2. The LL-37 cathelicidin-derived peptides were reported to directly inactivate ZIKV (

 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Xu J. et al., 2019</xref>). In our previous study, we found that ZY13 has an amphipathic helix structure and can cause the membrane perforation of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, we reasonably speculated that ZY13 may interrupt the viral membrane integrity of the ZIKV virions. Firstly, considering ZIKV pre-incubation with 20 μM of ZY13 significantly reduced over 95% of the plaque forming units, ZY13 was revealed to play antiviral roles by inactivating the viral particles of ZIKV. Confusingly, we found that ZY13 exhibited more notable antiviral effects in WT BMDM cells than in 
 <italic>Ifnar
  <sup>–/–</sup>
 </italic> BMDM cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Given this evidence, we further explored other antiviral mechanisms of ZY13 involved in inhibiting ZIKV infection. Remarkably, we found that ZY13 also possesses immunomodulatory functions by modulating type I IFN signaling. Type I IFN and the genes it stimulates are key mediators in controlling ZIKV infection and replication (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Barrows et al., 2018</xref>). Recently, AXL-SOCS1 have been identified as negative regulators of type I IFN signaling and have been shown to play an important role during ZIKV infection (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Strange et al., 2019</xref>). Our result suggests that ZY13 administration downregulates the expression of 
 <italic>Axl</italic>, 
 <italic>SOCS1</italic> and 
 <italic>SOCS3</italic> at early stage post ZIKV infection. Consistent with this observation, ZY13 administration was associated with an increase in the expression of type I IFN inducible genes 
 <italic>Oasl, Cxcl10</italic>, and 
 <italic>Ifitm3</italic> at 6 h post ZIKV infection. The ZY13 induced expression of type I IFN inducible genes may favor the elimination of ZIKV during the early phase of infection. Since AXL has closer links to ZIKV rather than other flaviviruses, these findings may partially explain the different antiviral efficacy of ZY13 against ZIKV and DENV-2.
