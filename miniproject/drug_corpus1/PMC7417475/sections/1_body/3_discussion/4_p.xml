<p>It is also worth mentioning that a growing body of evidence indicates that antimicrobial peptides may participate in the transcriptional regulation of bacteria and mammal cells (

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Munoz et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, the scrambled control peptide Scr-ZY13 shows little antiviral and immunomodulatory activity during ZIKV infection. Thus, as a reasonable conjecture, it is likely that ZY13 may act as a regulator of gene transcription during ZIKV infection and therefore warrants further studies.
