<p>ZIKV infection can result in cortical thinning and neurodevelopment anomalies of fetus. It is possible and necessary to evaluate the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antiviral efficiency of ZY13 by using an appropriate mouse model (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, we demonstrated that ZY13 could restrict the viral load in the brain and improve the growth defects of ZIKV-infected mouse pups. The development of the brain of rodents is immature at birth. In this sense, 1 day old neonate mice brain development may well correspond to that seen in the later stages of human pregnancy (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). On the basis of the results, it is reasonable to say that ZY13 may have therapeutic potential 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, a study has shown that different ZIKV strains respond differently to the natural compound silvestrol (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Elgner et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, for further anti-ZIKV agent development of ZY13, more experiments should be carried out both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> by using different ZIKV genotypes.
