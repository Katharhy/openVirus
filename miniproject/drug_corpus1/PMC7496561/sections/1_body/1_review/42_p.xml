<p>Adverse effects and challenges: adverse side effects include intolerable gastrointestinal toxicity and diarrhea. There may also be an increased risk of hepatotoxicity, hence close laboratoryÂ monitoring may be needed. With ritonavir being a CYP3A4 inhibitor, it is also a moderate inhibitor of p-glycoprotein (P-gp), organic anion transporter (OATP1B1), OATP1B3, and is an inducer of uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT). A sizable majority of patients with COVID- 19 requiring ICU admission are elderly with various comorbidities and polypharmacy. Therefore, considerable attention should be paid to any possible drug interactions in these patients [

Another area of concern, as aptly described by Li et al., is that while HIV protease belongs to the aspartic protease family, the two coronavirus proteases are from the cysteine protease family. In addition to this, HIV protease inhibitors were specifically designed to fit the C2 symmetry in the catalytic site of the HIV protease dimer, but the coronavirus proteases lack this C2 symmetric site. So the potency and efficacy of LPV/r remain debatable [
