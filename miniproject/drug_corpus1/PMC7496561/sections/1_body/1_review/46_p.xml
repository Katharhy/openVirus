<p>Principle behind use: in a majority of seriously ill patients of COVID 19, the leading cause of death has been found to be ARDS and multi-organ system failure. This has been linked to an exaggerated immune response leading to the heightened synthesis of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines like IL-6, IL-1β, IP10, and MCP1. This leads to a condition of severe systemic inflammatory response also known as CRS [

Hence the answer to a possible therapeutic intervention cannot rely on antiviral alone. IL-6 is a key inflammatory driver in these reactions. Recent guidelines have indicated that IL-6 can be a biomarker indicating worsening of COVID-19 [
