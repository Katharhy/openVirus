<p>MOA: as mentioned above, proteases are vital enzymes that play an important role in viral replication, maturation, and assembly process. Inhibition of these protease enzymes can help to effectively limit the spread of the virus in the host cells. LPV/r interferes with HIV protease, resulting in inhibition of HIV replication by causing dysregulation of structural and functional proteins in the virus core, contributing to the generation of immature and noninfectious virus particles [
