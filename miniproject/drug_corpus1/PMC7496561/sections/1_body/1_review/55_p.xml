<p>Ribavirin is a guanosine analog that interferes with viral RNA synthesis by inhibiting viral RdRp as well as messenger RNA (mRNA) capping [
 <xref rid="REF44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Studies have shown that while SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-OC43 were sensitive to ribavirin in vitro, drug concentrations that significantly impede CoV replication is higher than what can be safely achieved in humans. A reason for the decreased in vitro efficacy of ribavirin was found to be the excision of ribavirin nucleoside analogs by coronavirus proofreading mechanism. Subsequent in vivo testing showed that monotherapy with ribavirin showed restricted activity against SARS-CoV in mouse models. However, in primate models, improvement of MERS symptoms was seen when ribavirin was combined with type I Interferons [
