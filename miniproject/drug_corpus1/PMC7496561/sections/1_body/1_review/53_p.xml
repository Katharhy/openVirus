<p>Adverse effects and challenges: lymphopenia and anemia have been identified as potential adverse effects in multiple clinical trials, which can worsen the outcome in severe cases of COVID-19. Baricitinib therapy also increases the levels of creatine kinase, and this elevation is more common in patients in ICU and critically ill. Some studies have reported an increased incidence of respiratory tract infections as high as 16.3% and an incidence of other infectious diseases as high as 29-42%. Co-infection is a significant threat during treatment with baricitinib. There is an increased risk of reactivation of latent infections like TB, hepatitis B, Varicella-zoster, herpes simplex, and Epstein Barr virus strains [

Also, the biological agents targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines can only inhibit specific inflammatory factors, but the whole cascade is still active and affecting the system. Another concern is that some anti-inflammatory medications such as JAK inhibitors target and hamper interferon-alpha production, which plays a key role in the antiviral endogenous response, and theoretically may not be apt for the inflammatory cytokine storm caused by viruses such as COVID-19. In addition, the efficacy of baricitinib against COVID-19 is still under study [
