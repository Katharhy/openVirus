<p>As mentioned under pathogenesis, SARS-CoV-2 enters the cells of our body through ACE2. Some have suggested that the use of ACE inhibitor impairs (ACEI) the ACE/angiotensin-II/angiotensin-1 receptor pathway. which further impedes the integrity of the ACE2/angiotensin 1-7/MAS (MAS-related G protein-coupled receptor). This ultimately could result in decreased production of ACE2, thereby reducing the chances of SARS-CoV-2 entering the cell. However, it has also been argued that ACEI inhibits ACE and decreases the level of angiotensin-1. This in turn through possible negative feedback, upregulates more ACE2 receptors, leading to increased binding sites for SARS-CoV-2. A recent article published in The Lancet mentions that drugs causing an increase in ACE2 receptors are at a higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection [

Therefore, the balance of potential benefits and harms from continuing ACEI or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) therapy during an acute infection depends on the reason for prescribing. Although these drugs initially sparked interest due to their interaction with ACE receptors, which in turn play a major role in the pathogenesis of COVID infection, they are not being viewed as a potential COVID-19 treatment option. Currently, there are some clinical trials focussing on stopping ACE inhibitors and ARBs for patients with COVID 19. Data on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) drugs acting on lung-specific expression of ACE2 in human and animal experimental models are lacking. Further studies in humans need to be performed to better understand the relation between SARS-CoV-2 and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) pathways.
