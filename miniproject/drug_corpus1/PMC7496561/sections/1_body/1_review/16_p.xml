<p>Principle behind use: severe cases of COVID-19 are characterized by a cytokine storm defined as a sudden production of cytokines, such as IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), MCP1, MIP-1a, and TNF-Î±, secondary to the upregulation of the inflammatory process in COVID-19 [

 <xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], the viral attack occurs in two stages. In the first stage, the virus attacks the organs that express ACE2 receptors while the second attack occurs 7-14 days after symptom onset. In the early phases, the virus causes a reduction in B lymphocyte and IL-6 counts, which can have an impact on antibody production. The lymphocyte count continues to drop over the course of the disease along with a rise in inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, an ideal therapeutic agent should enhance the immune function of the patient along with slowing down the production of inflammatory cytokines [
