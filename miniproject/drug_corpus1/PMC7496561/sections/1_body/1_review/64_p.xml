<p>NETs are web-like DNA proteins expelled from the neutrophils that trap pathogens. Excessive NET formations can trigger a cascade of inflammatory reactions that destroy surrounding tissues, facilitating microthrombosis leading to permanent damage to pulmonary and other systems. The coagulation abnormality seen in infected patients is most likely due to the widespread inflammatory response as the virus does not appear to have intrinsic procoagulant effects. Early reports from the first 99 patients hospitalized in China showed that 5% had elevated prothrombin time (PT), 6% had elevated activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), 36% had elevated D-dimer, with increased biomarkers of inflammation such as IL-6, Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and c-reactive protein (CRP). Drugs like neutrophil elastase inhibitors, protein arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) inhibitors, gasdermin D inhibitors, deoxyribonuclease (DNase), colchicine, and IL-1β are some drugs targeting NETs while some are still under development. Of these, colchicine and anakinra are under study [
