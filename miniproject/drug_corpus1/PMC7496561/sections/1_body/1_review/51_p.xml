<p>MOA: baricitinib is a reversible inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2, which results in blockage of signal transmission from cytokines or growth receptors. This leads to reduced hematopoiesis and immune cell function. This blockade of signal transmission impedes phosphorylation, which further prevents the activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription. It is postulated that baricitinib could prevent the intracellular movement of viral cells and the development of viral particles due to its affinity for binding to associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1) [
