<p>Adverse effects and challenges: as with any transfusion, plasma exchange carries a risk of transfusion-transmissible infections, the incidence of which is very low in the US. Other noninfectious risks include allergic transfusion reactions, transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO), and transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). TRALI is especially important in critically ill patients due to COVID-19. These patients may have underlying acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which could be worsened by TRALI. Volume overload (TACO) has the potential to precipitate pulmonary edema, especially in older adults, small children, and those with preexisting cardiac disease. Anaphylactic reactions may occur in patients with Immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency and antibodies to IgA [

A potential challenge that can affect the effectiveness of plasma exchange as a therapeutic option is the plasma antibody titer, which can vary among donors. Hence ensuring a high antibody titer specific for SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for optimum results. Also, the use of convalescent plasma has to be researched further due to the multidisciplinary approach in critically ill patients who are frequent recipients of plasma exchange [
