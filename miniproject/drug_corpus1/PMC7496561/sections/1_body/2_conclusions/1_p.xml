<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to a public health crisis resulting in an extensive search for curative treatments. Research findings and recommendations are constantly evolving as various aspects of the virus and its transmission are being studied. Apart from the recently approved RDV, there are no other approved specific drugs that can cure patients infected by the virus. It has also been suggested that there is a possibility of a large number of undocumented asymptomatic infections, which facilitates the rapid spread of the virus. This is why the containment of the virus will be a particularly challenging task. Social distancing, contact tracing, and self-isolation are important strategies to avoid the spread of COVID-19 infection as mentioned by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Many drugs listed in this review are encouraging and the benefits of these most likely outweigh the risk of adverse events and could potentially be life-saving. In addition, many coronaviruses have a highly mutable single-stranded RNA genome. Discovering new drugs against the virus is going to be challenging owing to the possible viral genetic recombinations. Extensive research is still needed to safely advocate the efficacy of the currently available therapeutic options.</p>
