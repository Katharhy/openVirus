<p>Pneumonia, which is one of the common complications seen in patients with COVID-19, follows a complex pathogenic mechanism. The virus generates an excessive immune response within the host, also known as a "cytokine storm". Cytokines such as the tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-1-beta (IL-1β), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-12 (IL-12), interferon-gamma inducible protein (IP10), macrophage inflammatory protein 1A (MIP-1a), and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) are released, resulting in the pathogenic cascade of the disease that leads to extensive tissue damage with dysfunctional coagulation. Of these, interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is produced mostly by activated leukocytes, seems to play the primary role in this cascade. IL-6 promotes the differentiation of B lymphocytes and stimulates the production of acute-phase proteins. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is an acute systemic inflammatory syndrome that is mediated by IL-6. It is characterized by fever and multiple organ dysfunction. Upon binding of SARS-COV-2 with the toll-like receptor (TLR), there is a release of pro-IL-1β, which is further cleaved into its active mature form. IL-1β plays a major role in lung inflammation and fibrosis seen in patients with COVID-19 [
