<p>Genetic characterization has exhibited that bats and rodents are the chief genetic sources of AlphaCoVs and BetaCoVs. On the other hand, avian species appear to be the major genetic sources of DeltaCoVs and GammaCoVs. The viruses of this large family group can cause neurologic, hepatic, respiratory, and intestinal diseases in multiple animal species, which include bats, cats, camels, cattle, and cases of COVID infection have also been detected in feline families in the New York Zoo. SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome contains 29891 nucleotides, which encode for 9860 amino acids, and it has a diameter of 60-140 nm. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 was found to have 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV. Information from these genomic analyses indicates the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 having evolved from a strain found in bats [

A study has revealed that Pangolin-CoV was found to be 91.02% identical to SARS-CoV-2 and 90.55% identical to BatCoV. Therefore, apart from BatCoV, Pangolin-CoV is most closely related to SARS CoV2 and it could be a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2-like CoVs [
