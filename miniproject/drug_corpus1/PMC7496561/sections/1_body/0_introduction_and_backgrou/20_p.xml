<p>The polypeptide translation product from the genomic RNA is processed into structural and nonstructural components by the two proteases, namely 3CLpro and PLpro. These proteins are essential for the replication and packaging of the virus. PLpro also acts as a deubiquitinase, which helps to deubiquitylate interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), a host cell protein. It also serves to inactivate the pathway for the nuclear factor κ‐light‐chain‐enhancer of activated B cells (NF‐κB). This ultimately results in immune suppression in the virus-infected host cells. Hence these proteases are potential targets for antiviral agents since they play an important role in viral replication and controlling the host cell. Decoded 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV exhibit 96% sequence identity, similar to the RdRp protein. Most residues that show variation are found on the protein surface. Hence, in spite of these small variations, small molecule agents that strongly suppress SARS-CoV 3CLpro are anticipated to show the same activity against the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. In contrast to 3CLpro, PLpro from the two origins demonstrates only 83% sequence identity. In the case of PLpro, the variations between the two origins occupy the majority of the surface of PLpro. The variations in the amino acid sequence are expected to affect the interaction of PLpro enzymes with their ligands. However, the secondary‐structure components that constitute the active site do not show any variation within the two PLpro proteins. Therefore, an inhibitor developed for the SARS‐CoV PLpro would also possibly work for the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro [
