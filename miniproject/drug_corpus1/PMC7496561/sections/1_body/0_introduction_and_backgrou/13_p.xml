<p>Several studies have reported that CoVs have four structural proteins, which are spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FIG1">1</xref>. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors are located in different organs of the human body, the majority of which are found in the lungs (type 2 pneumocytes, tracheal, and bronchial epithelial cells, macrophages). These ACE2 receptors serve as entry points for SARS-CoV, which is followed by its replication. ACE2 genes are present on the X chromosome and it is found to be expressed in greater proportions in the Asian population than Caucasian and African-American populations [

Studies have shown that BetaCoV receptors in human cells that express ACE2 have demonstrated increased entry of SARS-CoV-2 [
