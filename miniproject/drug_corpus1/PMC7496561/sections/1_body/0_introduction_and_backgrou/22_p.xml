<p>PIs like disulfiram, lopinavir (LPV), and ritonavir have shown activity against SARS and MERS. Although disulfiram has been reported to inhibit the PLpro of MERS and SARS in-vitro, it lacks clinical evidence. LPV and ritonavir were considered to suppress the 3CLpro of SARS and MERS and improved clinical outcomes in patients with SARS in a trial. However, its action against the 3CLpro and PLpro of SARS-CoV-2 is still being studied [
