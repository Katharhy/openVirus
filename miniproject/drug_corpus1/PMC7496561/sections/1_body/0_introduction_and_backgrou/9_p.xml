<p>Coronavirus is classified into four types based on the genomic structure: Alphacoronavirus (AlphaCoV), Betacoronavirus (BetaCoV), Deltacoronavirus (DeltaCoV), and Gammacoronavirus (GammaCoV). As of today, seven human CoVs (HCoV) infecting human species have been identified. BetaCoVs of A lineage (HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1) and AlphaCoVs (HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63) can cause the common cold and upper respiratory infections in immunocompetent individuals while lower respiratory infections can occur in immunocompromised people. Other human CoVs, BetaCoVs of the B and C lineage (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV respectively) cause epidemics involving the respiratory and extra-respiratory systems [
