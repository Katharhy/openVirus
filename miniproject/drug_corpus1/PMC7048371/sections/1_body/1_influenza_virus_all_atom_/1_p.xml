Taken together, these simulations achieved a comprehensive simulation time of ∼121 ns. The complete viral envelope simulation included 30 NA tetramers, yielding 14.5 μs of monomeric simulation (121 ns × 30 tetramers × 4 monomers/tetramer), and 236 HA tetramers, accounting for 85.6 μs of monomeric dynamics (121 ns × 236 tetramers × 3 monomers/trimer). Each glycoprotein structure used to build the initial viral envelope system was taken from fully equilibrated single-glycoprotein MD simulations (see

The viral envelope simulations were run on the Blue Waters petascale supercomputer using 114688 processors, equivalent to 16384 Blue Waters nodes or 4096 physical nodes. The simulation averaged 25.57 steps/sec. Frames were written every 10,000 steps (20 ps), ultimately occupying 11.66 terabytes of disk space. Data analysis drew upon conformations extracted at equally spaced time points from these trajectories. The adopted MD protocol for the viral envelope simulations is fully described in
