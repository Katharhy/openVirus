<p>To judge whether mesoscale simulations enhance conformational sampling, we compared the viral envelope full simulation (referred to as “complete-envelope”, 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>E) to five long time scale simulations of isolated NA tetramers embedded in small lipid-bilayer patches, described in a previous work (“single-glycoprotein”, 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>C).

 </sup> A fair comparison requires that the sampling of the two systems be consistent in terms of the actual simulation length. The viral envelope full simulation sampled 14.5 μs of monomeric dynamics, but the five simulations of isolated NA tetramers sampled only 1.0 μs of monomeric dynamics (5 simulations × 50 ns/simulation × 1 NA tetramer × 4 monomers/tetramer). Thus, to improve the comparison, we considered only the final 8.33 ns of the viral envelope simulation, which is equivalent to 1.0 μs of monomeric dynamics (1 simulation × 8.33 ns/simulation × 30 NA tetramers × 4 monomers/tetramer) (

  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>D). We refer to this truncated segment of the full simulation as the “terminal-envelope” simulation. In all cases, the motions of the C
 <sub>α</sub> atoms of the same 19 residues were projected onto the first two principal components of the viral envelope NA trajectories, and the resulting heatmaps were compared (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>C–E). Strikingly, the PCA of the NA catalytic site residues indicates that the viral envelope simulation more thoroughly explored the conformational landscape, even after controlling for total simulation time.
