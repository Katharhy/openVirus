<p>The PCA analysis demonstrates that the viral envelope simulation more thoroughly sampled distinct 1° pocket states (

  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>E) that are scarcely populated in the single glycoprotein (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>C). This holds true even when comparing the terminal-envelope (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>D) simulation to the single-glycoprotein simulations (where the total sampling time is equal). The enhanced conformational sampling may simply be a product of the large number of NA copies blanketed across the viral surface; however, we do expect some effects from the viral surface environment, including long-range electrostatic forces and glycoprotein–glycoprotein interactions that only the viral envelope simulation can capture.
