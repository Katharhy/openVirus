<p>Taken together, these results suggest a biophysical mechanism for the previously uncharacterized 2° site. Sialic acid receptors may first bind the 2° site before being transferred to the 1° sialidase site (

 </xref>). We propose that our chloride distribution analysis is well suited for studying these possible mechanisms of molecular transfer. In contrast to a simple electrostatic map, our simulation-based analysis accounts for both electrostatic and steric factors, as well as for the conformational dynamics sampled over all 14.5 μs of the monomeric simulation in the context of the whole viral-envelope environment. In addition, the proposed “bind and transfer” mechanism is in good agreement with prior experimental results and proposed mechanisms.
