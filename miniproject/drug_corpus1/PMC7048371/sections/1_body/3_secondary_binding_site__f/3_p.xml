<p>To further explore the role of electrostatics in the in this transfer mechanism, we calculated the electrostatic potential of the 120 NA monomers at the end of MD simulations using the adaptive Poisson–Boltzmann solver (APBS 1.4) software.

These results provide evidence that the two sites may act cooperatively, supporting the work of Lai et al.,
