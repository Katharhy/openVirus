<p>We note that all FDA-approved NA inhibitors, as well as the endogenous ligand sialic acid, contain negatively charged carboxylate groups. Considering the hypothesis that the 2° site contributes to catalytic efficiency by recruiting and keeping substrates within close proximity to the catalytic site
