<p>Although sialic acid substrates were not included in the viral envelope simulation, we propose that the negatively charged chloride anions in the bulk solvent surrounding the NA monomers serve as a rough surrogate for negatively charged ligand moieties that may associate with the glycoprotein surface. To identify regions favorable to chloride occupancy, we concatenated the 120 monomeric NA simulations and aligned them by the alpha carbons of the 1° site. The chloride atoms were binned into 3375000 voxels (0.67 Å × 0.67 Å × 0.67 Å each). We focused on voxels containing chloride counts greater than three standard deviations above the mean. Notably, our simulations reveal that a volume of high chloride occupancy connects the 1° and 2° sialic acid binding sites (

 </xref>A). This path is wide enough to allow negatively charged small molecules such as sialic acid or oseltamivir carboxylate to move from the 2° site to the 1° catalytic site. Additional regions of high chloride density are also depicted in
