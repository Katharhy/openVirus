<p>The volumetric and dynamical properties of the 1° site revealed in our simulations suggest that NA can bind many structurally distinct and complex sialoglycan receptors as part of the host-cell recognition process. Indeed, human glycans are vastly diverse in both their sugar composition and configuration (e.g., long, short, biantennary, triantennary, etc.).

 </sup> As such, the transient deepening and broadening of the 1° NA site may allow the glycoprotein to accommodate bulkier (e.g., long, bi/triantennary) and longer glycan receptors. Given that our simulations model the entire viral envelope, it may be that full-pocket opening only occurs in a crowded viral-surface environment. Alternatively, our simulations may capture full-pocket opening because the viral coat includes many replicates of individual glycoproteins, enabling extensive conformational sampling.
