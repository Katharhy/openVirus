<p>Using the intramolecular distance between the 150- and 430-loops as a metric for 150-cavity formation, we constructed a two-state MSM from the conformations sampled by the viral envelope simulation to estimate the time scales of 150-loop opening and closing motions. Ultimately, we find the stationary distribution (equilibrium probabilities) of the open and closed states to be similar (0.53 and 0.47, respectively). Correspondingly, the time to transition between the two states (i.e., the mean first-passage time (MFPT)) is also roughly equal (39 ± 15 ns for open to closed and 29 ± 11 ns from closed to open), indicating that loop opening and closing occur at similar rates (
