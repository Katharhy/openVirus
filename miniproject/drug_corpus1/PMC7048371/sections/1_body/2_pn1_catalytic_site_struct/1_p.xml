<p>To explore the dynamics of the catalytic site, we analyzed the volumes of the 1° pocket and adjacent regions over the course of the entire viral envelope simulation (120 NA monomers,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>)) with a closed 150-cavity has a volume of 800 Å
 <sup>3</sup>, and the structure of a nonpandemic N1 (PDB ID: 2HTY(
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>)) with an open 150-cavity has a volume of 1088 Å
 <sup>3</sup>. This indicates that the volume and depth of the catalytic pocket and adjacent regions can increase remarkably over what has been observed in crystal structures (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>C). Contributing to this additional cavity volume and depth are two novel subpockets near residues G351 and E227, buried deep inside, but contiguous with, the 1° site (

  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>B). An analysis with FTMap, a server for mapping ligand binding hot spots in macromolecules,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">63</xref>
 </sup> suggests that the G351 subpocket can accommodate small-molecule ligands. Similar to the 150-cavity and 430-cavity, the G351- and E227-adjacent subpockets may provide new ligand-binding opportunities.
