<p>To understand the impact of a crowded viral environment on loop sampling, we used the same protocol to construct an MSM from structures extracted from simulations of isolated NAs embedded in planar bilayer patches.

 </sup> The 150-loop dynamics of both the viral envelope and single-glycoprotein simulations are nearly equivalent; however, the error associated with the viral-envelope MSM is much smaller, likely due to the increased simulation time. The single-glycoprotein equilibrium probabilities of the open and closed states were 0.61 and 0.39, respectively, and the MFPT ranges (open to closed and closed to open after 50 ± 96 ns and 72 ± 44 ns, respectively) overlap with those calculated using the viral envelope simulations. This comparison suggests that 150-cavity dynamics are not influenced by the crowded environment of the viral envelope, an expected result given that this pocket is oriented inward (toward the neighboring three monomers of the same tetramer) rather than outward (toward the environment).
