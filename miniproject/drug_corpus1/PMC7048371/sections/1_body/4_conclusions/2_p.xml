<p>Taken together, this information provides fundamental insights into our understanding of sialic acid/oseltamivir carboxylate recognition, suggesting new strategies for the development of NA inhibitors. Our work also provides a novel methodological advancement for extracting long-time-scale dynamics from short-time-scale simulations by applying the powerful MSM theoretical framework at subcellular and cellular scales.</p>
