<p>Our work suggests a novel NA binding mechanism wherein a sialic acid-containing substrate (e.g., a glycan receptor) first binds the 2° site, as predicted by earlier BD simulations.

 </sup> After binding, the substrate is transferred to the catalytic site via electrostatic interactions. Finally, the catalytic site cleaves the terminal sialic acid substrate. In other words, a budding viral particle might use the 2° site to first attract the sialic acid-tipped receptors before these are cleaved within the catalytic site, ultimately allowing viral escape from the infected host-cell surface. MSM and volumetric analyses also further expand the functional annotation of the 1° site and surrounding regions, disclosing exceptionally deep and broad catalytic-pocket conformations. These findings can be exploited to design novel multipronged inhibitors capable of reaching the additional NA cavities unveiled in our multiscale simulations.
