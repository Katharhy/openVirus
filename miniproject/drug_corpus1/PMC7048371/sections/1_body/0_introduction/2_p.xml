<p>The catalytic (primary, 1°) site of NA is highly flexible, in part due to the adjacent 150- and 430-loops (residues 147–152 and 429–433, respectively, N2 numbering).

 </sup> The significance of this flexibility is highlighted by the structural comparison of the phylogenetically distinct group-1 (N1, N4, N5, and N8) and group-2 (N2, N3, N6, N7, and N9) NAs, which illustrates that the opening of the 150-loop in the group-1 structures leads to the formation of the so-called 150-cavity

 </sup> However, crystal structures of pH1N1 NA (pN1) reveal that, unlike all other group-1 NAs, its 150-loop is closed, and therefore no 150-cavity is present.

 </sup> In contrast, previous investigations utilizing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have found that the 150-loop of pN1 is in the open state ∼60–65% of the time.
