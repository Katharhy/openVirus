<p>Over the past decade, studies of viruses at the molecular and coarse-grained (CG) levels have given unique insights into these systems, complementing and extending available experimental data by providing highly detailed models at never-before-seen scales as well as suggesting testable biological hypotheses (predictions).

 </sup> Work by Schulten and co-workers established the first explicitly solvated atomic MD simulation of an intact virus, the satellite tobacco mosaic virus (∼17 nm diameter, ∼1 million atoms, 50 ns dynamics), in 2006.

 </sup> Zink and Grubmuller in 2009 used steered MD to explore the dynamics of the explicitly solvated icosahedral shell of the southern bean mosaic virus (∼36 nm diameter, ∼4.5 million atoms, 100 ns).

 </sup> In 2010, Ayton and Voth developed and simulated an implicitly solvated CG representation of the immature HIV-1 virion (∼125 nm diameter, 280,000 CG particles).

 </sup> In 2012, Larsson and co-workers simulated with explicitly solvated all-atom MD the satellite tobacco necrosis virus (∼17 nm diameter, ∼1.2 million atoms, ∼1 us),

 </sup> and Roberts et al. developed a fully atomic poliovirus (∼30 nm diameter, ∼2.8–4 million atoms, 50 ns).

 </sup> In 2013, Schulten and co-workers built and simulated a fully atomic representation of the HIV capsid (∼70 nm diameter, ∼64 million atoms, ∼100 ns),
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>
 </sup> and Andoh et al. in 2014 simulated an all-atom poliovirus capsid (∼30 nm diameter, ∼6.5 million atoms, ∼200 ns).

 </sup> Sansom and colleagues in 2015 reported an explicitly solvated CG influenza virus simulation (∼80 nm diameter, 5 million particles).

 </sup> and Bond, Verma, and co-workers,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>
 </sup> reported CG simulations of the Dengue viral membrane (∼50 nm diameter, ∼1 million particles). In addition to the rich structural, dynamical, and biophysical insights that these studies each provided, the investigations have collectively pushed the capabilities of molecular simulation, often relying on the world’s fastest and most advanced computing architectures.
