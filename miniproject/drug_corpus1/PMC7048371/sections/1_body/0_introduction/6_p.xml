<p>As the first explicitly solvated atomic-scale simulation of a viral lipid envelope (∼115 nm diameter, ∼160 million particles, ∼121 ns), the work reported here breaks new ground in molecular simulation. To further characterize the structural dynamics of the viral envelope and its glycoproteins, we combined our mesoscale all-atom MD simulations with Markov state model (MSM) theory,

 </sup> thus enabling the extraction of long-time-scale (e.g., microseconds) individual glycoprotein dynamics in a crowded environment from the short-time-scale MD (e.g., nanoseconds) of the fully intact viral surface. The accuracy and utility of MSMs have been demonstrated by experimental validation for many use cases, including protein–protein binding, small-molecule binding kinetics, and protein-folding rate prediction.

 </sup> Correspondingly, the approach reported here, which relies on the many copies of single glycoproteins present within a biologically accurate environment, provides a novel methodological advancement for extracting long-time-scale dynamics from short simulations through the powerful MSM theoretical framework at subcellular and cellular scales.
