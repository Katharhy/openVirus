<p>Here, we quantitatively compare how calculated protein dynamics differ when simulating many proteins in a single subcellular environment versus simulating single proteins in isolation. By exploiting the whole pH1N1 viral envelope treated entirely with atomic resolution, this study provides unique insights into the two sialic acid binding sites of NA (e.g., 1° and 2°). Our mesoscale atomic simulations suggest that the NA 1° site is even more flexible than previously appreciated and provide the first rigorous kinetic characterization of the 150-loop dynamics. Furthermore, our work suggests that the 2° site, which is more solvent exposed and, in some strains, has a higher

 </sup> may be responsible for initially capturing sialic acid residues, which are then electrostatically guided to the 1° site for enzymatic cleavage. Within this context, our mesoscale simulations unveil an unprecedented cooperative interplay between the two sites that further illuminates the process of sialic acid/oseltamivir carboxylate recognition and 2° site functional annotation. This fundamental discovery may be used as a rationale for the development of novel anti-influenza small-molecule therapeutics targeting NA.
