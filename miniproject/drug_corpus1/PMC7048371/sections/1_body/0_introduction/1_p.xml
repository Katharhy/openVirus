<p>Influenza virus infection is responsible for millions of deaths worldwide each year. The Center for Disease Control estimates that pandemic influenza A H1N1 2009 (pH1N1) affected 60.8 million people, resulting in 12468 casualties in the United States alone.

 </sup> Along with others, this strain dramatically contributes to yearly epidemics, continuously fueling concerns about the emergence of a new pandemic strain. In addition, the increasingly widespread resistance to antiviral medications is compounding this threat,
 <sup>

 </sup> thus requiring the development of novel approaches for the prevention and treatment of influenza virus infection. One such strategy is to target the viral surface glycoprotein neuraminidase (NA), which promotes viral progeny release from the host cell by cleaving terminal sialic acid residues.
