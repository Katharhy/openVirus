<p>NA also contains a secondary (2°) sialic acid binding site adjacent to the catalytic site. This site was first identified as a hemadsorption site in avian-origin influenza NAs

 </sup> and was not initially believed to be present in swine-origin strains due to nonconservation of critical residues at this site.

 </sup> However, more recent studies provide support for the presence of a 2° site in swine-origin influenza NAs, including pN1.

 </sup> The precise mechanism by which this 2° site functions remains unclear; however, a number of studies have demonstrated its role in receptor binding

 </sup> In addition, previous Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations of single glycoproteins and various ligands suggested that both endogenous substrates and the drug oseltamivir carboxylate bind faster to the 2° site than the 1° site (i.e., the
