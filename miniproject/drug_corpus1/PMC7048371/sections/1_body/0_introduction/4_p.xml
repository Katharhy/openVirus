<p>To study the 1° and 2° sites in the context of the viral surface, we used integrative modeling to construct a fully atomistic model of the pH1N1 viral envelope (

The model was built using high-resolution crystallographic structures of individual glycoproteins (∼1.9–2.6 Å resolution)

 </sup> that were spatially positioned according to a lower-resolution cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET, ∼16–20 Å resolution) map of a viral particle.

 </sup> Our viral envelope construct includes 30 NA tetramers (120 monomers) and 236 hemagglutinin (HA) trimers (708 monomers) embedded in a phospholipid bilayer, with realistic density and patterning taken from the cryo-ET. The entire pH1N1 all-atom system modeled here amounts to ∼160 million atoms (fully solvated) and is ∼115 nm in diameter. As such, it is among the largest biophysical systems yet studied with all-atom molecular dynamics.
