  <p>Volumetric and ligand binding “hot spot” analyses of the 1° catalytic site and adjacent regions. (A) NA is shown in ice blue ribbon, and the pocket volume is filled with semitransparent gel. The 1° active site, 430-loop, and 150-loop are visible. (B) NA is shown as a solid gradient, and ligand-binding hotspots are metallic. A portion of the surface-rendered protein was removed to facilitate visualization of internal cavities. This NA conformation has a notably open G351 pocket, which has a high propensity to bind ligands. (C) A histogram of the NA catalytic-site volumes sampled during the MD simulations. As reference, the volumes of the same active-site cavity from two crystal structures are indicated with black circled stars. The 3NSS(
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>) structure (pH1N1 with a closed 150-cavity) has a volume of 800 Å
   <sup>3</sup>, and the 2HTY(
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>) structure (H5N1 with an open 150-cavity) has a pocket volume of 1088 Å
   <sup>3</sup>. The simulated-pocket volumes range from ∼450 to 4440 Å
   <sup>3</sup> (intervals 3500–4500 not shown), as reported in
