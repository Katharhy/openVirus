 <caption>
  <p>A two-state MSM with representative structures from the viral envelope simulation. The equilibrium populations of the open and closed states are approximately equal in both the viral envelope and single-glycoprotein simulations. Correspondingly, the mean first-passage times between the states are approximately equal. The 150-loop and 430-loop are represented as green and red ribbons, respectively.</p>
