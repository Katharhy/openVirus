  <p>Chlorine anion distribution within the NA binding sites. The chlorine anion distribution (A) and the projection of the electrostatic potential onto the NA surface (B) show the pathway between the 1° and 2° sites. In panel A, NA is drawn as ice blue cartoon. Regions of high chloride occupancy are illustrated as dotted silver bubbles. Two sialic acids (PDB ID: 1MWE(
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>)) are superimposed in the catalytic (center) and 2° (upper right) sites for reference.
