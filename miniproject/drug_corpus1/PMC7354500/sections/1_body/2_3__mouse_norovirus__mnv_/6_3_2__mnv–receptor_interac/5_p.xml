<p>This flexibility of the P domain may play an important role in receptor interaction in MNV by creating more space for the receptor to bind [

 <xref rid="B66-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00618-f006">Figure 6</xref>, the atomic structure of the MNV P domain/CD300lf receptor [
 <xref rid="B68-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] was modeled into the pseudo-atomic cryo-EM structures of MNV in the apo (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00618-f006">Figure 6</xref>A) and the 3Å MNV/GCDCA complex structure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00618-f006">Figure 6</xref>B). For comparison, the ~9Å cryo-EM structure of the MNV/GCDCA/CD300lf complex is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00618-f006">Figure 6</xref>C. The overlay of the complex structure in the cryo-EM density is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00618-f006">Figure 6</xref>D. A, B, and C subunits are colored blue, green, and red, respectively and the CD300lf receptor is shown in yellow. In all panels, the C-termini of the CD300lf N-terminal fragment is noted as green circles on some of the copies of the receptor on the viral surface. As shown in the model of the expanded form, the C-termini of the CD300lf form trimers in the icosahedron. There is clearly not enough room for all the P domains to be saturated with receptor. When the structure of the GCDCA bound “contracted” structure [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] of MNV is used for modeling, there is additional space around each of the P domains for at least a higher degree of saturation with receptor. Interestingly, the P domains of the A subunits around the 5-fold axes are oriented such that there is clearly room for saturation. While this figure shows just two conformations, it is more than likely that the flexibility of the linker allows for multiple conformational states. These results suggest that when MNV enters the gut with its high levels of bile salts and other solutes, the virus may switch from the extended to the contracted state to make more space available for receptor binding.
