<p>Using these soluble forms of CD300lf and the P domains, they also directly measured the interaction affinity using surface plasmon resonance [
 <xref rid="B66-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The monomeric CD300lf protein bound to the P domain with a Kd of ~219 µM. While this represents a very weak interaction, the other members of the CD300 family, that failed to confer susceptibility to MNV infection (mouse CD300ld, mouse CD300lh, and human CD300f), showed little to no binding. By adding calcium, the affinity improved to ~25 µM and when GCDCA and calcium were both added, the affinity improved to ~12 µM. The monomeric CD300lf molecules were then linked as dimers by fusing them to an antibody Fc fragment. As expected, this improved apparent affinity (avidity) to ~0.5 µM. This is entirely consistent with foundational studies demonstrating that Fab fragments bind with ~100–1000 lower apparent affinity than the corresponding IgG [
