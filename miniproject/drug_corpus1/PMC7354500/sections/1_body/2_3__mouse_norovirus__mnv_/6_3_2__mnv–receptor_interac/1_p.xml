<p>The flexibility of the entire P domain may also play a role in receptor interactions. The Virgin lab found that the cell receptor for MNV was proteinaceous and was not dependent upon carbohydrates for binding [
 <xref rid="B65-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 system, a gene that encodes a cell-surface protein that contained an immunoglobin domain and belonged to a lipid protein family was most significantly enriched in the surviving cells, CD300lf. It was confirmed that this was the receptor from studies showing that knocking out Cd300lf in BV2 cells blocked infection by MNV and treating the cells with antibodies to CD300lf blocked MNV attachment. Attachment of MNV to BV2 cells was not affected by pre-treatment of the cells with the mannosidase I inhibitor, kifunensine, suggesting that carbohydrates do not play a significant role in MNV attachment. Even stronger evidence of the importance of CD300lf came from the demonstration that expression of this mouse cell surface protein in HeLa cells made these human cells susceptible to MNV infection. While carbohydrates are not apparently important for cell binding, they found that bile salts such as glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) enhances viral attachment to BV2 cells [

These results were further substantiated using isothermal titration calorimetry that showed GCDCA binds to the expressed form of the P domain with Kd of ~6 ÂµM, but TCA did not bind at all.
