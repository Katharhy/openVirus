<p>The P domain mobility could also affect antibody recognition. In the expanded state, the flexible tether between the shell and the P domains could be sensitive to proteases. This could release soluble P domains to act as a “smoke screen” for the immune system and present antigenic sites not normally exposed on the viral surface. Similarly, the marked flexibility of the P domains in the expanded state might expose these antigenic sites without having to be cleaved from the shell. In either case, if any of these normally buried sites are immunodominant, then the immune response might focus on producing antibodies that bind poorly or not at all to the contracted capsid. This hypothesis is supported by the findings that the immune response to MNV included antibodies to the buried shell domain [

 <xref rid="B64-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Essentially, the highly flexible nature of the P domain could be a “moving target” for the immune response.
