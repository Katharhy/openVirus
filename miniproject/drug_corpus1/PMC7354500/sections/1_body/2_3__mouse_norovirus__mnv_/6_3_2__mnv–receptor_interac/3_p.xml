<p>To determine the atomic details of CD300lf binding to the receptor, the atomic structure of the soluble P domain/CD300lf complex was determined [

 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Initial attempts at determining the cyo-EM structure of the whole MNV virus/CD300lf complex failed to clearly show receptor binding to the P domain. This could have been due to the relatively low affinity of CD300lf in the absence of GCDCA and/or the marked flexibility of the P domain causing disorder in the reconstruction. Therefore, as a control, the cryo-EM structure of the MNV/GCDCA complex was determined. Surprisingly, the addition of GCDCA alone cause large conformational changes in the capsid (
