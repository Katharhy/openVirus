<p>There were several major changes in the MNV capsid upon the addition of GCDCA [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The P domains rotated by ~90° counterclockwise and drop down onto the surface of the shell domain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00618-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Likely because of the new and extensive interactions between the shell and P domains, the P domain became highly ordered and the entire capsid protein could be traced. The structure of the P domain was essentially identical to the crystal structure of the GCDCA/P domain complex [

 <xref rid="B68-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. GCDCA was observed to bind between the P domain dimers and the C’D’ loop flips up towards the A’B’ and E’F’ loops. This, in turn, pushes the E’F’ loop towards the A’B’ loop causing the P domain to have the “closed” conformation observed in the original crystal structure [
 <xref rid="B61-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. While GCDCA was clearly observed between the two P domains in the cryo-EM density, there was no evidence of it binding anywhere else in the structure that might cause this large P domain motion. It was suggested that the effects of GCDCA might be non-specific via changes in the properties of water around the P domain [
