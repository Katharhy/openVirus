<p>The details of the MNV–receptor interactions have been elucidated with the atomic structure of the P domain/CD300lf complex [

 <xref rid="B68-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] and the cryo-EM structure of the MNV/CD300lf complex [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The CD300lf contact site is near the top of the P2 domain, between the A’B’ and D’E’ loops. Interestingly, this contact surface includes some of the amino acids involved in the binding of the neutralizing antibody, A6.2. From structural analysis, they also found that that that GCDCA and lithocholic acid (LCA) bind in two deep pockets in the P domain dimer interface, distant from receptor and antibody binding sites [
