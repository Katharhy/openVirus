<p>To understand how the 2D3 escape mutants, that are distal to antibody contact and buried beneath the surface, can block 2D3 binding, dynamic simulations were performed on the P domain where the V339I mutation was modeled into both the open and closed conformations [
 <xref rid="B71-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The results for the three simulations indicated that FabD/MNV-bound complex is sensitive to the flexibility of P domain dimer interfacial interactions, notably the salt bridge network that undergoes rearrangements necessary to accommodate the antibody binding. The buried dimer interface salt bridge network is complex and dynamic allowing the dimer to adopt more than one conformation. The V339I escape mutation is not in either of the A’B’ or E’F’ binding loops and simulations show it changes the salt bridge network and restricts the molecular liberation of the interfacial region and thus the conformational flexibility.
