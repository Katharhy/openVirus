<p>Using the A6.2/MNV-1 docking model [
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,
 <xref rid="B61-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] as a guide for mutagenesis, we identified six single point mutations in the E’F’ loop of the MNV-1 P domain that completely abrogated mAb A6.2 binding to MNV-1 and allowed mAb A6.2 neutralization escape in culture and in mice [
 <xref rid="B70-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. These studies suggested that a number of escape mutants block antibody binding by limiting the conformational repertoire of the E’F’ loop and not via direct interactions with the antibody. These studies are the first to suggest that escape mutations may act by limiting flexibility of an epitope or by driving the conformation towards a structure not recognized by the antibody. For example, in the open conformation, the L386F mutation would place the larger Phe side chain directly in contact with the bound antibody and would be exposed to water. However, in the closed conformation, the PHE would be completely buried between the A’B’ and E’F’ loops. Hence, the L386F mutation would appear to push the structural equilibrium towards the closed conformation, to which A6.2 cannot bind. Similarly, the A382R mutation in the closed conformation places the Arg into the solvent and thus should be the favorable structure. In contrast, in the open conformation, the A382R mutation would place the Arg side chain into a cluster of basic residues. Again, this suggests that the plastic P domain can thwart antibody binding by shifting the structural equilibrium away from the conformation favored by the neutralizing antibody.
