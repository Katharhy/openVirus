<p>To understand how noroviruses escape antibody neutralization, we determined the cryo-EM structure of MNV complexed with Fab fragments from a neutralizing A6.2 [
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. It was clear that A6.2 bound to the outermost tip of the P2 domain, right where the A’B’ and E’F’ loops lie. To better understand the interaction of mAb A6.2 with the P domain, we determined the crystal structure of the A6.2 Fab to ~2.5 Å [
 <xref rid="B70-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Typically, the third hypervariable loop (CDR3) of the heavy chain makes most of the contact with the epitope. Interestingly, this loop in A6.2 is strongly hydrophobic with the sequence “YFYALDYW”. When the structures of A6.2 and the P domain dimer were placed into the cryo-EM density, it was evident that A6.2 fit better onto the open conformation than the closed, with the hydrophobic CDR3 loop extending into the hydrophobic cleft between the A’B’ and E’F’ loops. Those hydrophobic residues in the P domain are deeply buried under the tips of the A’B’ and E’F’ loops in the closed conformation and not accessible to mAb A6.2. In addition, the CDR3 loop of A6.2 completely overlaps the E’F’ loops when modeled into the closed conformation, making it impossible for A6.2 to bind. Taken together, the modeling strongly suggested that A6.2 prefers the open conformation both in terms of structural and hydrophobic complementarity.
