 <xref rid="B61-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] was that the P domains of NV VLPs rest upon the shell domain, while there is a large gap in the electron density between the shell and protruding domains of MNV-1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00618-f004">Figure 4</xref>). This gives the appearance that the MNV-1 P domains lift off the shell (S domains) to form a second proteinacous layer. As shown in this figure, there is a linker region between the S and P domains that is coiled up in NV and becomes extended in MNV.
