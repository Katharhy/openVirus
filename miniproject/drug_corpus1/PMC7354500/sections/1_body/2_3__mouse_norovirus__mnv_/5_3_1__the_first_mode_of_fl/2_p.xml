<p>Since this unusual “floating P domain” conformation (“extended state”) was so different than the crystal structure of NV (“contracted state”), the structure of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) VLP was also determined [
 <xref rid="B61-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Similar to MNV-1, the P domains are lifted off the surface of the shell and have diffuse density, suggesting a high degree of flexibility. Neither MNV (genotype GV.1) nor RHDV (genotype GIV) infect humans and it is possible that it is a feature not found in the human noroviruses. Therefore, the cryo-EM structure of the human Vietnam026 (GII.10) VLP was determined [
 <xref rid="B62-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The cryo-EM reconstruction of the GII.10 norovirus VLP at ~10 Å resolution showed features very similar to MNV and RHDV. As with MNV and RHDV, the P domain appeared as a second outer shell with the P domain raised off the S domain by ~15 Å. Importantly, these studies also showed that this apparent P domain flexibility may play an important role in antibody binding. Hansman et al. determined the crystal structure of the P domain complexed with the Fab fragment from an antibody (5B18) that broadly recognized different GII viruses [
 <xref rid="B62-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The crystal structure of the P domain/Fab complex showed that the 5B18 Fab bound to a conserved region of the protruding domain. This binding site is involved in interactions with other regions of the capsid and is partially buried in the virus particle in the “compressed” state. Despite the occluded nature of the recognized epitope in the VLP structure, ELISA binding indicated that the 5B18 antibody was able to capture intact VLPs. The base of the P domain is only exposed to the antibody if there is extreme flexibility in the tether region between the shell and the P domain. This result has been further substantiated by more recent results in genotypes GI.1 [
 <xref rid="B63-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] and GII.4 [
 <xref rid="B64-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], where various epitopes are clearly buried in the compressed particle and only exposed if the P domain is allowed to lift off the shell.
