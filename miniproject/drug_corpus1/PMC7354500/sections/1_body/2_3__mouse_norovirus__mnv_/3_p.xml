<p>Caliciviruses are T = 3 icosahedral particles with 180 copies of the major capsid protein (VP1; ~58 kDa), that is divided into the N-terminus (N), the shell (S) and C-terminal protruding (P) domains [

 <xref rid="B56-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The S domain forms a shell around the viral RNA genome, while the P domains dimerize to form protrusions on the capsid surface. The P domain is subdivided into P1 and P2 subdomains, with the latter containing the binding sites for cellular receptors [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00618-f004">Figure 4</xref>, with the three copies of VP1 in the icosahedral asymmetric unit being designated as subunits A (blue), B (green), and C (red). Also noted in this figure is the location of the A’B’ and E’F’ loops in the P2 domain that will be discussed in detail below.
