<p>From these two cases, viruses with simple protein shells are more dynamic and flexible than might be expected. In the case of the rhinoviruses, the capsids appear to be breathing where the capsid may be opening and closing around the 2-fold axes and exposing the myristoylated N-termini of VP4. The receptor, ICAM, may prefer one of the conformations sampled during this breathing process and begin the uncoating process. As suggested by the effects of the WIN compounds and mutagenesis studies, the empty drug-binding pocket minimizes the energy required for these conformational changes. While it is attractive to suggest that antibody binding might similarly drive the capsid towards uncoating, the fact is that the most potent antibodies do not cause conformational changes. Even in the one study reviewed here that suggests such conformational changes might occur, the antibody does not appear to prefer one conformation over the other. In the end, the immune system simply recognizes epitopes presented to it and does not select for antibodies that induce conformational changes. While it is attractive to consider vaccines that recognize viruses in a transition state, trying to force the B cells to recognize a conformation that is not prevalent in solution will likely yield a poor adaptive immune response.</p>
