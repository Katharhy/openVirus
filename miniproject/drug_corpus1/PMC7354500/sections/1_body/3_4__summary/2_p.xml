<p>While the rhinoviruses appear to breathe in preparation for receptor interactions and uncoating, MNV has several modes of flexibility for quite different reasons. MNV has a highly mobile P domain that can move around the capsid surface that likely facilitates binding to the target cell. This flexibility of the P domain might also be involved in avoiding the immune system by presenting antigenic sites exposed in one state but not the other. This gross movement of the P domain is clearly sensitive to environmental conditions and appears to improve virus binding to the receptor. Similarly, there is evidence that the structure of the P domain itself responds to environmental cues. In physiological phosphate-buffered saline, the C’D’, E’F’, and A’B’ loops adopt an “open” conformation that appears to be recognized by antibodies. As the virus enters the gut, solutes such as bile salts move these loops to the “closed” conformation that is no longer recognized by antibodies but is favored by receptors. So, unlike HRV14, the plastic nature of the capsid allows the virus to present one “face” to the immune system and a very different one for cell attachment. Nevertheless, it is clear that neither of these viruses are simply inanimate “tin cans”.</p>
