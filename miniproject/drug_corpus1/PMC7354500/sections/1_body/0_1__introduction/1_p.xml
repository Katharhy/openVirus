<p>Non-enveloped viruses have been thought to have protein shells that simply move the viral genome from cell to cell. The following review will discuss human rhinovirus (HRV) and mouse norovirus (MNV) which intricately respond to environmental cues. With HRV14 (formal designation now HRV B14), the capsids undergo a “breathing” process, where the buried N-termini are transiently extruded [

While such a mobile capsid might be leveraged by antibodies for neutralization, that appears to not be the case. With MNV, the protruding (P) domain is only loosely tethered to the shell. In the presence of gut compounds such as bile salts, the P domain rotates down onto the shell and the conformation of the epitope is drastically changed [
