<p>These results are a clear demonstration of the changes in the HRV capsid upon release of the genome. However, it still is unclear if antibodies induce conformational changes upon binding and if this is a significant part of neutralization. Firstly, it is a bit of a misnomer to suggest that antibodies induce conformational changes per se. Even in this study, the model is suggesting that the higher temperatures are driving the changes in the intersubunit interactions and an antibody might be selecting for the altered conformation. However, even here, there is no obvious structural mechanism for either C5 recognition of the eclipsed particle or antibody induced conformational changes. In addition, if the main mechanism of C5 neutralization is the destabilization of the capsid, then one might expect some of the escape mutants would have stabilizing effects and lie distal to the epitope. Instead, all escape mutants to HRV14 monoclonal antibodies all lie on the capsid surface and are important antibody contact residues. Distal, stabilizing mutations are clearly possible as reviewed above in the case of escape mutations to the antiviral WIN compounds. Interestingly, distal antibody escape mutations are possible in viruses and discussed below in the review of mouse norovirus. Finally, it is unlikely that the common mechanism of antibody neutralization is induction of conformational changes. Indeed, all antibodies to the NIm-IA site in HRV14 have been shown to stabilize the capsid against pH denaturation rather than causing uncoating [
