<p>A more recent study on a NIm-III monoclonal antibody (C5) yielded some interesting results on antibody recognition and capsid breathing [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. C5 binds to the HRV14 NIm-III site that was defined by natural escape mutations in residues 72, 75, and 78 of VP3 [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This antibody was classified as an intermediate neutralizer and a weak aggregator [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. For comparison, mAb17 and mAb12 described above are strong neutralizers that can decrease viral titers by more than five logs. The remaining viral infectivity is likely due to escape mutants rather than residual activity. Neither of these strongly neutralizing antibodies immunoprecipitated the virus under the conditions used for these assays. In contrast, C5 precipitates the virus to some degree and only decreases infectivity by less than three logs [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The weak precipitation suggested that C5 tended to bind bivalently to the capsid surface, but not as efficaciously as mAb12 or mAb14.
