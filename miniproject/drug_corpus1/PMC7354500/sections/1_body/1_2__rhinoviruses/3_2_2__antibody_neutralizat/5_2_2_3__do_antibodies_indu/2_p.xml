<p>Fab fragments of C5 were added to HRV14 at 33 or 4 °C and the structures of the complexes were determined with cryo-EM. In all cases, Fab fragments were observed to bind to the capsid. The major difference was that there were more empty particles at 33 °C in the presence of the Fab than at 4 °C or in the absence of Fab at 33 °C. The treatment at 33 °C resulted in ~30%–60% of the particles releasing their genome, while only a small fraction of the virus was empty when treated at 4 °C. The major changes in the capsid upon release of the genome was expansion of the entire capsid and separation of the capsid at the icosahedral 2-fold axes. Interestingly, this separation of the VP2 α-helices at the icosahedral axes was discussed as a possible location of the N-termini extrusion in the previous mass spectrometry study [
