<p>As previously reviewed [

 <xref rid="B43-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], in any discussion about antibody-mediated neutralization of viruses, the development of the antibody response needs to be considered. The only driving force in B cell expansion is binding affinity of antigen to surface Ig of the B cell. There is no part of this expansion process that selects for neutralization efficacy, only binding. The only way for antibodies to be raised against the eclipsed particles is if there were significant amounts of this form of the virus during the adaptive immune response. Only then would it be possible for the antibodies to selectively bind to the eclipsed form and possibly shift the structural equilibrium. However, as was observed with the antibodies to the N-termini of VP4 described above, forcing an immune response to a form of the virus that is not the predominant species leads to weakly neutralizing antibodies. In this case, C5 is not as efficacious as the NIm-IA antibodies that were shown not to induce conformational changes [

The most likely scenario is that antibody binding to the dominant conformational species drives the selection and production of antibodies. These antibodies can theoretically aggregate, stabilize, or bind to eclipsed particles [

 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], it seems most likely that the in vivo synergism of antibodies with other components of the immune response plays the dominant role in antibody-mediated protection in vivo.
