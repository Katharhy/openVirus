<p>While it was suggested that the antibodies induced viral uncoating, it seems likely that the process is more complicated than that. From the studies reviewed above [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], the HRV capsid breathes at room temperature and this process is accentuated at higher temperatures. The hypothesis in this study was that the higher temperatures push the structural equilibrium of the capsid towards the “breathing” conformation and this structure is recognized by C5. This binding would then further push the structural equilibrium towards uncoating. If this hypothesis is correct, then C5 should prefer binding to the eclipsed particles rather than intact virions. This could be due to structural differences at the epitope between the two different particles or that the eclipsed particles might have more room for antibody binding than the native virions. However, the structures do not show evidence of either. C5 binds to both empty and full particles equally well since the apparent occupancy of C5 bound to both particles are the same when added at the same Fab/virus ratios. In addition, there is plenty of space for complete saturation of C5 on the capsid in both the native and eclipsed conformations. Perhaps more importantly, the structure of the NIm-III epitope region is essentially identical in the native particle and all four Fab/virus complexes presented in this work [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Therefore, C5 does not prefer binding to the eclipsed particle nor does there seem to be any significant structural changes around the epitope upon antibody binding.
