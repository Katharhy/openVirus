<p>The hypothesis that neutralizing antibodies act by inducing conformational changes was directly tested by the determination of several antibody/virus complexes. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against HRV14 are divided into three groups: strong, intermediate and weak [

 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. All strongly neutralizing antibodies bind to the Nim-IA site that is defined by natural escape mutations at residues D91 and E95 of VP1. Since strongly neutralizing antibodies form stable, monomeric antibody/virus complexes with a maximum stoichiometry of 30 antibodies per virion, it was concluded that they bind bivalently to the virions [

 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Weakly neutralizing antibodies form unstable, monomeric complexes with HRV14 and bind with a stoichiometry of ~60 antibodies per virion and strongly precipitate the virions. The remaining antibodies—all of which precipitate the virions—are classified as intermediate neutralizers [
