<p>Antibodies are a major defense against picornavirus infection and several mechanisms of antibody-mediated neutralization have been proposed. Large changes in pI were observed when antibodies bound to virions [

 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This led to a popular hypothesis that antibody-mediated neutralization of picornaviruses is due to the induction of large conformational changes upon antibody binding. This contention was later supported by studies that suggested neutralization occurs with only 1–2 antibodies binding to the virion surface [
