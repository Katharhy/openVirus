<p>The structures of three different Fab/HRV14 (Fab17, Fab12 and Fab1) complexes and of one mAb/HRV14 (mAb17) complex have been determined [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Although all bind to the Nim-IA site, mAb17 and mAb12 are strongly neutralizing antibodies, whereas mAb1 is a weakly neutralizing antibody. The atomic structures of Fab1, Fab17 and HRV14 were used to construct pseudo-atomic models and then probed using site-directed mutagenesis [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In the Fab17/HRV14 complex, the loop of the Nim-IA site on HRV14 is clamped in the cleft between the heavy and light chain hypervariable regions and forms complementary electrostatic interactions with corresponding side chains of Fab17.
