<p>Fab17 and Fab12 both bind to the Nim-IA site at a somewhat tangential orientation that placed the constant domains (C
 <sub>H1</sub>C
 <sub>L</sub>) of 2-fold related Fabs in close proximity that could facilitate bidentate binding across icosahedral 2-fold axes. In contrast, Fab1 binds almost vertically to the virion surface with a “twist” that made it seem unlikely that these antibodies could bind bivalently. These studies, at resolutions of 20–30Å, consistently demonstrated that antibodies do not induce large conformational changes in the virion upon binding. In the case of the mAb17/HRV14 complex, it was thought that bivalent binding itself might induce conformational changes in the capsid. Bivalent binding was subsequently visualized in the structure of the mAb17/HRV14 complex [
