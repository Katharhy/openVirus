<p>From the mass spectrometry results, HRV clearly undergoes a “breathing” process that exposes the N-termini of VP1 and VP4. Unlike the other regions of the capsid, these N-termini are highly conserved and, therefore, could be targets for a universal vaccine for HRV. To this end, monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were raised against 30-residue peptides representing the N-termini of VP4 and VP1 [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Only the antibodies against the VP4 N terminus were found to neutralize viral infectivity in vitro. Because of the high degree of sequence conservation, the antiserum to HRV14 VP4 cross-reacted with serotypes HRV16 and HRV29. Antibody neutralization closely paralleled MALDI analysis of capsid “breathing” in that antibody neutralization and proteolysis were enhanced at 37 °C in the case of HRV16 but elevated temperatures were not required for either trypsin digestion or antibody neutralization with HRV14 and HRV29. Epitope mapping of the N-terminal 30 residues of VP4 suggested that the N-terminus of VP4 likely adopts a non-linear conformation in solution because antibody recognition of the peptides was sensitive to removal of 6–8 amino acids from either end. This was further substantiated by mutagenesis studies of the infectious HRV14 clone where serine at VP4 residue 5 was replaced with a cysteine. Surprisingly, all copies of VP4 of the S5C mutant formed cross-links but did not apparently affect virus viability. This suggests that the oligomer being formed could be a natural part of the breathing and infection process. While these studies suggest that VP4 might be useful as a pan-serotypic rhinovirus vaccine, the neutralization efficacy was far below what is observed with antibodies raised against the outer shell. This could be due to the oligomeric structure of the 30-residue peptide not appropriately mimicking that of the N-terminus being extruded from the capsid. However, it seems more likely that the weak reactivity is a function of epitope availability. The immune response is being forced to recognize an epitope that is only transiently being exposed whereas the NIm sites are always fully exposed in their natural conformation. As with other vaccine targets, there is a tradeoff between epitope conservation and exposure during B cell and antibody recognition.
