<p>Picornaviruses are among the largest of animal virus families and include polio-, rhino-, foot-and-mouth disease, Coxsackie, and hepatitis A viruses. The rhinoviruses—of which, there are more than 100 serotypes—are major causative agents of the common cold in humans [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The virus is non-enveloped and has a ~300Å diameter protein shell that encapsidates a single-stranded, plus-sense, RNA genome of ~7200 bases. The human rhinovirus 14 (HRV14) capsid has pseudo T = 3 (P = 3) icosahedral symmetry and consists of 60 copies each of four viral proteins—VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00618-f001">Figure 1</xref>). VP1–3 each have an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel motif and comprise most of the capsid structure. VP4 is smaller, has an extended structure, and lies at the RNA–capsid interface [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A ~20Å deep canyon lies approximately at the junction of VP1 (forming the “north” rim) with VP2 and VP3 (forming the “south” rim), and surrounds each of the twelve icosahedral 5-fold vertices. The canyon regions of the major receptor group rhinoviruses, were shown to contain the binding site of the cellular receptor, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) [
