<p>It was suggested that certain host cell molecules, “pocket factors,” bind to the WIN drug-binding cavity beneath the canyon floor and provide transient stability to some of the picornaviruses [

There were small islands of electron density in the WIN drug-binding cavity of a number of picornaviruses (but not HRV14) that were called “pocket factors.” It was proposed that host cells produce various pocket factors that stabilize virions in the extracellular milieu and these factors compete with receptor for binding to the virion. To explain how the drugs and receptor could regulate uncoating in the presence of pocket factors, it was proposed that WIN compounds and receptor bind better than the pocket factor. However, the t1/2 of WIN compounds disassociating from HRV14 is on the order of 30–90 min [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and, therefore, it is unclear how these compounds can remain bound to virions during lengthy purification procedures. Most importantly, the structure of the Fab17/HRV14 complex [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] showed clear evidence for a bound pocket factor that was absent in the HRV14 structure alone [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This density must have come from the PEG 400 that was used as a cryo-solvent to freeze the crystals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00618-f003">Figure 3</xref>E). This suggests that the previously observed pocket factors may not have been host derived but rather from small-molecular-weight solutes in crystallization liquors or from additives used in the purification protocol. While these results suggest that the small molecules observed in the HRV crystal structures may not be from the cell, it was still possible that pocket factors exist in vivo.
