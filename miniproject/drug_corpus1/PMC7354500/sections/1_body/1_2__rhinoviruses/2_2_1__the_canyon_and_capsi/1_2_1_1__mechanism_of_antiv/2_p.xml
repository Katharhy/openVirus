<p>Analysis of HRV14 trypsin digestion products using mass spectrometry provided evidence that the drug-binding cavity plays a role in capsid dynamics [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. HRV14 was treated with immobilized trypsin for varying periods of times and the resulting fragments were analyzed to determine the sites of proteolytic cleavage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00618-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Unexpectedly, the sites most sensitive to trypsin cleavage are at the N-termini of VP1 and VP4 that are buried at the RNA–capsid interface. Within five minutes, there was cleavage at residues 13, 31, and 94 in VP1 and residues 9, 31, 33, 51, 62, and 94 in VP4. Since the virus concentration was in extreme excess, these represent single hit kinetics and are, therefore, independent and non-sequential events. This suggested that, even at room temperature, there is transient extrusion of these buried termini, or “breathing”.
