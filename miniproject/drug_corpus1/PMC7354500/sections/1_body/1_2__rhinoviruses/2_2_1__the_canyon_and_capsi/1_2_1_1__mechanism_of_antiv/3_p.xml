<p>It is possible that the digestion seen in these experiments was due to a mixture of intact and damaged HRV14 particles. To control for this, WIN compounds were added to the digestion mix since they were known to stabilize the HRV capsid. WIN compounds completely blocked cleavage at all sites but the drug did not affect the intrinsic activity of trypsin itself (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00618-f002">Figure 2</xref>). This stabilization is rather extreme in that HRV14 alone is cleaved by trypsin within five minutes, whereas the presence of WIN compounds delays cleavage for more than 18 h. Interestingly, not only did the WIN compounds block cleavage of the buried N-termini but also at the exposed NIm-IA site (residue 94 of VP1) that is more than 30Ã… away from the pocket. This suggests that there is a great deal of motion throughout the HRV capsid and that, when these antiviral compounds bind to the base of the canyon, infectivity is blocked by abrogating this flexibility.
