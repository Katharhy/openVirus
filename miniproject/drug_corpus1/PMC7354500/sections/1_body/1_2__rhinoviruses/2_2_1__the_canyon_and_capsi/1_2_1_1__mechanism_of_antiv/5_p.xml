<p>WIN compounds have also been shown to affect the receptor-virus interactions of the major but not the minor serotypes of HRV [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. On this basis, it was hypothesized that the small conformational changes in the canyon floor induced by drug binding were responsible for abrogation of cell attachment [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This hypothesis was attractive because of its conceptual simplicity. However, the minor group of HRV serotypes, that are also affected by the WIN drugs, utilize the LDL receptor [

 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] that binds to the top of the canyon [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It seems more likely that the mode of action of the compounds is stabilization of the capsid of all target viruses. The effects of the WIN drugs on ICAM binding is most likely unrelated to the minor conformational changes associated with drug binding. It is known that ICAM binding to the major HRV serotype group induces uncoating [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It is likely that, as ICAM interacts with the canyon region, large conformational changes occur to optimize receptor binding and this leads to uncoating. The binding of the WIN compounds stabilizes the capsid that likely not only prevents uncoating but also the receptor/HRV binding cooperativity.
