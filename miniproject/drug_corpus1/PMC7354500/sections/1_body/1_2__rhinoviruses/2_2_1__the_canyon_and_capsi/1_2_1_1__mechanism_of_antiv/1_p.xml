<p>A hydrophobic cavity lies directly beneath the canyon floor into which some non-polar antiviral compounds (WIN) bind [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Upon binding, these compounds greatly stabilize the capsid against thermal and pH denaturation [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] while causing only small changes in the canyon floor upon binding [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These hydrophobic compounds create an opening to the binding pocket by displacing M221 of VP1 [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Since the drug-induced conformational changes are limited to residues immediately surrounding the drug, it is likely that the major effect of the drug is stabilization of the capsid due to global Gibbs free energy effects of these compounds binding in a hydrophobic pocket rather than inducing gross changes in the capsid.
