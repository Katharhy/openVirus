<p>Further evidence of the stabilizing effects of the WIN compounds on HRV14 came from experiments where the virus was subjected to high hydrostatic pressure, low temperature, and urea in the absence and presence of an antiviral drug [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Capsid dissociation and changes in the protein conformation were monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy, light scattering, circular dichroism, gel filtration chromatography, mass spectrometry and infectivity assays. The data show that high pressure induces the dissociation of HRV14 and that this process is inhibited by WIN 52084. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry experiments demonstrate that VP4, the most internal viral protein, is released from the capsid by pressure treatment. This release of VP4 is concomitant with loss of infectivity. These results are consistent with the model, whereby WIN drugs block capsid dynamics necessary for cell attachment.
