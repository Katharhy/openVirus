<p>This simplified model is supported by studies demonstrating that drug-resistant mutations can arise distal to the drug-binding region. While some of the mutations that confer resistance in HRV14 make direct contact with the bound drug, many of the other residues point away from the bound WIN compounds and most lie on strands that remain relatively unchanged by drug binding. Therefore, these latter mutations may facilitate the canyon-associated conformational changes in the presence of drug rather than simply affecting receptor or drug binding.</p>
