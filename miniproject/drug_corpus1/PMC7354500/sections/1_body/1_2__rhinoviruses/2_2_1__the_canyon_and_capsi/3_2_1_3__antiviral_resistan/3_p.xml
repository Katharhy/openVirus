<p>HRV16 is a better example of distal, drug-resistant mutations. Resistant mutations V1210A, M1103T, and T1208A lie midway up the south canyon wall. These mutations destabilize virions, and hence, virions can only assemble in the presence of drug. This is an important finding in that it demonstrates that crucial residues are not only confined to the very bottom of the canyon and that the canyon region is very sensitive to mutations. Similarly, drug-resistant mutations are found in three regions of poliovirus: the drug-binding pocket itself, the north wall of the canyon (~17 Å away from the bound drug), and at the viral capsid inner surface. A number of these latter mutations are clustered around the VP4–capsid interface. Again, these results suggest that the neutralizing effects of the drug are not immediately localized to the bottom of the canyon.</p>
