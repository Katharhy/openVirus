<p>To test whether putative “pocket factors” might play a role in the viral life cycle, HRV14 was mutated in (V1188M, C1199W, and V1188M/C1199W) and around (S1223G) the drug-binding pocket [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Infectivity, limited proteolysis, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization analyses indicate that filling the drug-binding pocket with bulky side chains is not deleterious to viral replication but does stabilize the capsid. In contrast, studies with the S1223G mutant suggest that this mutation at least partially overcomes WIN drug-mediated inhibition of cell attachment and capsid breathing by lending some flexibility to the region. Finally, HRV16, which is inherently more stable than HRV14, was found to “breathe” only at 37 °C and did not tolerate stabilizing mutations in the drug-binding cavity. These results suggest that it is the drug-binding cavity itself and not the putative pocket factor(s) that is crucial for the capsid dynamics, which is, in turn, necessary for infection.
