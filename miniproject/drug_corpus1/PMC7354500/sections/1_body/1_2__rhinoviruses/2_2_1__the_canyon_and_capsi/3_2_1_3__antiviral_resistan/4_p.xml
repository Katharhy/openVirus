<p>We proposed that the drug-binding cavity evolved to maintain flexibility of this region [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Empty cavities keep proteins at a higher energy state, where it will take less energy to cause structural changes. If the cavity itself plays a role in the viral life cycle, then it would explain why other picornaviruses (e.g., FMDV and mengovirus) have highly homologous structures in this region but do not have bound “pocket factors”. We proposed that the virus is binding to receptors in a two-step process [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The first step is a weak association with the south wall of the canyon. Subsequently, and in a temperature-dependent manner, conformational processes occur that increase the affinity of the virus for the receptor [

 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Capsid “breathing” [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] is likely an integral part of this receptor/capsid cooperativity that initiates the major conformational changes leading to the exposure of the myristylated N-termini so they can find their membrane target. As was noted previously [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], the locations of the digested termini are closer to the icosahedral 3-fold and 2-fold axes than the 5-fold axes. This has been supported by recent evidence that at higher temperatures, gaps are formed at the 2-fold icosahedral axes [
