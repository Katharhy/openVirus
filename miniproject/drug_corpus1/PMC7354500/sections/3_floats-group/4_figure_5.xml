  <p>Structural changes in the MNV capsid upon the addition of the bile salt, GCDCA. (
   <bold>A</bold>) The 8Å structure of apo MNV and (
   <bold>B</bold>) the 3Å structure of MNV in the presence of GCDCA and low pass filtered to 8Å for comparison with the apo structure. A and B are colored from blue to red according to radius. (
   <bold>C</bold>) The pseudo-atomic model of the apo structure of MNV using the 8Å and 3Å cryo-EM electron density maps. (
   <bold>D</bold>) When GCDCA is added, the P domains rotate by ~90° and rest on top of the shell.
