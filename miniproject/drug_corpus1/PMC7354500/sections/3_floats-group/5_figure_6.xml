  <p>The structure of MNV complexed with the receptor, CD300lf. In panels A–C, the virus is grey and the receptor mauve. (
   <bold>A</bold>) The model for the expanded form of MNV with the CD300lf place using the atomic structure of the P domain/CD300lf complex [
   <xref rid="B66-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. An icosahedral 5-fold axis is represented by an orange pentagon and the C-termini of some of the CD300lf molecules are highlighted with green circles. (
   <bold>B</bold>) An atomic model of the MNV/GCDCA/CD300lf complex using the atomic model of the Pdomain/CD300lf and the EM structure of the MNV/GCDCA complex. (
   <bold>C</bold>) The 9Å cryo-EM structure of the MNV/GCDCA/CD300lf complex [
   <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00618" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. (
   <bold>D</bold>) The model from panel B overlaid with the cryo-EM density of the MNV/GCDCA/CD300lf shown in panel C. An icosahedral 3-fold axis that is denoted by the orange triangle. The orange ellipse notes the CD300lf bound to the A subunit with weaker density likely due to lower occupancy.
