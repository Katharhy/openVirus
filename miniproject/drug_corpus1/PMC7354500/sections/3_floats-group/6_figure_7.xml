  <p>Structure of the Fab 2D3.7/MNV complex and possible effects of bile salts on antibody binding. (
   <bold>A</bold>) ~9.0Å cryo-EM density of the FabD/MNV complex viewed down an icosahedral 5-fold axis. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Central section of the FabD/MNV electron density map. The approximate colors of the shell, P1, and P2 domains are blue, green, and yellow, respectively. The FabD variable domains are orange and the constant domains, red. (
   <bold>B</bold>) FabD modeled into the cryo-EM density using the “open” conformation of the P domain. The location of the “allosteric-like” escape to this antibody (V339I) is shown in black. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Stereo diagram of the FabD bound to the “open” conformation. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Stereo diagram of the hypothetical model of FabD bound to the “closed” conformation induced by the binding of bile salts to illustrate the antibody/P domain clashes in this conformation.
