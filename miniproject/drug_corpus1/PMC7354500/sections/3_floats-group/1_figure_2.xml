  <p>Use of mass spectrometry to demonstrate HRV14 breathing. (
   <bold>A</bold>) MALDI analysis of limited trypsinolysis of HRV14 in the presence and absence of WIN compounds. While HRV14 is extremely sensitive to trypsin cleavage at room temperature, the presence of WIN compounds blocks all cleavage for &gt;18 h. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Ribbon diagram of an icosahedra asymmetric unit with VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4 colored blue, green, red, and mauve, respectively. The locations of trypsin cleavage that occur within the first five minutes of exposure to trypsin are noted by spherical models. Note that there are cleavage sites at the extreme N-termini of both VP1 and VP4 not visible in the crystal structure.
