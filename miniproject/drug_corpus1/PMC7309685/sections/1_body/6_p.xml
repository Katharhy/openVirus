<p id="Par9">Inspired by the teaching of Nicolle, the French biologist and physician Hervé Harant also promoted the science of “medical ecology” in the Montpellier area in the mid-twentieth century. However, instead of drawing a sharp boundary between medical geography and disease ecology he insisted on their being continuous with one another. Drawing on the writings of geographer Maximilien Sorre and the concept of a “pathogen complex”, Harant relied on the then emerging ecological terminology, but this understanding of ecology had more to do with the natural history tradition than with population studies as such. Furthermore, neither May nor Harant referred to what Burnet called the “ecological point of view” or cited the writings of their fellow Frenchman, the Rockefeller microbiologist René Dubos. This despite the fact that by the 1960s Dubos was fast developing a reputation as an apostle of the burgeoning environmental movement and was increasingly employing horticultural metaphors to express his unease with short-term medical fixes, such as antibiotics, and to distance himself from eradicationist perspectives. Indeed, though towards the end of his career Dubos acknowledged that he had had few occasions to use the word ecology before the 1960s, he claimed that ever since 1924, when he had embarked on a career as an experimental biologist, he had “looked at things from an ecological point of view” (Honigsbaum
