<p id="Par12">Another example of the operation of transnational scientific networks in fostering ecological ideas was the pioneering plague research conducted by the Russian zoologist Evgeny Pavlovsky and his Soviet colleagues in the 1920s. Best known for his concept of “natural nidality”—a term derived from the Russian word “ochag”, meaning “hearth” or “home”—Pavolvsky appears to have had a much wider influence that was previously supposed, and not just on thinkers sequestered behind the Iron Curtain. On the contrary, Susan Jones and Anna Amramina maintain that there was “a surprisingly vigorous knowledge exchange with Western ecologists and biomedical scientists even under the most difficult conditions” (Jones and Amramina

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2019a</xref>, this issue). The two men exchanged a number of letters over the years, together with books and laboratory materials, and shared their ideas about the nature of infectious processes. While medical geography relied on the two-dimensional mapping of disease ranges onto places, the Soviet “natural focus” framework located disease explicitly in what Jones and Amrarmina describe as “spaces of interaction between components of non-human assemblages in nature.” It was an order of analysis in which humans were de-centred and secondary. Instead, Pavlovksy and his colleagues focused on the mutual influences between the key constituents of plague systems—rodents, microorganisms, fleas—and factors such as landscape, climate, and human cultures. In so doing, Soviet ecologists were able to actively incorporate ideological concepts into their plague studies, particularly in the Soviet borderlands where ecology provided a philosophical and material framework for furthering ideological goals of “sanitizing” colonial landscapes. In this way, Jones and Amramina argue, the natural focus framework was “entangled in political as well as material ecologies of knowledge and practice.” Indeed, to the extent that the framework “provided scientific validation and guidance for Stalinist-era colonization and development projects,” this was a key basis of its success.
