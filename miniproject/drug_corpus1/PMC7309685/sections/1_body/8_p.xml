<p id="Par11">A good example comes from the two papers with which we open the collection. At first glance, René Dubos’s investigations of the tubercle bacillus at the Rockefeller Institute in New York in the 1940s would seem to have little do with Frank Fenner’s classic study of myxomatosis in Australia in the 1950s, but, as Honigsbaum and Anderson show, both researchers were fascinated with the phenomenon of virulence and the environmental and ecological conditions governing host resistance to infection and disease. Moreover, in 1948, Fenner, at Burnet’s suggestion, had spent 11 months at Dubos’s laboratory at the Rockefeller Institute. There, he had assisted Dubos in his investigations of the chemical and morphological properties of the tubercle bacillus and the role of metabolic processes in converting latent tubercular infections into full-blown cases of the disease. The result was that by the time Fenner returned to Australia in 1950 and renewed his association with Burnet he was primed to apply these holistic perspectives derived from the laboratory study of mycobacteria—what might be termed physiological ecology—to host–parasite interactions in the field. His opportunity came in 1951 when he was invited to lead an “ecological study of mosquitoes” with a view to explicating their role in the transmission of the myxoma virus, which had been introduced to Australia a few years earlier in an effort to curb rabbit populations. Fenner’s study, which drew on what Anderson calls “local ecologies of knowledge,” in particular scientific networks operating through Australia’s Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, was the first to trace the coevolution of host resistance and parasite virulence in a natural setting in real-time. In the process, Fenner showed how natural selection served to regulate the virulence of the myxoma virus and stabilize host–parasite interactions in the wild. Little wonder that Dubos, who followed the progress of Fenner’s study closely, hailed it as an example of “host–parasite ecology” and that Fenner later described Dubos and Burnet as his two most important intellectual influences (Honigsbaum

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">b</xref>, this issue, p. 14). Perhaps more significantly from the point of view of the trajectory of ecological ideas in the post-war period, Anderson shows how Fenner’s study “offered techniques that could be applied equally well to biological warfare among humans,” thereby underlining the “congruence of the ecological mindset with prevailing cold-war thought styles” (Anderson
