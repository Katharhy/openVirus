<p id="Par14">A key implication of our study is that there was nothing inevitable about the adoption of ecological perspectives by medical researchers in the interwar period and the integration of these ideas into laboratory research and public health in the decades after the Second World War. Rather, such ideas often ran counter to the dominant bacteriological paradigm and institutional and commercial research agendas, including Cold War biological warfare research, aimed at the manufacture of vaccines and chemotherapies. Indeed, as Dubos’ early warnings about the dangers of antibacterial resistance illustrate, it took many years for these insights to find their way into medical schools and to be taken up by medical authorities. Furthermore, while for some medical thinkers a focus on the ecological, environmental and social factors governing host–pathogen interactions and the evolution or resistance fostered scepticism about short-term technological ‘fixes’ for medical problems, for others these ecological insights were seen as an adjunct to disease control and systems designed to enhance pandemic prevention. In this respect, the study has important implications for current policy debates around polio eradication and the monitoring of pathogens, such as influenza, that have long been considered pandemic threats, as well as other putative pandemic threats listed by the World Health Organization in its 2018 Research and Development blueprint.
