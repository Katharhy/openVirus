<p id="Par17">To conclude, Mendelsohn’s claim that modern ideas of disease ecology were already present in bacteriological epidemiology at the inception of medical microbiology is only true if one adopts a narrow and self-limiting definition of disease ecology. Instead, we argue that the modern notion of disease ecology rests on the notion that microbial pathogens reside in ecological niches in equilibrium states and that it is the disturbance of these harmonious natural environments that trigger epidemics and pandemics. It is only by broadening our understanding of the historical origins of Mendelsohn’s “modern, ecological understanding of epidemic disease” and the medical researchers and scientific networks responsible for the integration of such perspectives into medical microbiology and public health, that historians will arrive at a more definitive account of the intellectual origins of these ideas. This is not merely an intellectual exercise. As the debate over the role of ecological causation in SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates, the history of modern ideas of disease ecology can not only help us make sense of the past, it can also illuminate current scientific debates around emerging infectious diseases, and the interaction between biological, economic, and cultural factors in current pandemic emergencies, as well as others that may be lurking beyond the horizon.</p>
