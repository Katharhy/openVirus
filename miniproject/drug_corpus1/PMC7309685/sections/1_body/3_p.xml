<p id="Par5">Thus, a global picture of this multi-site tradition, of its actors and their personal and professional relations, and of its particular place within twentieth-century biomedical science is still wanting. If disease ecology emerged in the 1930s and formed a specific “analytic framework for understanding the interactions of microorganisms and macrobial hosts” (Anderson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2016</xref>, p. 242), it still remains to be characterized with respect to other trends in the biomedical sciences in the past century, including the rise of experimentalism and the earlier development of medical geography, as well as the intellectual exchanges that helped shape the field of disease ecology. For instance, what role did transnational scientific networks play in the propagation and circulation of ecological ideas, and how and to what extent did microbiologists forge alliances with researchers in allied fields? Reconstructing these “ecologies of knowledge,” to invoke Charles Rosenberg’s useful phrase, and the borders between them, is no easy task. As Anderson points out, since historians of science and medicine took up Mendelsohn’s question in earnest they have described multiple influences on the field’s formation and composition. These include not only parasitology and animal ecology, but veterinary pathology, medical geography, and institutions concerned with the control of agricultural pests. In the process, medical researchers came to adopt a very different language to that employed by microbe hunters, one that eschewed the old bacteriological metaphors of a “war” or “struggle” with microbes in favour of a more dynamic, interactive, and cooperative vision of health (see Lederberg 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2000</xref>). Whether or not it was couched in explicitly ecological language, it was a vision that tended to see disease as the result of temporary imbalances or disturbances of biological relationships, rather than as something that could or ought to be conquered or eradicated. And it was a vision that was explicitly sympathetic to Darwinian perspectives and that was prepared to embrace long evolutionary time frames. In so doing, it could not help but provoke deep philosophical questions about what the French bacteriologist Charles Nicolle (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1930</xref>) termed the “birth, life and death of infectious diseases” and the waxing and waning of epidemics in different historical epochs (see Méthot 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2019a</xref>, this issue), and what the Rockefeller researcher René Dubos called the “symbiosis between humankind and earth” (see Honigsbaum 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2017a</xref>,
