<p id="Par10">Dubos’s assertion points to a fundamental definitional and methodological problem: namely, what exactly does it mean to have an “ecological point of view” and is such a viewpoint contiguous with both “disease ecology” and “medical ecology?” Furthermore, if, as May and Harant appear to have believed, disease ecology is closely related to medical geography, what distinguishes one from the other and does it matter if the person invoking ecological perspectives considers themselves primarily a medical researcher or a geographer of disease? And more importantly: what

As the papers collected in this thematic issue make clear, scientists—when they did provide a definition—adapted the term ecology to fit their own particular projects. Indeed, although each of these ecologically-oriented medical researchers tended to represent themselves as singular, and, as Anderson has observed, “as the sole author of the idea, and rarely cited others, even those linked to him by education or friendship” (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2004</xref>, p. 41), none of them worked in a vacuum but were connected by networks of scientific exchange and shared intellectual passions.
