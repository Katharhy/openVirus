<p>There are 11 NA subtypes of IAV, of which N10 and N11 were recently identified in bat IAV genomes (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Tong et al., 2012</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The N1–N9 subtypes can be phylogenetically divided into two groups. Group I includes N1, N4, N5, and N8, while group II is comprised of N2, N3, N6, N7, and N9 (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Russell et al., 2006</xref>). Crystallographic studies show that group 1 NAs (except NA of A/H1N1pdm[09]) possess a large cavity termed 150-cavity adjacent to the catalytic site, but the 150-cavity was not observed in group 2 NAs (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Air, 2012</xref>). Upon binding of oseltamivir or zanamivir, the open 150-loop of group 1 NAs would adopt a closed conformation (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Russell et al., 2006</xref>). Besides, inhibitors targeting the 150-cavity may also effectively target group 2 influenza NAs, perhaps by inducing the rigid closed 150-loop of group-2 NAs into a half-open one (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). The structure of A/H1N1pdm(09) NA presents a deficient 150-cavity in its crystal structure, conferring resistance to oseltamivir (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, another auxiliary binding site adjacent to the sialic acid binding site called “430-cavity” has also been implicated and exploited for the design of new antivirals (
