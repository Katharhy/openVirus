 <sc>D</sc>-glucopyranoside) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>) share the same molecular backbone of a β-
 <sc>D</sc>-glucose residue linked to a chebuloyl moiety. The difference is that CHLI has three free galloyl groups attached to the β-
 <sc>D</sc>-glucose residue, while CHLA contains only one galloyl group and a hexahydrodiphenoyl (HHDP) group, which is assumed to be a substitution for the two galloyl groups (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Olennikov et al., 2015</xref>). The presence of the constrained HHDP group in CHLA is considered to result in larger spatial hindrance and less molecular flexibility. Thus, CHLI shows more broad-spectrum and potent biological activities due to the more favorable structure for entering the binding cavities or catalytic pockets of target proteases or enzymes. However, in our screening of anti-influenza activity described above, both of them showed excellent biological activity. The IC
 <sub>90</sub> of CHLI is even better. It can be inferred that the active site is related to its common CHEB structure. Although the mechanism of action of CHLA and CHLI on NA is not clear yet, we predict that they bind to the active site(s) of NA, either one single interaction with the 430-cavity or multiple interactions to both 150- and 430-cavities.
