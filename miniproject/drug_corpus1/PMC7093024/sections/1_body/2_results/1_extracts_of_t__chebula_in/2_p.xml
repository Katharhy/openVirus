<p>Among the most potent anti-IAV natural product samples, both unripe and ripe pods of 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> significantly inhibited IAV replication with IC
 <sub>50</sub>s of 5.8 ± 1.4 and 7.0 ± 1.0 μg/mL, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A,B</xref>). Since unripe pods of 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> exhibited a CC
 <sub>50</sub> to MDCK cells of 255.1 ± 1.3 μg/mL, while ripe pods of 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> showed no obvious cytotoxicity at a high concentration as 500 μg/mL, it is likely that there is some difference between the compositions of the two natural product sample preparations.
