<p>To compare the antiviral potency of CHLA and CHLI with the marketed NA inhibitor oseltamivir carboxylate, a yield reduction assay was performed with six influenza virus strains, including A/H1N1/PR8, A/H3N2/NY, A/H3N2/Brisbane, B-Yamagate, B-Victoria, and an oseltamivir-resistant A/H1N1pdm(09), which contains the NA/H274Y substitution. As a result, CHLA and CHLI showed significant inhibition against all influenza virus strains (

 <sub>90</sub>s of CHLA (1.26 μM) and CHLI (1.58 μM) upon A/H1N1/PR8 were lower than that of oseltamivir carboxylate (3.92 μM), suggesting their comparable activities (
