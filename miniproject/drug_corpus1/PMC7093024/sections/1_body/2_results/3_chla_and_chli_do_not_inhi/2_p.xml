<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, neither CHLA nor CHLI reduced Gluc expression. Note that the slight decrease in Gluc levels at 100 Î¼M of CHLA and CHLI might be due to cytotoxicity (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). These results suggest that CHLA and CHLI do not interfere with IAV entry or RNA replication.
