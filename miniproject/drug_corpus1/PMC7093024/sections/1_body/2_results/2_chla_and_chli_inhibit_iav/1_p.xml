<p>Considering the close relation between unripe and ripe pods of 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic>, the chemical compositions of the two samples were compared based on spectroscopic data with previously reported literature. Fifteen overlapped constituents were subsequently shortlisted and subjected to antiviral evaluation. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, at a concentration of 12.5 Î¼M, corilagin and ellagic acid showed about 40% inhibition, while CHLA, CHLI, and 1,2,3,4,6-pentagalloyllucose (PGG) showed &gt; 90% inhibition. Since corilagin, ellagic acid, and PGG have been well characterized for their antiviral activity against IAV (
