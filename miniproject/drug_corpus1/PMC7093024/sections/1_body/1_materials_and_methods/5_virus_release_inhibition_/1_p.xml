<p>To determine whether the hit natural product samples or the derivatives target to the release of progeny viruses, MDCK cells were infected with the reporter virus PR8-PB2-Gluc at an MOI of 0.1. At 20 h post-infection (p.i.), the culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed with PBS three times. Fresh Opti-MEM containing 2 μg/mL of TPCK–trypsin was added and cultured for 2 h in the presence of various concentrations of test samples/compounds. The culture medium was harvested and titrated using luciferase assay.</p>
