  <p>CHLA and CHLI block neuraminidase (NA)-mediated virus release. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Virus release inhibition assay. MDCK cells were infected with reporter influenza PR8-PB2-Gluc virus at an MOI of 0.1. At 20 h p.i., infected cells were washed three times, and fresh Opti-MEM containing 2 μg/mL of 
   <italic>N</italic>-tosyl-
   <sc>L</sc>-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)–trypsin was added for another 2-h incubation, in the absence or presence of indicated compounds. The supernatants were harvested, and progeny viruses were titrated by luciferase assay. Data are means ± SD from three independent experiments. **

   <bold>(B)</bold> NA inhibition assay. The NA was incubated with fluorimetric substrates in the absence or presence of indicated compounds. The intensity of fluorescence was detected to reflect NA activities. Data are means ± SD from three independent experiments. *
