<p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) belongs to the family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>, subfamily 
 <italic>Coronavirinae,</italic> and the order Nidovirales. They are classified into four genera such as 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus,</italic> both of which infect mammals, whereas 
 <italic>Gammacoronavirus</italic> infect avian species, and 
 <italic>Deltacoronavirus</italic> infect both mammalian and avian species. It is a large enveloped virus with a positive sense, single-stranded RNA genome of about 26 to 33 kb that is distributed broadly among birds, humans, and other mammals such as camels, bats, mice, dogs, and cats [
 <xref rid="B5-pathogens-09-00148" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The genome is surrounded by a helical capsid and an envelope; the spike protein forms large protrusions in the envelope in the shape of a crown, which gives the virus a coronal appearance. The word ‘
 <italic>corona</italic>’ in Latin means crown [
