  <p>Increment of SARS-CoV-2 mutation frequency after RdRp mutation appearance per geographic area. The increment of mutation frequency before and after February 9th, 2020 across the different geographic areas (Asia, Europe, North America) is shown. The figure shows a diminishment of Asian mutations (i.e. 1397, 8782, 11083, 26143 and 28144) that is simultaneous with the appearance of new mutations such as 2891, 3036, 23403 and 28881, when RdRp novel European mutation located at 14408 (in red) occurred. The upper table shows the increment or decrement for each single mutation, per geographic area</p>
