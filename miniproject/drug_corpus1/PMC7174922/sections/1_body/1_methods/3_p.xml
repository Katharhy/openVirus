<p id="Par23">The statistical analysis was performed by R software. We first checked the normality of data distribution with the Shapiro–Wilk test, expressing the continuous variables as median and range (min–max). Categorical variables were expressed as absolute frequency and percentages. Nonparametric Mann–Whitney and Fisher-Exact tests were used to compare the number of mutations per genome with at least one of the selected mutations with respect to the group of genomes that do not present the specific mutation analyzed. All p-values were calculated from 2-sided tests using 0.05 as the significance level.</p>
