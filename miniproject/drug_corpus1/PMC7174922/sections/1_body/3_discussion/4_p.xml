<p id="Par47">Some polymerase inhibitors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] are currently being tested in clinical studies to target SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, including Favipiravir [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], Galidesivir [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], Remdesivir [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], Ribavirin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], Penciclovir [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], Galidesivir [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and Ponatinib [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Additionally, other drugs such as Simeprevir (FDA approved HCV protease inhibitor), as well as Filibuvir and Tegobuvir (both RdRp inhibitors) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], are predicted to bind RdRp by molecular docking studies. In particular, a putative docking site was identified in a hydrophobic cleft very close to the mutated site 323 (P to L), corresponding to mutation 14408 identified in our study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Naturally occurring mutations in RdRp can potentially lead to drug-resistance phenomena, as already observed previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Alternatively, it might induce a significant decrease in drug-RdRp complex binding affinity. This could lead to different effectiveness of antiviral treatments where mutation 14408 is present. For this reason, due to the high frequency of RdRp mutation in the infected population, it is important to characterize the impact of 14408 mutation on the activity of RdRp and its susceptibility to antiviral drugs.
