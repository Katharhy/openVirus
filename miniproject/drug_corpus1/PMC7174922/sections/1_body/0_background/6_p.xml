<p id="Par18">The SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (also named nsp12) is a key component of the replication/transcription machinery. SARS-CoV-2 shares a high homology for nsp12 compared to SARS-CoV, suggesting that its function and mechanism of action might be well conserved [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This has been confirmed by a recent cryo-EM structural study obtained for SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In SARS-CoV, an exonuclease activity with proofreading function has been reported for the nsp14 (ExoN), and a homologue nsp14 protein is found in the SARS-CoV-2 as well [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. ExoN increases the fidelity of RNA synthesis by correcting nucleotide incorporation errors made by RdRp [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Genetic inactivation of the coronavirus ExoN results in a 21-fold decrease in replication fidelity compared to wild type SARS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Moreover, Kirchdoerfer and colleagues showed the involvement of nsp7 and nsp8 in the formation of a supercomplex with RdRp in SARS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and this has been confirmed also for SARS-CoV-2 in a recent study unveiling the structure of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp/nsp7/nsp8 complex [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This complex ensures RdRp processivity, becoming fundamental in the transcription fidelity. Nevertheless, the critical SARS-CoV RdRp residues involved in ExoN, nsp7 and nsp8 interaction have still to be identified.
