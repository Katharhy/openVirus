<p id="Par14">Noteworthy, some evidence has been recently provided, supporting that SARS-CoV-2 mortality can significantly differ depending on the geographic area. For example, Baud and colleagues reported that mortality rate is three times higher out of China (15.2% [95% CI 12.5–17.9] out of China, compared to 5.6% [95% CI 5.4–5.8] in China) [

Differences in viral infection rates can be due to a combination of factors, including different national strategies adopted for people movement restrictions, isolation and quarantine, different genetic population herd immunity. Mortality differences are to understand, but viral mutations and evolution capability over time may be important.
