<p id="Par30">In order to determine the appearance of each mutation, we analyzed each genome from each geographic area over time, by classifying them according to the timing of sample collection, as indicated in the GISAID database. According to this analysis, 6 time subgroups were defined, namely December 2019 (genomes from 5 patients), 1st–15th Jan. 2020 (genomes from 15 patients), 16th–31st Jan. 2020 (genomes from 52 patients), 1st–15th Feb. 2020 (genomes from 13 patients), 16th–29th Feb 2020 (genomes from 55 patients) and 1st–13th Mar 2020 (genomes from 80 patients).</p>
