<p id="Par31">The number of mutations (normalized by the population taken into account for each period of time) increases over time during viral spread out of Asia (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). No mutations were observed in the Asian genomes analyzed in December 2019. Interestingly, a different pattern of mutations was observed in Europe between January and February, when a new mutation, at position 14408, emerged (depicted in red). This mutation is located in the RdRp gene. Also starting from February 2020, the emergence of additional new mutations (i.e. 23403, 28881 and 2891–black, electric blue, dark green, respectively) is observed. Over time, we also noted an increase in the frequency of mutation 3036 (orange), already present in mid-January (2.2%).
