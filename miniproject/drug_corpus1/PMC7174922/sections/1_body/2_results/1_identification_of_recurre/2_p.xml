<p id="Par25">We divided our dataset into 4 geographic areas: Asia, Oceania, Europe, North America (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Within each area we performed alignment analysis comparing patients’ genomes with the reference sequence. The Asian group comprises genomes obtained from patients located in China, Japan, South-East-Asia and India. The Oceanian group comprises genomes from Australian patients, whereas the European one includes every genome obtained from patients located in each one of the European states (Spain, Portugal, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, France, Luxemburg, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Belgium). Finally, the North America group contains genomes from US and Canadian patients.
