<p id="Par24">A database of 220 complete SARS-CoV-2 patient-isolated genome sequences randomly collected from the GISAID database were aligned and compared to the WSM SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. In particular, 5 patient-isolated genomes were submitted to the GISAID database in December 2019 (2.3%), 67 in January 2020 (30.45%), 67 in February 2020 (30.45%) and 81 (36.8%) up to the 13th of March 2020. About 33.6% of complete genomes belong to patients aged less than 44Â years old, which is the average age of the patients included in the database. The majority of patients are men (55.5%).</p>
