<p id="Par40">We also analyzed the most frequent mutations detected: the ones in positions 3036, 23403 and 28881 (in Europe), and the ones in positions 17746, 17857 and 18060 (in North America). Viral genomes carrying each one of these mutations were compared with viral genomes without mutations, by using Mann–Whitney test for paired-groups comparison analysis. Genomes carrying mutations in positions 3036, 23403, 28881, 17746, 17857 and 18060 show a median of 3–4 mutations (range [2:5]), whereas genomes carrying none of them have a median of 1 or 2 mutations (range [0:3], p-value &lt; 0.001, Mann–Whitney test). This difference is statistically significant and implies that if one of those mutations is present, other mutations are more likely to occur.</p>
