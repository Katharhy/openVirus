<p id="Par39">We found that viral strains with RdRp mutation have a median of 3 point mutations [range: 2–5], whereas viral strains with no RdRp mutation have a median of 1 mutation [range: 0–3] (p value &lt; 0.001, Mann–Whitney test). The different distribution between the two groups relative to the number of mutations is statistically significant (Fig.
