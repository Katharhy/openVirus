<p id="Par34">Given the importance of RdRp for viability and replication of RNA viruses, mutations in this gene are statistically less likely to occur. However, in some cases, such as in poliovirus, episodes of drug-resistance induced by a point mutation in RdRp have been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In our database, the first appearance of a silent RdRp mutation (nt 14804) is manifested on February 9th, 2020 in UK (England), while a different RdRp mutation (nt 14408, amino acid P to L) is observed for the first time in Italy (Lombardy) on February 20th, 2020, when a dramatic increase of the number of European infected patients was reported from the WHO website [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. We evaluated the increase/decrease of each mutation frequency before and after February 9th, 2020 across the different geographic areas (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In particular, we observed a strong increase (+60.5%) of genomes carrying the 14408 mutation (affecting RdRp) in Europe, together with an increase of genomes carrying the 3036 mutation (+61.7%), the 23403 mutation (48.1%) and the 28881 mutation (+29.6%) (see upper table Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).
