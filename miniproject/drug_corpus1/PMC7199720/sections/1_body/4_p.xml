<p id="para0005">The drug action mechanisms of TCM are basically both similar and different from the conventional medicine. For the similarity, although COVID-19 is a new infectious disease, there have been reports to show that certain chemical components contained in a Chinese herbal formula are actually targeting on the pathological and molecular targets of COVID-19 to produce therapeutic effects, such as 3CL Pro, ACE2 and IL6 etc. On the contrary, the curative effects of Chinese herbal formula sometimes are not necessarily by directly inhibiting or killing the virus, but through the integration of various aspects such as relieving cytokines storm syndrome, protecting human tissues and organs, relieving immunological injury and enhancing the body's ability. With quick development of research programs on this new infection, we believe that solid scientific data would be provided to support widely application of TCM against this epidemic.</p>
