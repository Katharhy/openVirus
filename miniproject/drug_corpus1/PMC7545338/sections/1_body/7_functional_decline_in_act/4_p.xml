<p id="p0150">Deterioration in the ability to perform basic activities of daily living (e.g., dressing, eating, toileting, personal hygiene, and ambulation) is usually more severe in older adults with influenza, especially in frail older people 
 <xref rid="b0455" ref-type="bibr">[91]</xref>. A study of nursing home residents in the US from 1999 to 2005 found that daily activity decline, weight loss, and new or worsening pressure ulcers were impacted by influenza 
 <xref rid="b0460" ref-type="bibr">[92]</xref>. In a study in Canada, 15% of adults ≥ 65 years of age experienced catastrophic disability (loss of independence in at least two self-care activities) following hospitalization for influenza

ILI hospitalizations are associated with a 13% average increase in the risk of hip fracture hospitalization among long-stay and nursing home residents 
 <xref rid="b0470" ref-type="bibr">[94]</xref>. Influenza has also been temporally linked to increased hip fracture incidence during winter, an effect that was reversed by influenza vaccination 
 <xref rid="b0475" ref-type="bibr">[95]</xref>. Some of the mobility impairments in older individuals with influenza have been linked to upregulated inflammatory and muscle degradation genes, and downregulated positive regulators of muscle function
