<p id="p0140">Aging is often associated with functional changes, such as a decline in muscle strength, aerobic capacity, bone density, and pulmonary ventilation, all of which may impact daily activities 
 <xref rid="b0440" ref-type="bibr">[88]</xref>. Because the physical and physiological impact of hospitalization and bed rest includes reduction of plasma volume, accelerated bone loss, increased lung closing volume, and sensory deprivation, vulnerable older adults who are hospitalized or have prolonged bed rest are generally at higher risk of irreversible functional decline 
 <xref rid="b0445" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref>. Even mild illnesses may be sufficient to lead independent older adults into a cascade of functional decline and dependence.
