<p id="p0155">Many estimates of the impact of influenza impact on health-related quality of life are biased towards more severe illness because they are usually based on medically attended cases or those meeting ILI case definitions. By contrast, the Flu Watch study investigated the burden of milder, community influenza cases among a cohort of 5484 participants of all ages in England from 2006 to 2011 
 <xref rid="b0485" ref-type="bibr">[97]</xref>; these cases did not have to meet ILI definitions or result in healthcare consultations. Community influenza cases lost 24,300 quality-adjusted life years (95% CI: 16,600, 34,700) and caused 2.9 million absences per season (based on data from 2006−07 to 2009–10). Around 40% of influenza A cases and 24% of influenza B cases resulted in absenteeism from work (average duration of 3.6 days) or school (2.4 days). Milder influenza illness therefore also contributes to lost health-related quality of life on a population level. Overall, the impact of influenza on functional activity, frailty, dependence, and quality of life are critical areas of research needs because preservation of health, active living, and independence represent important objectives for older adults.
