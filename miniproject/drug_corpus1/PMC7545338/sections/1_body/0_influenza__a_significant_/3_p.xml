<p id="p0010">Influenza viruses continually evolve, allowing them to evade immune memory responses and infect individuals previously exposed to similar virus strains 
 <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Occasionally, an influenza virus from a non-human reservoir infects humans and acquires the potential to spread from person to person, as illustrated by the 1918â€“1919 pandemic that resulted in an estimated 500 million infections and 50 million deaths worldwide 
 <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. This level of devastation from influenza has thankfully not been seen since, possibly due to better public health measures and surveillance systems, the advent of vaccines, and the development of antibiotics and antiviral treatments. Even so, influenza causes epidemics affecting millions of people worldwide every year and, especially in temperate countries, the surges in medical visits and increase in healthcare utilization during the influenza months have been well described 
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Nonetheless, vaccination rates in most countries remain well below the 75% recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO
