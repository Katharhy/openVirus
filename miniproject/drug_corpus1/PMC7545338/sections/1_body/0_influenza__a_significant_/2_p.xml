<p id="p0005">Influenza is an acute infectious viral respiratory disease that causes annual epidemics and occasionally, pandemics 
 <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Influenza viruses spread easily, through aerosolized droplets produced by coughing and sneezing, or by hands and fomites contaminated with influenza viruses. Transmission occurs predominantly during the winter seasons in temperate regions and year-round in tropical regions, especially in crowded areas such as schools, nursing homes, or on public transport 
 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Illness is normally characterized by fever, cough, headache, muscle and joint pain, malaise, sore throat, and a runny nose – symptoms that have an abrupt onset, and can last for more than 2 weeks 
 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Although most people recover within a week without requiring medical attention, influenza can lead to severe illness, hospitalization, and death, especially in older adults, infants, pregnant women, overweight individuals, and individuals with chronic medical conditions
