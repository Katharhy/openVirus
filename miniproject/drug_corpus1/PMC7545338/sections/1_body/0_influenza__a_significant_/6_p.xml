<p id="p0025">Determining accurate laboratory-confirmed influenza attack rates is often difficult because the cohort studies required to do this are costly and complex. The placebo arm of a clinical trial can mimic a cohort study because unvaccinated individuals are closely followed up for disease, and trials are typically accompanied by high-quality diagnostics. A systematic review of 32 controlled influenza vaccine trials conducted between 1974 and 2011 estimated that approximately 1 in 5 unvaccinated children and 1 in 10 unvaccinated adults were infected with seasonal influenza annually

Despite close monitoring and active surveillance, symptomatic attack rates may be higher than that measured in those trials where only patients with respiratory illness are tested for influenza, and atypical presentations that do not conform to strict case definitions (e.g., exacerbations of underlying conditions) are likely missed.
