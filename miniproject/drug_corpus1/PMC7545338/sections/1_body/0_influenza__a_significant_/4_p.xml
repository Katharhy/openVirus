<p id="p0015">Reliable global disease burden data have historically been absent, but an important estimate was provided by the Global Burden of Disease Study 
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. It estimated that 54.5 million lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) attributable to influenza occurred in 2017, of which 8.2 million were severe and resulted in 145,000 (95% uncertainty interval: 99,000–200,000) deaths 
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In contrast, the global annual number of deaths was estimated to be much higher in a study by Iuliano et al. Using a less conservative method based on respiratory death codes, they calculated a global annual burden of ~ 290,000–650,000 influenza-associated respiratory deaths (4.0–8.8 per 100,000 individuals) occurring during the influenza seasons between 1999 and 2015
