<p id="p0105">A systematic review and meta-analysis of populations at risk of developing severe or complicated influenza found that diabetes was associated with higher risks of hospital admission from seasonal influenza A/H3N2 infection and death from pandemic influenza A/H1N1pdm09 virus infection 
 <xref rid="b0335" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. In one study of 162 hospitalized patients with influenza, the odds of being admitted to an ICU were four times higher for patients with diabetes compared to those without (adjusted odds ratio, 4.29 [95% CI: 1.29, 14.3]), making this a greater risk than that from cardiac disease (1.77 [95% CI: 0.61, 5.16]) 
 <xref rid="b0340" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. Several case reports and case series have also identified that influenza virus infection can aggravate diabetic ketoacidosis

 <xref rid="b0350" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. Influenza not only increases abnormal glucose levels by 75% but also impacts daily life of diabetic patients, with reduced sleep and physical activity 
 <xref rid="b0355" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. Based on the collective data, the WHO considers individuals with diabetes a high-risk group with a greater susceptibility for developing more severe and complicated influenza virus infections 
 <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and, accordingly, many national immunization technical advisory groups recommend that those living with diabetes and other metabolic disorders represent high priority groups for immunization
