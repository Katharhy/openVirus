<p id="p0060">Time-series studies provide strong evidence for an association. At the population level, it has been reported that influenza has a small but significant impact on cardiovascular events; for instance in England, 4% of AMI hospital admissions in adults aged ≥ 75 years were attributable to influenza during the peak of the transmission season
