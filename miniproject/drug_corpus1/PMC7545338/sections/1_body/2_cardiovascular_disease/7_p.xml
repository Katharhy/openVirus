<p id="p0075">Randomized clinical vaccine trials provide an alternative method for assessing how influenza may exacerbate chronic health conditions 
 <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Because randomization assures that treatment groups are otherwise similar, differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated populations can be attributed to the vaccine-prevented pathogen (“vaccine probe” approach). A meta-analysis of five randomized trials indicated a reduced frequency of a composite indicator of cardiovascular events in vaccinated subjects vs. control subjects (risk ratio, 0.64 [95% CI: 0.48, 0.86]) 
 <xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. A randomized phase III trial of a high-dose influenza vaccine in approximately 32,000 subjects ≥ 65 years of age showed that it is more immunogenic and efficacious than a standard-dose vaccine in this population

 <xref rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. In addition, it further reduced serious cardio-respiratory events by 17.7% (95% CI: 6.6, 27.4%; from 35.5 to 26.8 events per 1000 participant-seasons), pneumonia events by 39.8% (95% CI: 19.3, 55.1%; from 7.4 to 4.4 events per 1000 participant-seasons), and congestive heart failure by 24.0% (95% CI: −7.2, 46.1%; from 4.7 to 3.6 events per 1000 participant-seasons) 
 <xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. These findings have been broadly matched by observational studies 
 <xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Dedicated larger randomized studies are ongoing to confirm these associations in patients with high-risk cardiovascular disease and evaluate the impact of influenza vaccines on cardiovascular outcomes (e.g., clinicaltrials.gov, NCT04137887)
