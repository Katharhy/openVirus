<p id="p0055">These associations may be caused by several mechanistic pathways whereby an influenza virus infection alters the cardiovascular system to raise the risk of events, even in otherwise healthy individuals. Experimental and observational reports found that influenza virus infections can cause direct cardiac changes, ranging in severity from asymptomatic electrocardiogram abnormalities, myopericarditis, to acute myocardial infarction (AMI)

Influenza may also elicit systemic effects via inflammatory cytokines and prothrombotic changes, and these effects are associated with population-level increases in cardiovascular hospitalizations and deaths from AMI, heart failure, and cerebrovascular events
