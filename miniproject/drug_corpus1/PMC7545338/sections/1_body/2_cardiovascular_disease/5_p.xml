<p id="p0065">More recent studies have used self-controlled case-series methods, which measure the association between influenza (as a transient exposure) and a separate outcome event and, therefore, offer some advantages in reducing study bias because individuals act as their own control. One early case-series study from the United Kingdom found the risk of AMI and stroke to be substantially higher after a diagnosis of systemic respiratory tract infection

This association was later confirmed in other studies with the more specific diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed influenza, which found a 6–10-fold elevated risk of AMI within 1 week of an influenza virus infection

 <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. In a study of 1.9 million hospital admissions for AMI, patients with AMI and concomitant influenza (1% of patients) had worse outcomes than patients with AMI alone in terms of in-hospital death and development of shock, acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury
