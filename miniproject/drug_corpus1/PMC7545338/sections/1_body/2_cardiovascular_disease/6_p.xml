<p id="p0070">Influenza vaccines represent another tool to probe the impact of influenza on cardiovascular complications. Assessing reductions in rates of serious outcomes in vaccine recipients can provide insights into the broader impact of influenza – because the vaccine can only reasonably be assumed to prevent infection with influenza – regardless of whether the illness was directly or indirectly attributable to influenza. For example, in a Danish retrospective cohort study, influenza vaccination was found to reduce the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death in patients with newly diagnosed heart failure, especially if the vaccine was received annually and early before the influenza season

Similarly, in a self-controlled case series study in England, influenza vaccination of heart failure patients was associated with a lower risk of hospitalization due to cardiovascular disease (incidence rate ratio, 0.73 [95% CI: 0.71, 0.76]), and modestly reduced risk of hospitalizations from respiratory infections (0.83 [95% CI: 0.77, 0.90])

MacIntyre et al. indicated that influenza vaccine efficacy/effectiveness in preventing AMI was roughly equivalent to the one seen with statins or antihypertensive treatments, or smoking cessation, suggesting that influenza vaccination should be considered as an integral part of cardiovascular disease management and prevention
