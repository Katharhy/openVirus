<p id="p0085">Influenza virus infection of the lungs can trigger asthma attacks and a worsening of asthma symptoms, even in individuals with mild asthma or asthma that is otherwise well controlled by medication 
 <xref rid="b0250" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Asthma is one of the most common underlying diseases in patients admitted to hospital with influenza, both in adults (7.6–46% of admissions) and children (8.3–42%) 
 <xref rid="b0255" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Although spatiotemporal association has been found in adults between influenza and increased asthma hospitalizations 
 <xref rid="b0260" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, several clinical reports, particularly during the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic, showed that hospitalized asthma patients may have less severe influenza morbidity compared to non-asthmatic patients, with decreased risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and death 
 <xref rid="b0265" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0270" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0275" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0280" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Different hypotheses have been proposed to try to explain this outcome, including corticosteroid use 
 <xref rid="b0275" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, pulmonary immune responses, and lung changes in asthma patients that may limit the severity of infection 
 <xref rid="b0280" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Another hypothesis may be that the threshold for hospital admission is lower for these at-risk patients, with earlier presentation and lower degree of respiratory dysfunctions at admission. Nevertheless, because influenza virus infection can dangerously exacerbate asthma symptoms, individuals with asthma are strongly recommended to receive their annual influenza vaccination
