<p id="p0165">Evaluations of the economic value of vaccines may provide a good insight into societal impacts. Such evaluations are informed by multiple, overlapping data sources that include data from clinical trials, published literature, mathematical models, information regarding the costs of disease episodes, and specifically designed epidemiological studies. However, these assessments are often narrow, excluding many aspects of social value and externalities, such as hospital congestion, follow-on effects, aborted operations, and emergency room visits. Based on a retrospective database analysis in Canada, influenza seems to have a much larger effect on emergency room visits than captured by influenza or ILI clinical diagnoses alone, as evidenced by increased proportion of persons who registered for non-respiratory complaints during periods of elevated ILI activity

Narrow benefits include direct gains in health, healthcare cost savings, and protection against productivity losses directly in vaccine recipients and indirectly at the community level via herd protection. Broad benefits include longer-term improvements in child health, educational outcomes, and macroeconomic stability. Because these broader benefits are not normally measured in microeconomic evaluations, there are gaps in the evidence base behind broader economic and societal impacts of vaccination. Recommendations have been made to collect more of this type of data – for example, data on influenza-related household choices around consumption and savings could be collected in vaccine effectiveness trials or in standard demographic and health surveys
