<p id="p0170">One recent Canadian study revealed that the mean costs associated with influenza-related hospitalizations ($14,612 CAD) and ICU admissions ($39,477 CAD) are much higher than previously estimated 
 <xref rid="b0520" ref-type="bibr">[104]</xref>. Beyond reducing outcomes and their associated costs from third-party payer and societal perspectives, significant decreases in healthcare utilization are possible through vaccination 
 <xref rid="b0525" ref-type="bibr">[105]</xref>. For example, individuals with influenza are frequently prescribed antibiotics, either for bacterial co-infections or sometimes inappropriately, which contribute to antibiotic resistance
