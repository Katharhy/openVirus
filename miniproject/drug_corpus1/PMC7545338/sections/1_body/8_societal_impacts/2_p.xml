<p id="p0160">Compared to other major vaccine-preventable diseases in adults (pertussis, pneumococcal disease, and herpes zoster), influenza represents the most significant contributor in terms of incidence of disease and economic costs 
 <xref rid="b0490" ref-type="bibr">[98]</xref>. In the US, the total annual economic burden of seasonal influenza has been estimated at $11.2 billion ($6.3–$25.3 billion), of which $8.0 billion ($4.8–$13.6 billion) were indirect costs, such as absenteeism from work 
 <xref rid="b0495" ref-type="bibr">[99]</xref>. Similarly, in Europe, the total costs of influenza may range from €6 to €14 billion per year 
 <xref rid="b0500" ref-type="bibr">[100]</xref>. Yet the total economic cost of influenza is likely underestimated because other factors, for example poor performance at work due to influenza illness, are not easy to measure.
