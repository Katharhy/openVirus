<p id="p0130">Influenza virus infection is believed to facilitate bacterial infection by these and other commensals of the respiratory tract by revealing and providing more sites for bacterial adhesion, impairing host immune responses (notably innate responses), and destroying tissues to allow bacterial colonization and spread
