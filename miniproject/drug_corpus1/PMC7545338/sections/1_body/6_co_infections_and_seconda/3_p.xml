 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> are the most commonly reported causes of co-infection or secondary infection associated with influenza, and usually result in bacterial pneumonia 
 <xref rid="b0390" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. Indeed, it is commonly accepted that most of the deaths attributed to the 1918â€“1919 influenza pandemic were due to secondary bacterial pneumonia, especially caused by 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>
 <xref rid="b0390" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. Other associations have also been shown with invasive meningococcal disease in temperate countries and with 
 <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infections 
 <xref rid="b0395" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0400" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>. Some studies have shown these associations decrease after controlling for seasonal patterns and other temporal effects 
 <xref rid="b0405" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0410" ref-type="bibr">[82]</xref>, and additional well-controlled studies across temperate and tropical climates will be needed to accurately quantify these relationships.
