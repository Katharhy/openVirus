<p id="p0180">Empirical estimates of the full global influenza disease burden have not yet been published, primarily due to challenges of associating non-respiratory endpoints with influenza, especially when laboratory confirmation is rare. However, at the country level, excess mortality studies using regression techniques to estimate the influenza-attributable disease burden have been able to do this. For example, an excess mortality study performed between 1997 and 2007 in the US showed that most influenza-associated mortality was due to respiratory and circulatory causes, and that influenza also substantially contributed to mortality from other diseases 
 <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In this study, average annual influenza-associated mortality rates per 100,000 individuals were estimated to be 11.92 (95% CI: 10.17, 13.67) for all underlying causes, 1.73 (1.53, 1.93) for pneumonia and influenza, 3.58 (3.04, 4.14) for all respiratory causes, 3.82 (3.21, 4.4) for heart disease, 4.6 (3.79, 5.39) for all circulatory causes, 0.87 (0.68, 1.05) for cancer, 0.33 (0.26, 0.39) for diabetes, and 0.41 (0.3, 0.52) for Alzheimerâ€™s disease.
