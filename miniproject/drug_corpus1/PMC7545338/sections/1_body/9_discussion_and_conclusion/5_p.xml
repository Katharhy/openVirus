<p id="p0190">The data discussed in this review should be interpreted in light of several limitations. First, our review is a non-systematic review and the studies described were subjectively selected. Second, although we recognize that the robustness of the different methodologies used in these studies is variable, we did not systematically assess the quality of the studies described. For instance, some of the studies mentioned had a small sample size or risks of bias. Third, we found only limited data on associations between influenza burden and several pre-existing medical conditions such as COPD.</p>
