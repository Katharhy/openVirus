<p id="p0195">In conclusion, better understanding of the broader impact of influenza should help provide greater support to health authorities regarding the needs for vaccination programs. Indeed, in most countries, influenza vaccination coverage rates among at-risk populations are far below the 75% recommended by the WHO

Increasing vaccination coverage to reach this target will require an integrated strategy that reinforces awareness among healthcare policymakers and the public and encourages healthcare workers to become active vaccination advocates. Generating high-quality real-world evidence in big data studies may be crucial to achieve this goal. Additionally, structured communication campaigns targeting at-risk populations and strategies to reduce out-of-pocket expenses associated with vaccination will also be necessary. These measures to reduce the burden of seasonal influenza are supported in the WHO’s recent Global Influenza Strategy 2019–2030, especially for low- and middle-income countries
