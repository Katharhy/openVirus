<p id="p0115">In rare cases, influenza virus infection may result in neurologic complications including febrile seizures, influenza-associated encephalitis or encephalopathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and exacerbations in patients with epilepsy 
 <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0370" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>. Although the causes of these complications have not been clearly elucidated, molecular mimicry between viral antigens and self-antigens has been suggested as a potential mechanism 
 <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The severity of these rare events appears variable, and many diagnostic tests such as electroencephalogram and cerebrospinal fluid studies often fail to reliably associate severity with long-term outcomes 
 <xref rid="b0370" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>. Neurologic complications of influenza appear to be more frequently reported in children, and some (e.g., encephalitis) may have a genetic predisposition, given that more cases are reported in some Asian populations 
 <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. An association has also been suggested between influenza vaccines and Guillain-Barré syndrome (annual incidence of 0.4–4.0 cases per 100,000 population), although the magnitude of risk is several times lower than after influenza virus infection 
 <xref rid="b0375" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0380" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. Therefore, the benefits of influenza vaccination are significantly greater than any potential associated risks.
