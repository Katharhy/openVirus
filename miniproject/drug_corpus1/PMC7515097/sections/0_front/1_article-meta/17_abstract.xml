  <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> bacteremia is common in patient populations with a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU), but it rarely causes infective endocarditis. We are reporting a 27-year-old female with a medical history significant for IVDU and hepatitis C virus infection who presented to the emergency department complaining of fever and shortness of breath. Computed tomography of the chest with intravenous (IV) contrast revealed extensive bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with multiple cavitary lesions. The patient was treated with IV vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Blood culture grows methicillin-sensitive 
  <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MSSA) and 
  <italic>S. marcescens</italic>, both sensitive to cefepime/meropenem. Transesophageal echocardiogram revealed 3.4 x 2 cm tricuspid valve vegetation. Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted, who recommended transcatheter aspiration with the AngioVac® system (AngioDynamics Inc., Latham, NY). Post-procedure transesophageal echocardiogram revealed a significant reduction of vegetation size. Vegetation tissue culture grew MSSA and 
  <italic>S. marcescens</italic>. The repeated blood culture revealed no growth, and the patient significantly improved clinically. She completed a six-week course of IV meropenem as an inpatient until she was discharged home.
