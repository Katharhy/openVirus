<p>The presentation of IE differs based on whether it is right or left-sided. In left-sided IE patients have symptoms such as sustained bacteremia, peripheral emboli, and vascular immunological phenomena. Right-sided IE can present with septic pulmonary emboli. Additionally, chronic IE generally presents with an increased number of symptoms, while acute IE can present with less defining symptoms. The diagnosis of IE may be madeÂ by using the modified Duke criteria. This includes a list of major and minor criteria, that when fulfilled, is likely a case of IE. The major modified Duke criteria are blood culture positive for IE and evidence of endocardial involvement. The minor criteria include: predisposing heart condition or IVDU; fever of 38 degrees Celsius; vascular phenomena including major arterial emboli, septic pulmonary infarcts, mycotic aneurysm, intracranial hemorrhage, conjunctival hemorrhages, and Janeway lesions; immunological phenomena such as Osler nodes, glomerulonephritis, Roth spots, and rheumatoid factor; and microbiological evidence. The criteria are fulfilled when one major and one minor or three minor criteria are met [
