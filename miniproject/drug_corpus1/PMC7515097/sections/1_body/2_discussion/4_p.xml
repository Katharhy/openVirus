 <italic>S. marcescens</italic> is a gram-negative, aerobic, motile bacillus that produces a red pigment. It was first discovered in 1819, and the knowledge regarding the organisms’ infective capabilities has increased since then [
 <xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. 
 <italic>S. marcescens</italic> is present throughout the environment and can also be found in the human intestinal flora. It has been found in soil, plants, animals, and water sources [
 <xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The organism is frequently a hospital-acquired bacterium and is known to cause infections such as catheter-associated urinary tract infections, pneumonia, meningitis, and wound infections [

 <italic>S. marcescens</italic> IE was reported in 1951 and had an association with IVDU [

 <italic>Serratia</italic>, along with some other 
 <italic>Eneterobacteriacae</italic>, have an AmpC Beta-lactamase that is able to hydrolyze penicillin as well as first, second, and third-generation cephalosporins. This enzyme is usually induced when a patient is given beta-lactam antibiotics or if they have a certain mutation that can lead to antibiotic resistance. Therefore, while the antibiotic selection is difficult with 
 <italic>Serratia </italic>infections, susceptibility testing can be utilized to guide treatment [
