<p>Treatment for IE includes antibiotics, surgery, or the use of a transcatheter aspiration system (AngioVac® system). Anticoagulation therapy during an active infection is controversial because it could facilitate future embolization and lead to intracerebral hemorrhage. Therefore, anticoagulation is only started for indications other than septic emboli or if a prosthetic valve is involved [
 <xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Antibiotics are the first-line treatment and should be continued in an individual for a determined course length once there are negative blood cultures. In patients with an active infection, blood cultures should be obtained every 24-48 hours to assess infection status [
 <xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Surgery is indicated for IE with heart failure, uncontrolled infection, and to prevent embolization. Emergent surgery is recommended for heart failure with pulmonary edema and urgent surgery is recommended for heart failure with poor hemodynamic tolerance [
 <xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Uncontrolled infections refer to IE with complications such as an abscess, fistula, pseudoaneurysms, or positive blood culture 7-10 days following therapy or resistant organisms. Additionally, surgery done to prevent embolization is based on the size of the vegetation. Surgery is recommended for vegetations greater than 10 mm if the patient has had previous embolization and for vegetations greater than 15 mm for isolated vegetations [

 <xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The AngioVac® system is a vacuum-based percutaneous aspiration device that is minimally invasive and has been approved for removal of materials from the intravascular system since 2014. The procedure can also be done to reduce complications of surgery, increase the efficacy of antibiotics, and can be used as a bridge to surgery or as an alternative in patients with high perioperative risk [

 <xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Complications of the AngioVac® procedure include vascular or myocardial injury, pericardial tamponade, tricuspid valve injury, or pulmonary embolism [
 <xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Following treatment of IE, an additional TTE or TEE should be done to establish a new baseline of heart function. Post-treatment, patients are most likely to have a relapse of infection within two months. Cases involving
