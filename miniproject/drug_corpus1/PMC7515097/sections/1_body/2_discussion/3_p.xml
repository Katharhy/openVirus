<p>IE can vary in terms of presentation but also has a variety of organisms implicated in the illness, the most common infecting organism being 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Other causes include streptococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, gram-negative organisms, and fungi [
 <xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The risk of each of these can vary based on many individual patient characteristics, but the rarest forms of IE include those that are fungal or non-HACEK (
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic> species, 
 <italic>Aggregatibacter</italic> species, 
 <italic>Cardiobacterium hominis</italic>, 
 <italic>Eikenella corrodens</italic>, and 
 <italic>Kingella</italic> species) gram-negative aerobic bacilli. One rare non-HACEK gram-negative organism implicated in IE is 
 <italic>S. marcescens</italic>.
