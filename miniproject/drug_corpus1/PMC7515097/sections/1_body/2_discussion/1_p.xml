<p>The majority of IE is left-sided, however 5-10% of IE is right-sided and this is usually seen with IVDU or patients with IV lines and wires placed for medical reasons. Right-sided IE occurs when there is diluent-related damage with thrombus, drug-induced pulmonary hypertension with secondary valve damage, IVDU-related endothelial problems, or IVDU-related immunologic abnormalities [

For an infection to be sustained there must be irregularities of the endocardium to allow for bacterial adherence, adhesion must occur, and there should be survival of the adhered bacteria. The endocardium can become more habitable by bacteria through trauma to the tissue leading to deposition of platelets and fibrin. This surface, as well as various bacterial virulence factors such as dextran, promote the adherence of the pathogen. Lastly, bacterial survival is promoted through resistance to phagocytosis by white blood cells [
