<p>Urine drug screen was positive for opiates, methadone, and marijuana. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest with contrast revealed extensive pulmonary infiltrates with multiple cavitary lesions, likely due to septic emboli (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FIG1">1</xref>). Broad-spectrum intravenous (IV) antibiotics (vancomycin and pipercillin/tazobactam) were started. She was admitted to the intensive care unit for severe sepsis. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealed multiple vegetations on the atrial aspect of the tricuspid valve (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FIG2">2</xref>), the largest measuring 3.4 x 2.0 cm on the posterior leaflet and 3.2 x 1.1 cm on the anterior leaflet. Blood cultures taken were positive for 
 <italic>S. marcescens</italic> and methicillin-susceptible 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MSSA). Antibiotics were tailored to microbial susceptibilities. Percutaneous aspiration with an AngioVac® system (AngioDynamics Inc., Latham, NY) was performed for resection of the tricuspid vegetations. The post-procedural TEE showed significant reduction of vegetation size on the tricuspid valve (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FIG3">3</xref>). Cultures of the vegetations grew 
 <italic>S. marcescens</italic> and MSSA (Figure

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FIG5">5</xref>).
