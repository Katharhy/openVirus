<p>Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the inner lining of the heart and generally involves the heart valves but also may occur at septal defect sites, on chorda tendinea, and on the mural endocardium. IE can occur on both native or prosthetic valves. The incidence on native valves is 1.7-6.2 cases per 100,000 person-years and is worsened by risk factors such as intravenous drug use (IVDU), which has an incidence of 150 to 2000 per 100,000 person-years [

Other risk factors for IE include male gender, bacteremia, congenital heart disease, disruption of the gastrointestinal tract, poor dental hygiene, diabetes mellitus, human immunodeficiency virus infection, indwelling central lines, and cardiac implantable electronic devices [

 <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> IE is an extremely rare infection with no definitive treatment guidelines. In the era of opioid epidemics and increased risk of blood-borne infections, it is essential to recognize 
 <italic>S. marcesens</italic> as a possible cause of IE and initiate the appropriate antibiotics promptly [
