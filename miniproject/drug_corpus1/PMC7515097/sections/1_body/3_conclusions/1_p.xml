 <italic>S. marcescens</italic> IE is an extremely rare infection with no definitive treatment guidelines. The AngioVac® system is a promising noninvasive treatment for right-sided IE. The AngioVac® system has shown its efficacy in reducing the intracardiac vegetation size and the associated bacterial load, therefore increasing the efficacy of antibiotics in the clearing of the bloodstream infection. This system can also be utilized as a bridge to surgery by reducing the perioperative risk through improving clearance of infection, reducing the risk of septic pulmonary embolism, and improving hemodynamics. Multidisciplinary care is recommended for all patients of IE for better outcomes.
