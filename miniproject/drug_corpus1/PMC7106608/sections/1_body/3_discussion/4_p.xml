 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], studies are mixed on its potential association with ART initiation, with several studies demonstrating an absence of association [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. This association has not, to our knowledge, been explored in Vietnam to date. Authors working in China suggest that subpopulations of patients with depression may have differing levels of ART initiation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]; our study suggests that patients with increased depression symptoms were less likely to have initiated ART at baseline. This warrants further investigation, particularly as a recent study in Vietnam showed that one-fifth of patients living with HIV who were sampled endorsed depression symptoms [
