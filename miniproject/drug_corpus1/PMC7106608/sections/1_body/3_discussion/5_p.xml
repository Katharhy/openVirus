<p id="Par36">Among study participants, the strong association between ART receipt and HIV viral suppression eclipsed other important participant characteristics associated with HIV viral suppression in bivariate analysis, yet suggests that increasing access to ART from 70% to the UNAIDS target of greater than 90% is likely to achieve HIV viral suppression in people who receives ART. This study finding should not be interpreted as supporting public health approaches that only support ART roll-out without attention to substance use disorder treatment. Rather, it is essential to support ongoing opioid use disorder prevention and treatment interventions in order to reduce medical comorbidity and non-AIDS related deaths among people with opioid use disorder who account for the majority of HIV infections in Vietnam [
