<p id="Par39">Our study findings should be interpreted in light of several potential limitations. First, we cannot make causal inferences between participant characteristics associated with being on ART at baseline due to the studyâ€™s cross-sectional design. Additional research is needed to evaluate participants characteristics associated with the HIV care continuum among this patient population over time. Second, we were not able to consider the many structural characteristics potentially associated with being on ART or HIV viral suppression. The BRAVO intervention, however, is a structural intervention to increase access to OUD treatment in Vietnam and will assessed prospectively. Third, Vietnam is a middle-income country that has devoted substantial national resources to increasing treatment for both HIV and OUD. Results may not be generalizable to countries without such interventions, but may serve as a guide for those wishing to expand care services.</p>
