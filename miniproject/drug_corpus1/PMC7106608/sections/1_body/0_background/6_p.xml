<p id="Par18">To date, few studies have explored what individual characteristics may contribute to viral suppression in Vietnam regardless of opioid use. Several studies demonstrate that comorbid substance use disorders can decrease the likelihood of HIV viral suppression [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], though the majority of this effect is likely related to social barriers rather than a physiologic mechanism. One study found adherence to ART and use of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole as predictors of HIV viral suppression, while a history of tuberculosis was a risk factor for non-suppression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In another study, younger age at beginning of treatment and positive Hep-C antibody were associated with virologic failure on HIV treatment in Vietnam [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Social isolation, high perceived stigma, and multiple daily pill regimens have also been associated with suboptimal HIV virologic suppression in Vietnam [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The primary objective of this analysis was to evaluate associations between participant characteristics and the critical steps in the HIV care continuum of ART initiation and HIV viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA PCR &lt; 200 copies/mL) among people with opioid use disorder and HIV in Vietnam.
