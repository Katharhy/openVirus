<p id="p0060">In this work, we cover a knowledge gap about the COVID-19 Mpro and its comparison with the two most dangerous coronavirus epidemics, SARS and MERS CoVs. In addition, we used the first resolved COVID-19 crystal structure of Mpro to find suitable binding agents with proved safety. In this context, the FDA approved drugs were the best starting point in the way of repurposing approved and safe drugs against COVID-19.</p>
