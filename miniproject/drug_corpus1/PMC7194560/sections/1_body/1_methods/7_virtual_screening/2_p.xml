<p id="p0050">The Schrodinger glide docking module was used for virtual screening. In order to get accurate results, the standard precision (SP docking) was selected [
 <xref rid="bb9000" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb8000" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The output results were ordered by docking score. In this set, the curcumin was found to be a strong inhibitor of SARS Mpro [
 <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The measured IC50 was 0.0235 μM. The obtained docking results were reanalyzed to include a comparison with curcumin. The relative docking scores were calculated for every compound by dividing its score with the docking score curcumin.
