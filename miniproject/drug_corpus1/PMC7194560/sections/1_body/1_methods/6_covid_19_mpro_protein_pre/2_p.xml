<p id="p0045">Virtual screening was implemented by using the published crystal structure of COVID-19 Mpro (PDB ID 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:6lu7" id="ir0015" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">6lu7</ext-link>). The protein preparation module in Maestro software package (Schrodinger LLC, NY, USA) was used to optimize the protein structure for docking. Water and other nonspecific molecules were removed, the protein was protonated to add polar hydrogens, the structure was optimized at cellular pH conditions, and the structure energy minimized using OPLS2005 force field. The docking grid was generated by using the co-crystalised ligand as the center for docking box of 20 Å size.
