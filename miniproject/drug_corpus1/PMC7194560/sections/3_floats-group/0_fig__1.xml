  <p>Sequences alignment and phylogenetic relations of Mpro from SARS CoV, MERS CoV and COVID-19. A) Pairwise sequence alignment of COVID-19 and SARS CoVs Mpro. Conserved residues are not highlighted and displayed in black colour. The different residues are highlighted in by red colour B) pairwise sequence comparison of COVID-19 and MERS CoVs. Conserved residues are not highlighted and displayed in black colour. The different residues are highlighted in by red colour. C) the phylogenetic relations of Mpro, the tree was generated after the maximum likelihood.
