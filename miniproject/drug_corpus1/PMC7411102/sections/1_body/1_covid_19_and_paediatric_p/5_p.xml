<p id="p0035">Paediatric population affected by COVID-19 appears to have milder symptoms in majority, less frequent severe disease and hospitalizations. Infants and those with underlying co morbidities including CHD are at highest risk of complications of COVID-19. Laboratory findings are similar to adult population with few exceptions. Fever, cough and shortness of breath were less commonly reported in children as compared to adults. Myalgia, sore throat, headache, and diarrhoea were also less commonly reported by paediatric patients.
