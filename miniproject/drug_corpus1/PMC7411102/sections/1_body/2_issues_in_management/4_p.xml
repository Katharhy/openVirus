<p id="p0085">Many of these therapies have cardiovascular side effects especially arrhythmic risk due to QT prolongation. Consequent to the metabolic and pathophysiologic consequences SARS-CoV-2 infection and drug interactions such patients likely to have longer baseline QTc. The risk of risk drug-induced Torsades de pointes is influenced by number of factors such as electrolyte disturbances, female sex, hepatic/renal failure, structural heart disease, congenital long-QT syndromes, and concomitant QT prolonging medications. A risk score has been derived and validated by Tisdale etÂ al

Recently Indian Heart Rhythm Society has come up with document regarding cardiovascular risks of hydroxychloroquine in treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19 patients and recommendations for its use. It may be applicable to children also.
