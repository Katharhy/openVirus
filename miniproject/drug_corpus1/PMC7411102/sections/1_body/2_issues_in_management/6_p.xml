<p id="p0095">Another important issue is care of children who require intubation or other aerosol generating procedures and at the same time minimising the risk to health care provider (many children may be asymptomatic and unrecognised COVID -19). The consensus guidelines from the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia's Pediatric Difficult Intubation Collaborative and the Canadian Pediatric Anesthesia Society, recommend appropriate personal protective equipment as essential when performing aerosol-generating procedures. Airway procedures should preferably be done in negative pressure rooms. In between surgical cases sufficient time should be allowed for operating room cleaning and air filtration. The goal is to minimize aerosolized respiratory secretions and direct contact with patient. Recommendations include administering anxiolytic medications, intravenous anaesthetic inductions, tracheal intubation using cuffed tracheal tubes and video laryngoscopes and use of in-line suction catheters. Application of prone ventilation is strongly recommended for adult patients, and may be considered for paediatric patients event with CHD with severe ARDS.
