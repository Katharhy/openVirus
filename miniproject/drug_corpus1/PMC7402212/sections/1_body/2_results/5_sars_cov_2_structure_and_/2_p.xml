 <xref rid="bib0315" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0320" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. First, S protein binds to the cellular receptor ACE2 [
 <xref rid="bib0325" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. This attachment is followed by activation of the S protein, which initiates fusion of the viral membrane with the membrane of the host cell [
 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This fusion allows the virus to enter the cells [
 <xref rid="bib0330" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 releases its genetic material into the cell cytoplasm where it is translated into the viral replicase polyproteins pp1a and 1ab. Pp1a and p1ab are then cleaved by viral proteinases to form functional non-structural proteins (NSPs) such as a helicase (Hel) and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) which is responsible for replication of structural protein RNA [
 <xref rid="bib0335" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The plus-stranded RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 will serve to synthetize subgenomic negative-strand templates that serve as templates for mRNA synthesis. Structural proteins S1, S2, E, and M are then translated by ribosomes that are bound to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [
 <xref rid="bib0340" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Viral nucleocapsids (N) are assembled from genomic RNA, followed by budding into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)â€“Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) [
 <xref rid="bib0345" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. The nucleocapsids fuse with the virion precursor. Formed virions will then be transported from the ER through the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface via small vesicles and released from the cell through exocytosis [
