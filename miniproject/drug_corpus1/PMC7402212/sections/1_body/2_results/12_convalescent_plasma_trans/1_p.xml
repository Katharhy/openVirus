<p id="par0095">Convalescent plasma transfusion (CP) therapy was successfully used in the treatment of SARS, MERS and during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic with acceptable efficacy and safety [

It consists of collecting convalescent plasma from patients 2 weeks after recovery, to ensure neutralisation and a high antibodies titer followed by its administration to infected patients. Duan and his colleagues (2020) performed a pilot study in three participating hospitals in China to explore the feasibility of CP treatment in 10 severe COVID-19 patients. They showed that clinical symptoms significantly improved with the increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 days, accompanied by rapid neutralization of viremia [

Despite CP being an effective way to improve survival rate of severely infected patients, it does not permit the patient to acquire a SARS-CoV-2 immune protection and the safety of plasma globulin products specific to SARS-CoV-2 deserves further consideration [
