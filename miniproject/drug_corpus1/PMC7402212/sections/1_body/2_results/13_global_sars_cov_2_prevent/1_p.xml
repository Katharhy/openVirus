<p id="par0100">Given the lack of available effective vaccine or treatments, it is primordial to control the source of infection and cut off the transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 by implementing robust preventative measures against this virus. We know that close contacts and fomites are the most common ways of transmission for SARS-CoV-2. Aerosol transmission is still controversial. The WHO recommended several standard procedures for slowing the spread of COVID-19 by raising awareness on the prevention and control of the disease in the general population. The bulk of these strategies involve restricting mass gathering by advising the population to be confined and avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness in order to decrease the risk of spreading by breaking the transmission chain. Thus, many countries suspended all types (cultural, social, religious, scientific, sporting, and political) of mass gatherings and opted for videoconferences, and telecommuting. The WHO also recommended to maintain personal hygiene especially regular hand washing with soap and water or hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol, a healthy lifestyle and adequate nutritional intake [
