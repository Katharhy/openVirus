<p id="par0030">Coronaviruses have been described as causing several systemic infections in their selected animal host [
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, some of them can adapt dramatically and jump the species barrier by natural recombination causing epidemics or pandemics. Infection in human often leads to severe clinical symptoms and high mortality (

 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> the appearance of the seven human coronaviruses over the time (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). In 2002, in Guangdong (China), the SARS-CoV virus emerged and spread to the five continents infecting 8098 people and causing 774 deaths (9.5% of cases). In 2012, MERS-CoV emerged in the Arabian Peninsula infecting 2494 people in 27 countries and causing 858 deaths (34.4% of cases) [
 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In late December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 emerged in a seafood market (where several wildlife species are sold including bats, rabbits, snakes, birds and frogs) in Wuhan City, Hubei province, China [
 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. As of July 12, 2020, this virus has been responsible for 12,698,995 confirmed cases and 564,924 deaths worldwide (2.3%). SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly to 213 countries (at the time of revision), and the most affected continents are the America and Europe with 6,685,097 and 2,572,406 confirmed cases respectively since 31 December 2019 and as of July 12, 2020. In America, 286,796 persons were died and 196,096 ones in Europe until this day (

 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> ). On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern [
 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. On March 11, 2020, the WHO issued an announcement of the change in COVID-19’s status from an epidemic to pandemic disease. It was suggested that MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats [
 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Phylogenetic analyses showed that SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and SARS-like coronaviruses isolated in bats belong to a different clade than MERS-CoV, with a complete genome nucleotide identity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV of 79.5% and between SARS-CoV-2 and bat SARS coronavirus (SARSr-CoV-RaTG13) of 96% [
 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Palm civets and racoon dogs were identified as the likely reservoir host fuelling spillover to humans for SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], while MERS-CoV’s intermediate host is unequivocally dromedary camels [
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For SARS-CoV-2, pangolins and snakes are thought to be potential intermediate hosts but this requires further confirmation [
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. More evidence is needed to confirm the origin of this novel virus and its transmission to humans, to understand the best way to prevent and slow down its transmission and to better control of future zoonotic events. In 
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> , we summarize the principal characteristics of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Briefly, bats seem to be the common natural origin of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The clinical features of the three viruses are quite similar. However, unlike SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious and spreads rapidly, currently affecting more than 213 countries (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int" id="intr0020" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.who.int</ext-link>). SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host target cells; however, MERS-CoV binds to the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 receptor (DDP4) [
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. According to the latest studies, SARS-CoV-2 has the highest number of casualties but its mortality rate is lower (2.3%) compared to SARS-CoV (9.5%) and MERS (34.4%) [
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 resembles both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but appears unique in its high transmission rates.
