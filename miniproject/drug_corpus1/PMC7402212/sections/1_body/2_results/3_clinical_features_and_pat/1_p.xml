<p id="par0035">COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease. Its clinical manifestations range from mild to severe but most infected cases present a mild form of the disease and therefore have no severe clinical features [
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Based on current data, 81% of the cases exhibit mild symptoms and 1.2% are asymptomatic (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://weekly.chinacdc.cn" id="intr0025" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://weekly.chinacdc.cn</ext-link>). SARS-CoV-2 can spread rapidly in the community contrarily to SARS CoV and MERS-CoV that have a higher mortality rate but a stronger nosocomial than community transmissibility. This is likely due to the fact that they cause a more severe clinical phenotype than COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It was reported that COVID-19 average incubation period is 5.2 days (95% confidence interval (CI), 4.1–7.0) with the 95th percentile at 12.5 days [
 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Another study estimated it at 6.4 days (95% CI, 5.6–7.7) [
 <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The median age of COVID-19 cases ranges from 49 to 57 years [
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and median time from the first symptom to death is 14 days [
 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. While a detailed clinical landscape continues to be established, the most common clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 observed in patients were fever (87.9%), cough (67.7%) and fatigue (38.1%), whereas diarrhea (3.7%) and vomiting (5.0%) were occasional [
 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. All patients had pneumonia and about half had dyspnea [
 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Some COVID-19 patients showed arrhythmia, acute heart injury, impaired renal function and abnormal liver function (50.7%) at admission [
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In addition, there is evidence of ocular surface infection in patients with COVID-19 as SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in eye secretions of patients [
 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. A retrospective case series study conducted on 214 infected patients from Wuhan showed that 78 (36.4%) patients displayed neurologic manifestations [
 <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Furthermore, diminished ability to smell or taste observed in some patients [
 <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] was found to result from a neurotropic or neurovirulent viral infection of the olfactory system [
 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The older population and individuals with underlying health complications as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes were reported to present the severe disease symptoms [
 <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Children were found less vulnerable than the elder population [
 <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Pregnant women may be more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 as this virus may alter the immune responses at the maternal-fetal interface, and affect the well-being of mothers and infants [
 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. A retrospective study based on nine pregnant women infected by COVID-19 showed no evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission between mothers and infants in the late pregnancy [
 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. To avoid SARS-CoV-2 newborns infections after birth, immediate prevention instructions should be implemented for these women and their neonates, including a 14-day isolation for newborns and avoiding breast feeding during this period [
 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Laboratory findings showed typical CT results including bilateral pulmonary parenchymal ground glass and consolidated pulmonary opacities sometimes with a rounded morphology and peripheral lung distribution [
 <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Ground-glass-like lung images are probably due to the severe inflammation of lung cells becoming unable to exchange carbon dioxide and oxygen after SARS-CoV-2 infection [
 <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. A recent study showed that that SARS-CoV-2 could infect T cells explaining the lymphocytopenia commonly found in COVID-19 patients [
 <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. It was also observed that most critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 had elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-10) [
 <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], indicating potential bacterial co-infection caused by dysregulated immune system [
 <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Moreover, Nguyen team, by using 
 <italic>in silico</italic> analysis, showed that genetic variability across the three major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes (human leukocyte antigen [HLA] A, B, and C) may affect susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19 which need further experimental investigation [
