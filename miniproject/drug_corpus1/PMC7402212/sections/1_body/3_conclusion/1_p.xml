<p id="par0110">The international alert about the COVID-19 infection has helped in the containment of SARS-CoV-2. At the date of writing, COVID-19 showed promising signs of ending. Many countries seem to be efficiently controlling this SARS-CoV-2 pandemic wave and have considerably limited the mortality rate thanks to knowledge garnered in the past from SARS and MERS epidemics, allowing for the rapid institution of more efficient preventive measures. However, SARS-CoV-2 is far from being eradicated and many researchers predict novel waves in the future. That is why research efforts on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 need to be redoubled to discover efficient treatments as soon as possible. Several promising competitive therapeutic options are currently under development all over the world but require time to for validation and commercialization. There is still much to learn about COVID-19 and it critical that scientist around the world collaborate and share information in order to face this new global threat and to develop a suitable cure to benefit all of humanity.</p>
