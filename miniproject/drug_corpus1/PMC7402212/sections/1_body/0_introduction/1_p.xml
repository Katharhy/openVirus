<p id="par0005">Coronaviruses (CoV) are the largest known RNA viruses. Their size varies from 65 to 125 nm in diameter and their nucleic acid genome is single-stranded RNA, size ranging from 26 to 32 kb in length [
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Since 1960, six coronaviruses have been found to cause diseases in humans; SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh one, after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. While HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E are associated with mild symptoms in humans, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, belonging to the betacoronavirus genus, cause severe to deadly pneumonia in humans [
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Fever, dry cough, difficulty breathing and fatigue usually accompany this pneumonia [
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The fatality rates of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are 9.5%, 34.4%, and 2.3% respectively [
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. COVID-19 shows some particular pathogenic, epidemiological and clinical features which have are not completely understood to date as well as its wide and high transmission in the community versus nosocomial spread of SARS and MERS and its milder infection and low mortality compared to the severe phenotype and higher mortality caused by the two others viruses [
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. To date, no therapeutic or vaccines were approved against any of the known human coronaviruses and only protective measures were put in place. Based on the current published literature, we summarize in this paper the origin of this novel virus and its life cycle, the clinical characteristics of the disease, the possible transmission routes, the pathogenesis, the prevention measures and the undergoing treatments of this emerging infectious disease.
