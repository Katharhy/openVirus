 <caption>
  <p>A schematic diagram indicating the potential drug targets and drugs on viral replication processes. (1) ACE2 and spike complex inhibitors: Azithromycin and Chloroquine, interrupt in ACE2 and S protein complex formation; (2) TMPRSS2 inhibitor: Camostat Mesylate blocks cleavage and activation of the S protein; (3) Targeting endosomes: chloroquine and its derivatives increase pH and inhibit viral RNA release from endosomes; (4) Targeting proteases: ASC09F, Oseltamivir, Ritonavir, Oseltamivir, Oseltamivir, Lopinavir inhibit proteases thereby inhibit viral replication; (5) Targeting RdRp: Favipiravir, Remdesivir, and Ribavirin block RdRp and cause premature termination of RNA synthesis; (6) Targeting Spike: Monoclonal antibody, Arbidol, and convalescent plasma block spike protein which results into binding interruption with ACE2; (7) Targeting host immune system: activated host immune system can block virus propagation as well as recover body from the adverse effects posed by viruses</p>
