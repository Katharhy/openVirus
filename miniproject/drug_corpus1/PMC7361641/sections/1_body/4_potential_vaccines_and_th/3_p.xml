<p>A suitable vaccine of SARS‐CoV‐2 can prevent the spread of the current pandemic COVID‐19 and can save millions of lives and billions of money. Currently, different research groups around the world are working with more than 100 candidate vaccines against SARS‐CoV‐2 based on (1) inactivated or weakened whole virus, (2) nucleic acid, (3) viral vector, and (4) protein subunit or virus‐like particles (Figure 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), which are in the preclinical evaluation for SARS‐CoV‐2 (Amanat &amp; Krammer,

 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). As of May 2020, some vaccines are under different phases of clinical trials (Table 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-tbl-0005" ref-type="table">5</xref>). Five of those vaccines are in Phase 1 clinical trials, six are in Phase 2 trials and one vaccine candidate is in Phase 3 clinical trials (Table 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-tbl-0005" ref-type="table">5</xref>). Those candidate vaccines are DNA based (2), inactivated virus (2), modified antigen‐presenting cell (APC) (3), nonreplicating virus (2), and protein subunit based (1) (Table 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-tbl-0005" ref-type="table">5</xref>). The nonreplicating virus‐based vaccine, namely ChAdOx1 nCoV‐19, developed by the Consortium of the Jenner Institute, Oxford Biomedica, University of Oxford, which is under phase three clinical trial is considered as the most promising vaccine candidate so far. ChAdOx1 construct contains S protein that can elicit an immune response in the body, which might prevent subsequent infection of SARS‐CoV‐2 (Lane, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0099" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). The Phase 1 trial initiated in April where 1,000 plus immunizations have been accomplished and follow‐up is currently continuing. Now commencing Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials to assess how well the vaccine provokes immune responses in older adults, and to examine whether it can render protection in the wider population (

Another vaccine is the mRNA‐1273 vaccine, a synthetic strand of mRNA, which translates the prefusion‐stabilized viral spike protein. The mRNAs, after intramuscular injection, are predicted to generate antiviral responses toward the spike protein of SARS‐CoV‐2. Furthermore, the synthesis of the lipid nanoparticle‐encapsulated mRNA vaccine does not require the virus‐like conventional vaccines; therefore, these are harmless and ready to be tested (NCT04283461). However, no vaccine has completed any clinical trial yet, and no vaccines are available to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (Amanat &amp; Krammer,
