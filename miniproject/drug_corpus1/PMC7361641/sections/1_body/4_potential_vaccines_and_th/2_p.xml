<p>A vaccine is an ultimate hope to prevent and reduce the spread of COVID‐19. A vaccine can be either prophylactic, which prevents future infection or therapeutic, which is used to treat diseases such as cancer or infectious diseases (Frazer, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Guo et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0070" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). The whole pathogen (either killed or live‐attenuated), or parts of the pathogen, such as nucleic acid, proteins, or peptides, can be used as vaccines (Haque, Shah, Paul, &amp; Barua, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0074" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Shah &amp; Md Kawsar, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0147" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Whole virus vaccines have been widely studied and showed protection against the influenza virus (Fiore, Bridges, &amp; Cox, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>), the human papillomavirus, and the chickenpox virus (Liesegang, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0110" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>); whereas, subunit and peptide‐based vaccines have shown immunity in vitro (Khan, Hossain, Rakib‐Uz‐Zaman, &amp; Morshed, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0089" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) and animal studies (Islam, Clemens, &amp; Qadri, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0078" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). There were efforts to develop vaccines against SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV, which were tested in animal models (Gao et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>; Kim et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0092" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). However, there is no benign and operational vaccine available against SARS‐CoV until now. Development of vaccines against SARS‐CoV after the SARS outbreak in 2002–2004 was attempted (Greenough et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0068" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>; Roberts et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0139" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Tripp et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0172" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>); however, the efforts did not result in finding any effective vaccines until now. During MERS prevalence, it was believed that SARS‐CoV would provide a foundation and a template for developing vaccines against MERS‐CoV infection (Jiang, Lu, &amp; Du, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0080" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). However, only one MERS‐CoV DNA vaccine has so far completed a Phase 1 clinical trial (Yong, Ong, Yeap, Ho, &amp; Tan, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0196" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Several more viral vectored‐MERS‐CoV vaccines are in progress (Yong et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0196" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>) which were reviewed by Zumla, Chan, Azhar, Hui, and Yuen (
