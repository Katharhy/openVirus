<p>Beyond the approaches that have been addressed in this review, the strategies aimed at priming the host immune responses are of great potential as individuals with a compromised immune system are particularly vulnerable to COVID‐19. Moreover, along with viral‐specific therapeutics, immunomodulatory and anti‐inflammatory agents acting against nonspecific inflammatory responses also need to be focused. The lessons learned from this emerging pandemic can help us prepare in advance for any possible future epidemics. As we live in the era of big data, systematic and multidisciplinary approaches need to be employed to find drug targets and repurposing drugs for instant drug discovery.</p>
