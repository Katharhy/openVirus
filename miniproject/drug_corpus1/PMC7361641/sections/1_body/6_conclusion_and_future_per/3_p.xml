<p>In this review, we revisited the current knowledge on the potential drug targets of therapeutic promise against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and highlighted the application of the drug repurposing approach. The possible therapeutic options that are currently under clinical and preclinical studies have been discussed. We also compiled the current clinical trials mostly based on repurposing the therapeutic agents formerly designed for other indications that have been rapidly started during the early phase of the pandemic and are currently undergoing. Although far from practical application, significant progress has been made in vaccine development. Overall, this current effort leaves some valuable information on prospective druggable targets and current options of possible therapeutic as well as preventive strategies, providing a comprehensive and systematic guideline for those who are dedicated to COVID‐19 research.</p>
