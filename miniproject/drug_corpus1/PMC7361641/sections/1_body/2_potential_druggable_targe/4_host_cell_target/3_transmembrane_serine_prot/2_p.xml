<p>Although the ACE2 is available in the vascular endothelial cells of all organs, the lungs are more susceptible to SARS‐CoV infection (Hamming et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0072" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). This phenomenon strengthens the possibility of other factors associated with the actual pathogenesis of SARS‐CoV‐2. One such factor which accounts for the viral entry into host cells is TMPRSS2, a well‐known human alveolar and airway protease (Shulla et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0153" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). TMPRSS11a, a TMPRSS2 related protein, has been found to cleave SARS‐CoV S protein and to moderately accelerate viral infections (Kam et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0084" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). TMPRSS2 probably facilitates viral pathogenesis and transmission in two ways: First, TMPRSS2 might activate SARS‐CoV S protein for virus–cell and cell–cell fusion. Second, TMPRSS2 might protect viral recognition by different neutralizing antibodies of the host (Glowacka et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Evidence suggests that the entry of SARS‐CoV‐2 into host cells requires both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (Hoffmann et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0076" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), thereby suggesting that TMPRSS2 might be a potential drug target. Matsuyama et al. (
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0122" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) showed that a TMPRSS2‐expressing in VeroE6 cell line is highly susceptible to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection displaying the critical role of TMPRSS2 in the pathogenesis of this viral disease. Previously, Bromhexine hydrochloride, an FDA approved component in mucolytic cough suppressants, showed specific inhibition on TMPRSS2 with no adverse effect in prostate cancer patients and reduction of the progression of metastasis (Lucas et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0114" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Bromhexine hydrochloride might be repurposed as a TMPRSS2 inhibitor for preventing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection as well (Hoffmann et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0076" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>).
