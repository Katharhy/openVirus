<p>Autophagy is a natural mechanism of a cell which ensures the maintenance of cellular homeostasis by lysosomal catabolic action, leading the degradation and recycling of intracellular endogenous (macromolecules, abnormal proteins, and damaged organelles) and exogenous (viruses and bacteria) particles (Galluzzi et al.,

 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0103" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). Some viruses have developed strategies to escape autophagic degradation and use host autophagy machinery for their self‐replication (Dong, Dong, &amp; Levine, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). The significance of the autophagy process and its therapeutic development for SARS‐CoV, MERS‐CoV, and SARS‐CoV‐2 are reviewed by (Yang &amp; Shen, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0193" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). A recent study showed that MERS‐CoV halts the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes, whereas inhibitors like S‐phase kinase‐associated protein 2 induced autophagy, which leads to the reduction of the replication of MERS‐CoV (Gassen et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Thus, it seems that a considerable relationship exists between the autophagy machinery and coronavirus infections; therefore, these relationships need to be elucidated in SARS‐CoV‐2 to understand disease prognosis and also to enhance autophagocytosis as a possible treatment corridor.
