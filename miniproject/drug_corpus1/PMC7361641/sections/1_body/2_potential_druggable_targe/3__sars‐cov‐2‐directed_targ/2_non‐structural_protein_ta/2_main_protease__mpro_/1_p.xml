<p>Two large overlapping replicase polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab), encoded by two linked ribosomal frameshift, are hydrolyzed by an extensive proteolytic action of viral proteases (Fehr &amp; Perlman, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Graham, Sparks, Eckerle, Sims, &amp; Denison, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>; Pillaiyar, Manickam, Namasivayam, Hayashi, &amp; Jung, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0136" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). One of the crucial viral proteases is the M
 <sup>pro</sup>, also known as 3C‐like proteinase or NSP5, which is a homodimeric cysteine protease belonging to the coronavirus polyprotein group (Fan et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). Automatic cleavage of polyproteins leads to the generation of M
 <sup>pro</sup>, which cleaves the large polyprotein 1ab at 11 cleavage sites to generate NSPs. The identification of cleaving sequence at most sites is Leu‐Gln↓(Ser, Ala, Gly) to release NSP4–NSP16 (Pillaiyar et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0136" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Yang et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0192" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>; Zhang, Penninger, Li, Zhong, &amp; Slutsky, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0197" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). M
 <sup>pro</sup> directly mediates the maturation of NSPs, which is critical for the initiation of the SARS‐CoV‐2 replication cycle and could, therefore, be a potential druggable target (Zhang, Wu, &amp; Zhang, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0200" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). For instance, pyridone‐containing α‐ketoamides inhibited the M
 <sup>pro</sup> activity showing early promise for the development of anti‐viral drugs (Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0199" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Moreover, more than a hundred PDB structures of SARS‐CoV‐2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> have already been deposited at the RCSB database (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.rcsb.org/</ext-link>) and more are being added regularly. Here, most of the structures were elucidated by Cryo‐electron microscopy, NMR or X‐ray crystallography, or even the high‐throughput network‐based inhibitor screening or direct ligand‐based study (Jin et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0081" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Vuong et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0175" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). While ligand‐based inhibitors screening leads to the determination of complexed crystal structure of SARS‐CoV‐2 M
 <sup>pro</sup>, this approach aids in the structure‐assisted drug design and high‐throughput screening for potential inhibitors (Jin et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0082" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). The inhibitors targeting SARS‐CoV‐2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> are virus‐specific and, therefore, will not interfere with host cell proteases (Bzówka et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>).
