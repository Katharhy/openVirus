<p>SARS‐CoV helicase (NSP13) is one of the 16 NSPs generated after the proteolytic cleavage of two large polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab). This helicase, being one of the components of the replicase–transcriptase complex, plays significant roles in the life cycle of SARS‐CoV (Marra et al.,

 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0162" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), which constitutes the basis of targeting this enzyme for the development of potential antiviral agent. Helicases are motor proteins that unwind double‐stranded nucleic acids into two single‐strands during replication (Adedeji et al.,

 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0154" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Moreover, NSP13 N‐terminus carries 26 cysteines where 14 positions are highly conserved and assumed to possess a binuclear Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>‐binding cluster (Seybert et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0146" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). Importantly, an antiviral compound Bananin, which is an adamantane derivative, has been reported to inhibit helicase activities, thereby preventing the replication of SARS‐CoV (; Tanner et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0166" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>) and can also be evaluated against SARS‐CoV‐2.
