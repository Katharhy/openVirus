<p>To find a potential therapy for SARS‐CoV‐2, a concrete understanding of potential drug targets is essential. Herein, we revisited a comprehensive list of SARS‐CoV‐2‐directed targets (M
 <sup>pro</sup>, PLpro, RdRp, spike protein, helicase, envelop protein) and host‐directed targets (ACE2, TMPRSS2, and immune system) that might hold promise for the development of potential therapy against SARS‐CoV‐2 infections (Figure
