<p>Although research communities have responded rapidly, still there is no vaccine or effective therapeutics for COVID‐19 (Harrison, 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0075" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Some of the existing antiviral drugs from other viral diseases, including Remdesivir, are being considered as repurposing medicine to treat COVID‐19 patients, which resulted in mixed outcomes (Gautret et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Molina et al., 
 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0127" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). It is, therefore, crucial to focus on alternative rational strategies for the development of urgent therapeutics to control the ongoing pandemic. Developing new therapeutic drugs and vaccines requires a proper understanding of the disease, the immune response pattern after infection, and the pathogenesis of the virus. To accelerate this effort, we present a scoping review summarizing the potential drug targets and therapeutics under trials by critically analyzing all relevant published literature on this field. This review would provide concrete evidence concerning the drug targets, previous use of the drugs, and early findings of possible drug mechanisms. Moreover, our review would provide insightful evidence for future SARS‐CoV‐2 research and might support researchers to discover a potential remedy.
