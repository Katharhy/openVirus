<p>COVID‐19 that was first surfaced in China has already emerged as a global pandemic with a total of 10,421,869 cases, including 508,422 deaths, as of June 30, 2020 (

COVID‐19 and the similar previous outbreaks such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) share common signs and symptoms, such as sore throat, persistent high fever, pneumonia with common pathologies, such as immune dysfunction, and multi‐organ failure (Andersen, Rambaut, Lipkin, Holmes, &amp; Garry,

 <xref rid="ddr21709-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Like other coronaviruses, SARS‐CoV‐2 possesses several structural and nonstructural proteins that are implicated in crucial cell functions (Ashour, Elkhatib, Rahman, &amp; Elshabrawy,

 <sup>pro</sup>), papain‐like protease (PLpro), RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) are among the nonstructural proteins that are critical for viral replication (Forster et al.,
