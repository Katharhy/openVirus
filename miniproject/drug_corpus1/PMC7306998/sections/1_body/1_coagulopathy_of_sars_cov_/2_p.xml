<p>While early descriptions of the coagulopathy identified it as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), in DIC, unlike in severe COVID-19, platelet count and PT prolongation correlate with sepsis severity and mortality, while fibrinogen and FDPs levels do not.

 </sup> And while the majority of patients who die from COVID-19 develop some laboratory evidence of DIC during their admission, elevations in D-dimer and prolonged PT with mild thrombocytopenia and normal fibrinogen are commonly seen.

 </sup> Thromboelastography in patients with COVID-19 in the ICU shows a hypercoagulable state.

 </sup> These observations suggest the underlying pathophysiology in at least a subset of critically ill patients with COVID-19 is distinct from traditional systemic DIC and may be due to a unique coagulopathy.
