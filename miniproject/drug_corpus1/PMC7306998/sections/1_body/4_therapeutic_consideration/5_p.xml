<p>One therapeutic candidate to treat COVID-19 is dipyridamole, an adenosinergic drug indicated for use as an arterial thromboembolic prophylaxis agent in combination with aspirin or warfarin.

 </sup> Dipyridamole has recently been shown to suppress human neutrophil and T-cell activation, upstream of cytokine effectors.

 </sup> Dipyridamole induces a type I interferon response, which is necessary for physiologic anti-viral activity, and inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication

 </sup> Administered orally, dipyridamole has a favorable safety profile, and a small clinical trial in patients with COVID-19 suggests it may improve D-dimer levels.

 </sup> Randomized clinical trials of agents active at the intersection of inflammation and coagulation in COVID-19, such as dipyridamole, t-PA, and heparin are necessary to determine if these therapeutics can restore the balance of inflammation and coagulation without dampening early or late physiologic anti-viral responses. The heterogenous response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection and the various time-dependent pathways driving pathology make universal therapies challenging. The temporal and mechanistic role each pathway plays in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection remains uncertain and requires further exploration for treatment opportunities as efforts to control this pandemic continue.
