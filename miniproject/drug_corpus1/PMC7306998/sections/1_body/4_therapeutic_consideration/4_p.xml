<p>There are over 300 trials ongoing for patients with COVID-19, many of which aim to simultaneously reduce inflammation and thrombosis, including cytokine-directed therapies (against IL-1, IL-6, interferon gamma), corticosteroids, Janus kinase inhibitors, TLR ligands, complement inhibitors, 
 <italic>N</italic>-acetylcysteine, serine protease inhibitors, DNAse enzymes, and anti-viral agents. However, suppressing the cytokine storm or hypercoagulability may be insufficient once initiated, and targeting upstream pathways to prevent activation of this self-amplifying feedback loop may be more effective.
