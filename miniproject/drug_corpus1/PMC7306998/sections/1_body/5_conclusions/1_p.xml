<p>In conclusion, in patients with COVID-19, the presence of coagulopathy, characterized by elevations in D-dimer and FDPs, is consistently associated with more severe illness and mortality. Laboratory, clinical, and early histopathologic findings suggest this coagulopathy is distinct from sepsis-induced DIC and may reflect dysregulated hemostasis. Similar findings have been associated with several other viral infections, and it remains uncertain if this coagulopathy is specific to SARS-CoV-2 or the end common pathway of the thrombo-inflammatory response to severe viral infections. There are efforts to target numerous components of the thrombo-inflammatory pathway to improve outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19. The optimal management for these patients including strategies to diagnose VTE, appropriate anticoagulation doses and duration, and effectiveness of novel therapies are under active investigation in the current pandemic.</p>
