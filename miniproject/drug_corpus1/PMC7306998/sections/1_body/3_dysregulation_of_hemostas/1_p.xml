<p>Thrombi in the pulmonary micro- and macrovasculature are observed in patients with ARDS with or without overt DIC, and changes consistent with a prothrombotic state have been found both in blood and in alveolar fluid studies of these patients.

 </sup> Higher levels of FDPs and D-dimer are seen in patients who developed ARDS as compared to patients with similar predisposing conditions that did not develop ARDS.

 </sup> Lower levels of protein C and higher levels of soluble thrombomodulin and PAI-1 are also associated with multiple organ failure, disease severity, and mortality in ARDS in some studies.

 </sup> Mechanistically, there is increased thrombin generation by tissue factor coupled with an impaired fibrinolytic response due to elevations in PAI-1. Elevations in D-dimer, a breakdown product of crosslinked fibrin, may result from residual t-PA/plasmin activity, as well as from alternative fibrinolytic pathways such as human neutrophil elastase activity.
