<p>Additional studies in SARS-CoV and influenza found dysregulation of urokinase, coagulation, and fibrinolysis pathways contributed to the severity of lung injury, possibly through altering the hemostatic balance with subsequent coagulation-induced ischemic injury.

 </sup> These groups hypothesized that increased fibrinolysis led to a positive feedback loop of vascular permeability, leukocyte recruitment, and fibrin generation. Interestingly, one hypothesis suggests that elevated plasminogen may be a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection because plasmin may cleave the S protein of the virus and increase its infectivity.

 </sup> These findings highlight the delicate balance between corralling infection and uncontrolled inflammation and thrombosis.
