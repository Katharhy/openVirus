 <p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has become a global threat to not only public health impacts but also clinical and economic outcomes. During the past decades, there have been many studies focusing on surveillance, mechanisms, and diagnostics of AMR in infectious diseases but the impacts on public health, clinical and economic outcomes due to emergence of these AMRs are rarely studied and reported. This review was aimed to summarize the findings from published studies to report the outcome impacts due to AMR of malaria, tuberculosis and HIV and briefly discuss the implications for application to other infectious diseases. PubMed/Medline and Google Scholar databases were used for search of empirical and peer-reviewed papers reporting public health, clinical and economic outcomes due to AMR of malaria, tuberculosis and HIV. Papers published through 1 December 2019 were included in this review. A total of 76 studies were included for this review, including 16, 49 and 11 on public health, clinical and economic outcomes, respectively. The synthesized data indicated that the emergence and spread of AMR of malaria, tuberculosis and HIV have resulted in adverse public health, clinical and economic outcomes. AMR of malaria, tuberculosis and HIV results in significant adverse impacts on public health, clinical and economic outcomes. Evidence from this review suggests the needs to consider the similar studies for other infectious diseases.</p>
