<p>Findings from the current review have important implications for planning studies to address the public health, clinical and economic outcome impacts in other infectious diseases including gonorrhea. 
 <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic>â€”a pathogen causing gonorrhea has shown the capacity to develop resistance to the antimicrobials introduced for treatment of this infection since sulphonamides was firstly introduced for treatment of gonorrhea in the 1930s. Currently, 
 <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> is resistant to most antimicrobials previously recommended for treatment and emergence of resistance to the third-generation extended-spectrum cephalosporins has been found in many settings [

 <xref rid="B96-ijerph-17-01395" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. No doubt efforts to improve surveillance programme for monitoring trends of gonococcal resistance, explore resistant mechanisms for responding to emergence of the resistance, and develop new antimicrobials for providing alternative treatment options are important. However, studies on outcome impacts due to gonococcal resistance are most needed to justify the investment to address the AMR in gonorrhea. However, evidence from studies on outcome impacts of gonococcal resistance [

 <xref rid="B98-ijerph-17-01395" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>] is relatively limited. Actually, investment to control of gonorrhea is disproportionately lower than many of other infectious diseases [

This consideration has been firstly highlighted in China and included into its comprehensive ROADMAP plan to address research needs for gonococcal AMR [
