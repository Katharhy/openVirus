<p>It is well noted that the emergence of AMR or spread of resistant strain might result in a failure or delay to eliminate the infection, affecting the likelihood of onward transmission [

Regarding public health or epidemiological outcomes due to AMR, evidences were mostly obtained from population-based cohort studies or cross-sectional studies before 2000. However, mathematical models were increasingly used to predict the public health burden due to AMR in recent years. Background data and assumption parameters are critical for development of the models and outcomes predicted from the models. For example, in a San Francisco cohort of gay men discrepancies regarding the epidemics of drug-resistant HIV were found from model predictions. These differences in levels of resistance and effects on HIV incidence might be due to different time horizons, different model assumptions and other extraordinary factors or new events, such as vaccines, diagnostic tools, and policy changes [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-17-01395" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Built upon current disease estimates and trend assumptions, considering the source, course and transmission of infection, and taking other major forces into account, models have the potential to be particularly valuable in predicting the public health outcomes of drug resistance and the future disease burden. The relationship between the emergence of drug resistance in patients and the risk of clinical outcomes has been subject to various analyses from cohort studies. Antimicrobial-resistant organisms affect patient outcomes in several ways. Treatment factors including delay in appropriate antimicrobial treatment, decreased antimicrobial effectiveness, increased antimicrobial toxicity, improper antimicrobial dosing and/or increased need for surgery and other invasive procedures may contribute to adverse outcomes in patients infected with these organisms [
 <xref rid="B94-ijerph-17-01395" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Despite of the use of different methods of analysis as well as other factors, the results of studies included in this review have shown that patients with infections caused by drug-resistant organism generally had an increased risk of worse clinical outcomes and death, than patients infected with the same organism not demonstrating the resistance pattern. However, many studies were conducted in single institution and had small sample size. Future studies estimating clinical outcomes of antimicrobial-resistant infections should address the methodological limitations by using large patient populations in multicentre settings or by using large administrative datasets. There was a wide range of cost estimates across the studies probably because of the differences in economic background in study population and areas, methodologies used to collect the data and estimate the costs, comparator (infection susceptible to antimicrobials, or no infection) to be used for estimating additional cost, and study settings. Despite of these, additional expenditure resulted from emergence and spread of AMR was consistently reported in many of these studies. The economic burden of antimicrobial-resistant organisms can be assessed from a number of different perspectives, including that of society, the hospital, a third-paid party, a government agency or the patient [
 <xref rid="B94-ijerph-17-01395" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Most studies in this review did not attempt to measure the cost of resistance from a societal perspective (including all the economic impacts on patients, physicians, health care providers, third-party buyers, drug manufacturers, and overall societal welfare), making the true economic burden of antimicrobial-resistant infections difficult to quantify accurately. To better quantify the economic repercussions of AMR, future studies should consider costs from multiple perspectives [
