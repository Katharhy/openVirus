<p>There are several limitations to this narrative review. First, we only included two databases in our search. Second, our search strategy did not extend to grey literature, and were unable to rule out publication bias. Third, due to wide variations in study design, publication years and populations, it is hard for us to make a pooled estimate of AMR outcome for each disease and consequently to do comparisons in terms of AMR outcome impacts among these three diseases, which also points towards the need for more harmonised methods to assess public health, clinical and economic outcome impacts due to AMR among different infectious diseases.</p>
