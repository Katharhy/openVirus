<p>Based on a mathematical model that charted the evolution of drug-resistant HIV from 1996 to 2005 in a San Francisco (CA, USA) cohort of gay men, Blower et al. predicted that drug resistance would reach a high prevalence in developing countries, but that these epidemics of drug-resistant HIV would be driven by resistance acquired within individuals during therapy and not by transmission of resistant strains. Transmitted drug resistance had not increased - and the model predictions revealed that it would not increase - the annual incidence rate in San Francisco. Hence, the results indicated that transmission of resistant strains would be only a minor public health problem in San Francisco [

However, in another San Francisco-study presented in 2010 describing an identical population, a theoretical model (the amplification cascade model) revealed that 60% of the resistant strains being transmitted in San Francisco were capable of causing self-sustaining epidemics, and that an individual with an NNRTI-resistant strain can cause, on average, more than one new resistant infection. Consequently, the circulating NNRTI-resistant strains in San Francisco might pose a great and immediate threat to global public health [

In sub-Saharan Africa, a Spectrum Goals fast-track model was developed to project the average impact of HIV drug resistance on AIDS deaths and new infections between 2016 and 2030. Results indicated that in a situation where pretreatment drug-resistance levels were generally below 10%, drug resistance was responsible for an estimated 710,000 AIDS deaths and 380,000 new infections by 2030. If levels of pretreatment drug resistance are over 10%, the impact was greater, with an estimated 890 000 AIDS deaths and 450 000 new infections by 2030 attributable to HIV drug resistance [
