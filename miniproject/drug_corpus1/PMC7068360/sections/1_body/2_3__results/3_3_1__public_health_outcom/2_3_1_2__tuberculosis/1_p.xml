<p>An outbreak of TB in schools of United States caused by 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> resistant to isoniazid, streptomycin, and para-aminosalicylic acid was reported in 1976. And retrospective investigation revealed that the school outbreak was part of an ongoing community outbreak dating back at least to 1964 [

During 2008â€“2015, an outbreak of isoniazid-resistant TB with a unique genotype began in Atlanta and spread nationally quickly, provided a warning about the ongoing potential for long-lasting and far-reaching outbreaks, particularly among high-risk populations with untreated HIV co-infection, mental illness, substance abuse, and homelessness [

A dynamic state transition model constructed in China showed that by 2050, incidence, prevalence and mortality of Drug-sensitive TB (DS-TB) would decrease by 32%, 50% and 41%, respectively, whereas MDR-TB would increase by respectively 60%, 48% and 35%. Reduction in DS-TB is a result of high treatment and cure rates leading to a decrease in the prevalence of latent tuberculous infection (LTBI), while the increase in MDR-TB is attributed to inappropriate treatment, leading to high transmission of infection and increased LTBI prevalence [

Another compartmental model forecasted the percentage of MDR-TB among incident cases of TB to increase, reaching 12.4% in India, 8.9% in the Philippines, 32.5% in Russia, and 5.7% in South Africa in 2040. It also predicted the percentage of XDR-TB among incident MDR-TB to increase, reaching 8.9% in India, 9.0% in the Philippines, 9.0% in Russia, and 8.5% in South Africa in 2040. As prevalence of DR-TB increased, the primary driver of incident DR-TB shifted from acquired drug resistance during treatment to transmission to contacts of individuals with DR-TB, leading to spread of MDR and XDR tuberculosis [
