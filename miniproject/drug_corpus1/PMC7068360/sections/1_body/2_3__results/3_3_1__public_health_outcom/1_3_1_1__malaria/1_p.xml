<p>There were two reports that identified drug resistance as the major reason for the occurrence of a malaria epidemic. In Balcad (Somalia), a town with previously low malaria transmission, the incidence of malaria rose more than 20-fold between 1986 and 1988 and the emergence of chloroquine resistance, coupled with favorable meteorological conditions, was identified as the cause [

 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine was observed in 1990s, an ecological study was conducted in South Africa to assess the association between malaria incidence and the emergence and degree of the resistance to this first-line antimalarial treatment from 1991 to 2001. The data showed that when resistance of P. falciparum to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine was greater than 10%, the risk ratio for malaria infection was 5.9 compared to the low resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine period. And the risk of death from malaria was 10.8 and case fatality 1.8 times higher after drug resistance had reached 10%, than before [

Since the first two cases of artemisinin resistance were confirmed in Cambodia in 2006, foci of either suspected or confirmed artemisinin resistance have been identified in a few countries. An individual-based malaria transmission model predicted that artemisinin and partner drug resistance at levels similar to those observed in Oddar Meanchey Province in Cambodia could result in an additional 78 million cases over a 5-year period (2016â€“2020) in Africa, a 7% increase in cases compared to a scenario with no resistance [
