<p>If ineffective first-line treatments were used at health centers and hospital, the time to symptom resolution may be protracted. For example, in Papua New Guinea, the treatment failures for the 28-day follow-up period were 3.8 times more common in 1999 than in 1996, and during the 29â€“42-day follow-up period 3.8 times more likely in 2002 than in 1991, which were ascribed to the increasing parasite resistance to standard treatment with chloroquine and amodiaquin [

As resistance increases, there would be an increase in the number of patients who present with severe malaria, thus case fatality rate would rise. Retrospective and prospective hospital-based studies in various African countries had documented significant increase (from 2- to 11-fold) in admissions for severe malaria and malaria deaths when chloroquine resistance developed and spread [

In a study among pregnant women and newborn infants in Timika, it was found that in those with history of malaria during pregnancy, the increasing use of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, the first-line malaria treatment instead of chloroquine [
 <xref rid="B91-ijerph-17-01395" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], was associated with a 54% fall in the proportion of maternal malaria at delivery and a 98% decrease in congenital malaria. Also, the change to more effective treatment was associated with an absolute 2% reduction of maternal severe anaemia and absolute 4.5% decrease in low birth weight babies [
