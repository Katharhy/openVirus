<p>According to the WHO guidelines, there are six treatment outcomes in patients with TB: cured, treatment completed, died, treatment failed, defaulted, and transferred [

 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-17-01395" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. A retrospective study reported a relative risk of death of 1.9 among patients with rifampicin resistance compared with those with pan-susceptible group [
 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-17-01395" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Five studies reported an increase (from 1.4- to 12.4-fold) of poor treatment outcomes (death, failure or default from TB therapy) in isoniazid mono-resistance patients compared to isoniazid sensitive case [

 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-17-01395" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Patients with MDR-TB had considerably poorer clinical outcomes than if they developed disease due to drug-susceptible strains. Compared with susceptible cases, a significant increase (from 3- to 395-fold) in unfavorable outcomes was recorded among MDR-TB cases [

 <xref rid="B66-ijerph-17-01395" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Using country as the unit of analysis, an ecologic study showed that failure rates averaged 5.0%, and recurrence rates averaged 12.8% in the 20 countries where prevalence of initial MDR exceeded 3%, compared with an average of 1.6% and 8.1%, respectively, in 83 countries where initial MDR prevalence was less than 3% [
 <xref rid="B67-ijerph-17-01395" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In a meta-analysis, it showed a stepwise worsening of treatment outcomes in MDR-TB cases treated in multiple centers as the resistance pattern of infecting TB strains advanced from MDR without additional resistance, to added resistance to a second-line injectable drug, to a fluoroquinolone, and then to both (XDR-TB). The study reported that compared with poor treatment outcomes, treatment success was higher in MDR-TB patients infected with strains without additional resistance (64%) or with resistance to second-line injectable drugs only (56%), than in those having resistance to fluoroquinolones alone (48%) or to fluoroquinolones plus second-line injectable drugs (40%) [
