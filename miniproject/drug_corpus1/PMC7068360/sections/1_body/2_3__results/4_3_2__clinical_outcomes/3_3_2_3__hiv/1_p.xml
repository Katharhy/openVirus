<p>When using antiretroviral drugs as therapies for HIV-infected individuals, the antiretroviral treatment was considered efficient if the viral load decreases or remained undetectable (&lt;50 copies/mL). The emergence of drug resistance, however, was reported to influence the virological response. In a study from Canada, it found that baseline drug resistance phenotype was predictive of poor virological response to dual protease inhibitor combination. Patients were at least four times less likely to achieve a decrease in plasma HIV RNA viral load if their viral isolates were resistant to ritonavir or saquinavir [

Using the Stanford HIVdb algorithm, which assigns genotypic sensitivity score (GSS) of 1.00, 0.75, 0.50, 0.25 and 0.00 to the five levels of resistance (susceptible, potential low-level, low-level, intermediate-level and high-level resistance, respectively), a study from Taiwan found that compared with regimens with GSS &gt;2.5, initiation of regimens with GSS â‰¤2.5 was associated with a higher treatment failure rate (39.3% versus 15.7%) and shorter time to treatment failure [

Studies from multiple countries have documented the association between drug resistance and an increased risk of death or new AIDS defining event/death. The 48-month proportion of patients with none, one, two or three class-wide resistance were 8.9, 11.7, 13.4 and 27.1%, respectively, for death; 6.1, 9.9, 13.4 and 21.5%, respectively, for AIDS-related death; and 16.0, 17.7, 19.3 and 35.9%, respectively, for new AIDS event/death [

 <xref rid="B77-ijerph-17-01395" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Detection of drug resistance, particularly if extended to all three drug classes was related to poorer clinical outcome and represented a risk-marker of disease progression and death.
