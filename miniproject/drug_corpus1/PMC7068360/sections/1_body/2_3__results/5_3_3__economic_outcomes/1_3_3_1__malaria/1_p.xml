<p>In areas with high rates of chloroquine-resistance, physicians and governments have changed empiric therapy for malaria, increasing overall treatment costs. Phillips and Phillips-Howard calculated that the use of quinine versus chloroquine as first-line therapy in 150 million patients with malaria would increase spending by as much as $100 million [

When physicians use ineffective drugs as empiric therapy, resistance will manifest itself clinically as treatment failure, and costs, morbidity, and mortality will be greater for patients with infections due to resistant organisms than for patients with infections due to susceptible organisms. Based on a decision tree model applied to all malaria-endemic countries using their specific estimates for malaria incidence, transmission intensity and GDP, Lubell et al. projected an excess of 116,000 deaths annually in the scenario of widespread artemisinin resistance. And the predicted medical costs for retreatment of clinical failures and for management of severe malaria exceed $32 million per year. Productivity losses resulting from excess morbidity and mortality were estimated at $385 million for each year during which failing ACT remained in use as first-line treatment [
