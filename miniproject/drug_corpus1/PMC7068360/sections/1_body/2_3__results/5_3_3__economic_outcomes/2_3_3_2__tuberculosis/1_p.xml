<p>A South African cost analysis showed that the per-patient cost of XDR-TB was $26,392, four times greater than MDR-TB ($6772), and 103 times greater than DS-TB ($257). Despite DR-TB comprising only 2.2% of the case burden, it consumed ~32% of the total estimated 2011 national TB budget of US $218 million [

In South America, a study from Ecuador found that total non-MDR-TB related patient costs averaged $960 per patient, compared to an average total cost of $6880 for MDR-TB patients, which represented respectively 31% and 223% of the average Ecuadorian annual income [

In North America, a US study States showed that average hospitalization cost per XDR-TB patient ($285,000) was 3.5 times that per MDR-TB patient ($81,000). Hospitalization episode costs for MDR-TB ranked third highest and those for XDR-TB highest among 262 principal diagnosis categories [

Another retrospective study reported that total direct costs averaged $430,000 per XDR-TB patient, three times greater than MDR-TB ($13,000), and 25 times greater than non-MDR TB ($17,000). Direct-plus-productivity-loss costs averaged $554,000 per XDR-TB patient, two times greater than MDR-TB patient ($260,000). Applying these averages to 364 cases of MDR-TB and nine cases of XDR-TB in the US during 2005–2007, direct costs were ≈ $53 million and direct-plus-productivity-loss costs were ≈ $100 million [
