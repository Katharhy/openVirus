<p>Only one study reported healthcare costs associated with antiretroviral drug resistance. The study from Canada reported that patients with no resistance had mean per patient per month (PPPM) costs of Canadian dollars (CDN) 1058, by contrast with the CDN 1291 costs of patients with secondary/acquired resistance. And the mean costs increased by number of resistant classes: mean costs for one, two or three ARV class resistance was CDN 1278, 1337 and 1801, respectively [

Considering that treatment failure and switching may follow from the development of drug resistance, studies of the costs due to treatment failure or treatment changes could potentially be extrapolated to represent the costs of resistance [

In a separate study presented in 2010, over a follow-up period of up to 60 months, total mean healthcare costs were $35,000 higher for patients on a 3rd- or greater line treatment regimen compared to patients on a 1st- or 2nd-line treatment regimen [
