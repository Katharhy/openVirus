<p>A literature search was conducted to identify articles published through 1 December 2019 that involved studies on outcome impacts due to AMR of malaria, TB and HIV. The public health outcome was defined as the adverse outcome in terms of increasing transmission and spread of the prolonged infection due to AMR. The clinical outcome was defined as the adverse outcome in terms of increasing treatment failure, mortality and other complications due to AMR. The economic outcome was defined as the adverse outcome in terms of increasing healthcare costs and productivity-loss costs due to AMR. The following terms were used to search articles in PubMed/Medline: (“drug resistance” [MeSH Terms]) AND (malaria [MeSH Terms] OR tuberculosis [MeSH Terms] OR “HIV infections” [MeSH Terms]) AND (“outcome impacts” [All Fields] OR outcome [All Fields] OR impacts [All Fields]). Search of Google Scholar was conducted with the following search strategy: (malaria or tuberculosis or “HIV infections”) AND “drug resistance” AND “outcome”. Titles and abstracts of retrieved records were first screened for inclusion in a full text review. The full texts of potentially relevant studies were then examined to confirm inclusion based on eligibility criteria. We included the articles to meet the following criteria: (a) cross-sectional studies, prospective studies, retrospective studies, case-control studies, meta-analysis, empirical and peer-reviewed studies; (b) at least an abstract with estimates and/or full results published in English; (c) investigate public health, clinical or economic outcomes of AMR of malaria, TB and HIV. The reference list of included articles and relevant systematic reviews were also examined to identify any studies that may have been missed. Commentaries, conference presentations or letter to editors were excluded from this review. The quality of each included article was assesses using the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies [
 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-17-01395" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The articles finally included into this review were subsequently categorized according to disease (malaria, tuberculosis and HIV) field of interest (public health, clinical and economic outcomes). Due to wide variation in study designs and populations, we summarized the results of each included article narratively.
