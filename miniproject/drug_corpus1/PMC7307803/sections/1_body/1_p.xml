<p>Before moving the spotlight to the Yemeni case, it is useful to provide an overview of the available COVID-19 testing technologies. As soon as the full genome sequences of SARS-COV-2 became available, several in-house assays based on reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) were developed by leading health institutions [
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Within months afterwards, hundreds of commercial diagnostic kits were registered with the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) for validation by WHO partner laboratories [
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and several received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These kits fall into two main categories: molecular and immunological assays [
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Molecular assays, predominantly RT-PCR, are based on detecting amplified virus-specific RNA sequences, which makes them highly sensitive. They are currently the gold-standard for COVID-19 testing. Immunological assays are further classified into two types: one works by identifying antibodies produced in response to infection (also called indirect or serological tests); the other is designed to detect viral proteins (direct or antigen detection tests). Since it can take up to 20 days for COVID-19 patients to make detectable antibodies [
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], antibodies-assays are primarily useful for surveillance of the recovered rather than active cases diagnosis. They could help obtain estimates of mortality rates and make decisions about reopening the economy. On the other hand, antigen kits, just like RT-PCR, can be used for diagnosis of early infection. These kits can be a cost-effective alternative to RT-PCR, especially in resource limited settings such as countries with underdeveloped laboratories and health care systems as they can be used as point-of-care rapid tests [

 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The FDA has just authorized the first COVID-19 rapid antigen test [
