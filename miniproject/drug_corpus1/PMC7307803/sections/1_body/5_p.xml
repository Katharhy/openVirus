<p>We recognize that antigen-detection kits may have suboptimal sensitivity, especially in samples with low viral load [
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]; however, their diagnostic ability can be 
 <underline>supplemented</underline> with antibodies tests, as antibodies can still be detectable in up to 50% of the patients within the first 7 days [
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Serology tests can also be used for targeted screening of health care providers to identify those who developed immunity and can thus serve in the frontlines. However, they have to be selected with extreme care: in a very recent comparative study, only 3 out of 14 kits investigated were found to provide reliable results [
