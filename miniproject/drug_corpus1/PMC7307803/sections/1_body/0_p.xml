<p>When news came in from China about a new coronavirus, no one anticipated the situation we are facing today: a pandemic paralyzing the global economy, billions of people staying at home, and health care systems on the verge of collapse even in developed countries. The latter has been particularly amplified by the lack of treatment protocols as well as shortages of ventilators and ICU beds. One can only imagine how devastating the pandemic would be in poor countries, especially those involved in armed conflicts, where the health care system faces additional challenges, including lack of adequate testing to identify infected cases. While this is applicable to many countries in the region, the scenario is worst in Yemen. The country has been fragmented by war, devastated by a five-year long blockade, and has not yet recovered from deadly cholera and diphtheria epidemics that started in 2016. The aim of this commentary is to highlight the unique challenges of COVID-19 testing in Yemen and propose potential solutions.</p>
