<p>While WHO with the local authorities continue to work on scaling up the RT-PCR testing capacity, testing coverage is not expected to significantly improve. It is time, therefore, to seriously consider introducing immunological tests as potential alternatives to RT-PCR to be used on a large scale. Immunological kits are cheap and do not require specialized training. Additionally, they work with common laboratory platforms (eg, ELISA) or can be used as point-of-care tests (eg, lateral flow assays) [

It should be WHOâ€™s priority to support companies with development and validation of rapid antigen tests, and ensure poor countries have early access to them. As mentioned above, the FDA has just granted EUA for the first COVID-19 rapid antigen test, which highlights the need for such kits not only in resource-limited settings but also in developed countries where they will alleviate the pressure on hospitals and specialized laboratories.
