<p>This is particularly problematic as PCR testing in conflict zones in likely to face many obstacles. RT-PCR is laborious, technique-sensitive and requires expertise for assay setup and interpretation of results. This is unlikely to be achieved given the short time and limited training provided by WHO. Due to frequent power outages, the stability and performance of the temperature-sensitive RT-PCR reagents could be compromised. Yemen also has a poor road network that has been largely destroyed by bombing, which makes the timely transporting of samples to reference laboratories extremely difficult.</p>
