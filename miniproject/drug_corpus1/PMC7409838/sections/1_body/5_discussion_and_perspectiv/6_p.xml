<p id="p0330">Further analyses of the previous studies on 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors in association with the booming research on PROTACs [
 <xref rid="bib99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] have led to the emergence of the following drug development ideologies. PROTAC technology can be used in the design of anti-coronavirus drugs that induce the intracellular degradation of functional nsps of exogenous viruses. The principle of PROTAC technology involves the use of a bifunctional small molecule to links the target protein and the E3 ligase in the cell such that the target protein is ubiquitinated, and the ubiquitinated protein is then recognized by the proteasome, which leads to degradation of the target protein [
 <xref rid="bib101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. To date, various endogenous proteins, such as BTK, PARP1, HDAC6, AR, ER, BET, BRD4, BRD9, RIPK2, TBK1, Sirt2, CDK9, p38α, pirin, c-Met, EGFR, FAK, and FLT3, have been reportedly degraded using PROTAC technology [
 <xref rid="bib102" ref-type="bibr">[102]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib103" ref-type="bibr">[103]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib104" ref-type="bibr">[104]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib105" ref-type="bibr">[105]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib106" ref-type="bibr">[106]</xref>]. However, the application of PROTAC technology for the degradation of foreign proteins (such as viral proteins) remains in its infancy. To date, only the NS3/4A protease degrader DGY-08-097 of HCV has been reported, and its antiviral activity and resistance characteristics are significantly superior to those of the traditional drug telaprevir [
 <xref rid="bib107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. Thus, we propose that the existing 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors can be combined with PROTAC technology to develop coronavirus 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> PROTACs. These PROTAC degraders could exhibit the advantages of both occupancy-driven 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors and those of event-driven PROTACs: low-dose exposure would result in multiple rounds of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> degradation and would avoid the intracellular accumulation of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> in infected cells. These procedures would completely block the biological function of coronavirus 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> and its downstream viral proteins and would therefore inhibit the assembly and replication of the coronavirus in infected cells (shown in 
 <xref rid="fig20" ref-type="fig">Fig. 20</xref> ). Reversible covalent PROTACs for 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> have been designed and synthesized in our laboratory for further screening, and we expect that these inhibitors will overcome the shortcomings of traditional 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors and take advantage of the degradation effects of PROTACs.
