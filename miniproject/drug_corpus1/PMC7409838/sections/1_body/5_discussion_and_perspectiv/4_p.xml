<p id="p0320">Correspondingly, noncovalent reversible 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors mainly exhibit weak reversible binding (such as hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, and hydrophobic forces) with the amino acid residues in the S1, S2, and S4 pockets, which sometimes includes the catalytically active Cys145 in the S1’ pocket. This weak reversible binding could result in avoidance of the off-target risk and toxicity of irreversible inhibitors, and thus, these inhibitors might be suitable for long-term administration. Among the nonpeptidic reversible inhibitors, 
 <bold>55–59</bold>, which contain a piperidine moiety, and 
 <bold>54a-54f</bold>, which contain unsymmetrical aromatic disulphides, demonstrate excellent inhibitory activity. Some natural products and derivatives, such as isatin [

 <bold>46a, 54a, 74d</bold> and 
 <bold>75c</bold> are noncovalent SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors with a medium molecular weight and good antiviral activity and can potentially be utilized as lead templates for further drug design and screening.
