<p id="p0310">As the cases of SASR-CoV-2 infections continue to rise, the development of effective drugs and vaccines for the targeted treatment of COVID-19 is becoming increasingly urgent. Among the few available targets for anti-coronavirus drug development, 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, which is a key protein involved in the replication and transcription of coronaviruses, has become an important and relatively mature drug target in anti-coronavirus drug research. In addition, the SASR-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> crystal structure (PDB code: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:6LU7" id="intref0040" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">6LU7</ext-link>) is the first non-structural functional protein of SASR-CoV-2 that has a confirmed conserved structure compared with those of SASR and MERS 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>s. Thus, broad-spectrum coronavirus 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors are particularly suitable for the treatment of current and future coronavirus epidemics. The present article reviews the research progress on coronavirus 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors discovered from various sources over the past 10 years (2010â€“2020), including synthetic peptidomimetic and nonpeptidic inhibitors and natural product derivatives, and attempts to provide a complete description of the structural characteristics of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors, including details on their binding modes and other related information.
