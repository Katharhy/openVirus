<p id="p0205">Among these peptidomimetic inhibitors, the aldehyde compounds 
 <bold>11</bold> and 
 <bold>12</bold> and the α-ketoamide compounds 
 <bold>25–27</bold> showed good inhibitory activity against the current SARS-CoV-2. Compounds 
 <bold>11</bold> and 
 <bold>12</bold>, which as novel inhibitors designed and synthesized for SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> by Hong Liu and his colleagues [
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], demonstrate excellent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> (
 <bold>11</bold>: IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.053 ± 0.005 μM, 
 <bold>12</bold>: IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.040 ± 0.002 μM). Moreover, in vitro antiviral activity assays have indicated that both compounds exert potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects, with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.53 μM and 0.72 μM, respectively, and both 
 <bold>11</bold> and 
 <bold>12</bold> exhibit good 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> pharmacokinetic properties and an acceptable preliminary safety profile and have the potential to be new anti-SARS-CoV-2 preclinical candidates. Based on an analysis of the substrate binding pocket of SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> (PDB CODE: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:2H2Z" id="intref0010" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">2H2Z</ext-link>), an aldehyde was selected as the warhead in P1 that would form a covalent bond with cysteine. A detailed diagram of the interaction between compound 
 <bold>11</bold> and SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> shows that the aldehyde carbonyl of 
 <bold>11</bold> and the catalytic site Cys145 of SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> form a standard C–S covalent bond (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> -A). The oxygen atom of the aldehyde group forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone of the Cys145 residue at the S1’ site, which is crucial for stabilizing the binding conformation. The (
 <italic>S</italic>)-γ-lactam ring at P1 is in good agreement with the S1 site, and the oxygen atom of the (
 <italic>S</italic>)-γ-lactam group forms a hydrogen bond with the His163 side chain, the main chain of Phe140 and the side chain of Glu166 and also forms a hydrogen bond with the NH group of the (
 <italic>S</italic>)-γ-lactam ring. The cyclohexyl part at the P2 position can be inserted into the S2 position and stacks with the imidazole ring of His41. The indole group at the P3 position is exposed to the solvent (S4 site) and forms a hydrogen bond with Glu166. Interestingly, multiple water molecules (named W1–W6) play important roles in the binding of 
 <bold>11</bold>: W1 interacts with the amide bond of 
 <bold>11</bold> through hydrogen bonding, whereas W2–W6 form a few hydrogen bonds with the aldehyde group of 
 <bold>11</bold> and the residues Asn142, Gly143, Thr26, Thr25, His41 and Cys44, which contribute to the stability of the binding pocket of 
 <bold>11</bold>. The binding mode of compound 
 <bold>12</bold> is very similar to that of 
 <bold>11</bold> (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>-B). The difference in their binding modes might be due to the 3-fluorophenyl at the P2 position of compound 
 <bold>12</bold>. The side chains of the residues His41, Met49, Met165, Val186, Asp187 and Arg188 interact with the aryl group through hydrophobic interactions, and the side chain of Gln189 stabilizes 3-fluorophenyl via additional hydrogen bonding.
