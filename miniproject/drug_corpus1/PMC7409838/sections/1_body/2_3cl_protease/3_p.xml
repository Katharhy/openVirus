 <sup>pro</sup> is highly conserved among the known coronavirus species, and several common features are shared among the different coronavirus 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> substrates. From the N to the C terminus, the amino acids in the substrates are numbered as -P4-P3-P2-P1↓P1′-P2′-P3’-), and the cleavage site is located between P1 and P1’ [
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In particular, a Gln residue is almost always required in the P1 position of the substrates. Humans do not have a homologous 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, which makes 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> an ideal specific antiviral target. SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are significantly different from MERS-CoV in terms of cell invasion characteristics (the S protein of MERS-CoV utilizes DPP4 as a receptor). Nevertheless, amino acid sequence alignments indicate that the similarity of the 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>s of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can be as high as 96.1% [
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Further sequence comparisons have revealed that the 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>s of the three coronaviruses of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV exhibits a high degree of structural similarity and conservatism (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> ) [
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. These findings indicate that 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> could be used as a homologous target for the development of anti-coronavirus drugs that can inhibit the proliferation of various coronaviruses.
