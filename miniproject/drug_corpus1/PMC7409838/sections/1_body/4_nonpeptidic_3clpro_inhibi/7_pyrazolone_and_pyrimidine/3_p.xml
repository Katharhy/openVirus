<p id="p0280">Another series of 2-(benzylthio)-6-oxo-4-phenyl-1,6-dihydropyrimidines (
 <bold>75a-75f</bold>) also showed encouraging results as new anti-SARS hits [
 <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. The cytotoxicity of the test compounds was assessed using the MTT assay, and all the compounds were devoid of cytotoxicity. Further SAR studies revealed that compound 
 <bold>75c</bold>, which has a nitro at the C-4 position, is the most potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 6.1 μM). The moderate electron-withdrawing substituent at R
 <sub>l</sub>, such as chloro, in compounds 
 <bold>75c</bold> and 
 <bold>75d</bold> improved the inhibitory activity compared with the presence of electron-donating groups, such as methyl and methoxy groups (as shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> ). Molecular docking results have illustrated (docking study of 
 <bold>75c</bold> with PDB code:

The orientation of the ligand has a nitro phenyl group situated in the S1 pocket, and the nitro group points towards the surface of the protein. The oxygen of the nitro group forms a hydrogen bond with Gly143 and Cys145, and the chlorophenyl ring fits into the S2 pocket and forms hydrophobic interactions with Met49 and Gln189.
