<p id="p0270">Based on the embedding of the substrate recognition pocket of the SARS 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> R188I mutant (PDB code: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:3AW1" id="intref0030" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">3AW1</ext-link>), the isoserine skeleton was found to exhibit a more reasonable interaction with the mutant 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, resulting in the isoserine derivative (
 <italic>R</italic>)-
 <bold>66</bold>, which might be obtained by replacing the amine group at the α-position and adding a hydroxy group at the β-position of 
 <bold>65</bold>. The docking simulation of (
 <italic>R</italic>)-
 <bold>66</bold> with SARS 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> revealed a hydrophobic space on the S2 pocket of the R188I mutant protease. Compared with hydrophobic functional groups (such as alkane, cycloalkane and aromatic rings), the phenyl group was more suitable for insertion into the S2 pocket of the R188I mutant protease; therefore, (2
 <italic>R</italic>,3
 <italic>S</italic>)-phenylisoserine (PIS) derivative 
 <bold>67</bold> was obtained and selected as a candidate compound. A SAR study of the PIS derivative and the corresponding S1′ pocket revealed that the inclusion of a cinnamic derivative (
 <bold>68a, 68b</bold>) or a phenyl propionate derivative (
 <bold>68c</bold>) at the P1’ position elevated the inhibitory activity, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 65 to 75 μM (
 <xref rid="fig17" ref-type="fig">Fig. 17</xref> ). In addition, cyclohexyl rings are essential to the P1 function of PIS scaffolds, whereas the cinnamyl functional group at P4 can effectively maintain the inhibitory strength.
