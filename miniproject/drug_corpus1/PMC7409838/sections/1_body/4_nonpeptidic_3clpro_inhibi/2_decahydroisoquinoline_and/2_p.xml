<p id="p0215">Inspired by the interaction of the peptide inhibitor 
 <bold>28</bold> between S1 and S2 of SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, Shimamoto Yasuhiro et al. [
 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] designed and synthesized a series of competitive SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors (compounds 
 <bold>29a-29d</bold>, 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> ) with a decahydroisoquinoline fused ring scaffold. All synthetic decahydroquinoline inhibitors exhibited moderate to significant inhibition of SARS 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. According to X-ray crystallography (PDB CODE: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:4TWY" id="intref0015" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">4TWY</ext-link>, 
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> ), the fused ring structure of dehydroquinoline occupies most of the space in the S2 pocket. X-ray crystallography analyses have confirmed that the decahydroisoquinoline inhibitor is located in the fissure of the active centre of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, similar to the results obtained with the high-efficiency peptide-aldehyde lead compound. The decahydroisoquinoline scaffold was inserted into a large S2 pocket and filled most of the pocket space. As expected, the imidazole at the P1 site was inserted into the S1 pocket. These interactions effectively fixed the terminal aldehyde in the fissure of the active centre, and the new scaffold thus closely fit to the 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. Acyl groups on nitrogen atoms in decahydroisoquinoline scaffolds are located on the surface of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, where additional interactions might occur with 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. These interactions effectively fixed the terminal aldehyde tightly at the active site, resulting in a novel decahydroquinoline scaffold that cooperates closely with 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. To evaluate the effect of the configuration on the dehydroisoquinoline scaffold, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of trans-decahydroisoquinolin diastereomers in 
 <italic>N</italic>-4-phenylbenzoyl derivatives (
 <bold>29a</bold> vs 
 <bold>29b</bold>) or 
 <italic>N</italic>-4-bromo benzoyl derivatives (
 <bold>29c</bold> vs 
 <bold>29d</bold>) have been compared, and the results clearly showed that the (4a
 <italic>R</italic>,8a
 <italic>S</italic>) isomer is more potent than the (4a
 <italic>S</italic>,8a
 <italic>R</italic>) isomer.
