<p id="p0230">Jacobs et al. [
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] conducted a high-throughput screening of National Institute of Health (NIH) molecular libraries (approximately 293,000 compounds) to find hits of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors. The analysis of a dipeptide compound library identified 
 <bold>39</bold> (
 <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref> -A), which had an IC
 <sub>50</sub> less than 10 μM and was thus considered an exceptionally good candidate. Thus, a series of 3-pyridyl derivatives were subsequently optimized based on hit 
 <bold>39</bold>, and the resulting compounds 
 <bold>40a</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.2 μM) and 
 <bold>40b</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.1 μM) exhibited compelling inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. The X-ray crystal structure of 
 <bold>
  <italic>(R)</italic>-40a
 </bold> combined with SARS-CoV 3CL 
 <sup>pro</sup> (
 <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11</xref> ) demonstrated that 
 <bold>
  <italic>(R)</italic>-40a
 </bold> preferentially occupied the S1′-S3 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> subpockets. According to the identified binding mode, tert-butyl amide occupies the S3 pocket, the tert-butyl anilido group occupies a deep S2 pocket, and the 3-pyridyl group occupies the S1 pocket.
