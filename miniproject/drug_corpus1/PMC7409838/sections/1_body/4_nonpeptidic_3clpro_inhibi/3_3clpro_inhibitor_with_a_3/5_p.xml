<p id="p0245">According to X-ray crystallography (PDB code: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:4MDS" id="intref0020" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">4MDS</ext-link>, 
 <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref> ), rearrangement of the Gln189 and Met49 residue side chains forms the diamide 
 <bold>43</bold>, which exhibits an induced-fit binding site. This induced-fit binding site accommodates the 
 <italic>syn N</italic>-methyl pyrrole and anilido acetamide moieties of the inhibitors within the S2–S4 and S2–S1′ subpockets, respectively. In addition to the P2–P4 and P2–P1’ groups, 
 <bold>43</bold> partially occupies the S3 subpocket with a terminating 2-methylbutylamide. Moreover, Cys145 and benzotriazole N-(2) form a key hydrogen bond near the catalytic centre. Other hydrogen bond interactions are found near the catalytic site of His163 and benzotriazole N-(3), and the main chain Glu-166 NH shows an obvious interaction with the central acetamide oxide.
