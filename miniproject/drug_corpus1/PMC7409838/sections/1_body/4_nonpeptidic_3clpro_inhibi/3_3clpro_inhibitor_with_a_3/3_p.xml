<p id="p0235">To further clarify the SAR of the lead compound 
 <bold>40a</bold>, the P1–P3 framework was maintained consistent, whereas a library of five-membered aromatic heterocycles was synthesized through alterations in the P1′ position (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> , 41a-41f). Among the resulting compounds, imidazole (
 <bold>41c</bold>, IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 6 μM) and 5-chlorofuran (
 <bold>41e</bold>, IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 5.2 μM) substituted analogues were found to be the most potent. A subsequent study of P1 replacements was performed to identify alternative hydrogen bond-acceptor groups that might engage His163 while retaining the 2-furyl amide P1’ group. Among the six-membered π-excessive heterocycles examined (
 <bold>42a-42c</bold>), pyridazine (
 <bold>42a</bold>) and pyrazine (
 <bold>42b</bold>) were well tolerated. Furthermore, chiral stationary-phase supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) was applied to separate 
 <bold>40a</bold> enantiomers (
 <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>-B), and highly specific inhibition was obtained with a single stereoisomer 
 <bold>(
  <italic>R</italic>)-40a (ML188),
 </bold> which exhibited an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.5 ± 0.3 μM.
