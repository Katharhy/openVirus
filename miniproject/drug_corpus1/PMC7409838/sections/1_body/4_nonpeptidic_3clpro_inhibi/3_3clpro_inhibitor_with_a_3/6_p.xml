<p id="p0250">As a promising hit, the template compound 
 <bold>43</bold> has been subjected to intense derivatization, including P1 modifications, P2–P1′ exploration and P3 truncation (
 <xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 13</xref> ). First, the failure of the alteration of P1 to benzimidazole (
 <bold>44a-44c</bold>) indicated a strict substituent requirement for the 1,2,3-triazole unit. Comparatively, 4-phenyl-1,2,3-triazolium 
 <bold>44f</bold> exhibited effective inhibition (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 11 μM), and unsubstituted triazole 
 <bold>44d</bold> and trimethyl silyl triazole 
 <bold>44e</bold> were ineffective, which demonstrated the importance of maintaining a proper aromatic ring in the P1 subpocket during the optimization. Second, acetamide at the P2–P1’ region was exchanged with cyclic and acyclic amide congeners to render a series of analogues with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values below 10 μM, and the 
 <italic>i</italic>-propyl 
 <bold>45b</bold> and cyclobutyl 
 <bold>45d</bold> amide derivatives exhibited compelling activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values less than 5 μM. Furthermore, researchers performed fragment truncation at the P3 position to minimize pharmacophores and thereby reduce the overall redundant group and molecular weight, which could improve the physical and chemical properties as well as the ligand binding efficiency. Satisfactorily, the truncated amides 
 <bold>46</bold> exhibit comparable activity to the well-designed diamide counterparts 
 <bold>45</bold> (

 <bold>for 45a-45d vs 46a-46d</bold>). Karypidou et al. [
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] prepared a novel library of fused 1,2,3-triazole [

 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5-c</xref>] pyridine derivatives, and among these, 
 <bold>47–51</bold> exhibited good antiviral properties against human coronavirus 229E (
