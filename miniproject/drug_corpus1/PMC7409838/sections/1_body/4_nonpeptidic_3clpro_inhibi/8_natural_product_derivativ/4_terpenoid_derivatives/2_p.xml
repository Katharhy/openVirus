<p id="p0300">A screening of natural products for the identification of anti-coronavirus 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors revealed that tanshinone-type diterpenes (compounds 
 <bold>93–99</bold>) derived from 
 <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic> are selective inhibitors of SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> and PL
 <sup>pro</sup> [
 <xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. With the exception of cryptotanshinone (
 <bold>96</bold>), the other isolated tanshinones exerted a dose-dependent inhibitory effect but no time-dependent effect against 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. The activity of 
 <bold>93-99</bold> against 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> ranged from 14.4 to 89.1 μM. Further SAR study revealed that subtle differences in the substituents and stereo configuration can substantially affect the inhibitory activity. Specifically, the presence of a naphthalene moiety in the diterpene quinolone backbone appeared to improve the inhibition of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> in compared with that obtained with dimethyl-substituted tetralin (
 <bold>97</bold> and 
 <bold>98</bold> vs 
 <bold>93</bold> and 
 <bold>96</bold>). In addition, the dihydrofuran group (
 <bold>96</bold>) on ring A of cryptotanshinone reduced the inhibitory activity by two-fold compared with that of tanshinones (
 <bold>93–95</bold>) containing a furan group.
