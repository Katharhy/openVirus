<p>This will help to diagnose diseases at earlier stages, allowing medical intervention at this time. Early medical intervention will help to prevent the conditions altogether or at least ameliorate its prognosis. As the number of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 continues to rise globally, health-care systems become increasingly stressed. It is clear that the clinical laboratory plays a major role in this crisis, contributing to patient screening. As COVID-19 has triggered human casualties and a serious economic crisis posing a global threat, an understanding of the current scenario and developing a plan of action to contain the spread of the virus are urgently needed. Rapid diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics are important interventions for the management of the COVID-19 outbreak. It is essential to move forward with all the information necessary to be more prepared for a pandemic of its kind in the future. At present, scientists are working rigorously to find the solution to treat the SARS-CoV-2 infection at a rapid pace. Hence, more research is needed to adequately care for patients post recovery and to provide a framework of possible physical manifestations of the disease.</p>
