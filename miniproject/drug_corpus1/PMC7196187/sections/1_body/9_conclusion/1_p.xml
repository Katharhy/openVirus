<p>COVID-19 is a global pandemic, and currently it has emerged as the most intense and petrifying viral infection to be handled by the human race. Many countries have taken precautionary measures against the virus, and government officials in all countries continue to make efforts to minimize human contact by facilitating countrywide shutdowns of public places.
