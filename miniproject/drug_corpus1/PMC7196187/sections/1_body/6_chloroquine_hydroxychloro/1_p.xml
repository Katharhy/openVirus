<p>Chloroquine, which is categorized as an anti-viral drug, is principally used as an anti-malarial and autoimmune-treating drug (
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Chloroquine and its combination of drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 has been listed in 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are currently undergoing clinical trials to ensure their preventive action for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Chloroquine diffuses to the cell passively through the cell membranes and to the endosomes, lysosomes, and Golgi vesicles, where it becomes protonated, trapping the chloroquine in the organelle and raising the surrounding 
 <italic>p</italic>H (
 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The raised 
 <italic>p</italic>H in the endosomes prevent virus particles from using their activity for fusion and entry into the cell. Chloroquine does not affect the expression of ACE2 on cell surfaces but inhibits terminal glycosylation of the ACE2 receptor for cell entry targeted by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (

 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have various way to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 action. Also, because of chloroquine, there is a change in the 
 <italic>p</italic>H of lysosomes that leads to inhibition of the cathepsins, which is mandatory for the formation of autophagosomes to cleave the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and blocks the viral attachment to the human host receptors. Additionally, the chloroquine can constrain the quinone reductase-2, which is an essential agent required for the biosynthesis of sialic acid, which is generally used as the receptor moieties by the SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the chloroquine obstructs the MAP-kinase, which results in SARS-CoV-2 virus molecular crosstalk, further alters the viral assembly, and intrudes into the proteolytic process of the M protein of the virus (
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Savarino 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (
 <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) hypothesized that chloroquine might block the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-6 by blocking the pathway leading to ARDS.
