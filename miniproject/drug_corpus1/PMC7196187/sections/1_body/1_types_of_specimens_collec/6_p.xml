 <bold>Other samples:</bold> Since SARS-CoV-2 is present in blood and stool, these specimens can be collected in addition to the respiratory specimens. However, the efficacy of these tests remains unclear, because the data on viral shedding is still preliminary. In addition, for patients who have died, autopsy material and lung tissue may be used to test for the presence of the virus. Based on the samples collected, the diagnostic techniques will be carried out to verify the presence of the viral infection.
