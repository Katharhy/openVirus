 <bold>Sputum:</bold> The patients who have severe coughing symptoms will be asked to collect their sputum as the sample to detect the viral infection. The patients will be asked to rinse the mouth with sterile water and further expel the deep cough sputum straight away into a sterile, leak-proof, screw-cap-tightened sputum collection cup or sterile dry container.
