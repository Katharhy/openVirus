 <bold>Bronchoalveolar lavage and tracheal aspirate:</bold> For patients who are severely ill or having severe symptoms for the COVID-19 disease, the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and tracheal aspirate could be used from the lower respiratory tract. The BAL sample is acquired using a bronchoscope or catheter into the bronchus, where the aspirated fluid with the virus will be collected for the testing of the COVID-19 infection.
