<p>According to WHO (

Many countries have taken precautionary measures against the virus, and government officials in all countries continue to try to minimize human contact by facilitating countrywide shutdowns of public places, and various steps have been started to safeguard the people, like social distancing and self-quarantine, which limits our social interactions (

This will decrease the risk of spreading COVID-19 to people, by breaking the transmission chain and the influx of new COVID-19 cases in a given time period. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced scientists to rework strategies to combat infectious diseases through drugs, treatment, and control measures. The entire world is taking necessary steps to develop a vaccine for this dreadful virus, and for this kind of research governments are providing copious funds for scientists and institutions. The South Korean government and the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) have announced urgent research projects for the development of vaccines and drugs against COVID-19. In the Republic of Korea, since the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 on January 20, 2020, as per the KCDC report on April 21, 2020, the confirmed cases are 10,683, released from isolation 8213, isolated 2233, and deceased 237. The KCDC is rapidly taking the necessary steps to minimize the infection. The Republic of Korea has implemented several measures to effectively flatten the curve and provide timely medical care to the infected patient. India’s first case of COVID-19 was reported on January 30, 2020, in Kerala. As per WHO’s report on April 21, 2020, in India 18,601 were confirmed cases, 3252 had recovered, and 590 had died. The Indian government is using compulsory measures to ensure that people are well prepared to conquer this deadly infection of COVID-19.
