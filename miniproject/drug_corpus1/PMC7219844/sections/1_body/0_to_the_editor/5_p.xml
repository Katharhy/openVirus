<p>Within the health care setting, different international practices regarding PPE and guidelines are understandable due to the global difference in disease prevalence, the amount of testing available, the sensitivity of the tests, and resources. Nonetheless, the principles should be the same regarding the basics of infection control with early disease identification by vigilant screening, thorough contact tracing by mandatory record keeping, containment by proper PPE with exploration of sustainable options amid shortages, and strict implementation of clear IPC guidelines which should be designed to protect HCPs in individualized subspecialties or health care settings. Robust guidelines are particularly important as more countries are moving toward “reopening.” With different institutional IPC guidelines for PPE and ventilation strategies, a collaborative international network to establish the rate of nosocomial infection within HCPs could be a valuable resource going forward.</p>
