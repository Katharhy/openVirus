<p>Local IPC guidelines vary internationally. They should err on the side of caution though, when robust evidence is unavailable due a short time frame, and with new data continuously emerging. This is particularly relevant with the recognition of asymptomatic transmission of the disease which also translates to higher level of PPE required for AGMPs for asymptomatic patients.

 </sup> As treatment protocols evolve with emerging evidence, treatments like noninvasive ventilation usage change the level of PPE necessary to ensure HCPs protection. Whether HCPs adhere to local IPC guidelines are dependent on the element of the guidelines as highlighted in the recent Cochrane review.

 </sup> HCPs felt unsure as to how to adhere to local guidelines when they were long and ambiguous or did not reflect national or international guidelines.

 </sup> While the likely mode of COVID-19 transmission is droplet and contact, guidelines should be carefully tailored to different subspecialties rather than a “one size fits all” approach. Ideally, representatives from each specialty should be consulted. Transparency regarding resources such as PPE also fosters trusts among HCPs to implement IPC guidelines.

 </sup> These guidelines should not overlook AGMPs (eg, airway manipulation or noninvasive ventilation) and should protect those who work in the hospital “hot zone.”

 </sup> Furthermore, they should consider an impossibility to practice the globally recommended social distancing at the hospital or other health care settings (eg, nursing homes) which potentially expose HCPs to droplet and/or short range aerosol spread, while interacting with patients and other staff. This will contribute to further spread of disease to HCPs and patients. Therefore, continuous masking should be implemented. Many Asian countries have taken the lead in this respect.
