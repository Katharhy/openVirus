<p>Internationally, there is a wide variation of PPE, ranging from powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) to separate facemasks, goggles, gown, and gloves. Countries (eg, China, Taiwan, and South Korea), where PAPR or Hazmat suits are available, had previously experienced epidemics, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2003 (SARS-CoV-1) or Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS). One of the most notable advantages of PAPR is its sustainability by being reusable while offering protection for aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMPs). Shortage of PPE has been experienced in many countries leading to low level or absence of PPE, hence, exposing HCPs to potential infection.

 </sup> Some HCPs are required to don the same PPE for days or to reuse single-use N95 respirators. This prompted the Food and Drug Administration to approve the reusable industrial elastomeric respirators and decontamination systems for N95 masks in a timely fashion amid the pandemic.
