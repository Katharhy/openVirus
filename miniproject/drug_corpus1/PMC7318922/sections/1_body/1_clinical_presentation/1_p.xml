<p id="p0035">Clinical symptoms of COVID-19 range from mild respiratory illness to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The original cohort of patients in Wuhan presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea along with corresponding chest computed tomography imaging illustrating bilateral ground glass opacities and a notable paucity of upper respiratory tract infection hallmarks (e.g., rhinorrhea, pharyngitis, or sinusitis;
