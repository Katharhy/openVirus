<p id="Par44">The patient was diagnosed with HIV in 2002 and has been on ART for 14 years (since 2006). His initial ART regimen was stavudine (d4T) + lamivudine (3TC) + nevirapine (NVP) from August 2006 to August 2007. NVP was subsequently replaced by efavirenz (EFV) from August 2007 to August 2009. From August 2009, the patient voluntarily stopped treatment and returned to the clinic in 2010 for consultation. In 2010, the patient had a high VL (157,290 RNA copies/ml) and very-low CD4 cell count (87 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup>). Prior to ART re-initiation in 2010, genotypic resistance testing (GRT) results, interpreted throughout using Stanford HIVDB (

With this mutational profile, the patient was recommended PI/r + 2NRTI but we have no precision on antiretrovirals used thereafter. From 2011 to 2012, the patient was diagnosed co-infected with pulmonary tuberculosis and treated accordingly, classified as WHO clinical stage 3. After completing anti-tuberculosis treatment in 2012, he was lost to follow-up (duration unclear) and later returned for clinical consultation. Following clinical assessment, he received a regimen consisting of super-boosted ritonavir with darunavir (DRV/r) + raltegravir (RAL) + tenofovir (TDF) +3TC (unclear start date) till November 2017, a period during which adherence was suboptimal (assessed by self-reporting). While completing anti-tuberculosis treatment the patient discontinued HIV-treatment. Following clinical assessment, he was re-initiated with a regimen consisting of ritonavir boosted darunavir (DRV/r) + raltegravir (RAL) + tenofovir (TDF) +3TC (unclear start date) till November 2017; a period during which adherence was suboptimal. A second GRT was performed and the resulting mutational profile suggested DRV/r(600 mg × 2/day) + DTG(50 mg × 2/day), possibly associated with ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (ATV/r) for its potential capacity to enhance DTG concentrations (

However, the patient was prescribed DRV/r(600 mg × 2/day) + DTG(50 mg × 1/day) + TDF + 3TC from November 2017 to May 2019. In May 2019, the patient was empirically switched to DRV/r(600 mg × 2/day) + DTG(50 mg × 1/day) + abacavir (ABC) +3TC. Then, ABC was changed to TDF until August 2019 when the third GRT was performed.
