<p id="Par49">The third GRT (August 08, 2019), encompassing PR, RT and IN regions, showed high-level resistance to NRTI, NNRTI, PI and all INSTI. Additional RAMs were H221HY for NNRTI and S147G for INSTI. Viral tropism was also re-performed and demonstrated CCR5-tropic virus with a slightly reduced FPR (57.0%). Pending access to required innovative regimen, a salvage therapy guided by GRT was recommended, consisting of either “DRV/r(600mg x 2/day), saquinavir/r, TDF+3TC”, or “3TC-monotherapy” which maintains M184V and as such limits the viral replicative fitness. None of the recommendations; in November 2019, VL appeared relatively stable (5.54 Log copies/mL) under “DRV/r(600mg x 2/day)+TDF+3TC” and with an active family-centered adherence monitoring. Following intensified/close adherence strategy implemented, the patient is compliant to treatment but the latest plasma viral load remains high, with a slight increment (5.86 Log copies/mL on January 27, 2020), which confirms the need of innovative drugs and close case surveillance, including MRV that is not locally available [
