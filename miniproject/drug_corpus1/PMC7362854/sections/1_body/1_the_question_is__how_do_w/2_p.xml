<p id="p0075">Using the main potential targets and their roles in viral infection, many researchers have attempted to collect lists of possible synthetic and natural compounds via molecular dynamics simulations that can supply a roadmap for future studies [

Nevertheless, even if a drug candidate is discovered quickly, which is far from certain, preclinical and clinical tests are expected to take years.
