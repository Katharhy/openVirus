<p id="p0165">The results in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> show certain interesting data. First, there are only three drugs with highly different chemical natures and modes of action, i.e., umifenovir (
 <bold>7</bold>), azithromycin (
 <bold>12</bold>) and ivermectin (
 <bold>13</bold>), that do not virtually alter any vital proteins, and five drugs that interact with one human target, i.e., remdesivir (
 <bold>1</bold>), lopinavir (
 <bold>2</bold>), ritonavir (
 <bold>3</bold>) and danoprevir (
 <bold>14</bold>), which bind to protease enzymes, whereas favipiravir (
 <bold>4</bold>) can act as an ion channel modulator similar to many other drugs (comp. 
 <bold>5</bold>, 
 <bold>6</bold>, 
 <bold>8–11</bold>). However, these latter candidates could switch to 2-3 additional human targets. Second, as viral anti-3CLpro/PLpro activities, drugs 
 <bold>2</bold>, 
 <bold>3</bold> and 
 <bold>14</bold> could also alter human protease enzymes, and it is logical but remdesivir and favipiravir, as viral RdRp inhibitors involved in viral replication inhibition, can act on human protease enzymes and ion channels, respectively, according to the obtained data. Both drugs are currently in Phase III clinical trials as a possible treatment for COVID-19 in the USA (remdesivir) and Japan (favipiravir). Ruxolitinib (
 <bold>10</bold>), an anticancer drug tested for its potential to dampen the cytokine storm, could act as a modulator of signaling proteins, such as GPCR and enzyme inhibitors, in addition to its kinase inhibition activity.
