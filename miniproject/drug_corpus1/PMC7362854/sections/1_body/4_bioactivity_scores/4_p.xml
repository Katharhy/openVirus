<p id="p0170">According to recent work on control of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, hydroxychloroquine was less toxic and more efficient as a viral inhibitor than chloroquine [
 <xref rid="bib106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>], which confirms the current in silico calculation, but both drugs display retinal toxicity, which is an ophthalmologic concern because it is not treatable [
 <xref rid="bib107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. However, the short-term administration of these drugs rarely causes severe side effects, and longer exposure has been associated with certain serious although uncommon adverse events, including cardiomyopathy, bone marrow suppression and hypoglycemia [
 <xref rid="bib108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. In addition, it was found early on that these drugs are neither embryotoxic nor fetotoxic when used at the usual dosage for malaria prophylaxis [

The recent work of Wolfram et al. which reports new details on viral cell entry inhibition of (hydroxy) chloroquine, offers a cautiously optimistic report that (hydroxy) chloroquine might have a prophylactic and/or therapeutic effect against COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="bib110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>], though there is sufficient preclinical rationale and evidence on their effectiveness for treatment of COVID-19 to validate their use in the clinic [
