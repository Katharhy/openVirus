<p id="p0160">The Molinspiration tool also permits (to a certain degree) prediction of the bioactivity of the compounds as a ligand for the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) and the nuclear receptor, as an ion channel modulator, and as an enzyme inhibitor. With an indicator of the activity of a molecule, one can assess its inhibitory ability with respect to the vital proteins and enzymes of the human body. The data obtained can be used to estimate how harmful these active antiviral molecules are to the human body. Hence, the predicted relative affinity values to vital proteins of compounds
