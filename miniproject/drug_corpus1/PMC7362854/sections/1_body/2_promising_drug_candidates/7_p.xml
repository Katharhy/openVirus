<p id="p0110">In analyzing the main structural details of selected drugs/drug candidates, it was noted that of the 14 compounds, two are oxygenated macrocyclic compounds obtained directly or via sequential transformations from 
 <italic>Actinomycete</italic> bacteria (comp. 
 <bold>12</bold> and comp. 
 <bold>13</bold> as a B1a/B1b mixture, 80/20), and twelve are nitrogen-containing heterocycles are synthetic molecules. Among these, three candidates are nucleoside-based heterocycles (pyrrolo[2,1-

 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]triazine 
 <bold>1</bold>, 2-oxopyrimidine 
 <bold>8</bold> and 1,2,4-triazole 
 <bold>9</bold>), which resemble the respective RNA bases of adenosine and cytidine, two are so-called peptide-heterocyclic chimera derivatives (comp. 
 <bold>2</bold> and 
 <bold>3</bold>), and others are functionalized derivatives of classic heteroaromatic rings, i.e., pyrazine (comp. 
 <bold>4</bold>), quinoline (comp. 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>6</bold>), indole (comp. 
 <bold>7</bold>), pyrrolo[2,3-
 <italic>d</italic>]pyrimidin-pyrazol hybrid (comp. 
 <bold>10</bold>), imidazole (comp. 
 <bold>11</bold>) and macrocyclic lactam (comp. 
 <bold>14</bold>).
