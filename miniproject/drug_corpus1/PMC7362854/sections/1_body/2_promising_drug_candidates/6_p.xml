<p id="p0105">Ruxolitinib (Akavi®) is approved in 2011 to treat certain rare bone marrow/blood cancers (e.g., myeloproliferative neoplasm). The drug works by blocking enzymes JAK1/JAK2 in the JAK-STAT pathway, which is overactive in these blood cancers. At the same time, the JAK-STAT pathway is fundamental to many biological processes related to immunity and inflammation, including marshaling a cytokine response [

Ingavirin® is an original Russian antiviral drug for the treatment and prevention of acute respiratory viral infections by influenza and non-influenza with a unique mechanism of action. This drug provides early recognition of infection and the formation of the antiviral state of cells that stops the virus from reproducing and spreading in the body. It is effective against type A and B viruses, adenoviruses, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, coronaviruses, metapneumoviruses, enteroviruses, including Coxsackie virus and rhinovirus [

It was discovered 1980 and approved for medical use in 1988. In 2019, this drug was found active against pandemic influenza 2009 (A(H1N1)pdm09) virus acting by interfering with virus internalization process [

Danoprevir (ITMN-191/R7227, Ganovo®) is one the antivirals against hepatitis C virus belonging to the second-generation group so-called, direct-acting antiviral agents that act as NS3/4A protease inhibitors. It was developed in 2008; and in 2018, danoprevir was approved as a drug in combination with ritonavir, peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for the treatment of treatment-naive patients with non-cirrhotic genotype 1b chronic hepatitis C. It is a potent and selective noncovalent reversible NS3 inhibitor, a chymotrypsin-like serine protease that plays an essential role in the HCV viral replication process [
