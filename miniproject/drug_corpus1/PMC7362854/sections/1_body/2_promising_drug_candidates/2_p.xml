<p id="p0085">Certainly, the risk from the use of an approved drug should be significantly lower than from the disease itself. Therefore, the medicine must be safe. This fact greatly complicates the search: it is likely that at the stage of large clinical trials, it will be discovered that too much risk exists from the drug, risk that is incomparable with the danger of the disease.
