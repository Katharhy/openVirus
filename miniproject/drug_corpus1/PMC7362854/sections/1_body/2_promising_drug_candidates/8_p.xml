<p id="p0115">Our list contains only fourteen compounds, but the molecular and skeletal diversity is so great that it guarantees their specific interactions with the different above-mentioned targets of SARS-Co-V2 virus. Certainly, each structure of these drugs has been optimized, but for their specific profiles, we followed the approach based on monotherapy (“one-target, one-disease” approach). We are facing a novel virus that can mutate rapidly [

 <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Similar to HIV/AIDS treatment, which consists of the so-called “AIDS cocktail” therapy (combination antiretroviral therapy) [
 <xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], future COVID-19 treatment could be based on combination drugs that impact multiple targets simultaneously (i.e., “double drug cocktail” or “triple drug cocktail”, polytherapy). This approach could be generally more effective than the monotherapy method, and it is currently implemented in practice in this case [
 <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>], but unsuccessful individual experiments [
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] cannot rule out the significance of this approach. Moreover, multicomponent drugs that are co-formulated in a single tablet, which alters the ability of the other components to reach its target, or better, single drugs that are based on two different frameworks responsible for pharmacological effects (pharmacophores) and able to modulate multiple targets simultaneously [
 <xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>], could be highly advantageous in the future. However, from old magic bullets to modern “binary or trinary weapons”, a treatment against this coronavirus is still far away.
