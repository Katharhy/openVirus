<p id="p0175">Reprofiling a drug or experimental agent for a concrete disease is a complex task that requires time and fundamental dedication, and the repurposed pipeline is finite. Despite immense efforts, no good clinical evidence currently exists for any specific therapies (including antiviral and immune modulating agents). The repurposed drugs that are under investigation for COVID-19 should be used only in randomized and controlled trials. The revised physicochemical properties and bioactivity scores of potential small molecule drugs studied in this work indicate that no molecule is perfect: if certain small molecule drugs (comp. 
 <bold>4</bold>, 
 <bold>6</bold>, 
 <bold>8–11</bold>) meet Lipinski’s rule, they do not pass the standards for bioactivity scores, and if notably few drugs show a good drug-likeness criterion (comp. 
 <bold>12</bold> and 
 <bold>13</bold>), they violate two criteria of Lipinski’s rule.
