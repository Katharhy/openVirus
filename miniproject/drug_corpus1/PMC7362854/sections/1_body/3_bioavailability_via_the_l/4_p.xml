<p id="p0130">Considering these facts, we calculated the principal molecular descriptors of these small molecule drugs and examined them (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ). The calculated data indicate that among 14 drugs, seven compounds with MW &lt; 500 Da fulfill the RO5 for oral absorption, and the other half of the compounds with MW &gt; 600 Da do not fulfill the RO5, failing two or three criteria. The case of chloroquine (
 <bold>5</bold>) is a border zone; although it has small MW, it fails only one criterion. This observation is not surprising because ca. 16% of drugs, especially antiparasitic, anticancer and antiviral drugs that have oral bioavailability violate at least one of the criteria, and 6% fail in two or more criteria.
