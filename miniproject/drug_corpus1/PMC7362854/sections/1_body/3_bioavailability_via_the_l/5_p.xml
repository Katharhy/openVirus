<p id="p0135">One of the most parameters of this rule is lipophilicity, which is expressed by the cLogP feature. Almost all selected compounds have an appropriate cLogP (less than 5) for Lipinski’s rule, excluding two drugs, i.e., lopinavir (
 <bold>2</bold>) and ritonavir (
 <bold>3</bold>), which are highly lipophilic molecules with respective cLogP values of 5.69 and 7.14. In contrast, the drugs favipiravir (
 <bold>4</bold>), EIDD-2801 (
 <bold>8</bold>), ribavirin (
 <bold>9</bold>), ruxolitinib (
 <bold>10</bold>) and ingavirin (
 <bold>11</bold>) are highly hydrophilic molecules with cLogP values ranging from −2.27 to 1.83. These are notably small molecules that are highly soluble in an aqueous medium and have a poor capacity for permeability through membranes (weak lipophilicity), but they are probably capable of transport by certain membrane proteins. Interestingly, three macrocyclic compounds displaying an appropriate lipophilicity, i.e., azithromycin (
 <bold>12</bold>), ivermectin (
 <bold>13</bold>) and danoprevir (
 <bold>14</bold>), are less lipophilic than lopinavir (
 <bold>2</bold>) and ritonavir (
 <bold>3</bold>), which possess an alicyclic peptide backbone. All of these molecules are the “heaviest” (MW &gt; 628–873 Da) and bulkiest (MV &gt; 607–825 Da). Comparing both antimalarial drugs 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>6</bold>, although they have almost identical molecular volumes, hydroxychloroquine is more polar, less lipophilic, and thus encounters more difficulty diffusing across cell the membrane, as confirmed by kinetic and thermodynamic experiments [
