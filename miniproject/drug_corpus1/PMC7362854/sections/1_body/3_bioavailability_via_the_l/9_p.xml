<p id="p0155">It is noteworthy that as ACE2 inhibitors, two small drugs of chloroquine (
 <bold>5</bold>) and hydroxychloroquine (
 <bold>6</bold>), with respective pK
 <sub>a</sub> values of 10.06 and 9.22, show the best intestinal absorption. Unfortunately, pK
 <sub>a</sub> calculations from the ChemDraw program do not supply a second ionization constant for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. However, in practice, it was found that chloroquine has two basic groups corresponding to the quinoline-ring nitrogen and the diethylamino side-chain nitrogen with ionization constants of 8.1 and 10.2, respectively. Moreover, at a physiologic pH of 7.4 (plasma), 18% of chloroquine is monoprotonated but still soluble in lipid and able to traverse cell membranes, and when it enters a lysosome (pH ∼ 4–5), it is biprotonated [

 <xref rid="bib104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. In practice, chloroquine is administered as a phosphate salt, whereas hydroxychloroquine is processed as a sulfate, and both drugs are usually absorbed in the upper intestinal tract [

 <sup>2</sup> that allow them to cross the hematoencephalic barrier. Umifenovir (
 <bold>7</bold>) is also a possible ACE2 inhibitor, but it is more acidic (pKa = 5.24) and less soluble in water (LogS = −6.04) than chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine drugs (LogS = −4.53 and −3.77, respectively) (
