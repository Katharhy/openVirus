<p id="p0120">It is well known that the balance between solubility and polar/hydrophobic properties is critical for a drug that must be absorbed, penetrate numerous biological barriers and reach the desired site of action without affecting the biological balance of the entire organism. Based on a literature analysis, almost all of the abovementioned small molecule drugs could bind four highly different targets of SARS-Co-V2 virus, i.e., RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), coronavirus main chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro) and spike protein S1. Additionally, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [
