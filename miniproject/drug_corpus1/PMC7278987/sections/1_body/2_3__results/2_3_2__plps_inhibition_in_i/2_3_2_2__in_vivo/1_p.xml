<p>Despite promising results shown in mice with proteasomal inhibition in a SARS model [
 <xref rid="B56-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], only two main studies on murine models specifically consider PLP inhibition in vivo. First, in a 2014 study, IFN-receptor knockout mice that lack ISGs, and are not able to survive Sindbis virus infections, were infected with chimeric Sindbis viruses, engineered to express ISG15 and either SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV PLPs or their inactive mutants. Mice infected with the mutated PLP virus showed a 76% survival, attributable to ISG15 restoration, while the wild type PLP virus infection resulted in more than 80% mortality [

 <xref rid="B66-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], was specific for PLP and induced an increase in ISGylation, that led to an increase in survival to the wild type PLP virus. Unfortunately, there was no significative efficacy in the SARS-CoV mouse model [

Here, a USP18 (a cellular DUB with physiological deISGylating activity) knockout mouse model, displaying increased level of ISGylation, was infected with a murine hepatitis coronavirus. Higher ISGylation levels were positively correlated with a delay in coronavirus replication, and, instead, negatively with the PLP2 levels in vivo. Although, PLP2 inhibition was tested in vitro, lower viral titers were observed [
