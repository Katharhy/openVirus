<p>The latest, and second main, PLP inhibition model in vivo is an engineered murine hepatitis coronavirus. The DUB, and not the protease activity, of a murine hepatitis coronavirus PLP2 was disrupted through structure guided mutagenesis. The obtained mutant coronavirus was tested in macrophages for its ability to elicit cellsâ€™ innate immunity and showed an increased activation of IFN. However, inoculation in mice only resulted in a mild attenuation of virulence, despite an improvement in histological features [

As an explanation, the authors hypothesized that the DUB activity of this PLP may not be necessary in vivo, or may only be required in some tissue-specific/environmental contexts. Remarkably, the authors reported difficulties in isolating a mutant virus without PLP DUB activity and claim this was due to the difficulty in separating it from other activities that resulted in no replication if disrupted. This difficulty, per se, may have more meaning than just a technical issue, and suggests that PLPs may be essential for viral replication.
