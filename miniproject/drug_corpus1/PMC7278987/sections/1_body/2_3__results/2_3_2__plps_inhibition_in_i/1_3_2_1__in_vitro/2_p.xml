<p>Remarkably, in a 2017 work, its authors developed an innovative therapeutic strategy, using Ub variants, to inhibit MERS-CoV PLP in Vero cells. These protein-based inhibitors were shown to be highly selective for this PLP and to disrupt all of its enzymatic functions (pp processing, DUB and deISGylating activity), leading to a four orders of magnitude decrease in viral titer [

As the authors themselves recognize, the only questionable feature in this therapeutic strategy was the requirement of sophisticated protein engineering techniques. However, such a suggestion should not be rejected, and may indicate that other bio-pharmacological techniques, such as monoclonal antibodies designed against SARS-CoV2 PLP or PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs), capable of mediating the ubiquitin-proteasome mediated degradation of SARS-CoV2 PLP, may have merit.
