<p>PLPs play their first role during the early replicative phase of coronavirus infection. After the virus enters the host cell, a replication/transcription complex (RTC) is required to orchestrate the replication of the viral units in the cytoplasm. Here, the PLPsâ€™ cysteine protease activity is essential for the cleavage of the N-terminal segment of the RTC polyprotein (pp). Specifically, the RTC is coded by two open reading frames (1a and 1b), that, with a ribosomal frame shift mechanism, lead to the transcription of two polyproteins: pp1a, that features the nsps from 1 to 11, and the larger pp1ab, that, in addition, contains nsps 12 to 16. The pps need to be processed correctly into the nsps, which are the active elements of the RTC. PLPs are encoded within nsp3 and free the N-terminal nsps of the RTC, while the remaining units are processed by the three chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLP alias main protease), which may also serve as an attractive therapeutic target [
