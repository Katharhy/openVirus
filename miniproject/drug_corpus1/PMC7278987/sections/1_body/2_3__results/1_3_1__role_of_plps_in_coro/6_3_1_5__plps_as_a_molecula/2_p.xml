<p>While the activities of PLPs are usually conserved among the

 <xref rid="B5-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], to which coronaviruses belong, an enhanced PLP antagonism of innate immunity seems to be a peculiar characteristic of zoonotic coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV [

 <xref rid="B4-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], we speculate they might have similar roles in pathogenesis. Crystallographic analysis might clarify the mechanisms underlying the COVID-19 pathogenesis and provide a therapeutic target for the identification of inhibitors through high throughput molecular screening.
