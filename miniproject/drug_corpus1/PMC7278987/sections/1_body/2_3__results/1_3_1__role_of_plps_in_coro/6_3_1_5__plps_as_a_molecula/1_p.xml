<p>Although many additional structural and non-structural coronavirus proteins may contribute to suppress the cellular responses to viral infections [

 <xref rid="B60-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], the role of PLPs in the production of the replicase proteins and their location at the center of numerous signaling nodes suggest validity in targeting them as an anti-viral strategy. Collaterally, considering these effects of PLPs and other viral proteins on dysregulating the innate immune response, one may hypothesize that they could be at the origins of a mechanism that underlies the potential development of a cytokine storm [
