<p>Last, but not least, this PLP was shown to induce an upregulation of the transcription and translation of transforming-growth-factor (TGF)-β1 through ERK, which was inhibited by treatment with MG132. Noticeably, the treatment with the ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 inhibited the activation of TGF-β1 activated genes, with an 8.4-fold reduction observed for type I collagen [

The results of these studies contributed to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying this feature of SARS-CoV PLP, confirmed the effects seen on human samples, and showed pro-fibrotic features induced in lung histology by this PLP in a mouse model. Taken together, these considerations suggest the connection of PLPs with collagen expression via TGF-β1 signaling and a pathogenic role of SARS-CoV PLP in inducing lung fibrosis [
