<p>There are well established evidence that coronaviral PLPs are able to deconjugate ISG15 moieties from proteins [

 <xref rid="B5-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], but, since the detailed mechanisms through which ISG15 exerts its antiviral activity are still not completely elucidated, the exact consequences of PLPs deISGylating activity in coronavirus infections are still poorly understood. However, two mouse models demonstrate in vivo that ISG15 has antiviral properties against a murine hepatitis coronavirus [

 <xref rid="B48-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. This does suggest that the deISGylating activity of PLPs is an important mechanism used by coronaviruses to counteract the hostâ€™s antiviral response.
