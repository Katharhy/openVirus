<p>While the MERS-CoV PLP has been reported to have analogous effects [

 <xref rid="B39-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], the SARS-CoV PLP DUB activity is the best characterized and has been demonstrated to antagonize the IRF3 pathway at many steps. This PLP was first reported to inhibit the RIG-I and TLR3 induction of the IFN-β [

 <xref rid="B40-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], to block the phosphorylation and dimerization of IRF3 by interacting with its upstream regulators [

 <xref rid="B41-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and to directly deubiquitinate IRF3and thus disrupt its IFN-β promoter activity [
 <xref rid="B42-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, recent studies, highlight a K63 Ub DUB dependent broad interaction with various, if not all, components of the IRF3 pathway, such as STING, TRAF3/6, MAVS and TBK1 [

 <xref rid="B45-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Another important pathway influenced by the SARS-CoV PLP is NF-kB. Here, the DUB activity is known to be exerted upon IkBα, an inhibitor of NF-kB [
