<p>Considering that this PLP has more than one site to bind Ub [
 <xref rid="B6-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and a study showing that inhibition of PLP protease activity results in reduced NF-kB (but not IRF3) antagonism [
 <xref rid="B32-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], it could suggest that IRF3 antagonism depends on DUB activity towards K63 linked Ub chains and NF-kB antagonism instead on DUB activity against K48 linked Ub chains [
 <xref rid="B21-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]; a type of linkage that in vitro seems to be preferred by this PLP [
 <xref rid="B18-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In summary, we suggest that PLPs antagonism of the antiviral response is generalized upon the pathways, rather than focused on their single elements, and counteracts various Ub modifications.
