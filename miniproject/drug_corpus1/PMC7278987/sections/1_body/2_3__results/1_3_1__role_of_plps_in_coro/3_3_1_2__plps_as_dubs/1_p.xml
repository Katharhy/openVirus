<p>The host cell innate immune response to viruses begins once the viral nucleic acids are sensed by pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLR) and retinoid inducible gene I (RIG-I). This event triggers signal cascades, including kinases such as TANK-binding kinase-1 (TBK1) and inhibitor-kB kinases (IKKs), leading to activation of transcription factors such as interferon-regulatory factor-3 (IRF3) and the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB). These proteins translocate into the nucleus and serve as transcription factors by binding to promoter elements in target genes, leading to the expression of several cytokines, including type I IFNs (as α and β IFNs), which in turn will trigger a huge number of intra and extra cellular processes leading to activation of the innate immune response [
