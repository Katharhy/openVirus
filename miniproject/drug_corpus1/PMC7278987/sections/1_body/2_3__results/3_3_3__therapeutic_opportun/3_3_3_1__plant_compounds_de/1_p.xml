<p>Several additional natural compounds derivates have been demonstrated to have activity against PLPs. Six compounds were isolated from 
 <italic>Tribulus terrestris</italic> fruits and acted as mixed type inhibitors with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 15.6–70.1 µM against the SARS-CoV PLP protease activity [
 <xref rid="B71-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The evaluation of derivatives from 
 <italic>Angelica keiskei</italic> leaves led to the isolation of 9 chalcones and 4 coumarins, with inhibitory activity against both proteases of the same coronavirus. Of these, compound 6 (xanthoangelol E) has an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.2 µM against the PLP and 11.4 µM against 3CLP (a chymotrypsin-like protease, also proposed as a molecular target against coronaviruses). 
 <italic>Angelica keiskei</italic> derivatives were also identified as inhibitors of PLP DUB and deISGylating activity [
 <xref rid="B72-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Park et al., who proposed many natural derivatives against coronaviruses, recently reported similar results from 
 <italic>Broussonetia Papyrifera</italic> root derivatives, including the MERS-cov proteases [
 <xref rid="B73-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Lastly, the seeds of 
 <italic>Psoralea Corylifolia</italic> have been another source of lead compounds, such as isobavachalcone and psoralidin, with activity towards the SARS-cov PLP [
 <xref rid="B74-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Unfortunately, all of these molecules have thus far only been evaluated biochemically in vitro and not at more advanced pre-clinical development stages, but, encouragingly, the extracts of 
 <italic>Strobilanthes cusia</italic> leaves demonstrated PLP2 inhibitory properties and positive antiviral results against the human coronavirus NL63 in cells [
 <xref rid="B75-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Therefore, we suggest that further research should be performed.
