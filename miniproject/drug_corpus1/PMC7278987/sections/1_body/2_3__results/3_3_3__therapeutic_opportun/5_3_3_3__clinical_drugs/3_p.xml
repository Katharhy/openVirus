<p>Severe and advanced cases of COVID-19 pneumonias often involve immune system mediated damage, a so-called cytokine storm, and immunosuppression has been proposed for this context [

 <xref rid="B12-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. On the basis of these elements, rather than in upfront therapy, we would consider thiopurine analogs and their associated drugs for the treatment of the cytokine storm in COVID-19, that could eventually result in an antiviral and a double immunomodulatory efficacy: inhibiting the viral replication, suppressing hyperinflammation damage and enhancing the endocellular innate immune response against SARS-cov2. We again recommend, extreme prudence in considering these drugs, as their side effects might be a danger.
