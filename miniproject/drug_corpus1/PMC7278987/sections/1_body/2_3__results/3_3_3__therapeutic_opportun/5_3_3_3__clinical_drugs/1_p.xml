<p>Within the category of clinically available drugs, thiopurine analogs, used to treat diseases such as cancer or autoimmune diseases, may have been overlooked. They have previously been shown to display activity as SARS-CoV PLP inhibitors in vitro [

 <xref rid="B77-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. In addition, as the thiocarbonyl group has been judged to be the active element of these compounds, they may also serve as models to develop safer and more effective molecules [
 <xref rid="B76-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Indeed, since such drugs have immunomodulatory actions and are known to depress the immune system, we would suggest a degree of caution in their use in infectious diseases.
