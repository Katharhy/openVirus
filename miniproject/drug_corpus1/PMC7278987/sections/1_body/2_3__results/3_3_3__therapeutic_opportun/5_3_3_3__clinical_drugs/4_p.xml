<p>In addition, we would like to highlight that a recent report demonstrated that disulfiram (a clinically approved alcohol abuse antagonist, now repurposed as an anticancer drug) can competitively and noncompetitively inhibit SARS and MERS PLPs, respectively, and this activity is synergic with 6-thioguanine (a thiopurine) and mycophenolic acid against MERS, but not SARS, PLP [

These recent findings in vitro, together with a relatively good risk/benefit ratio, may make disulfiram a clinically evaluable drug against COVID-19. However, as a hepatic acetaldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor, its pharmacological interactions might be considered.
