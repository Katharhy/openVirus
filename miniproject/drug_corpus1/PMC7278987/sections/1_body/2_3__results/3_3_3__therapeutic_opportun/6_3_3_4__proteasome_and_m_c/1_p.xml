<p>The proteasome inhibitor MG132 has been shown to reduce cytokine levels and improve survival and lung histology in a SARS murine model [
 <xref rid="B56-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The authors did not propose a strong explanation for this effect of MG132, but the reported anti-inflammatory [
 <xref rid="B96-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>] and anti-viral internalization effects [
 <xref rid="B97-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>] of the proteasome inhibitors may be the mechanisms underlying it. Interestingly, MG132 has been used in recent studies to counteract the effects induced by PLP [

 <xref rid="B55-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. This, taken together with the results in the recentmurine model of DUB-mutated PLP2 in murine hepatitis [
