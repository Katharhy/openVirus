<p>As previously mentioned, a number of drugs are already used or under clinical evaluation for the treatment of COVID-19. This includes the anti-malaria agent hydroxychloroquine, several antiretrovirals, as well as interferon and tocilizumab [

 <xref rid="B12-ijms-21-03492" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Importantly, because the structure of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV PLPs has been solved using crystallography, this has allowed for high throughput molecular screenings for the identification of a number of PLP inhibitors, that showed activity against viral replication in cells [

In a recent report, molecular modeling and high-throughput screening methods of 30,000 molecules were used to identify inhibitors against the MERS-CoV PLP.
