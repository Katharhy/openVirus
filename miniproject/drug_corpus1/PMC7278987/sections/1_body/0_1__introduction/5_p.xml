<p>The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is a key regulator of protein homeostasis. The pathway to proteasomal degradation consists of a group of enzymes called ubiquitin (Ub) ligases, that attach ubiquitin moieties to target proteins. The addition of ubiquitin serves as a highly specific destruction tag, where ubiquitinated proteins are trafficked to the proteasome for degradation. A reverse pathway involving ubiquitin removal also exists and is mediated by the action of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) that catalyze the removal of Ub from tagged proteins [

While proteasome targeting tends to involve poly-Ub chains containing Ub moieties linked via isopeptide bonds at lysine residue 48 (K48) of Ub, other Ub linkages (particularly K63) and Ub-like modifications (i.e., sumoylation, NEDDylation and ISGylation) are involved in signal transduction and the regulation of immune responses. It is of no surprise that viruses, including coronaviruses, often use modulation of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like modifiers to evade the host cell immune response [
