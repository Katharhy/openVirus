<p>Based on these numbers, the majority of the world’s health care systems are ill-equipped to deal with the surge of patients requiring hospitalization without taking additional measures to prevent system collapse. There is an immediate concern that the mortality rate could increase further due to a lack of available intensive care unit beds required to treat severe cases. Furthermore, since no large clinical trial has been possible considering the timescale of the pandemic, there is no consensus on how to treat severe cases of COVID-19 viral pneumonia. Thus far, all evidence of treatment options are derived from a few case experiences during the SARS and MERS epidemics, from administrations made in special cases based on analogy with other diseases, intuitions and experimental therapy of some pathological features/symptoms [

As we are in the rising part of an epidemic time/contagion graph, with a significant proportion of the world’s population under restrictions or quarantine, the identification of therapeutic options for treating severe cases of COVID-19 is of paramount importance.
