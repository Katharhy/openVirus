<p id="p0310">It is well understood that COVID-19 outbreak and current policies are based on regulations; the main strategy worldwide mirrors and expands the strategy used in the prior SARS pandemic to limit the spread of the pandemic: ‘Stay at home’/quarantine. This approach primarily does not account for human real-life needs scenarios, lacks realism as a directive for subsequent new viral epidemics or pandemics, does not provide the protections afforded by ‘herd immunity, does not meet current and future needs in health and safety of the global population, and adversely impacts development of production and economy worldwide. The only advantages are 1) flattening the contagion curve through social distancing and lockdowns and 2) avoiding hospitals (and Intensive Care Units) overwhelmed by Covid-19 cases.</p>
