<p id="p0325">As of mid-March 2020, many countries in the world are on partial lockdown to control the pandemic (COVID-19) spread, and the only effective ‘treatments’ at this time are good hygiene (washing hands), wearing a mask, and quarantine. Although quarantine may reduce the spread of the virus, it may impose the self-medication at home for chronic diseases without medical diagnosis and treatment, increase the risk of adverse complications of cardiovascular, metabolic, autoimmune and psychiatric diseases, shifting thus the health cost from public providers to patients. Scientists in fields of public policy have presented combined tactical and strategic treatment approaches that aimed at preventing and reversing COVID-19 and other diseases, including treatment repurposing as well. Optimally, the tactical and strategic approach components would be implemented in parallel, to provide benefit from the synergies of the combined approach This combined approach would allow the vulnerable to survive the near-term potentially lethal effects of SARS-CoV-2 exposure through tactical treatments, and would allow the most vulnerable and the larger population to be more resistant to future viral attacks of all types through strategic treatments (
