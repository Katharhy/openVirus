<p id="p0330">The immune system is remarkably dynamic throughout life in relation to its componentsâ€™ number and its function. Interestingly, older adults exhibit a decline in immune function -known as immunosenescence-resulting in increased susceptibility to infectious diseases and a higher risk of serious complications than younger people, reflecting altered acquired and innate immunity (

Immune function may be improved in immune competent adults, particularly those over 65 years old, by restoring deficient micronutrients, such as vitamins A, C, D, E, B2, B6, and B12, folic acid, iron, selenium, and zinc to optimal (
