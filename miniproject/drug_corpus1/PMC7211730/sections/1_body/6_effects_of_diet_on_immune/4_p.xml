<p id="p0340">The Western-type diet (described as a diet rich in processed sugars, trans- and saturated-fats, but low in complex carbohydrates, fibers, micronutrients, and other bioactive molecules such as polyphenols and omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids) has been shown to predispose to inflammation, likely by increasing the uptake of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from gut microbes secondary to altered gut permeability and increased leakiness (

 <xref rid="bib198" ref-type="bibr">Zinöcker and Lindseth, 2018</xref>). Although activation of TLR4 by LPS may cause inflammatory response, a number of nutrients, such as long-chain omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, have been shown to thwart TLR4 activation, thus attenuating inflammation (

In contrast, a Mediterranean-type diet, which is rich in certain foods (vegetables, fruit, nuts, legumes, fish, ‘healthy’ dietary fats such as virgin olive oil), has been shown to be associated with lower risk for chronic diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders (
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Dinu et al., 2018</xref>). These effects have been attributed to immune-modulation and the anti-inflammatory properties of various polyphenols and other bioactive compounds inherent to these foods, especially fruits and vegetables (

Νutrients from genetically modified organisms (GMOs) affect the adaptive immune response because the cellular ability for specific recognition of a genetically modified protein is lacking. There is no ‘memory’ on repeated exposure, resulting in allergic reactions observed in consumers after consuming modified plants. One example is the “Starlink” maize, which was engineered with genetic information from Bacillus thuringiensis to increase the plant's resistance to various insects (

 <xref rid="bib194" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Except for xenobiotic and GMOs allergenicity, there are genetic hazards arising from the inserted gene, its expressed protein per se, and secondary or pleiotropic effects on other gene expression. This results in disruption of natural genes in the manipulated organism (
