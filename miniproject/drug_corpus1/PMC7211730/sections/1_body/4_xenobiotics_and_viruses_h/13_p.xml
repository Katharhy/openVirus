<p id="p0300">In addition, given that SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells is mainly mediated by the endocytic pathway, chloroquine seems effective in blocking endocytosis and/or inducing viral entrapment into the lysosome. The latter can be achieved by neutralizing the endosomal pH, thus favoring virus–endosome fusion, inhibit lysosomal protease activity, and prevent the cleavage of S protein and therefore viral entry into the host cell (

 <sup>+</sup> T-cell activity to viral antigens. In addition, it blocks phosphorylation (activation) of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and caspase-1 (

Moreover, chloroquine affects immune system activity by mediating an anti-inflammatory response, which might reduce damage due to the cytokine storm. Chloroquine inhibits IL-1β mRNA expression in THP-1 cells, reduces IL-1β release, IL-1 and IL-6 cytokines in monocytes/macrophages, and IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, TNFα, IL-6 and IL-12 gene expression (
