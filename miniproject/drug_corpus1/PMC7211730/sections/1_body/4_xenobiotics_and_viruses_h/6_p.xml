<p id="p0265">Viral infections and chemical exposures can produce pro-inflammatory mediators that, if sustained over time, result in chronic inflammation in target organs. This condition often entails tissue damage, increased mutation rate and genomic instability, which represents a cancer-prone microenvironment (

In cardiovascular morbidity, xenobiotics and viruses have been found to increase chemokines, cytokines, heart mitochondrial GPx activity, DNA damage, cholesterolemia, expression of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and pro-coagulant activity, ROS, TNF-α and TGF-β, protein and lipid oxidation in heart cells, endothelial dysfunction, and decreased mitochondrial GSH levels, resulting in hyper-coagulability and thrombosis (
