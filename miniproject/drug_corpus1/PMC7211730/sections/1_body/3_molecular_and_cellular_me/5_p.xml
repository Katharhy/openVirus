<p id="p0230">ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) have shown to up-regulate ACE2 expression in animal studies, thus increasing the availability of target molecules for SARS-CoV-2. These considerations have led to speculation that ACE inhibitors and ARBs might be harmful in patients with Covid-19. However, a number of studies conducted in different populations and with different designs have come to the conclusion that ACE inhibitors and ARBs are unlikely to be harmful in patients with Covid-19 (
