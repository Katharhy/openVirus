<p id="p0240">The Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) signaling pathway is evolutionarily conserved and functionally linked to innate immunity. Signaling results in nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF-κB, which regulates the expression of distinct genes in immunity or development (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Anthoney et al., 2018</xref>). TLR has been implicated in the pathogenesis of airway disease resulting from respiratory virus infections, with TLR signaling leading to the activation of type I interferons (IFN-α and IFN-β), proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF, IFN-γ, and CCL5), and interferon-stimulated genes (
 <xref rid="bib159" ref-type="bibr">Totura et al., 2015</xref>). The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the TLR activates the its downstream signaling pathway, causing the release of pro-IL-1β (which is cleaved by caspase-1). This is followed by inflammasome activation and production of active mature IL-1β, which is a mediator of lung inflammation, fever and fibrosis (
