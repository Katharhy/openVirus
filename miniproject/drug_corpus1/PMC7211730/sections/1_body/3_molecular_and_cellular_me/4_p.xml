<p id="p0225">ACE2 is highly expressed in the lung, where it appears to exert a protective role in acute lung injury as loss of pulmonary ACE2 function has been associated with acute lung injury. Hence, the binding of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 neutralizes the advantageous physiological effects of this enzyme. Attenuation of ACE2 catalytic function alters RAAS system activity, resulting in enhanced inflammation and vascular permeability observed in the pathogenesis of inflammatory lung disease, eventually leading to acute lung injury and adult respiratory distress syndrome as observed in patients with severe COVID-19 (

Indeed, when angiotensin I and angiotensin II receptors (AT1R and AT2R, respectively) are activated, they lead to the increased expression of proinflammatory mediators (e.g., IL-6), triggering an inflammatory process in the lungs and other organs. In particular, AT1R activates the transcription factors NF-kB and activator protein 1 (AP-1), which in turn increases cytokine expression, apoptosis, vasoconstriction, fibroproliferation, retention of Na+, and the enhancement of lung injury. The endogenous angiotensin II inhibits alveolar fluid clearance and dysregulates epithelial Na
 <sup>+</sup> channel (ENaC) expression via AT1R, contributing to alveolar filling and pulmonary edema (
