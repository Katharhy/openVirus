<p id="p0060">Chronic exposure to environmental chemicals has been shown to suppress or enhance immune responsiveness, depending on factors such as dose, timing, and route of exposure. For example, environmental immunology has led to the understanding of how xenobiotics (such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)) acting via immunomodulatory signaling pathways, and specifically the aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AhR), may adversely affect the developing immune system (which seems to be more sensitive to environmental insults than the adult immune system (

Immunotoxicology can also be beneficial in investigating whether an epidemic/pandemic, or a chronic disease, is idiopathic or a deterministic event reflecting cumulative adverse effects on the immune system. Understanding the impact of environmental toxic stimuli on the immune response ultimately contributes to improving public health.
