<p id="p0155">Exposure to a wide array of environmental chemicals, such as pesticides, heavy metals, and endocrine disruptors, may also affect the developing immune system. Pesticides, such as organochlorines (chlordane and DDT/DDE) organophosphates (diazinon) and carbamates (carbofuran) have been shown to induce developmental immunotoxicity (

The use of lead as a petrol additive, or more generally as an environmental contaminant, has adverse effects on the immune system, since the immune system appears to be quite sensitive to lead. Lead-induced skewing of immune responses has the potential to alter the incidence of asthma, autoimmunity, infectious diseases, or cancer (
