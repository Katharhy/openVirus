<p id="p0145">Immunological development is dependent on both genetic and environmental influences (
 <xref rid="bib169" ref-type="bibr">Vassilopoulou et al., 2017</xref>). Both cellular and humoral immunity are factors that drive inter-individual variation in correlation with age, gender, and season. They all play a major role in shaping the immune profile analogous to lymphoid and myeloid cell level, B cell subsets, and Ig levels, or T cell immune traits as compared to the B cell immune traits. All these parameters are sensitive to toxic environmental exposures, especially in the adult immune system. The developing immune system can also be disrupted by early-life environmental insults, which may adversely affect the health of the exposed offspring later in life. These adverse effects could extend to following generations through epigenetic inheritance, thus weakening future generationsâ€™ bodily defenses against infections (

The increased risk for injury to the developing immune system has been shown across several categories of drugs, chemicals, as well as heavy metals, some metalloids and mold toxins, through perinatal genome reprogramming, increasing the risk for adverse immune outcomes persisting into later life (

In particular, exposure to AhR agonists may cause persistent changes to immune responses that can affect subsequent generations, meaning that the environment of prior generations shapes susceptibility to pathogens and antiviral immunity in later generations (
