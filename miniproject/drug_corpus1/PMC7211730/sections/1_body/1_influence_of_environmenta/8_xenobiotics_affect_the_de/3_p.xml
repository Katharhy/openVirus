<p id="p0150">Developmental exposure to AhR-activating chemicals perturbs immune cell development, resulting in attenuated hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation and long-term self-renewal (
 <xref rid="bib144" ref-type="bibr">Sakurai et al., 2017</xref>). It also results in delicate deviations in the architecture of the crystal structure of AhR, thus contributing to increased incidence of autoimmunity and decreased responsiveness to infectious pathogens in later life, via gradual and long-term repression of AhR-mediated gene transcription (
 <xref rid="bib144" ref-type="bibr">Sakurai et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, long-term activation of AhR by TCDD has been shown to induce epigenetic changes in lymphocytes, especially T cells, leading to DNA hypermethylation and resulting in decreased CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell antiviral immunity (

 <sup>+</sup> T cell response to viral infection in the lung, resulting in more significant broncho-pulmonary inflammation and reduced antiviral immunity (
