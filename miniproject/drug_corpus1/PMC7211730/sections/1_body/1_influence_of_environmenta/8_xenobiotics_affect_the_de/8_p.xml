<p id="p0175">The degree to which xenobiotics deregulate immune responses depends on cell-type and maturational state, especially in vulnerable population groups. Both inflammatory and regulatory gene expressions via cross-talk between transcriptional (e.g. AhR and NF-ÎºB), xenobiotic response elements activation and other posttranslational and epigenetic alterations, together with viral immunotoxicological engagements, contribute to unwanted complications on macrophages, dendritic cells, the cytolytic activity of murine NK cells, innate lymphoid cells and Foxp3
