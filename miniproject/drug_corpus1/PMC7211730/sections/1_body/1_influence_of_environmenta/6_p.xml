<p id="p0070">Xenobiotics, whether natural or anthropogenic, can readily interact with the immune system, leading to a suppressed or enhanced immune responsiveness (
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Fenga et al., 2017</xref>). Of increasing concern is the observed reduced immune response to viral and bacterial infection, as well as myelosuppression and thymic dysfunction. For example, coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins have been shown to mediate their effect via the AhR. Such effects include diminished humoral antibody responses, humoral immune suppression (
