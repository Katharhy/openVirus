<p id="p0095">AhR canonical and noncanonical signaling pathways can regulate master regulatory transcriptional factors, such as the nuclear factor (NF)-κB promoter and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT). These transcriptional factors regulate the general transcriptional machinery to induce transcriptional, post-translational and epigenetic expression of selective inflammatory genes (

 <sup>2+</sup> concentrations that drive cardiac and skeletal muscle pathology. This sequence leads to downstream pro-inflammatory responses mediated by c-src, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), and C–C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CCL1) (
