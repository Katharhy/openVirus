<p id="p0075">The AhR is an evolutionarily ancient protein that can be activated or inhibited by various types of exogenous and endogenous ligands. While AhR canonical signaling has been identified as a primary mediator of biological responsiveness to environmental chemicals, alternative signaling events are increasingly being understood to mediate the physiological effects of AhR (
 <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Khazaal et al., 2018</xref>). AhR is a cytosolic signal sensor and transcription factor that translocates into the nucleus upon binding to planar aromatic hydrocarbons. In addition, AhR signaling is intricately involved in fine-tuning distinct immune responses, particularly at environmental interfaces where endogenous and exogenous AhR ligands accumulate (

Notably, ligands with differential AhR agonist activity may have opposing effects on Th cell differentiation, demonstrating the finely tuned regulation of this transcription factor at the ligand-binding level (
