<p id="p0140">Macrophages are critical for the development of inflammatory processes. These cells express the AhR, and several studies have corroborated their activation by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)
 <italic>,</italic> to produce and release modulatory chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines (

AhR activation by TCDD has been shown to decrease survival after infection with a nonlethal dose of influenza A virus, concomitant with doubling of pulmonary neutrophil influx and suppression of expansion and differentiation of virus-specific effector CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells (

 <xref rid="bib140" ref-type="bibr">Roca et al., 2013</xref>). COPD affects approximately 200 million people worldwide and is globally one of the leading causes of death. Smoking, biomass burning, air pollution, and inhalation of fine dust are contributing factors to COPD and atmospheric particulate matter —a known carrier of AhR ligands— can aggravate COPD (
