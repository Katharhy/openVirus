<p id="p0370">Global health cost and COVID-19 effects on the world economy, health systems, and production are massive currently, and will be far more massive when a final accounting is performed. We recommend application of massive COVID-19 screening tests as an important step for properly 1) recording the extent of the COVID-19 outbreak and, through evidence-based corrective actions, 2) delaying the spread of the pandemic. Given the guidance of the health authorities to transfer COVID-19 patients into hospitals only when presenting fever and dyspnea, it appears that for all admitted patients, and especially for ICU patients, the inflammosome is already at an advanced stage precluding effective treatment. Accordingly, novel AhR-mediated immunotherapies for a plethora of immune-associated diseases/disorders should be pursued.</p>
