<p id="p0375">Conclusively, additional common safety factors need to be added when calculating COVID-19 prevalence and infectivity, including the cooperation of healthcare providers and the scientific community experts. The use of a self-managed qualitative and quantitative evaluator for COVID-19 spread is also a realistic suggestion, keeping in mind that the increased incidence in COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, Spain, Iran, Turkey, USA and United Kingdom appears to have a close correlation to probably inadequate and delayed implementation of uniform antivirus measures, despite the socio-economic, racial, demographic, cultural and administrative characteristics of each country. New investigations into both genetic and environmental fields of immunotoxicology will advance our understanding of immune function, provide the foundation for the development of novel immunotherapeutics and, more importantly, decrease the effect of immunological risk factors.</p>
