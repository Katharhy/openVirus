<p id="p0365">While several animal species may harbor SARS-CoV-2, the precise animal reservoir has yet to be confirmed. It seems likely that a spike mutation, which probably occurred in late November 2019, triggered transmission of the virus to humans (

Τhe current anti- SARS-CoV-2 therapies used in some patients have been unable to counteract disease progression and to save patients’ lives. Since the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 is highly conserved, it could be a target for antiviral (anti-S2) drugs; however, the potential for viral mutations may be responsible for future disease relapses (
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Cascella et al., 2020</xref>). In this study, we emphasize that in addition to the urgent measures that are necessary to interrupt the coronavirus transmission from farming animals to humans, there is also a need to improve the current global strategy for energy management and other factors that may adversely affect the immune system of the human, and thereby increase the risk of both infectious and chronic-degenerative diseases. Exposures to large classes of xenobiotics have a triple impact on the immune system. First, xenobiotics promote immunomodulatory effects in immune cells. Second, xenobiotics increase the range of immunotoxicity of human-associated micro-organisms or new viral and microbial attacks. Third, xenobiotics may reduce vaccine efficacy.
