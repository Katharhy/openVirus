<p id="p0190">In nanotoxicology, numerous studies clearly demonstrate that multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and inhaled particulate matter (PM) induce lung injury (

MWCNT and PM can also exacerbate asthma-like conditions via innate pathways such as TLRs that trigger the generation of IL-25, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). MWCNT also induce epithelial damage resulting in IL-33 release, which in turn promotes innate lymphoid cell recruitment and the development of IL-13-dependent inflammatory response (
