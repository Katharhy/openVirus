The pesticidal loosening of tight junctions increases the intestinal permeability and disrupts the integrity of vasogenic homeostasis and vascular permeability, thus increasing translocation of bacteria to distal organs and resulting in bacterial infectivity (

Pesticides also disrupt redox biology, reduce antioxidant enzyme activities, increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress, which may impact the immune system function because of the cross-talk between oxidative and pro-inflammatory pathways. In addition, pesticides can induce ATP and energy depletion and DNA instability through DNA damage or epigenetic alterations, sister chromatid exchanges, telomere shortening, diverse mutations, and premature cell death, which also impact the immune system function (
