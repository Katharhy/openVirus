<p>Flavonoid compounds have received many rewards by showing their potential in medicinal chemistry. Dihydrorugosaflavonoids belong to the same class and display their potential to inhibit CHIKV replication. In conclusion, it could be explicated that halogenated dihydrorugosaflavonoids with the appropriate modifications are deserving candidates for additional study to find out the accurate facts of their mechanism of action and effective anti-CHIKV therapeutics.</p>
