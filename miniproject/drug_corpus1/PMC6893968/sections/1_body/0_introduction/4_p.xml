<p>Despite the increasing number of chikungunya patients, haplessly, to date, no antiviral remedy or vaccine is available in the market for the cure of CHIKV-infected patients. Some CHIKV vaccine approaches have been analyzed, together with inefficient, live weakened, and DNA chimeric vaccines. However, questions associated with protection and efficiency have stalled the development of current vaccine entrants.

 </sup> Besides, drugs testified via in vitro screening of chloroquine, ribavirin, and arbidol to curb CHIKV progress have failed to produce noteworthy therapeutic aids in clinical samples.

 </sup> In the recent past, high-throughput assays have been established to figure out probable inhibitors of CHIKV. Literature search has provided the information regarding analysis of 356 natural product molecules and clinically recommended medicines to counteract CHIKV replicon, and an accompanying test with the surrogate infection model of Semliki Forest virus (SFV),
