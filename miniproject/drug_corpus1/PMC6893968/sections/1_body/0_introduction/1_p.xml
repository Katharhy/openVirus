 </sup> Concerning the data obtained from the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP, India), the number of infected people identified in April 2018 was 9175, 4875 from Karnataka following 1375 from Gujarat and 966 from Maharashtra. Earlier research studies have shown that there is considerable resource burden from chikungunya outbreaks, which escalates in monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Therefore, cases of chikungunya viral fever have increased in the continent of Asia and various parts of the world. The name chikungunya originates from “Makonde”, meaning “to become twisted”. It denotes the “curved” appearance of those going through joint ache as a result of chikungunya infection. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) spreads by mosquito vectors 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>. The common eukaryotic hosts are primates and humans. In humans, the symptoms associated with CHIKV are nausea, fever, joint pain, vomiting, rashes, and persistent arthralgia. Clinical manifestation is one of the bases for the diagnosis of chikungunya infection, but the confirmation of disease can only be made after laboratory tests. Suspected cases are validated by positive anti-Chikungunya virus IgM or IgG results or by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results.
