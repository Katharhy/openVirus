<p>In this study, the docking potential of dihydrorugosaflavonoid derivatives with the macrodomain of nsP3 and their antiviral potential against CHIKV are reported. Based on the outcomes of antiviral screening using CHIKV-infected Vero cells, the dihydrorugosaflavonoids were assessed with several assays. The cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition and plaque reduction assays were conducted to determine the inhibitory potential of compounds on CHIKV replication, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to assess the reduction of viral RNA levels in the infected cells. An immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was carried out to investigate the reduction in CHIKV antigen upon treatment with the screened compounds.</p>
