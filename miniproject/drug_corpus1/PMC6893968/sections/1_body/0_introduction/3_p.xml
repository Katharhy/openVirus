<p>Crystallographic studies and cryoelectron microscopy of different alphaviruses and their proteins deliver vital information regarding the molecular organization and the distribution of the virion structural portions.

 </sup> Encapsidated by 240 copies of CP, the RNA genome of CHIKV makes the nucleocapsid core.

 </sup> The grown-up alphavirus virion (70 nm in diameter) has an envelope, which is derived from the host, having

 </sup> CHIKV bears a genome of almost ∼11.7 kb, polyadenylated at the 3′ end and capped at the 5′ end. The non-structural polyproteins (nsP1234) are encoded by the 5′ two-third open reading frame (ORF) of the genome. The three chief structural proteins (capsid (C), E1, and E2) are encoded by the 3′ one-third ORF of the genome.

 </sup> The functioning of non-structural protein (nsP) promotes the construction of distinct mature non-structural proteins (nsp1–4). nsP1 is the capping enzyme, nsP2 is the viral helicase and protease, and nsP4 is RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which has an intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain.

 </sup> The role of nsP3 was not very well defined. However, recently, McPherson et al.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>
 </sup> have reported that CHIKV’s nsP3 macrodomain hydrolyzes ADP-ribose groups from mono(ADP-ribosyl)ated proteins and the activity of nsP3 mono(ADP-ribosyl)hydrolase is somewhere decisive for CHIKV replication and virulence in mice. At the N-terminus, nsP3 encompasses a very preserved MacroD-type macrodomain. The protein fold in the macrodomain is remarkably conserved, which is present in numerous plus-strand RNA viruses, and it attaches to ADP-ribose. Mutant viruses missing hydrolase activity were incapable of replicating in mammalian BHK-21 cells or mosquito, 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic>, cells and quickly regressed the catalytically inactivated mutants.
