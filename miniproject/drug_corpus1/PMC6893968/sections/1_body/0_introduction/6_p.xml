<p>Due to nonavailability of the antiviral drug against CHIKV, mostly natural compounds have been subjected to screening for antiviral activity to obtain lead molecules using high-throughput assays.

 </sup> Therefore, in this study, we have checked the antiviral potential of our compounds against the CHIKV. First, using molecular docking, the target site for the compounds was identified in CHIKV. The non-structural viral proteins have a crucial role in the replication and survival of CHIKV. Among nsP1–nsP4, nsP3 has a natural ligand ADP-ribose that binds to its macrodomain, which is highly conserved.

 </sup> The docking of these compounds into the nsP3 macrodomain indicated that the halogenated dihydrorugosaflavonoids interacted and fitted more effectively in its pocket. This binding property of halogenated dihydrorugosaflavonoids with nsP3 invigorated us to screen these compounds for antiviral efficacy against CHIKV.
