<p>In Togaviridae family, CHIKV comes under the genus Alphavirus. Alphaviruses are configured as enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. There are 29 members in the alphavirus genus; some members of the genus contain several animal and human viruses like Ross River virus, Sindbis virus (SINV), Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV), Semiliki Forest virus (SFV), Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), etc. They are furthermore categorized into Old World and New World viruses reliant on the changes that occurred in their life cycle, fatality, and clinical manifestations. Basically, the Old World viruses CHIKV, SINV, SFV, etc. engage the protein nsp2 to downregulate the host cell transcription, have less demise percentage, and stimulate arthralgia. The New World viruses VEEV, WEEV, etc. use virus capsid protein (CP) to downregulate the host cell transcription, have high casualty frequency, and generate encephalitis.</p>
