<p>The effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) of 
 <bold>5c</bold> and 
 <bold>5d</bold> was determined from antiviral curves. The EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 5c compound was 26.14 μM (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>a) with a selectivity index (CC
 <sub>50</sub>/EC
 <sub>50</sub>) of 4.33 (CC
 <sub>50</sub> = 113.4 μM (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>a)). The EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 5d compound was 28.39 μM (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>b; selectivity index = 4.19; CC
 <sub>50</sub> = 119 μM (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>b)). The reported EC
 <sub>50</sub> values are the means of two experiments, which are performed in triplicates. It clearly shows that 4′-halogenated dihydrorugosaflavonoids (
 <bold>5c</bold> and 
 <bold>5d</bold>) possess better inhibitory potential than other substituted dihydrorugosaflavonoid compounds for CHIKV.
