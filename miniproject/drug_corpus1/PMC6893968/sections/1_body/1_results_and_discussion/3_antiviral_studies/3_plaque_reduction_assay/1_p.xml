<p>The reduction in the CHIKV infectivity in the presence of 
 <bold>5c</bold> and 
 <bold>5d</bold> compounds was assessed by plaque reduction assay. In the case of 
 <bold>5c</bold>-compound-treated CHIKV, virus inhibition was observed nearly up to 95% at 70 μM, 88% at 50 μM, and 80% at 30 μM concentration, while 
 <bold>5d</bold>-treated-CHIKV showed 92% at 70 μM, 86% at 50 μM, and 84% at 30 μM, as compared to control (

 <bold>5a</bold>, 
 <bold>5b</bold>, 
 <bold>5e</bold>, and 
 <bold>5f</bold>) did not show inhibition of CHIKV.
