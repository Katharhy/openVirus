<p>Immunofluorescence staining allows rapid diagnosis of viral antigen in the infected cell using monoclonal antibodies against the virus-specific antigen. One of the two envelope glycoproteins present in the chikungunya virus named E2 glycoprotein has been used as the viral antigen in this study for virus detection by IFA. Here, CHIKV at an MOI of 1 was propagated in Vero cells for 36 h with 
 <bold>5c</bold> and 
 <bold>5d</bold> compounds at 70 and 50 μM concentrations. IFA measured detection of the intracellular virus with an envelope-specific monoclonal antibody (E2 mAb). Additionally, no E2-expression was visualized in a negative control sample, while CHIKV-infected cells were positive for E2-expression.

 </xref> clearly shows that both 
 <bold>5c</bold> and 
 <bold>5d</bold> compounds inhibited CHIKV at 70 and 50 μM concentrations.
