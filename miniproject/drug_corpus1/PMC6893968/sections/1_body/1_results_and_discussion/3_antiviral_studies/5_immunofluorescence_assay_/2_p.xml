<p>Due to nonavailability of an antiviral drug or vaccine against CHIKV, various approaches have been considered all over the world to identify the lead molecules restricting CHIKV infection or replication. In this piece of work, molecular docking of dihydrorugosaflavonoids with nsP3 showed their interaction with the key residues of nsP3 that bind ADP, which supports the possibility and indicates that these compounds are potential antivirals for CHIKV. This is confirmed in this study by performing various antiviral assays. The CPE and plaque reduction assay displayed that compounds 
 <bold>5c</bold> and 
 <bold>5d</bold> potentially inhibit CHIKV infection. Further, qRT-PCR assay results clearly show the potential of these two compounds in the suppression of viral RNA levels in infected cells. Furthermore, the antiviral activity of dihydrorugosaflavonoids toward CHIKV is also well delivered by IFA.
