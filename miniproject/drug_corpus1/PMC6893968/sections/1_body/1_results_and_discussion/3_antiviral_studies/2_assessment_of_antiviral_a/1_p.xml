<p>After evaluation of MNTD for both the compounds, the different non-cytotoxic concentrations of 
 <bold>5c</bold> and 
 <bold>5d</bold> compounds were screened on virus-infected Vero cells to find out the possible effects of the compounds. Viral-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) assay was evaluated at 48 hpi (
