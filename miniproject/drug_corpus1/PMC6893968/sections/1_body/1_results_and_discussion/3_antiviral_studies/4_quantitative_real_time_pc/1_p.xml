<p>Conventional RT-PCR methods are still one of the reliable diagnostic methods for studying viral load in supernatants and clinical samples. Here, qRT-PCR was used for validating the antiviral effect of 
 <bold>5c</bold> and 
 <bold>5d</bold> by quantifying CHIKV RNA levels in the infected cells. The reduction in the viral RNA level was observed when treated with 
 <bold>5c</bold> and 
 <bold>5d</bold> compounds at 24 hpi. The CHIKV RNA levels upon treatment with 70 and 50 μM 
 <bold>5c</bold> were reduced to closely 95 and 90%, respectively, whereas in case of 
 <bold>5d</bold>, with 70 and 50 μM, the RNA levels of CHIKV were reduced to ∼ 93 and 91%, respectively (
