<p>The tetrazolium-based cell viability assay was conducted to investigate and detect the maximum nontoxic dose (MNTD) for both the compounds 
 <bold>5c</bold> and 
 <bold>5d</bold>. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay is dependent on the reaction of water-soluble compound (MTT) with an insoluble formazan product by viable cells with active metabolic activity. Thus, the color produced due to the formation of formazan is a suitable marker of only viable cells. Different concentrations of the 
 <bold>5c</bold> and 
 <bold>5d</bold> compounds were assessed by MTT assay at 24 h. Both compounds did not display toxicity up to 85 μM as &gt;70% of Vero cells were viable (

 </xref>a,b). Half-maximal cytotoxicity (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated from the plotted graph and represented as a dotted line. So, all of the antiviral assays were performed using 30–70 μM concentration of both the compounds.
