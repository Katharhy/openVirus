 </sup> All of the synthesized compounds have dissimilarities in ring B. The ring A has a hydroxyl group at the 7
 <sup>th</sup> position and an ester group at the 5th position. Rest of the changes are only in ring B with differently substituted benzene. They were obtained during the synthesis of analogues of rugosaflavonoid (
 <bold>6a</bold>â€“
 <bold>f</bold>) as an intermediate before the synthesis of the final product (
