<p>The nsP3 has three key domains, a central zinc-binding region, a very conserved N-terminal macrodomain, and a poorly conserved, not properly structured acidic and highly phosphorylated C-terminal domain. The functions of various cellular proteins to influence signaling, stress granule assembly, and viral replication are controlled by the C-terminal domain.

 </sup> The exact role of the central zinc-binding region and N-terminal macrodomain is not well categorized. Macrodomains are known to have a conserved protein fold detected from archaea to higher eukaryotes considered for their affinity to the small molecule ADP-ribose and its analogues. In positive-strand RNA viruses such as alphaviruses, coronaviruses, and hepatitis E virus, the macrodomains are the integral part of the nsPs.

 </sup> the molecular understanding of the particular binding of ADP-ribose to the CHIKV nsP3 macrodomain revealed that nsP3 amino acids Asp 10, Ile 11, Asn 24, Asp 31, Gly 32, Val 33, Cys 34, Ser 110–Tyr 114, Val 133, and Arg 144 act as the critical residues in the binding pocket, which make molecular contacts with the ligand. Also, the ribose and diphosphate units of the ADP-ribose were found to play a significant role in making molecular contacts with the amino acid residues of nsP3 in the CHIKV nsP3–ADP-ribose complex (
