 </xref>c). The carbonyl oxygen of ring C formed hydrogen bonds with Ser 110, Thr 111, and Gly 112. Asp 10 and Ile 11 are also nearby. Val 33 interacted with ring oxygen. 
 <bold>5c</bold> also showed bonding with Leu 109. Thr 114 interacted with the carboxylate group attached with ring A. All of these amino acid residues of the binding pocket are critical and are also active in the binding of nsp3 macrodomain with ADP-ribose (
