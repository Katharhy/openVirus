<p>The bromo derivative of rugosaflavonoid (
 <bold>5d</bold>) showed binding in the potential site pocket of the nsp3 macrodomain and showed interactions with Asn 24, Gly 112, and Asp 31 (

 </xref>d). The docking scores of 
 <bold>5c</bold> and 
 <bold>5d</bold> were found to be −7.54 and −6.86 kcal mol
 <sup>–1</sup>, respectively (

 </xref>). These effective binding interactions (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">2</xref>
 </xref>) indicate that these compounds may interfere with the function of nsP3 macrodomain and thus inhibit the replication of CHIKV. Therefore, to evaluate the inhibitory potential of halogenated dihydrorugosaflavonoids against CHIKV, the antiviral assays were performed using Vero cell lines by observing the cytopathic effect (CPE), plaque reduction assay, the quantification of the viral genome RNA by qRT-PCR, and using immunofluorescence imaging.
