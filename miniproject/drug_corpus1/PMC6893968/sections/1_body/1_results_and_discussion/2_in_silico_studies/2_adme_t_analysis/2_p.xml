 </sup> values of parameters such as QP log Po/w, QP log HERG, QPP Caco, QP log BB, QPP MDCK, QP log Kp, QP log K
 <sub>hsa</sub>, and percentage of human oral absorption are shown for compounds 
 <bold>5a</bold>–
 <bold>f</bold>. QP log Po/w reports the expected octanol/water partition coefficient. Its range should be −2 to 6.5. The values for 
 <bold>5a</bold>–
 <bold>f</bold> obtained were between 2.2 and 2.7. QP log HERG predicts IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for the blockage of HERG K+ channels. Its defined range is above −5.0. The values obtained for dihydrorugosaflavonids were between −4.7 and −4.8, which are above −5.0. QPP Caco gives an idea about the apparent Caco-2 cell permeability in nm s
 <sup>–1</sup>. The Caco-2 cell is a model for the gut–blood barrier. Below 25, it is considered as poor, and above 500, it is considered as significantly good. Its computational values for compounds 
 <bold>5a</bold>–
 <bold>f</bold> were found to be between 318 and 411, which are not great but not poor also. QP log BB calculates the brain–blood partition coefficient. Its acceptable range is −3 to 1.2. The compounds (
 <bold>5a</bold>–
 <bold>f</bold>) under study showed these values from −1.13 to −0.76. QPP MDCK predicts apparent MDCK cell permeability in nm s
 <sup>–1</sup>/MDCK cell, which is identified to be a good imitator for the blood–brain barrier. Its acceptable range is 25–500. Its values for dihydrorugosaflavonoids (
 <bold>5a</bold>–
 <bold>f</bold>) were obtained between 150 and 465. QP log KP predicts the skin permeability. Its acceptable range is −8 to −1.0. For compounds 
 <bold>5a</bold>–
 <bold>f</bold>, its values were obtained between −2.9 and −2.1. QP log K
 <sub>hsa</sub> predicts affinity toward human serum albumin. Its tolerable limit is −1.5 to 1.5. For compounds 
 <bold>5a</bold>–
 <bold>f</bold>, its values ranged between 0.68 and 0.207. It is mentioned that the percentage of human oral absorption range of 25% is weak and 80% is significant. For compounds 
 <bold>5a</bold>–
 <bold>f</bold>, these values were obtained between 88.32 and 90.67. These results support that the compounds have all of the values in the acceptable range.
