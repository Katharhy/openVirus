<p>In the process of drug discovery development, various rules were considered but suffered various limitations.

 </sup> Therefore, a combination of pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK), which explains the interaction of an organism with the drug, is important to be studied. PD evaluates what the drug does to the body, and PK explains how body responds to the drug. The main components of PK are absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME), finally associated with toxicity (ADMET). Although ADME properties explain the utmost pharmacological performance of small molecules, the toxicology study ensures no injury to the organism with no side effects. According to Hodgson, “A chemical cannot be a drug, no matter how active nor how specific its action, unless it is also taken appropriately into the body (absorption), distributed to the right parts of the body, metabolized in a way that does not instantly remove its activity, and eliminated in a suitable manner—a drug must get in, move about, hang around, and then get out”.

 </sup> Haplessly, to address all of these parameters is time-consuming and cumbersome due to the intricacy of human body, where all of these parameters affect each other. It has not only limitations to interactions within the body but also several restrictions due to gender, age, genetic state, disease, etc. In this case, in silico technologies can be helpful to compute these calculations based on the mathematical algorithm used in the in silico software. Although it does not give full guaranty that it is going to work 100% in the living system, it saves our time in the selection of molecule to be considered for further studies. Therefore, ADME/T properties were studied using Qikprop software of Maestro.
