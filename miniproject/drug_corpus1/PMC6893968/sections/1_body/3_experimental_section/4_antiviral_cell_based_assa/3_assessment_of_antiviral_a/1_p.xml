<p>Vero cells were seeded onto a 24-well plate at a cell density of 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well. Cells were treated with compounds 12 h prior to infection (before infection). At MOI of 1, the cell monolayer was infected with CHIKV with gentle shaking after every 15 min for 90 min. The inoculum was discarded, and the cell monolayer was washed twice to ensure that there is no chance of secondary infection. Compounds were also added in the post-infection media containing DMEM with 2% FBS for 24 h (after infection). Infected cells were incubated with 0.1% DMSO as the negative control. After 24 hpi, the supernatant was collected for determining virus titer by plaque-forming assay. After collecting the supernatant, TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added (as per manufacturer’s protocol) to the adherent cells in a 24-well plate to isolate RNA for qRT-PCR. Furthermore, the CPE of CHIKV on the Vero cell line appeared in ∼48 h after the cell infection. Hence, the effect of inhibitory compounds on the CPE was observed after 48 hpi with an inverted light microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany). Dose–response cell viability and antiviral curves were used to determine EC
 <sub>50</sub> and CC
 <sub>50</sub>. The ratio of CC
 <sub>50</sub>/EC
 <sub>50</sub> is the selectivity index, which gave an idea of the therapeutic window of the dihydrorugosaflavonoid compounds.
