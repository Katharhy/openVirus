<p>The cytotoxicity of 
 <bold>5c</bold> and 
 <bold>5d</bold> compounds for Vero cells was measured using MTT (Sigma) in a 96-well plate format. Stocks of 
 <bold>5c</bold> and 
 <bold>5d</bold> compounds were prepared by dissolving in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and the working concentration was prepared by further diluting in culture media. At 90% confluency, the media were removed, and media containing different dilutions of compounds were added into each well. Wells with 0.1% DMSO were considered as control. After 24 h, MTT was added to each 96-well in a volume of 20 μL of 5 mg mL
 <sup>–1</sup> stock and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Upon completion of incubation, DMSO was added to dissolve formazan crystals. The absorbance was read at a wavelength of 570 nm using citation three multi-mode plate reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc.). The experiment was done in triplicates.
