For quantification of viral genome after 24 h of incubation with or without the compound, the supernatant was discarded and trizol was added to the plate. RNA was purified according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Purified RNA was treated with DNAse to remove any traces of genomic DNA (Promega) and then subsequently used for cDNA preparation using the AccuScript high fidelity cDNA synthesis kit (Agilent) with 1 μg of extracted RNA. The forward and reverse primers used for amplification
