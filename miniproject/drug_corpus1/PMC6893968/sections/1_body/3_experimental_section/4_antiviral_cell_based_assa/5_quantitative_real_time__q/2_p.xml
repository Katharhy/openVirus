<p>Negative and positive controls were included for PCR amplification. Nuclease-free water was used instead of the RNA sample as a negative control to screen possible contamination. RNA extracted from the untreated CHIKV supernatant was used as a positive control. Experiments were done in triplicate and repeated twice for accuracy of the result. PCR runs were carried out according to the standard KAPA SYBR fast universal qPCR kit on a QuantStudio 5 System (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). The cycling conditions are as follows: 95 °C for 20 s and then 40 cycles of 95 °C for 1 s and 60 °C for 20 s. Fluorescence was detected after each cycle. To analyze data, fold change difference between control samples and compound-treated samples was calculated using ΔΔCt values.</p>
