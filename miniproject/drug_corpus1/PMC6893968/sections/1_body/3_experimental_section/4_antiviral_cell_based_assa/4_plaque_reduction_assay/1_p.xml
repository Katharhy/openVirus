<p>To perform the plaque assay for measuring the virus titer, a Vero cell monolayer was seeded in 24-well plates at 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per well. 
 <bold>5c</bold> and 
 <bold>5d</bold> compound treatment and infection were the same as described in the assessment of antiviral activity. The final DMSO concentration in both the compounds was 0.01% v/v. The infected cells were treated with varying concentrations of each compound in DMEM with 2% FBS and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 24 h. At 24 hpi, the cell supernatant was harvested, and the 10-fold serial-diluted CHIKV supernatant was added to the Vero cells and incubated at 37 °C for 90 min while the untreated but virus-infected cells were taken as control. Afterward, cells were overlaid with 1% carboxymethyl cellulose in MEM with 2% FBS and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. After 48 h, the overlay medium was discarded, then the cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde for 2 h, and cells were stained with 1% crystal violet solution for plaque visualization.
