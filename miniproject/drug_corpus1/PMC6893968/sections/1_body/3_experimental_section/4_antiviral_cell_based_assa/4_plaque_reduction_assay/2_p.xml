<p>Doseâ€“response curves were generated by measuring percent inhibition in the plaque reduction assay for a particular range of compound concentrations. Varying concentrations of each compound were used to generate inhibition curves for calculating the 50% effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>). EC
 <sub>50</sub> of each compound was calculated by plotting the graph of percent inhibition of the compound at different concentrations vs. compound concentration. The plaque reduction assay was performed in triplicates for a particular concentration of the compound and was repeated twice to verify the constant inhibition results.
