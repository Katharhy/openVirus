<p>Vero cells were seeded onto a 6-well plate at a cell density of 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells per well. Cells were treated with 70 and 50 μM concentrations of 
 <bold>5c</bold> and 
 <bold>5d</bold> compounds prior to and after CHIKV infection. At 36 hpi, cells were washed three times with PBS and then fixed with methanol:acetone (1:1) for 1 h at room temperature followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton-X-100. After washing, cells were incubated with antibodies against CHIKV, i.e., anti-alphavirus (1:100, SANTA Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), for 1 h and then incubated with fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated secondary anti-mouse antibody (1:250, Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. The plate was then rinsed with PBS and counter-stained with DAPI (Sigma) for 15 min. Then, the image was captured by two trained persons, under a fluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems). All experiments were repeated thrice to verify the results.
