<p>All of the chemicals utilized during the reactions were obtained from Spectrochem, India. 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature on Varian 400 MHz and 100 MHz spectrometers, respectively. Chemical shift values were displayed with reference to TMS as an internal standard. DMSO-
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sub>6</sub> was used as the solvent to prepare the samples. Chemical shifts were expressed in δ (ppm) and coupling constants (
 <italic>J</italic>) in Hertz. The splitting pattern abbreviations are as follows: s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, unresolved multiplet; dd, doublet of the doublet. Column chromatography was performed with Merck silica gel 60 (230–400 mesh). Analytical thin-layer chromatography was carried out using Merck silica gel 60F
 <sub>254</sub>, and iodine was used as a developing reagent. IR spectra were recorded on an FTIR IR Affinity-1 Shimadzu spectrophotometer. The CHNS analysis was recorded on Elementar Vario El-III.
