<p>ADME properties of ligand molecules were obtained by the QikProp tool of Schrodinger 2017, which delivered information about absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADME/T) properties of the ligands. It provided data such as QP log Po/w, QP log BB, overall CNS activity, Caco-2, MDCK cell permeability, log K
 <sub>hsa</sub> for human serum albumin binding, percentage of human oral absorption, etc. The method was conducted as per the protocol published.
