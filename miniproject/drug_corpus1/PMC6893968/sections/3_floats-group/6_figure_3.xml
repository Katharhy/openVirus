  <p>Dihydrorugosaflavonoid cytotoxicity and inhibition assay. (a and b) Cell survival dose–response curves to determine the cytotoxicity of dihydrorugosaflavonoid compounds in Vero cell lines. Compounds’ treatment at different concentrations, 10–100 μM, was given to Vero cells for 24 h. (a) 
   <bold>5c-</bold>compound-treated Vero cells; (b) 
   <bold>5d</bold>-compound-treated Vero cells. Percent survival values were obtained based on untreated cells as control. CC
   <sub>50</sub> thresholds are marked with a dotted line; (c and d) dose-dependent inhibition of CHIKV shown by 
   <bold>5c</bold> and 
   <bold>5d</bold>, respectively. 
   <bold>5c</bold> and 
   <bold>5d</bold> both exhibit a statistically significant reduction in CHIKV titer at micromolar concentrations. In the analysis, statistical significance is analyzed by the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test and Dunnett’s post-test. ***
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001. Values are mean ± standard deviation of two experiments, which are performed in triplicates. VC is the virus control.
