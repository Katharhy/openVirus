  <p>Demonstration of antiviral activity against CHIKV in treated Vero cells. Dihydrorugosaflavonoid-treated Vero cells (pretreated cells) were infected with CHIKV at an MOI of 1 for 90 min. Followed by virus adsorption, the infection medium was changed with the medium containing compounds for 24 h. After 24 hpi, the supernatant was collected for determining percent reduction of viral titer by plaque reduction assay: (a) 
   <bold>5c</bold> compound; (b) 
   <bold>5d</bold> compound. The graphs show the dose-dependent curves of 
   <bold>5c</bold> and 
   <bold>5d</bold>. In the analysis, EC
   <sub>50</sub> values of 
   <bold>5c</bold> and 
   <bold>5d</bold> are 26.14 and 28.39 μM, respectively. EC
   <sub>50</sub> thresholds are marked with a dotted line. Statistical significance is analyzed by nonlinear regression (curve fit). Values are mean ± standard deviation of two experiments, which are performed in triplicates.
