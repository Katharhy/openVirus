  <p>Evaluation of the antiviral effect by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Viral inhibition was assessed by IFA by treatment with 
   <bold>5c</bold> and 
   <bold>5d</bold> compounds. Cells were observed at 36 hpi; micrographs with green fluorescence indicate the virus load as determined with anti-E2 mAb and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated secondary antibody (green), and blue fluorescence indicates the nuclear staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Infected Vero cells with compound treatment (
   <bold>5c</bold>, 70 μM (c); 
   <bold>5c</bold>, 50 μM (d); 
   <bold>5d</bold>, 70 μM (e); 
   <bold>5d</bold>, 50 μM (f)) and cell control (containing no virus (a)) are shown. Virus control images are represented in (b). Cells were observed by a fluorescent microscope (Leica Microsystems) with a 20× objective lens. Scale bar is 50 μm.
