  <p>(a, b) Relative quantification of CHIKV mRNA of Vero cells treated with 
   <bold>5c</bold> and 
   <bold>5d</bold> compounds, by real-time PCR. Compounds were added to the cells 12 h before CHIKV infection and were present in the post-infection medium. Viral RNA in infected cells was quantified 24 h post-infection using β-actin as endogenous control by qRT-PCR performed in triplicates. By using the comparative Ct method, the relative amount of mRNA was calculated. The fold change in treated cells was compared with virus control and is presented logarithmically. Statistical significance is analyzed by the one-way ANOVA test and Dunnett’s post-test. ***
