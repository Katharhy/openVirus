  <p>Molecular docking of nsP3 with natural ligand ADP-ribose and dihydrorugosaflavonoids. (a) Two-dimensional image of ligand interaction of nsp3 with ADP-ribose in the binding pocket; (b) three-dimensional ligand interaction diagram of nsP3 with ADP-ribose showing critical residues of nsP3 (binding pocket) such as residues Asp 10, Ile 11, Arg 144 (with adenine), Asn 24, Asp 31–Cys 34 (with sugar moiety), Ser 110–Tyr 114, and Leu 108 (with phosphate group) entailed in interactions with ADP-ribose; (c) interactions of the chloro derivative of dihydrorugosaflavonoid (
   <bold>5c</bold>) with nsp3, with hydrogen bonds shown in blue and halogen bonds in gray; and (d) interactions of the bromo derivative of dihydrorugosaflavonoid (
   <bold>5d</bold>) with nsp3.
