   <tr>
    <td> - Limited power—small patient populations (total n = 19)</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td> - Poor generalizability of data—each report was based on a single institution’s experience</td>

   <tr>
    <td> - Weak study design—only one of the three studies had a control group for comparison but it was a historical control group</td>

    <td> - Timing of treatment—convalescent plasma given relatively late in disease course (&gt;Day 10 in most cases)</td>
