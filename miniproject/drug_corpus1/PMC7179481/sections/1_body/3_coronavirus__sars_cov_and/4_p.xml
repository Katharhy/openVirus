The 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea resulted in a few case reports and series that failed to show clinical improvement with the administration of convalescent plasma [

 <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, one study found that donor plasma containing higher titers of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody resulted in seroconversion of the recipient post-transfusion whereas seroconversion was not noted when plasma with a low titer of neutralizing antibody was transfused [

Granted, data presented therein was only based on 3 patients and a total of 4 convalescent plasma transfusions, so definitive conclusions cannot be drawn. Nonetheless, the study again raises the valid consideration of quality of convalescent plasma and the role neutralizing antibody titers might play.
