<p id="p0095">Soo and colleagues compared 19 patients receiving convalescent plasma to 21 patients treated with pulsed methylprednisolone [
 <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. More subjects who received convalescent plasma were discharged by day 22 of hospitalization compared to the subjects in the steroid group (74% vs 19%, respectively). Mortality was also lower in the convalescent plasma group, which had no deaths, whereas, five subjects in the steroid group died. The steroid group also had more co-comorbidities, but statistical significance between groups remained even after controlling for co-existing conditions. Nonetheless, this was a retrospective, non-randomized trial and similarly to some of the aforementioned Ebola studies, anti-SARS-CoV-1 antibodies contained within the convalescent plasma were not standardized; therefore, the degree to which antibody titer or type of antibodies present affect outcomes is unknown. The authors also questioned whether the poorer outcomes in the steroid group could have been due to the detrimental effects of steroids. This theory is thought-provoking considering the current anecdotal observation that steroids may exacerbate disease in COVID-19 infection.
