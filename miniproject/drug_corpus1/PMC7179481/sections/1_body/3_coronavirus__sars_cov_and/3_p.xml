<p id="p0100">Cheng et al. examined the use of convalescent plasma from a different angle. They retrospectively reviewed 80 patients with SARS infection who had been given convalescent plasma (median volume 279.3 mL) and compared those who had been transfused before day 14 following the onset of symptoms to those who received plasma after day 14 [

The results showed that the group that received convalescent plasma earlier had better outcomes (defined as discharge by day 22 vs. death by day 22 or later discharge) than the patients who received plasma later. Limitations were similar to the previous study: retrospective nature, non-randomization, and non-standardized antibody titers in the convalescent plasma. Additionally, there was not a non-transfused control group for comparison. Notwithstanding the shortage of high-quality evidence and the moderate to high biases in the SARS-CoV-1 study designs, a meta-analysis of 8 of these studies demonstrated a benefit in mortality following convalescent plasma transfusion [
