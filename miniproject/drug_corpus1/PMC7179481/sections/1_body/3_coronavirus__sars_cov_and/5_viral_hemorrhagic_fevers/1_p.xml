<p id="p0110">In addition to Ebola, convalescent plasma has been evaluated in the treatment of other viral hemorrhagic fevers including Bolivian hemorrhagic fever [
 <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], Lassa fever [
 <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and the Argentine hemorrhagic fever [
 <xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. These studies were either small and/or suffered from poor design with numerous, non-controlled confounding factors. Of potential interest, one Lassa fever study was a controlled trial in which the investigators demonstrated improved mortality in patients who received convalescent plasma prior to day 10 of illness onset compared to those who received plasma after day 10 (9% vs 72%, respectively) [
 <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, there are some caveats to this report. This was a retrospective analysis that included cases spanning years starting in 1970, and variations in management that may have changed over the course of the years were not detailed. Mortality of patients with Lassa fever who did not receive convalescent plasma was 27%, which is significantly better than those who received plasma after day 10. This could indicate a myriad of confounding factors including but not limited to: plasma after day 10 may have been detrimental, the group that received plasma later was sicker at baseline, or variation in medical management between patients.
