<p id="p0035">Passive antibody transfer dates back to the 1890â€™s when antibodies were first used to protect against bacterial toxins before the introduction of antimicrobials [

Modern formulations of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), pooled from thousands of healthy donors, is still used to prevent viral infections in certain patient populations [

 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As such, it is logical to consider the use of passive antibody transfer to treat patients in the current pandemic. Could plasma collected from COVID-19 convalescent patients be efficacious in treating patients still battling the infection, or as a prophylactic approach to prevent this disease? In this review we attempt to address this question along with presenting historical accounts of the use of convalescent plasma in the management and treatment of viral infections, focusing on outbreaks in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. We shall start by examining the use of convalescent plasma in other viral diseases and ultimately direct our attention to coronaviruses. By the end, the authors hope to address whether convalescent plasma is a realistic therapeutic approach to address the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
