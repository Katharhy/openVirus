<p id="p0040">The 2013-2016 West African Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak provided a recent opportunity to evaluate the use of convalescent plasma. Despite a noticeable lack of prospective, randomized control trials, several nonrandomized trials emerged offering some evidence upon which to build. One described 84 patients from Guinea who received convalescent plasma (two consecutive transfusions, 200-250 mL/transfusion) within 2 days of diagnosis and compared them to a cohort of 418 controls treated at the same facility [

Even before day 3, 17% of patients in both cohorts had died, and after day 3, 31% of the plasma-treated patients and 38% of the control patients died. The studyâ€™s main limitation was that the control group was a historical cohort of patients; as such, many unaccounted confounding variables could have impacted mortality. Viral load was also not directly measured but rather PCR cycle threshold was used as a surrogate. Another key limitation was that at the time of transfusion, the anti-Ebola virus (EBOV) antibody and neutralizing antibody titers were not known. Subsequently, the same group published a follow-up letter to the editor with results of antibody testing [

In terms of neutralizing antibodies, the majority (75%) of plasma donors had low titers (1:10-1:40) and only a minority (5%) had high titers (1:160). These serological results bring the relevance of neutralizing antibody to the forefront and raise the important question of whether high levels of neutralizing antibody affect clinical efficacy.
