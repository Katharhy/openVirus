<p id="p0045">The second nonrandomized study was out of Sierra Leone and compared clinical outcomes in 44 subjects treated with convalescent whole blood to 25 non-treated patients [
 <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. They showed an improvement in fatality in patients receiving convalescent whole blood compared to the control group (27.9% vs 44%, respectively) with a 2.3 odds ratio of survival for those receiving treatment. Although this study was not randomized, had a small n, and used whole blood as opposed to plasma, the results, unlike the previous study, suggest efficacy of convalescent blood products. The remaining Ebola-related publications are limited to case series that provide anecdotal efficacy of convalescent plasma in patients receiving at least one other investigational therapy, precluding definitive interpretation of the effects of convalescent plasma as a monotherapy [
