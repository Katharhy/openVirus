<p id="p0135">Based on the use of convalescent plasma in the aforementioned epidemics and pandemics and the conceivable benefit for COVID-19 patients, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of convalescent plasma to treat severely ill patients with COVID-19 infection [
 <xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Given that efficacy is far from proven, the FDA is calling for clinical trials to investigate administration of convalescent plasma in the setting of COVID-19. Accordingly, the FDA is urging physicians to submit investigational new drug (IND) applications [

Donors must also meet the eligibility criteria for standard blood donors set forth by the federal regulation 21 CFR 630.10 and 21 CFR 630.15; and standard testing is to be undertaken set as per regulation 21 CFR 610.40. So far, five clinical trials have begun to investigate convalescent plasma in a variety of COVID-19 settings: [

For patients who may not meet criteria for these clinical trials, the FDA has also approved protocols for emergency use and expanded access [
