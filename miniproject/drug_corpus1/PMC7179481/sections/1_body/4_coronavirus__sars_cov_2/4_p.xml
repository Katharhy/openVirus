<p id="p0130">Worth mentioning, a risk benefit analysis employing a stochastic age-specific susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model based on age, symptomatic/asymptomatic ratio, age-specific severity rates using comorbidity data, and COVID-19 transmission parameters was published in a recent review by Bloch and colleagues [
 <xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Five hundred stochastic simulations were carried out assuming varying degrees of effectiveness (25%, 50%, 75%) of convalescent plasma treatment and presuming a break-point where the fatality ratio of treatment would need to be greater than the fatality ratio of the disease (i.e., the point at which risk of transfusion related fatalities surpasses COVID-19 related mortality). The model exhibited remarkable benefit of convalescent plasma in the setting of COVID-19 infection even at conservative estimates of 25% effectiveness. In other words, the model indicates the risk of morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 infection coupled with the potential benefit, even if minimal, outweighs the risks of transfusion.
