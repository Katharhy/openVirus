<p id="p0120">In their cases series, Shen et al. feature 5 critically ill patients, all of whom received convalescent plasma containing SARS-Cov-2 antibodies (titer &gt;1:1000) and neutralizing antibody (titer &gt;1:40) between day 10 and 22 of admission [

Following transfusion, 4/5 patients experienced increases in viral antibody titers, decreases in SARS-Cov-2 viral loads, and normalization of temperature and resolution of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Duan and colleagues, present a series of 10 severely ill COVID-19 who all received one 200 mL transfusion of convalescent plasma with high titers of neutralizing antibody (&gt;1:640) at a median of 16.5 days [
 <xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The primary endpoint in this study was safety, which was demonstrated as all patients tolerated plasma transfusion without severe adverse events. The secondary endpoints included amelioration of clinical symptoms and improvement in laboratory values by day 3 post transfusion. They reported increases in neutralizing antibody titer, oxygen saturation, and lymphocyte count; and decreases in C-reactive protein, SARS-Cov-2 viral load, and lung lesions on radiological examination. Lastly, Zhang et al. describe 4 critically ill patients who were transfused between 200 and 2400 mL of convalescent plasma ranging from day 11 to day 18 of admission [
 <xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. All 4 patients were considered recovered from the COVID-19 infection; however, recovery/discharge ranged anywhere from approximately 1 week to 1 month post initial transfusion so the temporal relationship between convalescent plasma and clinical improvement is difficult to reconcile. The definition of recovery is arguable given one patient was discharged on supplemental oxygen and another patient required continued critical care for multi-organ failure, granted the SARS-Cov-2 viral load had decreased and lung lesions resolved on imaging.
