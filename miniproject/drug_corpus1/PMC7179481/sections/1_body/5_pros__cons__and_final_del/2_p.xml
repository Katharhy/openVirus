<p id="p0145">The cons of convalescent plasma include basic administrative and logistical barriers of identifying, consenting, collecting, and testing donors. The efforts of the FDA delineated above should attenuate some of these hindrances. Finding donors with robust humoral response could be a hurdle as well, as not all recovered patients have detectable antibodies in the convalescent stage [

Additionally, the current lack of widely available and validated SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays, particularly assays detecting neutralizing antibodies, may hamper identification of ideal donors. Concentrating for neutralizing activity may also mitigate potential viral antibody dependent enhancement (ADE), a process in which plasma antibodies exacerbate disease by enhancing viral cell entry and viral replication by various mechanisms, some of which have been described in MERS infectious model [

 <xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Theoretically, ADE could exacerbate COVID-19 infection in patients who receive convalescent plasma from donors who were not tested for SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, the administration of passive antibodies can suppress the recipientâ€™s humoral immune system from generating pathogen-specific antibodies thereby leaving an individual susceptible to reinfection [
