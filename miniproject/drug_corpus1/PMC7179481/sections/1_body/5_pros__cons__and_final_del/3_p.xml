<p id="p0150">Of course, there is the rare but non-zero risk of transfusion transmitted infections. However, pathogen reduction could improve the safety profile of convalescent plasma. In fact, one study found that psoralen treatment did not substantially reduce the titers of anti-EBOV specific antibodies or their neutralizing effect [

 <xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. These risks include transfusion reactions such as transfusion related acute lung injury, transfusion associated dyspnea, transfusion circulatory overload, and serve allergic reactions with associated bronchospasm, all of which could worsen respiratory disease in COVID-19 patients, especially those who are already on supplemental oxygen and/or intubated.
