<p id="p0155">These pros and cons must be weighed in the context of data presented in the literature, and identifying the literature that presents the strongest evidence is fundamental. Though there are many case reports and case series that espouse the benefits of convalescent plasma, they select for the patients who did well and are confounded by co-administration of other treatment modalities, making it difficult to discern the contribution of the convalescent plasma in the patientâ€™s improvement. The nonrandomized and randomized studies presented herein appear to both support and refute the clinical efficacy of convalescent plasma in the setting of viral infections. The nonrandomized trials of convalescent plasma appear to demonstrate benefit, while most of the randomized trials have failed to demonstrate improvement in clinical outcomes. The results from the randomized control trials investigating the use of H-IVIG suggest some clinical efficacy, which may be related to uniformly high titers of antiviral antibodies in the pharmaceutical preparations. Therefore, there may be merit in concentrating future efforts in H-IVIG or concentrated formulations of antiviral antibodies. Whatever the antibody formulation, the need is evident for prospective, randomized trials comparing convalescent plasma to well defined control groups. The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic offers yet another occasion to execute such high caliber studies, without which the clinical efficacy of convalescent plasma will continue to be in question.</p>
