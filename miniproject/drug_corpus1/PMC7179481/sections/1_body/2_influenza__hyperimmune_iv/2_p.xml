<p id="p0080">Though this was a well-designed study, it is not without its limitations. The authors note that the fractionation process took approximately 6 months, and as such, the first wave of the pandemic was missed. By the time the study was carried out (2010-2011), the pandemic started to dissipate, which negatively affected enrollment. Consequently, after exclusion criteria were applied, only 35 patients were included, limiting the power of the study. The generalizability of results is also limited, as the exclusion of late presentation precludes extrapolating data to a more critically ill subset of patients; and only donors with neutralizing antibody titers &gt;1:40 were included. Thus, whether lower titer donors would offer any benefit remains unknown.</p>
