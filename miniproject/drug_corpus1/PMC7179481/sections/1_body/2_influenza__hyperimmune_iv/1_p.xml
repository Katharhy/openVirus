<p id="p0075">Convalescent plasma can be fractionated into hyperimmune IV immunoglobulin (H-IVIG), a concentrated formulation with enriched levels of pathogen-specific antibodies. In regard to quality, the few studies that examine H-IVIG arguably supply some of the best designed studies of passive antibody transfer in human subjects. One such study was a multicenter, prospective, double-blind randomized control trial in the setting of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic [

H-IVIG was manufactured from convalescent plasma from a total of 276 donors, all of whom had neutralizing antibody titers of &gt; 1:40; and patients who received H-IVIG (n=17) had similar baseline demographics to and were compared to patients who received standard IVIG (n=18). The group that received H-IVIG had significantly lower viral loads on day 5 and 7 post infusion than the IVIG arm. Multivariate analysis revealed that treatment with H-IVIG was the only variable that reduced mortality (0% vs. 40%, experimental vs control group, respectively) when administered within 5 days of symptom onset.
