<p id="p0085">More recently in 2019, a multinational group, 45 institutions in all, published a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating the safety and efficacy of H-IVIG in a cohort of adult patients over 5 influenza seasons [

Patients with symptom onset within 7 days of randomization and a National Early Warning score of at least 2 were randomized to either treatment group—standard of care and 500 mL of H-IVIG—or control group—saline placebo; study participants and investigators were blinded to treatment. The primary end point was a clinical outcome as defined by 6-category ordinal scale at day 7, which was used to estimate odds ratio. After excluding patients that did not receive randomized treatments, 308 were included in analysis with 156 randomized to H-IVIG and 152 receiving placebo. Of the 308 patients, 224 had influenza A serotypes and 84 had influenza B serotypes. The overall results showed that when administered with antiviral therapy, the addition of H-IVIG did not demonstrate clinical improvement over placebo. The odds ratio of clinical improvement was 1.25 (95% CI: 0.79-1.97,

Notably, a pre-specified subgroup comparison of outcomes in influenza A and influenza B ran counter to the investigators’ hypothesis. They found that the subgroup of patients with influenza A derived no benefit from treatment even though they achieved high titers of hemagglutinating antibody following infusion of H-IVIG. In contrast, the subgroup of patients with influenza B had improved clinical benefit at day 7 but achieved lower titers of antibody in response to infusion of H-IVIG. Post-study analysis found that the antibodies to influenza B had higher affinity. Yet, the data for influenza B are based on a small subset (n=84) of the total cohort (n = 308) and therefore have wide confidence intervals. Nevertheless, if H-IVIG were to demonstrate benefit in well-designed trials of SARS-CoV-2, H-IVIG may prove useful with regard to ease of administration compared with convalescent plasma. For example, H-IVIG volumes are generally small, simplifying distribution, and preparations could be administered via injection in outpatient settings as opposed to transfusion of plasma, which involves larger volumes delivered intravenously in a hospital type setting [
