<p id="p0060">Although this study had more patients than most published convalescent plasma studies, the overall number of patients included was only 138. Furthermore, they did not have a control group without plasma transfusion, as the investigators believed that a no-plasma control group would have affected the blinding because a saline infusion solution has a distinct appearance from plasma. The aforementioned phase 2 trial did assess high-titer plasma versus standard of care, and like the phase 3 trial, there was no significant benefit in plasma over standard treatment in terms of the primary endpoint. That being said, both the phase 2 and 3 trials indicated benefits in secondary endpoints, particularly in duration of mechanical ventilation and in intensive care. Lastly, the phase 3 trial used hemagglutination inhibition titers as inclusion criteria for use of plasma. Some studies would contend that neutralizing antibody titers or anti-neuraminidase titers are more appropriate markers to measure [
