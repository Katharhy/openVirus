Like the case reports from the Ebola experience, these reports suffer from the same limitations, including co-administration of other antivirals and treatments, particularly oseltamivir. Interestingly though, the investigator of one of these reports made a point to compare the viral sequences from the convalescent plasma donor and the patient and found &gt;99% homology [
