<p id="p0065">During the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic of 2009, a prospective cohort study of adults with severe infection, requiring intensive care, was conducted [

In this study patients were offered convalescent plasma treatment and clinical outcomes were compared between those who accepted treatment and those who declined. In all, 93 patients were recruited of which 20 patients received convalescent plasma and were matched to the non-treatment control group. The group that received the convalescent plasma experienced significantly lower mortality than the control group (20.0% vs 54.8%, respectively), which remained significant in multivariate analysis. In addition to lower mortality, the treatment group saw significantly lower viral loads as well as lower cytokine levels post treatment. Even though this was not a randomized trial, it was prospective in nature with well-matched experimental and control groups and findings held up in multivariate models. When combining these findings with those from retrospective observational studies from the same period [
