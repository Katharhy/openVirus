<p id="p0055">The randomized control trials that have been performed examining the efficacy of convalescent plasma concern influenza infection. Based on the promising results of their randomized, phase 2 trial, which investigated the utility of convalescent plasma versus standard of care in patients with severe influenza A or B [
 <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], Biegel and colleagues proceeded to carry out a prospective, randomized, double-blind phase 3 trial that sought to compare the clinical efficacy of convalescent plasma with high titer (≥1:80) anti-influenza A antibodies against convalescent plasma with low titer (≤1:10) anti-influenza A titers in patients with severe disease [
 <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Patients were followed for 28 days with a primary end point being clinical status on day 7 as defined by a six-point ordinal scale. Ninety-two patients received high-titer plasma while 48 received low titer plasma. No benefit in high titer plasma over low titer plasma was found. In fact, the study was terminated early when it was determined that even if the planned full 150 participants were recruited, the high-titer group would still show no improvement in clinical status over low titer plasma. Of note, 34% of the subjects experienced serious adverse events including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and allergic transfusion reactions, which highlight the potential hazards of convalescent plasma. Given the results and possible adverse reactions, the group concluded that the data did not warrant the treatment of influenza A with convalescent plasma.
