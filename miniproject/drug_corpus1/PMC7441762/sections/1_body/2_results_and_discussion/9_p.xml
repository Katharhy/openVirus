<p>Avicularin is a flavonoid isolated from 
 <italic>Polygonum aviculare, Rhododendron aureum and Taxillus kaempferi</italic> (Fukunaga et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>; Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0100" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>). A derivative of quercetin, it possesses biological properties including anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-allergic properties. Van Anh Vo et al., demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of avicularin by LPS-induced suppression of ERK signaling pathway in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells (Determination of Avicularin in Polygonum Aviculare L. by Square Wave Polarography. - PubMed - NCBI, n.d.). Avicularin elevated the sensitivity of cisplatin in drug resistant gastric cancer cells in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies by enhancing the Bax and Bak expressions (Guo et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). In another study, avicularin suppressed the intracellular accumulation of lipids by suppressing C/EBPα-mediated activation of GLUT4 expression in 3T3-L1 cells (Fujimori &amp; Shibano, 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Present computational analysis showed that it has good affinity to M
 <sup>pro</sup> with a docking score of −9.6 Kcal/mol and MM-GBSA dG binding energy −66.6 Kcal/mol. Similar to Delphinidin 3,5-diglucoside and scutellarein 7-glucoside, the alpha-L-arabinofuranosy moiety of avicularin is majorly involved in interaction with the main residues (CYS
 <sup>145</sup> and GLU
 <sup>166</sup>) of the catalytic site via hydrogen bonding. To further increase the binding affinity, the benzene ring forms π-π stacking with the HIE
 <sup>41</sup> of the hydrophobic subsite. Also the hydroxyl group of chromone nucleus and benzene ring were found to interact with the THR
 <sup>190</sup> and HIS
 <sup>164</sup>, CYS
 <sup>145</sup>, respectively through hydrogen bonding, enhancing the fit into the active site (

 <sup>406</sup>, THR
 <sup>445</sup>, ASP
 <sup>367</sup> and ASH
 <sup>368</sup> of domain I. Docking poses also reveals the presence of multiple π-cation interaction between chromone nucleus and ARG
 <sup>273</sup>. The carbonyl group of main nucleus was found to be bonded with ARG
 <sup>518</sup> through hydrogen bonding (
