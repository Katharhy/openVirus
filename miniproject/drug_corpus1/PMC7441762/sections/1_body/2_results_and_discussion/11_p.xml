<p>However for ACE2, 3,5-Di-O-galloylshikimic acid has the 3
 <sup>rd</sup> lowest MM-GBSA dG binding energy of −51.7 Kcal/mol with docking score of −11.16 kcal/mol. From the docked poses inside ACE2 catalytic site, it can be concluded that oxygen of the carboxylate was found to interact with HIE
 <sup>505</sup> and HIE
 <sup>345</sup> through hydrogen bonding and with ARG
 <sup>273</sup> through non-covalent ionic interaction (salt bridge). The hydroxyls of the benzoyl moiety were displaying hydrogen bonding interaction with the TYR
 <sup>127</sup> and GLU
 <sup>406</sup>. HIE
 <sup>345</sup> of the side chain was involved in the π-π stacking interaction with one of the benzoyl ring (
