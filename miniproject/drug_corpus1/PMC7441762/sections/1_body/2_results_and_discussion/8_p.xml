<p>The second lead compound is a flavonoid glycoside, Scutellarein 7-glucoside isolated from plants like 
 <italic>Verbena officinalis L</italic> (Rehecho et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), 
 <italic>Buddleja madagascariensis Lam</italic> (Emam et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>), 
 <italic>Plantago asiatica L</italic>, 
 <italic>Scutellaria immaculate</italic> (Yuldashev, 
 <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), 
 <italic>Plantago asiatica L</italic> and 
 <italic>Polygonum odoratum</italic> (Okonogi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Biologically scutellarein 7-glucoside shows anti-inflammatory activity by decreasing the IL-6 and TNF-α production as reported by Okonogi et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Another study reported by Goran et al., shows its certain inhibitory activity against indole-3-acetic acid oxidase there by inhibiting ATP formation inside the plant mitochondria (Stenlid, 
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">1976</xref>). In addition to these properties Rehecho et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) reported that it also shows free radical scavenging activity. The binding affinity docking scores of Scutellarein 7-glucoside against M
 <sup>pro</sup> and ACE2 are −9.3 Kcal/mol and −10.6 Kcal/mol. The MM-GBSA dG binding energies are −68.55 Kcal/mol and −59.1 Kcal/mol. In M
 <sup>pro</sup> all the hydroxyl groups of sugar moiety are involved in H-bonding with the CYS
 <sup>145</sup>, His
 <sup>163</sup> and GLU
 <sup>166</sup> which are the main residues of the catalytic site. Moreover hydroxyl group of phenyl ring also interacts with the GLN
 <sup>192</sup> residue of S4 subunit through hydrogen bonding that further secures scutellarein 7-glucoside binding to M
 <sup>pro</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3(ii)</xref>). While in case of the ACE2 enzyme the hydroxyls of the sugar moiety were locking the Scutellarein 7-glucoside by forming multiple hydrogen bonds with GLU
 <sup>375</sup>, HIE
 <sup>345</sup> and HIE
 <sup>505</sup>. The phenyl ring was shown to make π-π stacking interaction with the phenyl ring of HIE
 <sup>345</sup>. The carbonyl oxygen and hydroxyl group of chromone nucleus were displaying hydrogen bond interaction with the THR
 <sup>371</sup> and ASH
 <sup>368</sup> (
