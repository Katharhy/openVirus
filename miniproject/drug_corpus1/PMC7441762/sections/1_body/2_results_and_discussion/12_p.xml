<p>To be eligible for clinical evaluation, pharmacokinetic profile of a drug plays pivotal role. Based on the results of ADME calculations all the investigated leads have low bioavailability score. The bioavailability score (ABS) depends on passing or violating Lipinski’s rule of five. At biological pH, a compound is expected to have &gt;10% bioavailability (F) in rat only if it pass Lipinski’s rule of five with ABS 0.55 (i.e. 55% chances of 
 <italic>F</italic> &gt; 10% in rat). However if it fails, ABS is only 0.17 i.e. 17% chance for a molecule to have bioavailability &gt;10% in rat (Martin, 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). With ABS-0.17, delphinidin 3,5-diglucoside (an anthocyanin), the bioavailability through gastro intestinal tract (GIT) is reported to be very low. A study reported by McGhie and Walton (
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) concluded that in animals and humans low anthocyanins levels are absorbed in the circulation and excreted in urine, but high levels are found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Another investigation by Paul et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) suggests that anthocyanins in the form of crude extract have less bioavailability as compared to encapsulated spray dried formulations. Like delphinidin 3,5-diglucoside the next two leads (Scutellarein 7-glucoside, Avicularin) which are glycosidic flavonoids also have less bioavailability with acceptable water solubility limit. Glycosidic flavonoids show less permeability through GIT (Arts et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Hollman et al. reported that only aglycone part of flavonoids pass through the intestinal membrane and glycone moiety mostly gets digested in the GIT with time to reach peak concentrations (T
 <sub>max</sub>) between &lt;0.5 and 9 h (Walle, 
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). The 3,5-Di-O-galloylshikimic acid (gallotanin with quinic acid core) estimated log S value suggest that it has acceptable water solubility due to presence of polar functional groups, yet its bioavailability score is only 0.11.
