<p>Traditional medicines in different countries have history of successfully treating several epidemics and endemics. With advanced drug discovery tools in place, it is feasible to screen active ingredients of these natural concoctions for potential antiviral application. We attempted to explore this approach by screening selected natural secondary metabolites for their dual binding potential to (1) viral main protease M
 <sup>pro</sup> that has a conserved catalytic cleavage site responsible for post-translational processing of polyproteins required for viral replication in all SARS corona viruses and (2) ACE2 the principle receptor responsible for entry of the viral particles into the host cells. The top four leads Delphinidin 3,5-diglucoside, Scutellarein 7-glucoside, Avicularin and 3,5-Di-O-galloylshikimic acid showed encouraging binding affinity with MM-GBSA energies up to −74.0 Kcal/mol and −79.5 Kcal/mol to M
 <sup>pro</sup> and ACE2, respectively. However, their theoretical bioavailability score (ABS) of 0.11 or 0.17 makes them ineffective via oral route. Potential natural leads such as Delphinidin 3, 5-diglucoside, an anthocyanin responsible for the red pigmentation of pomegranate juice, are ingested orally. Nonetheless, their viral inhibitory potential is greatly limited by low oral bioavailability. To overcome this bottleneck, these molecules can be either engineered to withstand GIT degradation and first pass metabolism or can be encapsulated in nano/microparticles towards their site specific pulmonary delivery.
