    "Molecular mimicry is a general strategy used by pathogens to infect the host cells. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 virus has resulted in more than 6,700,000 infections and 390,000 deaths worldwide. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by this virus. In this project concept, we aim to focus on the peptide-protein interaction analysis using two important drug targets in SARS-CoV-2 such as spike (S) protein and nucleocapsid (N) protein. These proteins play an important role in the virus entry and encapsidation of the viral particles. Motifs or functional regions in these two proteins must be sharing sequence homology with human protein (ACE2) which may be involved in the binding mechanism. The results will show a set of motif regions which can disrupt the viral infection. Once we identify these sets of antigenic determinant regions, antibody binding activity studies can be performed by in vitro methods. Our results from this study may suggest the existence of antigenic mimicry between SARS-CoV-2 and host proteins. The hit peptide components will have therapeutic applications to be developed into a wide variety of medicinal formulations against SARS-CoV-2 such as vaccine, intranasal and inhalation formulations. Also, the choice of conserved regions will lead to development of cross protective therapeutics against wide range of coronaviruses."
