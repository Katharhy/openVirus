<p>Evidence has emerged on the human-to-human transmission of the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in health care and family settings (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). As the virus spreads mainly through droplets, sneezes and aerosols (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), there is a high risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during dental procedures (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Recently, it was found that SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in saliva specimens which may allow viral transmission even among patients without cough or other respiratory symptoms (
