  <p>To assess suspected patients through their signs and symptoms, especially fever and cough (
   <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In these cases, dental procedures should be postponed, and health authorities should be notified. Symptomatic relief for patients with tooth pain and/or swelling could be performed with analgesics such as acetaminophen. Although it was hypothesized a potential interaction between ibuprofen use and SARS-CoV-2 (
   <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), there is no current evidence that this drug aggravates COVID-19 infection in any age group. Recently, the World Health Organization disclaimed there is contraindication for the use of ibuprofen in patients with COVID-19.

  <p>To provide staff education and the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including N95 respirators, clinical gloves, safety glasses, hair covers and disposable aprons. A N95 respirator is a respiratory protective device designed to achieve a very close facial fit and very efficient filtration of airborne particles. N95 respirators block at least 95% of very small (0.3 micron) test particles. A surgical mask is a loose-fitting, disposable device that creates a physical barrier between the mouth and nose of the wearer and potential contaminants in the immediate environment (
   <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Current evidence shows that N95 respirators appeared to have a protective advantage over surgical masks in laboratory settings and on procedures that generate aerosols, but the results from clinical studies are inconclusive regarding acute respiratory infections (
   <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
   <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). For patients in health facilities, the use of surgical masks seems rational (
   <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).

  <p>To clean hands with soap and water or hand rub with 70% ethanol or 70% isopropanol (
   <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), before and after assistance. Avoid touching eyes, nose, or mouth with uncleaned hands. Although there are no current studies evaluating the effects of ethanol on SARS-CoV-2, previous studies have shown that hand rubs with 70% ethanol or 70% isopropanol are usually effective against enveloped viruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (
   <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
   <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).

  <p>Extraoral radiographs and cone beam computed tomography are preferable over intraoral radiographs to prevent cough or vomiting reflexes and, consequently, aerosol generation. Moreover, during dental procedures it is recommended to avoid stimulate trigger zones (
   <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) of cough and vomiting including base of the tongue, fauces, uvula, palate, and posterior pharyngeal wall.

  <p>To use rubber dam isolation during dental procedures and avoid the use of ultrasonic and sonic scalers, air polishing, air-water syringe, air abrasion units, and rotary handpieces. In vitro study showed that the airborne material generated by using ultrasonic scaler can be spread for a distance of at least 20 cm from the operative site (
   <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Furthermore, the potential for the spread of an pathogen via an invisible aerosol must be recognized and minimized or eliminated to the greatest extent feasible within a clinical situation (
   <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Importantly, it was shown that droplet nuclei can remain suspended in the air for up to 30 minutes (
   <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Therefore, removing the mask before 30 minutes in this environment may increase the risk of contact with contaminated particles. Efficient removal of contaminated ambient air could include improvements in the general ventilation and the use of High-Volume Evacuator. To date, there is no evidence of clinical effectiveness of pre- and post-procedural rinse with antiseptic solutions for SARS-CoV-2.

  <p>For both suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases requiring urgent dental care (e.g., abscess drainage), especially for those who will undergo procedures that generate aerosols, it is necessary, if possible, to leave them for the end of the service shift and promote terminal disinfection after care to avoid contaminating others.</p>

 <list-item>
  <p>To clean and disinfect environmental surfaces and patientcare equipment using hospital grade germicides (quaternary ammonium-based, phenol-based, and alcohol-based products), as the SARS-CoV-2 can survive for 72 hours on surfaces of stainless steel and plastic, 24 hours in cardboard and from 40 minutes to 2 hours 30 minutes in aerosolized form or in dust (
   <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Disinfection and sterilization of instruments should be performed using appropriate PPE and well-established techniques. Reinforce biosafety guidelines for auxiliary staff of dentists. It is important to keep an adequate time frame between consultations for a correct cleaning of the dental office structure.

 <list-item>
  <p>To dispose the waste from dental procedures in specific packages for infected waste. These must be replaced when reaching 2/3 of their capacity or at least within 48 hours, or in compliance with the institutionâ€™s infection control committee protocols, since the inadequate disposal offers high risk to ecological and public health (
   <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).
