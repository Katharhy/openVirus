<p id="p0105">In the last 20â€¯years, from SARS-CoV in 2002, to MERS-CoV in 2009, to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, there have been three outbreaks of severe infectious diseases caused by CoVs, which require high attention. In recent years, the results of genomic sequencing and bioinformatics for these CoVs have enabled the creation of screening models, which have been used to develop small molecule drugs and vaccines with different mechanisms of action, such as protease inhibitors, nucleic acid synthesis inhibitors and polymerase inhibitors. However, there have been no potent and specific drugs developed for coronaviruses.</p>
