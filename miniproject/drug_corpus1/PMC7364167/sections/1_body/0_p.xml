<p id="p0005">Coronavirus (CoV) is the general name of a family of viruses that is commonly found in nature [
 <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These viruses are able to utilize a wide variety of host species, and because host switching is a common feature in the evolution of CoV, novel CoVs may appear at any time [

 <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>]. The December 2019 outbreak of a new coronavirus in China's Wuhan region, recently named SARS-CoV-2, belongs to the coronavirus 2B type, which shows 80% similarity to the SARS-CoV genome. There is still the possibility of continued mutation in the future [
