<p id="p0035">Cyclophilins (Cyps) are a commonly expressed and highly conservede class of intracellular proteins belonging to the PPlase family [
 <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Cyps have a very important role in the replication of RNA viruses, such as influenza A viruses, HIV, HCV, and others. Cyps are known to be present in the cells of eukaryotes and prokaryote organisms [
 <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. There are seven main types of cyclophilins in the human body, namely cyclophilin A (CyPA), cyclophilin B (CypB), cyclophilin C (CypC), cyclophilin D (CypD), cyclophilin E (CypE), cyclophilin 40 (Cyp40), and cyclophilin NK (Cypp). They are not typically connected to each other in the human genome [
 <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Of these, CyPA is the most abundant and dominant protein in the Cyps family. CyPA plays an important role in intracellular protein synthesis, folding, and transportation, as well as immunosuppression, immunomodulation, and signal conduction. However, CyPA is closely related to viral infections, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, Alzheimer's disease, and cardiovascular disease [

 <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition, CyPA is associated with hepatitis and fibrosis caused by viral infections such as HBV, HCV and non-alcoholic fatty liver, as well as the generation of resistance to liver cancer and liver cancer metastasis, making it a potential target for the treatment of liver disease [
