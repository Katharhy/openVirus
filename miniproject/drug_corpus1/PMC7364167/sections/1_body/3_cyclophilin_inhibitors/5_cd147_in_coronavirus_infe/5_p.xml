<p id="p0085">CyPA/CD147 interaction is also related to other diseases. The pathophysiological relevance of CyPA-CD147 interactions to inflammatory processes has been studied in many animal models. Studies on synovial macrophages in patients with rheumatoid arthritis have reported that the expression of CyPA and CD147 can be found [

CyPA and CD147 have higher levels of expression in pancreatic cancer tissues, in which CyPA is found in a dose-dependent manner. This proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells can be effectively blocked by CD147 antibody [
