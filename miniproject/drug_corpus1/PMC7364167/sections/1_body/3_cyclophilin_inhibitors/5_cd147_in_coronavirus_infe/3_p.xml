<p id="p0075">CD147 plays a critical role in the infection of various viruses in the human body, such as HIV, HBV, HCV, and KSHV. Related studies have shown that, during HIV-1 infection, the CyPA of the host cells incorporates the nascent virus through interaction with HIV-1 Gag protein. As the virus matures and releases the Gag protein, CyPA becomes redistributed on the surface of the virus and mediates HIV-1's adhesion to target cells by interacting with protein receptors expressed by host cells. The combination of CD4 and chemokine receptors on the host cell promotes the fusion of the virus and the cell membrane, and eventually causes the virus to invade the host cell. The CD147 molecule of the host cell can promote infection of the host cell by the HIV-1 virus through interaction with the virus-associated CyPA.</p>
