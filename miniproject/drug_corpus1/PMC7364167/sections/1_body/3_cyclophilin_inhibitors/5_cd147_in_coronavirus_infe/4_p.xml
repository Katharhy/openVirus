<p id="p0080">During SARS-CoV infection of host cells, the CD147 molecule works via a mechanism similar to that in HIV-1 infection: interaction with CyPA. CD147-antagonist peptide 9, which has a high binding rate to HEK293 cells, has an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV. Because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have similar characteristics, Chen et al. and colleagues investigated the possible function of CD147 in the virus entry to host cells. It was reported that blocking CD147 on host cells shows inhibition on SARS-CoV-2 and that CD147 has a critical role in promoting the infection of host cells by the virus. Surface plasmon resonance by using Biacore analysis confirmed the interaction between CD147 and S protein (SP) [
