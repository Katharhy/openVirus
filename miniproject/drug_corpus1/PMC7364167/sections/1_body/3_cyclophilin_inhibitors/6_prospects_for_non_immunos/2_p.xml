<p id="p0095">As an immunosuppressive drug, CsA has a broad spectrum of antiviral effects [
 <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], but its immunosuppressive properties can lead to adverse side effects during antiviral therapy. As a result, several non-immunosuppressive cyclophilin inhibitors based on CsA structures are being developed (
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ), and these non-immunosuppressive CyPA inhibitors separate their function of PPIase inhibition from their immunosuppressive function. The side chains of the modified CsA molecule can develop non-immunosuppressive analogues, such as Alisporivir, NIM811, SCY-635, sangliferins, and STG-175. In order to better understand the structural diversity of CyPA inhibitors, more non-immunosuppressive CsA derivatives need to be developed. Known co-crystal structures provide the basis for drug optimization of non-immunosuppressive cyclophilin inhibitors.
