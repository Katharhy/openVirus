 <italic>In vitro</italic>, CsA can inhibit the replication of almost all coronavirus genera in a dose-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Cell culture experiments have found that CsA can strongly inhibit the viral replication of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, hCoV-229E, poultry infectious bronchitis virus, and mouse hepatitis virus [
 <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], but only showed significant blocking in the early stages of replication [
 <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Blocking coronavirus replication requires a higher CsA concentration (16 μM) than other RNA viruses (0.5–3 μM), indicating that the CoV is less sensitive to CsA treatment [
