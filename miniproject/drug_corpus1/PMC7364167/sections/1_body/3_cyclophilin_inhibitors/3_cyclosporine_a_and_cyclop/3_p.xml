<p id="p0045">The cellular phosphatase CaN participates in the transcription process of some cytokines, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2), by activation of NFAT. Latter translocates into the nucleus upon dephosphorylation thus being able to regulate immune gene promoters. The complex between CsA, Cyps and CaN prevents dephosphorylation of NFAT inhibiting the release of immune cytokines and thus excerting immunosuppression. [
