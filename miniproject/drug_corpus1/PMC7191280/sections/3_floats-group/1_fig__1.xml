  <p>Overview about the role of ACE-2 during SARS CoV-2 infection.</p>
  <p>Angiotensin II can either bind to the angiotensin II receptor type I (AT
   <sub>1</sub>-R), where it induces vasoconstriction via the phospholipase C (PLC), proteinkinase C (PKC) pathway, or be processed by angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to generate angiotensin 1–7. Afterwards, angiotensin 1–7 can bind to the MAS-receptor (Mas-R), which induces a signaling cascade subsequently leading to a vasodilatory effect. During SARS CoV-2 infection, viral spike protein (S) on the surface of the virus binds to ACE2. After processing of the S-protein by the endogenous transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), the viral particle is endocytosed and acidification of the endosome leads to viral and cellular membrane fusion and release of viral single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) into the cytosol. There, the ssRNA is replicated and translated into viral proteins (N, M, E and S). Additional viral mechanisms facilitate the downregulation of endogenous 
   <italic>ACE2</italic> and upregulation of 
   <italic>ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17</italic> (
   <italic>ADAM-17</italic>) expression. After vesicular transport to the cell surface, ADAM-17 facilitates its role as a “sheddase” and cleaves the extracellular domain of ACE2. Moreover, increased extracellular cytokine concentrations (TNFα, IFNγ, IL-4) lead to the activation of cellular proinflammatory pathways by different cytokine receptors. These pathways further support virus-induced downregulation of ACE2 and upregulation of ADAM-17.
