<p id="p0300">When the world health organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 as an international emergency at the end of January and declared it a pandemic in March 2020 [
 <xref rid="bb0410" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>], several efforts were already made to understand the diagnosis and prognosis of this respiratory syndrome. Noteworthy, there are regional differences in COVID-19 severity, which seem to reflect on socio-economic parameters and the readiness of the healthcare systems to cope with such a challenge. Whether COVID-19 has direct or indirect effects to the young or aged cardiovascular system is poorly understood so far because we are only at the beginning of monitoring the COVID-19. This includes specific biomarker discovery to predict patients at very high risk as well as superior imaging tools to monitor cardiac remodeling and inflammation (e.g. MRI). Especially ACE2 abundancy is of high interest in context of SARS-CoV-2 and a potential impact on cardiac tissue; however, insufficient number of cases has been reported so far to draw reliable conclusion and rhACE2 is rather considered a therapeutic strategy to limit viral infection, which will be now investigated in phase-II clinical trials. In addition, clinical association studies in the early, mid and late phase of COVID-19 are urgently needed to discuss standard care, in particular for HF patients who seem to be at highest risk for a severe course of COVID-19.
