<p id="p0250">Since the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is still an emerging pandemic with more than 2.1 million confirmed cases worldwide [
 <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], special focus is currently directed towards the understanding of why people are hospitalized, receive intensive care, and frequently die as a consequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Mortality rates seem particularly high when patients suffer from distinct comorbidities. First studies were initiated mainly on Chinese cohorts, as China is the suspected point of origin of COVID-19. These studies indicate that patients subjected to intensive care units (ICU) frequently show hypertension, diabetes and/or cardiovascular diseases (CVD) [
 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These patients demonstrate much higher mortality rates compared with patients that are free of these comorbidities [

 <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>]. While higher mortality rates among CVD patients are also associated with other respiratory diseases (especially influenza virus-induced flu or previous SARS epidemics), the question was put forward, whether people treated for heart-related illness are more prone to SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, based on first epidemiological evidence, but particularly based on the presumed upregulation of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor. While this association is currently heavily discussed, and will be also be a subject of this review, latest epidemiological studies coming from Europe at least underpin the greater risk for a critical disease progression in this group of patients [

 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, we here aim to outline the mechanisms influencing the cardiac system because of its central implications in the COVID-19 course. We further highlight currently investigated and upcoming therapy options for COVID-19 patients with cardiac disease conditions.
