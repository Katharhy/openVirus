 <bold>CO</bold>rona
 <bold>VI</bold>rus 
 <bold>D</bold>isease outbreak at the end of 20
 <bold>19</bold> (COVID-19), is based on a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus probably originating from bats and/or pangolins [

 <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>]. The first local outbreak was reported in Wuhan, a small but heavily populated region in China, subsequently spreading rapidly around the world within three months [

 <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A substantial number of asymptomatic courses have been reported. To properly address the prevalence, transmission, hospitalization and mortality rates of SARS-CoV-2, it will be of utmost importance to determine the number of asymptomatic cases (including those who are currently infected and recovered). Accordingly, several cross-sectional studies were already launched to determine the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Preliminary results from the Heinsberg-Study (named after a town that was the first COVID-19 hotspot in Germany) suggest that around 15% of 500 people chosen at random showed an antibody response [
 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In symptomatic cases, flu-like symptoms range from fatigue, coughing and shortness of breath, to fever as well as gastrointestinal disorders. Less common symptoms are upper respiratory-related signs such as sneezing and a sore throat [
 <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. When the symptoms first appear, a relatively rapid spread of the virus towards the lungs might cause severe pneumonia, which then frequently requires an oxygen supply or mechanical ventilation [
 <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The progression of a COVID-19 infection towards this critical phase should be urgently avoided if possible, because at this stage there is not only serious damage to the lungs but to the heart due to pre-existing CVDs making COVID-19 a life-threatening infection. In the past two months, unjustified attempts were made to place the number of cases and estimated mortality rates of COVID-19 into perspective by comparing it to influenza [
 <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The major differences revoking such comparison are: firstly, a suspected high prevalence for asymptomatic disease spreaders; secondly, a prolonged incubation period compared to common seasonal influenza viruses; and thirdly, an extended disease progression, reflected by an average ICU stay of 15 days with a minimum of 10 days in Italy [
 <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Altogether, this establishes the basis for the COVID-19 outbreak and the fast spread of this pandemic.
