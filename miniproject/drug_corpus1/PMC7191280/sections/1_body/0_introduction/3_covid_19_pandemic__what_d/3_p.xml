<p id="p0260">A critical disease progression of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients is supposed to be initiated by the inability of the immune system to prevent the spreading of viruses to the lungs. This can rapidly lead to pneumonia evidenced by typical visible features in computed tomographic analyses [

The latest guidelines therefore recommend first measuring basic blood parameters in order to assess the state of infection and adjust medication accordingly, even if SARS-CoV-2 infection has not yet been confirmed [

 <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This can accelerates the treatment, which might then limit critical manifestations.
