<p id="p0285">Once the virus enters the cell, the viral RNA is released and the host-cell's cellular programs are utilized for viral replication. In addition to producing infectious progeny, several mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication influence ACE2 expression and presentation. Firstly, internalization of the receptor is accompanied by a reduced availability on the cell surface. Secondly, so far unknown viral mediators inhibit 
 <italic>ACE2</italic> and concurrently induce 
 <italic>ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17</italic> (
 <italic>ADAM-17</italic>) gene expression [
 <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The membrane-bound metalloprotease is involved in processing the tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), but is also functioning as a “sheddase” by releasing anchored receptors and cytokines [
 <xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. As a physiological regulator of the RAAS system, ADAM-17 mediates cleavage of ACE2, pointing towards its direct involvement in COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Thirdly, not only the release of TNFα [
 <xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], but also processing of different important pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 4 (IL-4) and interferon γ (IFNγ) is accomplished [
 <xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0320" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0325" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The latter two act directly on 
 <italic>ACE2</italic> expression via autocrine pathways [
 <xref rid="bb0325" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], further promoting the downregulation of ACE2 on the cellular surface of infected cells, and might secondary imply an imbalance of T cell responses and over-reaction of the immune system by provoking a cytokine storm (
