<p id="p0280">The central role of ACE2 in cardiac physiology and pathology, as well as the fact that it acts as the major entry receptor for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 suggests that it is a promising therapeutic target [
 <xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Receptor binding is facilitated through the viral spike protein that is processed by the protease TMPRSS2 [
 <xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Then, the spike protein interacts with the extracellular domain of ACE2, which triggers clathrin-dependent endocytosis of the complex [

 <xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Interestingly, this interaction is remarkably enhanced in patients suffering from hypertension or coronary heart disease as well as in diabetic or other comorbid conditions [

 <xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The viral spike protein is cleaved at a furin site, which is not present in SARS-CoV, by the furin protease plasmin, thereby increasing the cellular uptake of viral particles and enhancing its pathogenicity [

 <xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Furthermore, there is an association of elevated plasmin levels with the strong induction of D-dimer as a product of hyper-fibrinolysis, which is an additional critical parameter of severe COVID-19 progression [
