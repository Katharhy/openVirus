<p id="p0290">The consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection alone are already an enormous stress for the body. Considering that many patients suffer from pre-existing illness and elderly people present a compromised immune system [

 <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0330" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], the severity and the potential life-threat of a SARS-CoV-2 infection becomes very clear. The treatment plan of CVD patients regularly includes inhibitors of the RAAS, namely ACE-I and ARBs. Recently, upregulation of ACE2 has been associated with RAAS inhibitor medication [

 <xref rid="bb0340" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0345" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>]. The point was recently raised that the susceptibility in those patients is even increased based on high viral loads that were detected in patients with poor outcomes [
 <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. A broad spectrum of institutions and scientist have discussed this topic extensively as treatment guidelines were and are still required very urgently because of the rapidly growing number of cases. Summarizing the most important aspects of this ongoing discussion, antihypertensive drugs should not be discontinued if there is no medical necessity, as uncontrolled blood pressure or clinical instability is a superior high-risk factor for severe complications [
 <xref rid="bb0355" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. So far, there is no evidence of increased susceptibility of hypertensive patients; on the contrary, studies in Chinese cohorts suggest an even lower estimated prevalence of COVID-19 in blood-pressure controlled subjects compared to the distribution of high blood pressure in the population in general [
 <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Indeed, a retrospective study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with hypertension identified a lower risk of all-cause mortality in patients under ACE-I and ARB treatment [
 <xref rid="bb0360" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Moreover, a cardio-protective activity of ACE2 has been previously described in different animal models and clinical studies of heart diseases [
 <xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0370" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0375" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>], concluding that an even desirable effect might be achieved through this medication. Therefore, a clinical trial was initiated at the end of February aiming to re-raise ACE2 levels without risking increased infection rates. Here, soluble human recombinant ACE2 (rhACE2) infusions were planned in a COVID-19 patient cohort consisting of 24 participants [
 <xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. The conceptual idea is that the non-membrane-bound receptor functions as a trap for viral particles by intercepting SARS-CoV-2, thereby preventing binding to cell surface-located ACE2 and the subsequent infection. Whether this proposed mode of action is only effective in the early phase of infection remains an open question to date. It is generally conceivable that every drug or clinical intervention leading to a decreased viral load might result in an improved outcome combined with reduced long-term complications. However, for non-declared reasons, the promising pilot study has been recently withdrawn as indicated at

 <xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Nevertheless, the pharmaceutical company APEIRON Biologics AG announced a large phase II clinical study a few days ago. They plan to treat 200 COVID-19 patients in Austria, Germany and Denmark with APN01, synonymous for rhACE2 [
 <xref rid="bb0385" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Importantly, preclinical models reinforce the potential benefit of this treatment. Monteil et al. demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection of engineered human organoids, more precisely blood vessel and kidney organoids, is significantly limited when soluble hrACE2 is applied. In this approach, the group of Penninger specifically investigated the infection-limiting effects at early stages of COVID-19, thus substantiating the previous hypothesis [
 <xref rid="bb0390" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Altogether, despite the current lack of evidence of efficacy in humans, first studies support the use of rhACE2 to decrease viral load [
 <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0390" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Additional cardio-protective effects of the treatment are also conceivable, although it is questionable whether non-membrane anchored plasma ACE2 can completely fulfil the protease function [
 <xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. To sum up, rhACE2 appears to offer great potential to improve the outcome of COVID-19 patients and minimize adverse chronic damages to the lung, heart and additional organ systems and therefore, the results of the first clinical trials are eagerly anticipated.
