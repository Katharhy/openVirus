<p id="p0270">Considering the multiple effects on the heart, it can already be assumed that previous CVDs would lead to an unfavorable progression of COVID-19. Interestingly, the drastically increased mortality rate in patients with pre-existing or new cardiac injuries is associated with elevated serum levels of troponin T (TnT), a biomarker for cardiac damage. Indeed, the study of Guo et al. points out that CVD patients without significantly raised TnT serum levels only represent a slightly increased mortality compared to patients without CVD [

Therefore, in the case of expected cardiac damage due to distinct comorbidities or severe disease progression, TnT levels should always be strictly monitored, but also critically interpreted since some medications and interventions themselves can cause an upregulation of TnT [

 <xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], TnT may be used to predict the outcome of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and aid in clinical decision making for the best possible treatment options, which ultimately help to reduce COVID-19 mortality [
