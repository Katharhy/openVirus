<p id="p0265">The involvement of the cardiovascular system in severe COVID-19 courses is already undisputed, but the specific underlying mechanisms remain to be explored. One proposed mode of action is related to a direct infection of cardiomyocytes (CMCs) by SARS-CoV-2 during the critical phase that leads to the development of myocarditis [

 <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. To date, there is no indisputable evidence for myocarditis in deceased COVID-19 patients, which requires confirmation through a biopsy or an autopsy. Therefore, to address whether inflammation of the cardiac muscle contributes to the observed heart failure (HF), additional investigations are still necessary. A second assumption that is currently pursued, is that an over-activated immune system is predominantly contributing to SARS-CoV-2-induced heart damage. Subsequent to cardiac ischemia as a consequence of pneumonia and the associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [

 <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], CMC damage and death induces a variety of pro-inflammatory mechanisms, which in turn spiral out of control and further promote loss of CMCs [

Hence, a secondary induced cardiac injury seems to be quite likely, although specific evidence is still lacking owing to the currently tense clinical situation. However, these ideas are strongly endorsed by previous studies investigating the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 or later on the MERS-CoV-associated epidemic in 2012 [

 <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Similar long-term implications on the cardiovascular system as observed in a study for SARS-CoV can only be suggested [
