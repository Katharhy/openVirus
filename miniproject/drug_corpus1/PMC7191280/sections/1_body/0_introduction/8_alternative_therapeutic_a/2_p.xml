<p id="p0295">Recently, diverse therapeutic approaches have been considered and several clinical trials have already begun. There is an intriguing variety of proposed pharmacological interventions, which arose from intensive research, the collaboration of many working groups and scientific journals around the globe. There are many possible targets in addition to ACE2, thus combined therapies may be possible and probably even more potent. Here, we highlight some of these therapeutic strategies, which have a special focus on adjuvant therapies to prevent cardiac injury. As mentioned above, high plasmin/plasminogen levels are often abundant in distinct comorbidities, and can therefore serve as a predictive biomarker for risk assessment [

While compassionate use of this nucleotide analogue improved the outcome in 36 out of 53 COVID-19 patients, placebo-controlled and randomized trials are required to assess the therapeutic efficacy [
