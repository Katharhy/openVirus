Published statistics vary between different countries, mainly because of small cohorts, different prevalence of these diseases and inadequate testing of potentially SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. In general, various organ systems are believed to participate in COVID-19 due to the widespread expression of the primary SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [
 <xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. ACE2 is an important regulator of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which systemically influences the vasculature and blood pressure via distinct hormones. This endocrine system additionally regulates the fluid and electrolyte balance in the kidneys. Briefly, the peptide prorenin is cleaved in the kidneys and activated renin is then released into the blood stream where it in turn activates angiotensinogen, which is converted into angiotensin I and finally into angiotensin II (AngII). Specific angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACEs), mainly expressed on renal and pulmonary epithelium, facilitate this activation cascade. The vasoconstrictive angiotensin II is the major driver of the blood pressure-increasing response, when the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys detects critically low blood pressure [

 <xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Specific ACE inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are the first choice as an antihypertensive drug [
 <xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. However, ACE2 is a well-characterized negative regulator of the RAAS system as it converts AngII into the vasodilatory fragment Ang 1â€“7, which simultaneously decreases the AngII concentration to further facilitate the antihypertensive effect [
 <xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. ACE2 is located on the cell surface e.g. in the renal, cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal systems [
 <xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], providing an explanation for the observed symptoms of COVID-19. In the following part of this review, we will highlight potentially connective mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 and the dysregulated presentation of ACE2 with the described clinical features in the context of cardiac injury.
