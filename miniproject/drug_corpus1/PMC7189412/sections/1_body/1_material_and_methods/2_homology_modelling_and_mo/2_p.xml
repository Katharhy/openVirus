<p>The amino acid sequence of SARS-CoV-2 orf1ab polyprotein was retrieved from National Centre for Biotechnological Information (NCBI) (Tax id: 2697049, Accession No: QHD43415). It was then subjected to pairwise sequence alignment against 3CLpro and 2′-OMTase from its close relative SARS-CoV (tax id: 694009) to figure out their amino acid sequence in SARS-CoV-2. Homology modelling of these proteins was performed using SWISS-MODEL (Waterhouse et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) with the user template option. Template structures were selected from Protein BLAST (Camacho et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) against Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) based on query coverage, percentage of sequence identity and crystal structure resolution. Energy minimisation of modelled proteins was achieved using YASARA (Krieger et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) and GalaxyWEB (Ko et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) web servers. Model evaluation was performed before and after minimisation using Structure Analysis and Verification Server (SAVES) v5.0 meta server (UCLA MBI), which includes ERRAT (Colovos &amp; Yeates, 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>), Verify-3D (Luthy et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>) and PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>) programmes.
