<p>Another crucial protein responsible for viral replication and expression in host cells is non-structural protein 16 (nsp16) or 2′-OMTase. Most viral mRNAs possess a 5′-terminal cap structure (m7GpppN) which is essential for efficient splicing, nuclear export, translation and stability (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). This structure undergoes methylation catalysed by 2′-O-ribose methyltransferase at the ribose 2′-O position of the first and second nucleotide of the mRNA(Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Lugari et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Nsp 16 encodes the 2′-OMTase which provides the viral mRNA with the ability to camouflage and obscure itself from the host cell, thus preventing recognition and activation of the host immune response which is essential for successful viral infection (Menachery et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). This protein can, therefore, act as another potential drug target for the SARS-CoV-2.
