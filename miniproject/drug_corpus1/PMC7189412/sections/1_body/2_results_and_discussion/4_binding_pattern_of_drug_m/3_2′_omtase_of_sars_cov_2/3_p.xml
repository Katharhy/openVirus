<p>In the case of 2′-OMTase, Dolutegravir showed an estimated binding free energy (ΔG) of −9.4 kcal/mol, and the inhibition constant was 128.7 nM. Besides, Bictegravir conferred an estimated binding free energy (ΔG) of −8.4 kcal/mol against 2′-OMTase, and the estimated inhibition constant was 0.696 µM. Moreover, both Dolutegravir and Bictegravir were found to be actively interacting with the catalytic site residues (see 
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) and interacting with the substrate-binding pocket (see
