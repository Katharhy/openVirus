<p>The predicted model of 2′-O methyltransferase (2′-OMTase) (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>) comprises of a core MTase domain, S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM) binding region and a cap-binding groove. The core MTase domain is found to comprise residues 30–209 of nsp16 as found in SARS-CoV (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). 2′-OMTase catalyses the transfer of SAM methyl group by relying on a conserved K-D-K-E tetrad within the substrate-binding pocket for activity (Menachery et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The surface provided by K-D-K-E (Lys-46, Asp-130, Lys-170 and Glu-203) motif present at the bottom of the central groove might bind the first adenine nucleotide conserved as the acceptor of methyl group during methylation (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).
