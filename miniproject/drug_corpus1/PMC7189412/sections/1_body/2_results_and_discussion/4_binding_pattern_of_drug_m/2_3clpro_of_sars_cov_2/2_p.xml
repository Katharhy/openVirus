<p>As SARS-CoV 3CLpro (PDB ID: 1UJ1), the predicted model also forms a homo-dimer with both protomers (signified as ‘A’ and ‘B’) oriented nearly at right angles to each other (see

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>). Domains I comprises residues 8–101, domain II includes residues 102–184 and domain III consists of residues 201–303 and is attached with domain II through an extended loop region (residues 185–200
 <bold>)</bold>. Domain I and Domain II form a chymotrypsin fold, whereas domain III is required for the homodimer assembly. The substrate-binding site is positioned in the cleft of domain I and domain II and is composed of a Cys145-His41 catalytic dyad. The substrate-binding pocket consists of His41, Phe140, Asn142, Gly143, Ser144, Cys145, Tyr161, His163, Glu166 and His172 residues (Yang et al.,
