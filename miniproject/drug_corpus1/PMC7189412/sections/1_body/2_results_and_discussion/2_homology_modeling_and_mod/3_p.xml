<p>Once the models were obtained, they were evaluated using SAVES v5.0 metaserver based on ERRAT, Verify 3D and PROCHECK. The models were further refined and minimised using YASARA Energy Minimization Server and GalaxyWEB servers. The final model of 3CLpro had a Verify 3D score of 100% and ERRAT quality factor of 98.19. In the case of PROCHECK, 93.9% residues were present in the most favoured regions of Ramachandran Plot (Ramachandran et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">1963</xref>), and more importantly, only one residue (Tyr154) was present in the disallowed regions. In the case of 2′-OMTase, the final model had a Verify 3D score of 87.33%, and ERRAT quality factor of 94.50. According to PROCHECK, 90% of the residues were in the most favoured regions of the Ramachandran plot, and notably, no residues were present in the disallowed regions. We used PDBsum (Laskowski et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) to calculate the overall average G-Factor score, which is 0.12 for both 3CLpro and 2′-OMTase, which also reflected the accuracy of the refined modelled structure (see
