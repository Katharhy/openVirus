<p>RMSD analysis of the free form of 2′-OMTase depicted that the protein molecule achieved stability at around 40 ns, and it almost maintained its stability until 100 ns. The maximum RMSD fluctuations were recorded in the first 20 ns only. There were minor variations at around 60 ns, but apart from that, the protein was quite stable until the end of the simulation cycle. The 2′-OMTase-Dolutegravir complex attained stability at around 20 ns and maintained that stability until 90 ns, except a minor drop at approximately 70 ns. The average fluctuations spiked a little bit in the final 10 ns (90–100 ns) of this simulation. The 2′-OMTase-Bictegravir complex also took 40 ns to attain stability, but it also maintained it until the end of the simulation cycle (40–100 ns). It showed a minor dip at 60 ns, but it was able to gain its stability back at around 65 ns. As the free protein, the maximum fluctuations of protein-drug complexes were recorded in the first 20 ns only, after that, all of them took a steady path (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6a</xref>) and maintained convergence state until the end of the simulation period. However, in the case 2′-OMTase-Dolutegravir complex, slight changes were observed at 90–100 ns. An average RMSD value of 0.299 nm, 0.393 nm and 0.410 nm was obtained for unbound 2′-OMTase, 2′-OMTase-Dolutegravir complex and 2′-OMTase-Bictegravir complex, respectively. As evident from the average RMSD values, both of the drug complexes were very comparable to each other, but the 2′-OMTase-Dolutegravir complex was found closer to the free protein molecule.
