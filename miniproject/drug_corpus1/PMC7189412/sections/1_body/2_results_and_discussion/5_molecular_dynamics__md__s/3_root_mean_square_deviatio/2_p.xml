<p>RMSD is essential to quantify the structural stability of a protein or protein-drug complexes within a regular time frame. RMSD analysis depicted that unbound 3CLpro started stabilising after 15 ns, and it maintained stability until 90 ns. The RMSD pattern varied slightly during the final 10 ns. Besides, the 3CLpro-Raltegravir complex also attained stability at around 10 ns, and it maintained it until 90 ns. The RMSD again decreased during the final 10 ns (90–100 ns). In contrast, 3CLpro-Paritaprevir complex gained stability at around 20 ns, retained that stability until 70 ns except for one minor dip at about 50 ns. After 70 ns, the average RMSD declined until the end of the simulation cycle (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5a</xref>). An average RMSD value of 0.295 nm, 0.361 nm and 0.401 nm was obtained for unbound 3CLpro, 3CLpro-Raltegravir and 3CLpro-Paritaprevir complexes, respectively. Overall results explained that these two drug molecules did not significantly influence the structural stability of 3CLpro, although they nearly maintained the structural integrity, particularly Raltegravir. Based on the average RMSD values obtained from this analysis, the 3CLpro-Raltegravir complex was found to be closer to the drug-free form of 3CLpro.
