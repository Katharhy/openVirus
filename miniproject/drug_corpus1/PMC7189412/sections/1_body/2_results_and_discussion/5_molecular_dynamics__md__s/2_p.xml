<p>Molecular dynamics simulation is used to study the physical transitions of atoms as well as entire macromolecules and are effectively adopted to comprehend the structure-to-function relevance of a given macromolecule (Ambure et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Amera et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Hospital et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Moreover, it can also be employed to illustrate the strength, pattern, and properties of protein-drug interactions and the dynamic conformational changes of macromolecule experiences under various physiological conditions (Amera et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Different structural parameters, including RMSD, RMSF, Rg, PCA (based on ED approach), Intermolecular H-bondsand SASA, were evaluated as a function of time. To elucidate the conformational stability, dynamics, structural stability, folding properties and compactness of protein-drug complexes, MD simulations were performed for a period of 100 ns.
