<p>In the case of 3CLpro, we observed the highest fluctuations in loop heavy domain II and domain III. The loop regions are very flexible elements of protein molecules, and their flexibility is essential to accommodate the drug at the binding site appropriately. Besides, the 3CLpro-Raltegravir complex was found to be showing more significant fluctuations in comparison to 3CLpro-Paritaprevir complex (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5b</xref>). The average RMSF values of 3CLpro, 3CLpro-Raltegravir complex and 3CLpro-Paritaprevir complex were found to be 0.170 nm, 0.182 nm and 0.184 nm, respectively. Additionally, the majority of the protein residues were stable with RMSF values smaller than 0.3 nm. Also, the catalytic dyad (His41 and Cys145) participating in interactions with the drug molecules remained highly stable throughout the MD simulation.
