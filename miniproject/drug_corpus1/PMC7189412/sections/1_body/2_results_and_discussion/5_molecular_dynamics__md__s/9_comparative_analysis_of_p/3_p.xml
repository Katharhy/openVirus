<p>Structural superposition of pre and post MD simulation of drug-free 2′-OMTase structures showed an RMSD of 2.115 Å. Besides, we also carried out the same analysis for both drug bounded structures of 2′-OMTase. Also, we performed the same structural superimposition analysis of drug bounded structures 2′-OMTase, which explained that the RMSD before and after MD simulation of 2′-OMTase-Dolutegravir complex and 2′-OMTase-Bictegravir complex was reliable and stable with the values of 1.767 Å and 2.568 Å, respectively (see
