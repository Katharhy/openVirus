<p>PCA of free 2′-OMTase, 2′-OMTase-Dolutegravir complex and 2′-OMTase-Bictegravir complex depicted that the protein, as well as the protein-drug complexes, were occupying almost equal conformational space (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0010">Figure 10</xref>). Trace of the covariance matrix for 2′-OMTase, 2′-OMTase-Dolutegravir complex and 2′-OMTase-Bictegravir complex was found to be 106.463 nm
 <sup>2</sup>, 123.878 nm
 <sup>2</sup> and 117.187 nm
 <sup>2</sup>, respectively. Together with all of the MD simulation analysis, PCA supported that Dolutegravir and Bictegravir could be the most promising drugs capable of inhibiting the function of 2′-OMTase.
