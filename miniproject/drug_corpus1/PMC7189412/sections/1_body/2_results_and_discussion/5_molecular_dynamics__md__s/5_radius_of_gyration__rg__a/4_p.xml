<p>In the case of 2′-OMTase, both the protein-drug complexes were slightly less compact in comparison to the free 2′-OMTase. The free protein, as well as the protein-drug complexes, attained stability at 30 ns and remained stable until the end (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6c</xref>). The average Rg values of 2′-OMTase, 2′-OMTase-Dolutegravir complex and 2′-OMTase-Bictegravir complex were found to be 1.796 nm, 1.799 nm and 1.805 nm, respectively. Most of the fluctuations in the Rg values were recorded before 20 ns which again supported that these drug molecules stayed strongly bound to the active site and they helped to maintain the stability and compactness of the protein structure.
