<p>The radius of gyration is a valuable tool to understand the folding properties and compactness of protein and protein-drug complexes. It can also be used to elucidate the influence a drug molecule exerts leading to conformational changes in protein structure. A relatively high Rg value indicates a protein molecule with loose packing, whereas a smaller Rg value indicates a protein structure with tight packing. This analysis is also used to understand whether the drug molecules maintained the folding behaviour of protein or not.</p>
