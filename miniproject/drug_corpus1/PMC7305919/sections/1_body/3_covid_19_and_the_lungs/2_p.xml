<p id="p0045">A second manifestation that occurs in a minority of patients usually in the second week from symptom onset is a dysfunctional immune response, in which massive activation of cytokines is triggered. Markedly elevated concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines attract immune cells to the lungs. The resulting lung damage, with desquamation of alveolar cells, hyaline membrane formation, and pulmonary oedema, is manifest as ARDS, with widespread bilateral consolidation or GGO on imaging accompanied by progression to hypoxaemic respiratory failure.
