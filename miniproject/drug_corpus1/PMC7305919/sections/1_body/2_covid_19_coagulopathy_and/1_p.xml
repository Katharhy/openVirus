<p id="p0025">Severe COVID-19 causes a specific coagulopathy that is reminiscent of, but also distinct from, other systemic coagulopathies associated with severe infections, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation or thrombotic microangiopathy.

 </xref> Pro-inflammatory cytokines, in particular IL-6, stimulate mononuclear cells to express tissue factor, leading to thrombin generation, thereby initiating a systemic coagulopathy. Superimposed on this low-grade coagulation activation, direct infection of endothelial cells causes release of plasminogen activator (explaining the very high D-dimer concentrations in severe COVID-19) and large von Willebrand factor multimers.

 </xref> The massive release of these multimers overwhelms the cleaving capacity of its physiological regulator ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) resulting in high concentrations of uncleaved von Willebrand factor mediating the consequent deposit of microvascular platelet thrombi, especially in affected pulmonary vessels.
