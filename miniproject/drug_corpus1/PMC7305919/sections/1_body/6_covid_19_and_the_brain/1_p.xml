<p id="p0085">Neurological complications of COVID-19 infection result from a number of factors: direct invasion of neurological tissue by the virus, virus-induced inflammatory changes (including thrombosis), metabolic disturbance (such as hypoxaemia and acidosis), and unintended consequences of medical interventions ranging from sedative medications to the pressure effects of prolonged prone positioning. Direct invasion of neurones could be facilitated via ACE2 receptors, but the presence of these entry points in brain tissue is unconfirmed
