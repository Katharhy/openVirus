  <p>Parabolic response surface analysis of the 5 anti‐viral drugs established with the 30 combinations. A) Viral infection rates at 12 h (bar plot and left 
   <italic>y</italic>‐axis) of the 30 combinations and their accumulative equivalent doses (line plot and right 
   <italic>y</italic>‐axis). Error bars show standard deviations (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). B) The coefficients of the parabolic response surface were calculated by stepwise regression (
   <italic>p</italic>‐value &lt; 0.001). The values of the coefficients are presented by heatmap. C) Response surfaces of the 3 identified interactions with the other three drugs at 0 dose. The 
   <italic>x</italic>‐axis values represent equivalent doses. D) Response surfaces of the 3 identified interactions with the other three drugs at 1 equivalent dose. The 
   <italic>x</italic>‐axis values represent equivalent doses. E) The adjusted 
   <italic>R</italic> values of the polynomial models built by stepwise regression increase as 2‐drug and 3‐drug interaction terms are added. However, the addition of 4‐drug and 5‐drug interaction terms makes no difference, indicating the overall anti‐viral efficacy is mainly attributed from single drug contributions, drug quadratic effects, 2‐drug interaction synergy and 3‐drug interaction synergy. Abbreviations: AMT, Amantadine HCl; AZT, Azithromycin; CLR, Chloroquine Diphosphate; OMP, Omeprazole Sodium; RBV, Ribavirin.
