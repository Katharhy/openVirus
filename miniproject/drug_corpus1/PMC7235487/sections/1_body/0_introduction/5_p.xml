<p>Within 3 days, our studies successfully identified and repeatedly validated multiple drug combinations that simultaneously reduced VSV infection to 1.5% with no apparent adverse impact on A549 viability. In addition, this platform identified multiple highly efficacious and tolerable regimens, presenting the potential of multiple options for treatment. This study demonstrated that Project IDentif.AI can potentially be used for patient‐specific or population‐wide development of actionable combination therapy. It's implementation also does not require complex disease mechanism or drug target information for implementation. This may enable its immediate application toward dynamically‐optimized drug repurposing and novel combination therapy development against high priority pathogens such as COVID‐19 and others.</p>
