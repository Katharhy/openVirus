 <sup>]</sup> among others. When addressing infectious diseases that are not well understood, and capable of exhibiting aggressive clinical courses with subsequent patient mortality, rapid intervention that is optimally suited to target the pathogen is critical. Due to the unpredictability and severity of these pathogens, combination therapy based on drug repurposing is often indicated due to the urgency of intervention and the requirement of previously established drug safety in humans. Unfortunately, these drug combinations are often designed using trial‐and‐error strategies. Specifically, drugs are selected based on their targets or mechanism of action, and they are administered using clinical standard dosing guidelines. Dose adjustments are made when toxicity is observed. Unfortunately, these approaches likely preclude optimal treatment outcomes.
