<p>The VSV model used for this study was encoded with green fluorescent protein (GFP) to monitor cell infection, with GFP intensity corresponding to viral infection efficiency. The GFP intensity of VSV‐infected cells under different MOI parameters (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1) were assessed. Cell densities for each well of 96 well plate varied between 4000 (4k), 8000 (8k) and 12 000 (12k) per well. Infection was allowed for 24 and 30 h (

We therefore utilized 12k per well as the initial cell density throughout the study. We then further reduced the MOI and incubation time. Microscope images of bright field and fluorescence are merged for visualization under different MOI parameters (0.001, 0.01, 0.1) after VSV infection occurred for 12 h (Figure

 <xref rid="adtp202000034-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). Of note, as indicated in the Figure 
 <xref rid="adtp202000034-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1C</xref> and ImageJ cell counting results, only 9.56 ± 2.55% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) cells were infected under MOI = 0.001 during 12 h. A MOI = 0.01 infected a majority of the cells after a 12 h incubation and the overall GFP intensity continued to increase at the 24 h checkpoint, indicating that the virus continued its reproduction inside the cells during this period of time.
