<p>The core aim of Project IDentif.AI was to simultaneously identify the combinatorial drugs and doses that optimally inhibited VSV infection of A549 while maximizing A549 viability. In lieu of using prior information pertaining to the synergistic affects among the 12 candidate drugs to identify suitable drug combinations, Project IDentif.AI harnessed a quadratic relationship between drug/dose inputs and efficacy/safety outputs to effectively identify the drug‐dose parameter space from which the optimal drug combinations could be pinpointed, and drug synergy was identified after the optimization process was completed. Therefore, this process was agnostic to disease mechanism, as well as drug target information. The viral infection outcomes from each drug treatment were recorded at 12 and 24 h. For the purposes of evaluating the speed of optimization that would also yield experimentally validated VSV inhibition from a 12‐drug set, a minimum threshold of 72 drug combinations with a broad range of corresponding dose levels were initially assessed (MOI = 0.1, Table S2, Supporting Information). Viral infection and drug treatment was simultaneously applied to host cells. The efficacy and corresponding accumulative equivalent dose of the 72 drug combinations revealed a broad spectrum of VSV infection rates (

Of note, the key therapies that were shown to contribute toward viral inhibition when delivered in combination with other candidates, and merit further optimization included amantadine HCl, azithromycin, chloroquine diphosphate, omeprazole sodium, and ribavirin.
