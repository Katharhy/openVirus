<p>12 drugs purchased from Selleckchem (TX, USA) were included in this study. These included amantadine HCl, dexamethasone, azithromycin, chloroquine diphosphate, naproxen sodium, fluoxetine HCl, loratadine, omeprazole sodium, ritonavir, lopinavir, doxycycline and ribavirin. Amantadine HCl, chloroquine diphosphate, naproxen sodium, fluoxetine HCl, omeprazole sodium, doxycycline and ribavirin were diluted using complete cell culture medium, while dexamethasone, azithromycin, loratadine, ritonavir, and lopinavir were diluted in DMSO. The final stock concentration of all the drugs was 100 × 10
