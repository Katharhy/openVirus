<p>To cancel the disparity of the therapeutic concentration ranges between drugs, as well as to facilitate the expression of dose concentrations, the concept of equivalent dose was adopted. 1 equivalent dose refers to 5 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup>
 <sc>m</sc> for naproxen sodium and ribavirin, and 1 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup>
 <sc>m</sc> for the others. Thus, the accumulative equivalent dose of a combination therapy was defined as the sum of the equivalent doses of its constituents.
