<p>Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a RNA virus, was used as the pathogen model in this work. VSV was engineered and encoded with green fluorescent protein (GFP). The concentration of VSV stock was 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> pfu µL
 <sup>−1</sup>, and different multiplicity of infection (MOI) parameters were used to optimize the final MOI for cell infection. The MOI used for the optimization process included 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001 and 0 (control). Cells were infected by VSV under different MOI parameters for 12, 24, and 30 h during the optimization process. For each MOI, the conditions were run in triplicate. 100 µL of cell suspension (12k cells per well) was seeded in a 96 well‐plate and pre‐incubated for 12 h to be infected by VSV. Following viral infection, the GFP fluorescence intensity of the cells induced by VSV reproduction was measured with a microplate reader (BioTek, Synergy HT, USA) using the top‐reading mode, with excitation wavelength of 483 nm, and emission wavelength of 535 nm).
