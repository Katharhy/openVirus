<p>As exhibited with the recent emergence of COVID‐19, there are adequate tools to rapidly identify and obtain genomic details in near real time through modern sequencing techniques that often enable the swift development of effective diagnostics.

 <sup>]</sup> However, the ability to develop medical therapeutics that are both effective and easily deployable remains a critical gap in epidemic response efforts. Vaccines and therapeutics for the past two outbreaks have benefited from greater than 20 years of development efforts that allowed for rapid advancement to human use clinical studies. In epidemic situations interventions that address both individual patient illness and control/prevention of continued transmission are necessary. The spectrum of disease caused by emerging/re‐emerging infectious diseases can vary considerably including severe symptomatic disease, moderate/mild symptomatic disease, and asymptomatic spreaders. Moreover, convalescence remains a challenge as recovering patients may continue to shed virus, sometimes for extended periods of time after initial infection. Therefore, effective therapeutics and interventions must have the ability to address the full spectrum of disease and contribute to controlling transmission and spread of the pathogen.
