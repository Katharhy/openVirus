<p>Effective tailoring of treatment to both populations and individuals may also increase healthcare quality and efficiency, enabling an opportunity to personalize healthcare costs via quality‐based pricing. Specifically, technologies that realize actionable data on patient‐specific drug/dose profiles will play a key role in establishing the relationship between individualizing treatment with improved quality of care. This relationship will also be driven by the emergence of quality variation, as some patients, hospital systems, and payers will be more willing than others to make available and/or pay for the testing that may generate more, or better data on patient‐specific drug/dose profiles. In turn, this may lead to the introduction of performance‐based contracting or quality‐based price discrimination, which are suitable pathways to explore, especially if they result in better health outcomes while reducing the cost of care.

 <sup>]</sup> Many countries have implemented a performance‐based approach to contracting for medical services, which has also led to improvements in domains beyond healthcare quality and efficiency. For example, this approach in the U.S. is implemented under the name of “pay for performance” or “payment by results” in the U.K. These strategies have shown that performance‐based contracting can improve social welfare,
