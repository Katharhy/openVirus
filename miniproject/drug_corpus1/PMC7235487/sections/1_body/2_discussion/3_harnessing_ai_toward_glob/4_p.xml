<p>In addition to considering patient‐centric healthcare coverage of emerging AI platforms to tailor their treatment, as the latest circumstances show on a larger scale, global health emergencies can substantially impact economies. For example, prolonged overburdening of providers, patients, payers and policymakers due to pandemics, coupled with ageing populations can lead to unsustainable healthcare infrastructures. When considering the core disease areas that receive the most attention, such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular, the reality is that communicable infection remains a formidable healthcare infrastructural burden.

 <sup>]</sup> For example, in many parts of the world, there remains a need to develop better infectious disease interventions to fight the overuse of antibiotics (positioned to consume 10 million lives annually by 2050).

 <sup>]</sup> This challenge alone could have dramatic economic consequences. Considering the regional relevance of this problem, ≈80% of the malaria parasites in parts of Thailand and Vietnam were resistant to artemisinin and piperaquine, and that the failure rates of the among the most potent frontline combination therapy regimens comprised of dihydroartemisinin‐piperaquine (DHA‐PPQ) had reached as high as 87% in Northern Thailand.

 <sup>]</sup> Many solutions ranging from vaccines to novel drug designs are being proposed to address the COVID‐19 situation. However, maintaining agility in modulating drug regimens to account for potentially rapid viral mutation or other factors that could dynamically predict patient responses and identify corresponding optimized interventions will be critical. Dengue, which affects more than 400 million people each year, is highly‐dynamic based on variables such as geographical climate. A recent study has suggested that 8000 cases of TB could be prevented each year solely through the use of more advanced analytics.

 <sup>]</sup> The economic evaluation of interventions may become increasingly important as extraordinary circumstances strain healthcare system‐wide operations as well as industry operations. Therefore, governments and healthcare systems may be under pressure to substantially impact their quality‐adjusted‐life‐years (QALY) and disability‐adjusted‐life‐years (DALY). It should also be noted that the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in global spend on drug research and development was 3.6% between 2010 and 2017, outpacing global sales of prescription drugs, which grew at a CAGR of 2.0% during the same period.

 <sup>]</sup> Therefore, the importance of accomplishing more while using less resources, making healthcare systems more economically‐viable, and maximizing the potential of deploying AI into the agile and dynamic deployment of therapeutic regimens cannot be overstated.
