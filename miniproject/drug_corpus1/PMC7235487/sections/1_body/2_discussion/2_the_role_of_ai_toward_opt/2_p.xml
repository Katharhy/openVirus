<p>During the COVID‐19 outbreak, immediately deployable combination therapies based on drug repurposing were used in the clinic. These included Kaletra (ritonavir/lopinavir) in combination with oseltamivir. (Tamiflu
 <sup>®</sup>), and other regimens. Repurposed monotherapies and combination therapies carry the benefit of previously demonstrated safety in patients and threshold efficacy for other indications. Therefore, it is common in these scenarios to select a small pool of established therapies to co‐administer, and to adjust drug doses accordingly if toxicity issues ensue. While shown to be potentially clinically effective for some patients, this is largely a trial‐and‐error strategy. Globally optimizing drug repurposing is a starkly different approach, and can yield combinations comprised of unexpected therapies that far outperform traditional drug combination development, which is based on target/mechanism‐based drug selection followed by dose finding.
