<p>It is important to emphasize that this study was conducted using an in vitro VSV model, and the top ranked drug combination has not been subsequently clinically validated. In addition, the VSV model was selected primarily due to it being a well‐characterized and readily available platform. If a different disease platform and/or host model are used, it is highly probable that the ranking, drugs that comprise the combinations, and the number of drugs that mediate optimal performance will change. Also, this study was conducted with a diverse range of potential drug candidates. In a clinical setting, especially to address COVID‐19 or other clinically relevant pathogens, the pool of drug candidates, which should be developed in consultation with the treating clinical team, is likely to differ substantially from the pool used in this study. Furthermore, if this approach is applied toward clinical samples, patient‐specific rankings of optimal combinations can potentially emerge. The importance of the findings of this study are centered on the ability to rapidly interrogate massive parameter spaces that are created when both the right drugs and their right respective doses have to simultaneously reconciled. The ability to reconcile this extraordinarily large set of possible combinations in a timely fashion into actionable and globally optimized combinations may be effective for scenarios where the prevention of community spread of novel and aggressive pathogens is critical. While additional further clinical validation at the point‐of‐care is required, several key factors pertaining to the broad clinical relevance and prior validation of technologies related to Project IDentif.AI should be noted. Firstly, previous oncology studies using the quadratic phenotypic optimization platform (QPOP) and CURATE.AI, which are foundational to Project IDentif.AI, have demonstrated that benchtop‐based implementation of this approach have directly led to markedly enhanced patient outcomes compared to traditionally observed results.
