<p>When not constrained by drug selection based on targets and mechanism of action, the pool of candidate therapies can be enlarged to include a broader diversity of compounds for repurposing. Unfortunately, it should also be noted that drug dosing not only impacts single drug efficacy and safety. In the context of drug combination design, dosing considerations will also impact the drugs that ultimately comprise the best combinations. This effectively creates a parameter space that is too large to interrogate using brute‚Äêforce testing of all possible combinations.</p>
