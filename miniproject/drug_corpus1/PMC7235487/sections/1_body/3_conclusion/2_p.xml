<p>This work has provided a foundation toward the rapid identification of dynamically optimized and actionable combination therapies to address a broad spectrum of infectious disease applications while also accounting for new strains that may eventually circulate. Given the mechanism‐ and disease‐agnostic foundation of Project IDentif.AI, further studies will evaluate this platform for rapid COVID‐19 intervention, and establish its readiness to pinpoint regimens toward downstream pathogens with aggressive clinical courses. Pairing the technical capabilities of AI‐driven drug development platforms with important policy‐based considerations and lessons learned from the global response to SARS, H1N1, EVD, and other epidemics/pandemics may ultimately lead to expedited intervention at scale.</p>
