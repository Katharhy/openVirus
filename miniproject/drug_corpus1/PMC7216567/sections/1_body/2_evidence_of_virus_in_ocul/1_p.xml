<p id="Par3">The nasal portal is the most common route of entry for SARS-CoV-2 virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. To facilitate cellular entry, the spike protein (S) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to the ACE2 receptor and is then primed by proteases such as TMPRSS2 and this binding affinity determines the viral load and disease severity. However, other proteases may also be involved [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In the eye, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-localise in the corneal epithelium [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Conjunctivitis is a rare manifestation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and transmission through ocular secretions is also low [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].
