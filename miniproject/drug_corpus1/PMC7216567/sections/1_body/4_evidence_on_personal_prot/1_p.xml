<p id="Par6">There are conflicting views worldwide on precisely how effectively masks protect healthcare workers, patients and the general public. Masks do provide high levels of respiratory protection and for this reason the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the Royal College of Ophthalmologists [RCOphth] and PHE have advised the use of masks when examining and treating all patients. Masks are classified based on filter efficacy and face adhesion: FFP 1, 2 and 3 offer filter efficacy 80%, 94% and 99%, respectively [

Gloves, disposable aprons, eye protection, fluid resistant type IIR surgical masks (FRSM) and slit lamp guards are recommended as PPE for all ophthalmic clinic assessment and outpatient procedures (e.g. intravitreal injections) by the Royal College of Ophthalmologists [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. For potential AGPs, the PHE and RCOphth guidance advises consideration of the use of single use FPP respirator, fluid resistant gown, gloves and eye protection. For high risk acute areas such as operation theatres where AGPs are performed and high dependency unit where ophthalmology review may be required, use of gloves plastic apron and FRSM with eye protection is recommended. The PHE recommends use of masks for all patients attending outpatient clinics and using communal waiting areas.
