<p id="Par10">Nosocomial transmission has been recognised as an important amplifier in epidemics of both SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome. Although hospital settings are the most common sites for secondary transmission of SARS and MERS virus, it is not the case for COVID 19 and considerable transmission occur through close contacts [

Overall, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 240 (14%) tests. To further explore the occupational role affected, staff were divided into three groups—direct patient facing roles, non-patient facing roles but potentially high risk and non-clinical roles. Most staff were in group 1 (834 [81%] of 1029), with a minority in groups 2 (86 [8%]) or 3 (109 [11%]). However, comparison yielded no significant difference in rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the groups. They concluded that nosocomial infection from patients to staff was not an important factor—community spread played a larger role in transmission. Another important outcome from the testing protocol was that a large number of employees (1414) were able to return to work quickly even in direct patient facing roles. However, the limitations of the study were testing of a smaller cohort of non-clinical staff, lack of data on symptomatology and use of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp assay which has low sensitivity [
