  <p>Schematic phase diagram of Antibody-Depending Enhancement (ADE) effect for four-serovars dengue disease: DEN 1, DEN 2, DEN 3 and DEN 4. The mechanism of ADE may be perceived when an individual who has previously infected (primary infected) with one serotype of the dengue infected again (secondary infected) months or years later with a different serotype. While an individual is infected with one serotype dengue disease (say DEN 1), the immune response developed antibodies against this particular serotype (DEN 1: green) dengue disease that prevents the virus from binding to macrophage cells. However, if another serotype of dengue virus: DEN 2/DEN 3/DEN 4 (orange/red/blue) infect the same individual, the immune system is misled because the four serotypes have similar surface antigens. The antibodies cannot recognize the surface protein of the newly attacked virus which proceeds to infect individual because it has not been inactivated by antibodies. This phenomenon is defined as Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) that creates the contagious disease much more terrible. The primary infected form mostly minor disease whereas the secondary infected is more likely to be associated with dengue hemorrhagic fever.
