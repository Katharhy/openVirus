<p id="p0085">Comparing S-2 with S-4 diseases, we observed an increase in serotype diversity causing a subsequent rise in disease incidence (panels B and C). A similar tendency was also observed in the case of both vaccinated and secondary recovered individuals (panels D, E, and G). Enhancement of serotype diversity increased the portion of both vaccinated and secondary recovered groups. However, only one exception was observed for the primary recovered (panel F) group, suggesting that an increase in serotype diminished the portion of recovered individuals. This can be fully justified by the fact that a higher number of disease serotypes intensified the transmission from primary recovered to secondary infection. Additionally, 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> highlights that the impact of both vaccinations (primary and secondary) suppressed the spread of the disease when compared with non-vaccination or the default settings (no vaccination and evolutionary mechanism taking place). Furthermore, it appears that a higher efficiency at a cheaper cost delivered higher vaccination uptake, which in turn reduced infection for both primary and secondary incidences. The opposite tendency was observed in the case of less efficient and more expensive vaccines. According to results in general, even though more individuals will benefit from either primary or secondary vaccination, an epidemic cannot be eradicated by these two vaccination types as employed in the parameter settings noted here.
