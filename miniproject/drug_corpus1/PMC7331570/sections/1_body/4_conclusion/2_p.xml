<p id="p0140">Applying the vaccination game approach to epidemics, we proposed an 
 <italic>n</italic>-serovar SVIRS disease model for studying the effect of ADE for two vaccination types, primary and secondary, as it relates to the control and preclusion of contagious diseases. Model investigations and numerical simulations were carried out by including two voluntary vaccination options with several parameters including vaccination cost, efficiency, and ADE factor for two serotypes (S-2 and S-4). Our model can easily be extended to a generalized 
 <italic>n</italic>-serotype model for arbitrary infections. The model presumed modified replicator dynamics and a mean field approximation, i.e., an infinite and diverse population.
