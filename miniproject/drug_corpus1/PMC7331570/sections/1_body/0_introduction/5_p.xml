<p id="p0040">Based on the literature, within the vaccination game framework, human decision-making and behavior is multi-modally affected by self-interest, vaccination cost, neighborsâ€™ attitudes, and vaccination risk. All of these factors may play an important role in decreasing the risk for both vaccinated and non-vaccinated (free rider) individuals. However, all of the research noted above involving the vaccination game approach presumed vaccination as pre-emptive and lasting only one season. More importantly, the research adopted vaccines that were primarily aimed at treating influenza-like diseases. In the present study, we created a novel realistic model for the vaccination game approach for dengue-like disease treatment by taking into account ADE, where two vaccinations are introduced within a time sequence. Here, primary vaccination should be applied prior to initial infection, with the secondary vaccine following the first infection. Furthermore, spreading of the disease and updating the treatment strategy should be restructured using the same time scale, and the immunity lasts until it wanes.</p>
