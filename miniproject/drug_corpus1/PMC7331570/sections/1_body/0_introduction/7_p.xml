<p id="p0050">The paper is ordered as follows. First, we formulate our model in detail. This is followed by introducing an evolutionary mechanism for the strategy-updating rule, i.e., modified replicator dynamics. After describing the model, we present simulation results and discuss their implications. Finally, we conclude the paper with a brief discussion of major findings in the conclusion section.</p>
