<p id="p0030">Among multi-serotypes epidemics, dengue fever, one of the most devastating mosquito-borne viral infections to humans, is a significant problem worldwide (

 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">Shepard et al., 2016</xref>). The disease is caused by infection with any of four virus serotypes: DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4 (
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Ferrar et al., 2014</xref>). The virus affects more than 3.9 billion people in 128 countries in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world, and 52% of people are at risk in Asian and Latin American countries (

 <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">Biswal et al., 2019</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2018</xref>), and the vaccine aimed at avoiding second infection. However, for those who have not previously been infected, the vaccine is not as effective. Regarding current vaccination and serotype processes linked to dengue fever, the sequence of infection to which an individual is exposed should be considered. Strategies for self-protection from risk will greatly influence whether first and/or second infections occur. In the case of dengue fever, the most efficient protective measure is vaccination. In this context, the so-called 
 <italic>vaccination game</italic> can be an effective approach for modeling such a complex and dynamic system, where epidemiological dynamics in society can be considered alongside the social evolution of individual decision-making for committing to vaccination in view of governmental policy.
