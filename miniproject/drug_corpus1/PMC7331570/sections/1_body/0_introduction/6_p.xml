<p id="p0045">The main goal of this work is to provide a benchmark for allowing the study of an epidemiological model for dengue transmission once vaccination has been affected. In doing so, the study focuses on representing the effect of ADE and 
 <italic>n</italic>-serovar aspects within the evolutionary game framework. The two types of vaccinations, primary and secondary, were based on the respective dynamics of vaccination rate among individuals, which is affected by individual perceptions of both infection risk and cost burden. The model further allowed for investigating the relationship between ADE, serotypes, and cost-efficiency and how these might influence a vaccine within an evolutionary framework context.
