<p id="p0025">In the present study, we design on the strengths of existing research and considered the epidemic model and vaccination game and multi-serotype approaches, which in turn is based on evolutionary game theory and gives rise to the human decision-making process. The theoretical approach pioneered by

 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">Goffman and Newill, 1964</xref>) played an important role in epidemiology in terms of the control and prevention of contagious diseases. Recently, this area of study has been accentuated due to the advent of a new strain of pandemic diseases such as influenza, smallpox, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), pneumonia, and dengue fever, among others. Precisely, if we are concerned more to control infectious diseases by immunization, pathogens become more robust to survive and developed new antigenic strains (

 <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Vaughn et al., 2000</xref>). One such ‘enhanced disease’ phenomenon is attributed to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), which gives rise to a bolstered viral growth rate in a secondary infection following recovery from a primary infection caused by a variety of serovars (

 <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">Billings et al., 2007</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">Billings et al., 2008</xref>) (see 
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> ). Antibody-dependent enhancement represents an evolutionary advancement in multi-strain viruses that makes vaccination difficult. More specifically, this enhancement presents obstacles to optimal immunization that includes all strains of a disease. The reason for this is that newly developed vaccines against only one serotype can increase the possibility of infection by a second serotype. This is particularly risky for people suffering from dengue fever and its related conditions, because infections in this case are particularly severe.
