Northwest region-Cameroon having the second epidemiological burden of HIV infection, generating data on PDR in these geographical settings, will enhance evidence-based decision-making.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Objectives</title><p>We sought to ascertain levels of PDR and HIV-1 clade dispersal in rural and urban settings, and their potential association with subtype distribution and CD4-staging.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Methods</title><p>A cross-sectional study was conducted from February to May 2017 among patients recently diagnosed with HIV-infection and initiating ART at the Bamenda regional Hospital (urban setting) and the Mbingo Baptist hospital (rural setting). Protease and reverse transcriptase sequencing was performed using an in-house protocol and pre-treatment drug resistance mutations were interpreted using Stanford <italic>HIVdb</italic>.<italic>v8</italic>.<italic>3</italic>. Phylogeny was performed for subtype assignation.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 61 patient sequences were generated from ART initiators (median age: 37 years old; 57.4% female; median CD4 cell count: 184 [IQR: 35&#x02013;387] in urban vs. 161 [IQR: 96&#x02013;322] cells/mm<sup>3</sup> in rural). Overall, the level of PDR was 9.8% (6/61). Of note, burden of PDR was almost doubled in urban (12.9% [4/31]) compared to rural setting 6.7% (2/30), <italic>p</italic> = 0.352). Fifteen (15) PDR mutations were found among four patients the urban settings [6 resistance mutations to NRTIs:[M41L (2), E44D (1), K65R (1), K70E (1), M184V/I (2), K219R (1)] and 6 resistance mutations to NNRTIs: K103N (1), E138A/G (2), V179E (1), M230L (1), K238T (1), P225H (1)] against two (02) mutations found in two patients in the rural setting[2 resistant mutations to NNRTIs: E138A (1) and Y188H (1)]. The rural setting showed more genetic diversity (8 subtypes) than the urban setting (5 subtypes), with CRF02_AG being the most prevalent clade (72.1% [44/61]). Of note, level of PDR was similar between patients infected with CRF02_AG and non-CRF02_AG infected (9.1% [4/44]) vs. 11.8% [2/17]), <italic>p</italic> = 1.000). Moreover, PDR appeared higher in patients with CD4 cell count &#x0003c;200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> compared to those with CD4 cell count &#x02265;200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (14.7% [5/34]) vs. 3.7% [1/27]), <italic>p</italic> = 0.214).</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Conclusions</title><p>PDR is at a moderate rate in the Northwest region of Cameroon, with higher burden within urban populations. CRF02_AG is the most predominant clade in both urban and rural settings. No effect of HIV molecular epidemiology and CD4-staging on the presence of PDR in patients living in these settings was found.

However, with the new goal currently endorsed by the joint United Nations program on AIDS (UNAIDS) aimed at ending AIDS by 2030, through the 90-90-90 treatment target by 2020 [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and coupled with the WHO recommendation to test and treat [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], there have been an increase in the on-going scale-up of antiretroviral treatment (ART) most especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However the increased scale-up has led to undesired consequences like the selection and emergence of HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) variants, which remains a major obstacle, limiting the efficacy of commonly available antiretroviral (ARVs) [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. HIVDR remains a huge problem as it currently involves not only patients on antiretroviral-treatment, but equally drug-na&#x000ef;ve individuals carrying HIV-resistant strains [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Based on the World Health Organisation (WHO) classification of HIVDR, it is classified into three main categories; pre-treatment drug resistance [PDR, (among ART initiators or re-initiators)], transmitted drug resistance (TDR, among recently-infected individuals), and acquired drug resistance [ADR, (at ART failure)] [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. ADR occurs when HIV mutations emerge as a result of viral replication in individuals receiving ARV drugs. Transmitted HIV drug resistance (TDR) are resistances detected in ARV drug-naive patients with no history of ARV drug exposure. While pre-treatment HIV drug resistance (PDR) is resistance detected in ARV drug-naive people initiating ART or people with prior ARV drug exposure initiating or reinitiating first-line ART. PDR can either be transmitted or acquired drug resistance. It may have been transmitted at the time of infection (TDR), or it may be acquired by virtue of prior ARV drug exposure [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The transmission of HIV-1 drug resistance from treatment-experienced patients to newly infected individuals has been observed in developed countries with access to antiretroviral therapy [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref010" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In 2015, a meta-analysis conducted in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), South/Southeast Asia(SSEA), Upper-income Asian countries, Latin America/Caribbean, Europe and North-America showed the median overall prevalence of transmitted HIV drug resistance was 2,8%, 2,9%, 5.6%, 7.6%, 9.4% and 11.5% respectively [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Cameroon a sub-Saharan African country situated in Central West Africa, harbours 67% of the Worlds HIV infection [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

The Northwest region having the second highest HIV epidemiological burden [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] would require evidence on PDR in both rural and urban settings.

In this study, the Pre-treatment (PDR) prevalence rate was found to be 9.8%. Keeping in mind that the new surveillance method revised in 2014 by the WHO to monitor PDR in populations initiating ART involves generating a national representative prevalence estimate among this population [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], our findings suggest that PDR is at a moderate level at these settings, in accordance with previously described PDR WHO survey method of populations within a specified geographic area [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref029" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our results are in accordance with previous studies carried out in the centre region Yaounde-Cameroon reporting drug-resistance mutation in population initiating ARV ranging from 4.9% to 24% [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A recent study characterising a national representation of PDR in Cameroon following recent guidelines by WHO showed PDR resistance in Cameroon to be 10.4% [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This would suggest that though standard first-line treatment may remain effective, their efficacy is been affected as rate of PDR is on the rise. Studies conducted in other African countries show drug resistance mutation in populations initiating ARV to be; 11.5% (Mali), 9.2% (South Africa), 9.2% (Kenya), 4.2% (Morocco) [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In Europe precisely in the UK PDR has been found to reach right up to 14% [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Rates as high as 25% of PDR has been reported in the USA [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Of note most of these studies accessed transmitted drug resistance in na&#x000ef;ve patients as distinguished now from pre-treatment drug resistance as per WHO revision in 2014 [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The differences in prevalence of PDR can be due to several factors; among which we could have the nature of the study (cross-sectional versus longitudinal), as longitudinal studies has been shown to have a lower level of drug resistance in na&#x000ef;ve population compared to cross-sectional [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Secondly, differences in data among countries may also have resulted from specific biological and cultural characteristics as they relate to national epidemics, such as transmission routes, the proportion of non-B viruses and prescription guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Finally discrepancies can be further explained by the fact that, there are different algorithms available to the public domain which are routinely used for drug resistance interpretation and can therefore give results which are more or less similar, depending on the capacity of these tools to detect mutations [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, the Stanford HIVdb algorithm version 8.5 known for its high sensitivity in the HIVDR detection was used in our study.</p><p>Our study showed a majority of mutations to NNRTIs (about two times higher than resistance mutations to NRTIs). There were no mutations to PIs detected in our study. This can be explained by the fact that majority of the population under HAART are not exposed to protease inhibitors which are generally reserved for second line treatment in our setting. Therefore the rate of drug resistance mutations conferring resistance to PI among populations initiating ARV is minimal. This is in accordance with a previous study which showed that only secondary mutations associated with PIs were detected in drug na&#x000ef;ve patients in Cameroon during 2000 to 2002 [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, another study in 2006 detected primary resistance to PI among na&#x000ef;ve patients in Cameroon, revealing a rate as high as 7.4% [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This could be explained by the fact that the study had a larger sample size and the utilisation of deep sequencing method was employed which could detect minor mutations conferring resistance to PIs. Of note patients in the rural setting presented with resistance only to the NNRTIs in our study. This is in conformity of a recent study in Cameroon that showed presence of mutation to NNRTIs among na&#x000ef;ve patients in rural areas only, with prevalence of PDR to NNRTI being 4.3% [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Another study in rural Cameroon showed PDR among population initiating ARV to be 4.8% [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The low prevalence experienced in rural areas could be explained by the fact that these areas have not been exposed to ARV for a very long period as compared to urban areas where ARV have been the main stay. The low genetic variability of these drugs can also influence their apparition. However there have been an increase in trend of PDR amongst populations initiating ARV in Cameroon from 0% in 1996&#x02013;99 to 12.3% in 2007 [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] with this increase experienced more in NNRTIs. A recent retrospective study by Hassan et al in Kenya [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] using next generation sequencing (NGS) showed 24% of participants had at least one PDR variant with 8% to NRTIs, 6% to NNRTIs and 12% to PIs. The higher PDR found in their study when compared to ours is explained by the fact they used a more sensitive sequencing technique which detects mutation variants which cannot be detected using the standard sanger sequencing method. However the prevalence of NRTIs and NNRTIs is similar to that of our study. Similarly, a study conducted by Mbunkah <italic>et al</italic> in Cameroon [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] using NGS on dried blood spots found a low prevalence of transmitted drug resistance most especially in PIs, as fewer patients (&#x0003c;5%) are exposed to these regimens in the country [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Therefore, efforts for continuous surveillance monitoring for PDR should be intensified with NGS emphasis laid on rural areas that would be much more exposed to HIV drug-resistance as ART scale-up increases.</p><p>The mutation E138A found both in rural and urban setting confers low-level resistance to second generation NNRTIs and their presence alone or in conjunction with the mutation M138I causes decreased susceptibility of the virus to ETV and RPV [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This mutation has been found to occur between 0.5 to 5% among na&#x000ef;ve patients [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The mutation Y188YH (quasi-specie) found only in the rural setting renders an intermediate level of resistance to the first-line NNRTIs [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>In the urban setting, mutations conferring resistance to both NRTIs and NNRTIs but not PIs were found. The most common mutation to NRTIs found in our study was M41L (13.33%, 2/15). The mutation M41L is a TAM that usually occurs with T215Y. In combination, M41L plus T215Y confer intermediate / high-level resistance to Zidovudine (AZT) and Stavudine (d4T) and contribute to reduced Didanosine (ddI), Abacavir (ABC) and Tenofovir (TDF) susceptibility [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Of note the mutation K65R was found in one na&#x000ef;ve patient. This mutation has mostly been described in patients under HAART but has hardly been found in patients&#x02019; na&#x000ef;ve to ARV therapy [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. K65R causes intermediate/high-level resistance to TDF, ddI, ABC and d4T and low/intermediate resistance to Lamivudine (3TC) and Emtricitabine (FTC) but has also been found to increase susceptibility to AZT [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The emergence of K65R in na&#x000ef;ve patients in our study strongly suggest reduced efficacy of first line regimens, hence the need for proper surveillance of this mutation among this population. The mutation M184V which on its own confers high level resistance to 3TC and FTC (about 100-fold increase) [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] was detected amongst these patients. The presence of this mutation could be explained by the fact 3TC is one of the principal drugs used in first-line therapy in Cameroon and equally constitute the backbone in the PMTCT of HIV. However, TDF in the presence of 3TC has been shown to induce M184V mutation which enhances the efficacy of 3TC-TDF combination [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The mutations k103N, E138G, P225H. K238T, V179E, M230L and E138A found in the participants in the urban setting conferred resistance to NNRTIs. K103N and M230L conferred high level resistance to the first-line NNRTIs. These findings are similar to that reported in a similar study in an urban setting in Cameroon [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The presence of these mutation is understood because Efavirenz EFV and Nevirapine (NVP) are molecules widely used in the first-line regimen and in addition nevirapine is the key antiretroviral for the PMTCT in Cameroon.</p><p>As pertaining to HIV-1 genetic variability, the phylogenetic analysis of the protease-reverse transcriptase <italic>pol</italic> region of the sequences in both settings revealed a marked genetic diversity most predominantly in the rural setting than urban. The CRF02_AG was the most represented strain in this region, in accordance with studies in other regions of Cameroon showing the prevalence of this strain [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. It has been shown that the CRF02_AG strain have a biologic advantage over parental strains, including a possibly higher replicative fitness and/or transmission capacity [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In addition the founder effect has also been argued for the predominance of CRF02_AG in West Central Africa which stipulates that the recombinant strain first introduced in a particular area, consequently get established in a population before other subtypes enter into the scene [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. These could explain the predominance of the CRF02_AG strain in our study.</p><p>Finally, in both settings we found no association between CD4 staging (immune status), subtype distribution and the occurrence of drug resistance mutation. Our results are in accordance with a similar study done in the Centre region (Yaounde) Cameroon in 2014 [<xref rid="pone.0235958.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However further studies with larger sample size are recommended to better affirm our findings.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Study limitations</title><p>This study had some limitations which include, the fact that we used conventional Sanger sequencing which does not detect minor virus populations if frequencies are less than 20&#x02013;25% of the entire viral population found within an infected individual. Therefore, minor mutations that have been shown to affect ARV drug susceptibility could not have been detected following our method. Furthermore, the use of deep sequencing for full length would have help in delineating potential new viral strain herein reported as unclassified. Also, the small sample size in our study could have an effect on the overall estimates of PDR; another limitation is our criteria for classifying drug na&#x000ef;ve individual based solely on the testimonies of our patients, as some could have information bias about their status, thus supporting the measurement of drug concentration in future studies. The lack of viral load testing also limited the ability in assessing the effect of plasma viral load on PDR. This concept could now be easily addressed as viral load as become free of charge in the Cameroon ART program since January 2020.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>Conclusion</title><p>PDR was at a moderate rate in the two settings and higher within the urban populations. Though CRF02_AG is predominant in both urban and rural setting, viral diversity was found to be higher within the rural population. We found no association between HIV subtypes, CD4 staging and the occurrence of PDR mutation amongst these patients. Our findings suggest that there is need for close virological monitoring, use of NNRTI-sparing regimens, or HIV-1 genotyping for patients initiating ART in urban settings, especially with the presence of K65R mutation that jeopardizes the effectiveness of the current preferred first line ART.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are thankful to patients who provided their consent for enrolment, and to administrative, clinical and technical staffs of the study sites for facilitating study implementation.

In addition, the authors tried to find potential correlations between drug resistance and viral load or CD4 cell count, but due to the low number of enrolled individuals, no evidence for that was found. Thus, valuating the clinical impact of drug resistance in this kind of population remains challenging. In order to have a real overview of drug resistance in urban and rural area, and to really evaluate its clinical implication, more patients should be tested in a longer time period. This is the most important limitation for this study, that should be accurately stressed along all the manuscript.</p><p>Below are major comments:</p><p>1) The authors asserted to have considered for their study pre-treatment HIV drug resistance (PDR) mutations, defined like transmitted or acquired drug resistance. According to what the authors wrote, these mutations may have been transmitted at the time of infection (TDR), or it may be acquired by prior ARV drug exposure. However, which mutations the authors used for their analysis remain unclear. A list with all the NRTI, NNRTI, and PI resistance mutations used for this study should be added in the supplementary material. For example, were the revertant mutations at RT position 215 considered in this list? If not, these mutations should be added for their role in drug resistance. These revertants might easily develop in T215Y/F and their presence by standard sequencing may indicate the presence of T215Y/F as a minority variant.</p><p>2) Results, &#x0201c;Prevalence of HIV-1 Drug Resistance&#x0201d; paragraph. The authors stated that the PDR prevalence in rural and urban setting is 12.9% and 6.7%, respectively. It is not clear if this prevalence reflects the number of patients carrying at least one drug resistance. Please, clarify. The authors should also define clearly the number of patients carrying at least one NRTI and NNRTI mutation.</p><p>3) In order to better evaluate drug resistance mutation patterns, the authors should add a table that summarizes for each one of the 6 patients carrying drug resistance, viral load, CD4, drug resistance mutations, subtype, and location of ART facility where the diagnosis was done (urban or rural).</p><p>4) Discussion section. The authors stated that their study &#x0201c;showed a majority of mutations to NNRTIs (52.94%) than NRTIs (47.06%)&#x0201d;. The prevalence of NRTI and NNRTI resistance should be reported on the overall population, and not, as done, on the 6 patients infected by drug resistant virus.</p><p>5) Discussion section. The authors should compare their results with the most recent literature published on this field in Africa. In a recent paper based on NGS, Hassan et al defined the prevalence of drug resistance mutations in HIV-1 infected drug na&#x000ef;ve patients from rural area of Kenya (Hassan et al., PloS One 2019). The authors reported a 24.0% of participants with at least one drug resistance, 12% against PI, 8.0% against NRTI and 6% against NNRTI. Despite the use of NGS, the prevalence of NRTI and NNRTI resistance in this paper is quite similar to those reported by Fokam et al. Differently, the prevalence of PI resistance that is zero in Fokam et al. is similar to that reported by another Cameroonian paper using NGS technology (Koizumi, JAC 2006).</p><p>Minor revision:</p><p>1) Abstract and Results: Please, report drug resistance mutation without quasispecies (i.e. no M41ML but M41L).</p><p>2) Results, Subtypes of HIV-1 Protease-Reverse Transcriptase sequences paragraph. Instead of A1/F2 subtype, define the exact recombinant form of this sequence.</p><p>3) Results, Subtypes of HIV-1 Protease-Reverse Transcriptase sequences paragraph. Please, revise the sentence &#x0201c;the rural setting showed more two more genetic variant [8 subtypes; A1 (3), G (1), F2 (1), CRF02_AG (21), CRF06_cpx (1), CRF11_cpx (1), CRF18_cpx (1) and A1/F2 (1)], compared to the Urban setting [5 subtypes A1 (3), G (3), F2 (1), CRF02_AG (23) and CRF18_cpx (1)].&#x0201d; What does &#x0201c;more two more genetic variant&#x0201d; mean? Add the prevalence of subtypes in rural and urban settings, and p-value.</p><p>4) Figure 1, resolution should be improved</p><p>5) Please, revise reference 10.

Please, use an uniform terminology along all the manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #2: This work quantifies the prevalence of pre-treatment drug resistance (PDR) in both rural and urban settings in Cameroon. A total of 61 sequences from 61 patients were analysed for NNRTIs and NRTIs resistance mutations. Fifteen resistance mutations were found in 4 patients from the urban setting compared with only two mutations (NNRTIs only) in two patients from the rural setting. Comparison between rural versus urban setting or level of CD4 are limited by the small sample size. The manuscript needs careful reading to correct few typos or English wording. I have only few minor comments</p><p>1. There are only few mutations observed in few patients so the complete list of mutations for the four patients from the urban setting should be given.</p><p>2. It is somewhat over-interpreted to consider that the difference in CD4 between urban and rural of 184 vs. 161 indicate a delay in diagnosis. Both IQR are very large likely as the range.</p><p>3. Comparing the level of CD4 and the prevalence of mutations shows no statistical difference likely due to the small sample size. I&#x02019;m surprised that the level of HIV-1 RNA was not available in the study to compare the presence of mutations according to the level of viral load at genotyping time. I guess that the CD4 count is a proxy of the level of viral load based on the correlation between HIV-1 RNA and CD4 cell count. This point should be discussed.</p><p>4. In the discussion Section, I&#x02019;m not convinced that discrepencies between studies can be explained by the different algorithms used. I understood that the percent gives for the studies are % of resistance mutations not resistance to drugs. The difference in the list of mutations used in the different algorithms is marginal.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

However, which mutations the authors used for their analysis remain unclear. A list with all the NRTI, NNRTI, and PI resistance mutations used for this study should be added in the supplementary material. For example, were the revertant mutations at RT position 215 considered in this list? If not, these mutations should be added for their role in drug resistance. These revertants might easily develop in T215Y/F and their presence by standard sequencing may indicate the presence of T215Y/F as a minority variant.</p><p>Authors: We thank the reviewer #1 for this very pertinent comment. As stated in the methodology section; paragraph 5 of analysis, analysis for drug resistance mutations was done using the HIVdb algorithm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hivdb.standford.edu/">http://hivdb.standford.edu/</ext-link>) version 8.5. Following the high precision remark on the revertant mutations at RT position 215, indeed it was considered in the list of mutations from Stanford HIVdb used for analysis. None of the patients had these mutations. A list with all the NRTI, NNRTI and PI resistance mutations has been added in the supplementary material as stated by the reviewer #1. See page 7, lines 266-270.</p><p>Comment #2: Results, &#x0201c;Prevalence of HIV-1 Drug Resistance&#x0201d; paragraph. The authors stated that the PDR prevalence in rural and urban setting is 12.9% and 6.7%, respectively. It is not clear if this prevalence reflects the number of patients carrying at least one drug resistance. Please, clarify. The authors should also define clearly the number of patients carrying at least one NRTI and NNRTI mutation. </p><p>Authors: we thank the reviewer #1 for this remark, the comment is very pertinent. Of the 6 patients who had drug resistances in both settings, 4 patients in the urban setting had at least one drug resistance (12.9%) while 2 patients (6.7%) had at least one drug resistance in the rural setting. The statement has been rephrased for better clarification on the identified section on the manuscripts. See details in pages 9-10, lines 335-339.</p><p>Comment #3: In order to better evaluate drug resistance mutation patterns, the authors should add a table that summarizes for each one of the 6 patients carrying drug resistance, viral load, CD4, drug resistance mutations, subtype, and location of ART facility where the diagnosis was done (urban or rural).</p><p>Authors: we thank the reviewer #1 for this remark, the comment is very pertinent. The summarized table 3 has been added accordingly. See pages 11-12, lines 389-393.</p><p>Comment #4: Discussion section.

The authors should compare their results with the most recent literature published on this field in Africa. In a recent paper based on NGS, Hassan et al defined the prevalence of drug resistance mutations in HIV-1 infected drug na&#x000ef;ve patients from rural area of Kenya (Hassan et al., PloS One 2019). The authors reported a 24.0% of participants with at least one drug resistance, 12% against PI, 8.0% against NRTI and 6% against NNRTI. Despite the use of NGS, the prevalence of NRTI and NNRTI resistance in this paper is quite similar to those reported by Fokam et al. Differently, the prevalence of PI resistance that is zero in Fokam et al. is similar to that reported by another Cameroonian paper using NGS technology (Koizumi, JAC 2006).</p><p>Authors: we thank the reviewer #1 for this pertinent update. The respective manuscripts have been read and used in our discussion section. See page 13, lines 444-452.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>Minor comment #1: Abstract and Results: Please, report drug resistance mutation without quasi species (i.e. no M41ML but M41L).</p><p>Authors: we thank the reviewer #1 for this remark.

Add the prevalence of subtypes in rural and urban settings, and p-value.</p><p>Authors: we thank the reviewer #1 for this comment. The word &#x0201c;more two more genetic variant&#x02019; is a duplication which has been corrected. Actually, the statement was aimed at informing the rural setting had two genetic variants which the urban setting didn&#x02019;t. These variants were CRF06_cpx and CRF11_cpx. The prevalence of subtypes was evaluated based on the clade. Participants were classified as either having CRF02_AG or non CRF02_AG and based on the setting a non-significant p-value of 0.715 was obtained. This is explained in paragraph 1 of &#x0201c;Results, Subtypes of HIV-1 Protease-Reverse Transcriptase sequences paragraph.&#x0201d; See page 10, lines 356-366.</p><p>Minor comment #4: Figure 1, resolution should be improved</p><p>Authors: we thank the reviewer #1 for this remark.

This statement has been removed from the text.</p><p>Minor comment #3: Comparing the level of CD4 and the prevalence of mutations shows no statistical difference likely due to the small sample size. I&#x02019;m surprised that the level of HIV-1 RNA was not available in the study to compare the presence of mutations according to the level of viral load at genotyping time. I guess that the CD4 count is a proxy of the level of viral load based on the correlation between HIV-1 RNA and CD4 cell count. This point should be discussed.</p><p>Authors: we thank the reviewer #2 for this very pertinent remark. Indeed, we also had the same need in viral load testing throughout for the study. However, this could not be realized because viral load testing was not recommended at ART initiation and the cost of viral load testing was not available. Of note, at the time of the study, viral loads were still payable in Cameroon, and the Cameroon government has only recently adopted free viral loads since January 2020. This has been highlighted in the discussion section, under study limitation. </p><p>Minor comment #4: In the discussion Section, I&#x02019;m not convinced that discrepancies between studies can be explained by the different algorithms used. I understood that the percent gives for the studies are % of resistance mutations not resistance to drugs. The difference in the list of mutations used in the different algorithms is marginal.</p><p>Authors: we thank the reviewer #2 for this remark. Indeed, resistance mutations are expressed in percentages. Moreover, the sequencing method has a very important role in the detection of the resistance mutations. For example, the sanger sequencing technic used in our study does not detect viruses with major mutations like M46I unlike other WHO major mutations like K103N that can be easily detected because of its high replicative fitness. The sequencing method used can therefore be improved for better identification of mutations if further deep sequencing is performed, which can henceforth explain the difference in the detected mutations.</p><p>In a nutshell, we are very appreciative for your informed review and we hope our revised version would meet your approval of the revised manuscript. </p><p>Sincerely, </p><p>Dr. Joseph Fokam</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0235958.s001"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0235958.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pone.0235958.r003" article-type="aggregated-review-documents"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0235958.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ceccherini-Silberstein</surname><given-names>Francesca</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2020 Francesca Ceccherini-Silberstein</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2020</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Francesca Ceccherini-Silberstein</copyright-holder><license xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article id="rel-obj003" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0235958" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
