<p>This study had some limitations which include, the fact that we used conventional Sanger sequencing which does not detect minor virus populations if frequencies are less than 20–25% of the entire viral population found within an infected individual. Therefore, minor mutations that have been shown to affect ARV drug susceptibility could not have been detected following our method. Furthermore, the use of deep sequencing for full length would have help in delineating potential new viral strain herein reported as unclassified. Also, the small sample size in our study could have an effect on the overall estimates of PDR; another limitation is our criteria for classifying drug naïve individual based solely on the testimonies of our patients, as some could have information bias about their status, thus supporting the measurement of drug concentration in future studies. The lack of viral load testing also limited the ability in assessing the effect of plasma viral load on PDR. This concept could now be easily addressed as viral load as become free of charge in the Cameroon ART program since January 2020.</p>
