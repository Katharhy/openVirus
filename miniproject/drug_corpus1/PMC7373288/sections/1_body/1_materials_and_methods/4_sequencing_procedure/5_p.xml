<p>The amplified reverse transcriptase DNA sequences were analysed for potential drug resistance mutations using Stanford HIVdb algorithms (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hivdb.standford.edu/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://hivdb.standford.edu/</ext-link>) version 8.5, considering possible revertant mutants as sentinel of minority variants. Based on a genotypic susceptibility score, drug resistant mutations detected were classified as high, intermediate or low-level resistance to NRTIs, NNRTIs or PIs.
