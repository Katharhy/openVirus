<p>Sequences obtained were aligned in BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor Version 7.2.6 using CLUSTAL W [
 <xref rid="pone.0235958.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and compared with reference sequences of all known HIV-1 group M subtypes (A1, A2, B, C, D, F1, F2, G, H, J, and K). Circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) were downloaded from the Los Alamos HIV sequence database (
