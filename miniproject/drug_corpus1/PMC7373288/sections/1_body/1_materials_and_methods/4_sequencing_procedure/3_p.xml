<p>Amplified samples from the 
 <italic>pol</italic> region were completely sequenced in the sense and antisense orientations using an automated sequencer (ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer) with the help of seven different overlapping sequence-specific primers: 
 <monospace>5’ AGC AGA CCA GAG CCA ACA GC 3’</monospace>(2140–2159 gag), 
 <monospace>5’ CCA TCC ATT CCT GGC TTT AAT 3’</monospace> (2582–2602 pol
 <monospace>), 5’ CAG GAA TGG ATG GCC CAA AA 3’</monospace> (2590–2609 pol), 
 <monospace>5’ TTG TAC AGA AAT GGA AAA GGA AGG 3’</monospace> (2660–2683 pol), 
 <monospace>5’ CCC TGT GGA AAG CAC ATT GTA 3’</monospace> (2985–3004, with an insertion), 
 <monospace>5’ GCT TCC ACA GGG ATG GAA A 3’</monospace> (2993–3011 pol), 
 <monospace>5’ CTA TTA AGT CTT TTG ATG GGT CA 3’</monospace> (3506–3528 pol) [reference from the HXB2 strain from the Los Alamos National Laboratory database using the Sequence Locator and QuickAlign tools:

The sequencing primers were designed based on the analysis of highly conserved regions among HIV-1 subtypes. The reaction mixture for the sequencing reaction contained 8 μl ABI PRISM Big Dye Terminator (Perkin-Elmer), 4.8 μl water, 3.2 μl primer (1 pmol) and 4 μl of purified cDNA (40 ng), for a total volume of 20 μl. The sequencing conditions were as follows: 35 cycles (96°C, 10 s; 55°C, 10 s; 60°C, 4 min); 1 cycle of 4°C for 30 min. The quality of each sequence was ensured by covering the PR-RT region with at least two sequence segments (one forward and one reverse). The sequencing product was purified using Sephadex G-50 resin (Sigma-Aldrich) in order to eliminate excess primers, unincorporated dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs), and salts.
