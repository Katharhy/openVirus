Hospital case files were selected by simple random sampling method using balloting procedures. The units of selection were positively diagnosed HIV naïve participants. The participants from each selected case file was then interviewed and if the respondent was below 18 years or refused to participate the next case file was then chosen.

A pre-testing of the questionnaire was done in two other selected health facilities each from a rural and urban setting Eight millilitres of whole blood was collected by a trained staff into EDTA blood collection tubes and four (04) plasma aliquots each of 1ml were constituted from every blood sample by centrifugation at 1800 rpm for 10mins and stored at -80°C. At the end of the collection process, the samples were transported with the help ice packs coolants within a period of 5 hours to the “Chantal BIYA International Reference Centre for research on HIV/AIDS prevention and management” (CIRCB) where they were stored at -80
 <sup>0</sup> C for molecular analysis and bioinformatics.
