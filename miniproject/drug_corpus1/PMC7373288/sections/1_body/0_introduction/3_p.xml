<p>Studies carried out in some parts of Cameroon showed a high genetic diversity of HIV with the CRF02_AG being the most predominant form [

 <xref rid="pone.0235958.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] with a greater epidemiological burden in the urban than rural setting. In spite of the availability of findings with a global estimate at national level, there is limited evidence on the level of PDR at regional level, and this pitfall could have different implications according to geographical localities. More so, these studies do not focused on assessing HIV-1 genetic diversity and its possible effects on PDR. The Northwest region having the second highest HIV epidemiological burden [
 <xref rid="pone.0235958.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] would require evidence on PDR in both rural and urban settings. Our objectives were; to ascertain PDR in both rural and urban settings in this region, to determine class specific resistance to NRTI, NNRTIs and PIs and its potential association with subtype distribution and CD4 staging for better ART program implementation.
