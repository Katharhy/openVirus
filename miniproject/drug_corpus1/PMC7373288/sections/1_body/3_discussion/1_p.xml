<p>With the increase risk of emerging drug resistance viruses in developing countries, HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) monitoring is therefore a capital component to support the adherence of patients and consequently pragmatic interventions with respect to the first-line ARV regimens. In this study, the Pre-treatment (PDR) prevalence rate was found to be 9.8%. Keeping in mind that the new surveillance method revised in 2014 by the WHO to monitor PDR in populations initiating ART involves generating a national representative prevalence estimate among this population [
 <xref rid="pone.0235958.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], our findings suggest that PDR is at a moderate level at these settings, in accordance with previously described PDR WHO survey method of populations within a specified geographic area [
 <xref rid="pone.0235958.ref029" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our results are in accordance with previous studies carried out in the centre region Yaounde-Cameroon reporting drug-resistance mutation in population initiating ARV ranging from 4.9% to 24% [
 <xref rid="pone.0235958.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0235958.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0235958.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A recent study characterising a national representation of PDR in Cameroon following recent guidelines by WHO showed PDR resistance in Cameroon to be 10.4% [
 <xref rid="pone.0235958.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This would suggest that though standard first-line treatment may remain effective, their efficacy is been affected as rate of PDR is on the rise. Studies conducted in other African countries show drug resistance mutation in populations initiating ARV to be; 11.5% (Mali), 9.2% (South Africa), 9.2% (Kenya), 4.2% (Morocco) [
 <xref rid="pone.0235958.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0235958.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In Europe precisely in the UK PDR has been found to reach right up to 14% [
 <xref rid="pone.0235958.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Rates as high as 25% of PDR has been reported in the USA [
 <xref rid="pone.0235958.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Of note most of these studies accessed transmitted drug resistance in naïve patients as distinguished now from pre-treatment drug resistance as per WHO revision in 2014 [
 <xref rid="pone.0235958.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The differences in prevalence of PDR can be due to several factors; among which we could have the nature of the study (cross-sectional versus longitudinal), as longitudinal studies has been shown to have a lower level of drug resistance in naïve population compared to cross-sectional [
 <xref rid="pone.0235958.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Secondly, differences in data among countries may also have resulted from specific biological and cultural characteristics as they relate to national epidemics, such as transmission routes, the proportion of non-B viruses and prescription guidelines [
 <xref rid="pone.0235958.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Finally discrepancies can be further explained by the fact that, there are different algorithms available to the public domain which are routinely used for drug resistance interpretation and can therefore give results which are more or less similar, depending on the capacity of these tools to detect mutations [
 <xref rid="pone.0235958.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, the Stanford HIVdb algorithm version 8.5 known for its high sensitivity in the HIVDR detection was used in our study.
