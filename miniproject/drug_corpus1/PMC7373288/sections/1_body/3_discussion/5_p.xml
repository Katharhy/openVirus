<p>As pertaining to HIV-1 genetic variability, the phylogenetic analysis of the protease-reverse transcriptase 
 <italic>pol</italic> region of the sequences in both settings revealed a marked genetic diversity most predominantly in the rural setting than urban. The CRF02_AG was the most represented strain in this region, in accordance with studies in other regions of Cameroon showing the prevalence of this strain [

 <xref rid="pone.0235958.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. It has been shown that the CRF02_AG strain have a biologic advantage over parental strains, including a possibly higher replicative fitness and/or transmission capacity [
 <xref rid="pone.0235958.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In addition the founder effect has also been argued for the predominance of CRF02_AG in West Central Africa which stipulates that the recombinant strain first introduced in a particular area, consequently get established in a population before other subtypes enter into the scene [
 <xref rid="pone.0235958.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. These could explain the predominance of the CRF02_AG strain in our study.
