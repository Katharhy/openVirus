<p>Our study showed a majority of mutations to NNRTIs (about two times higher than resistance mutations to NRTIs). There were no mutations to PIs detected in our study. This can be explained by the fact that majority of the population under HAART are not exposed to protease inhibitors which are generally reserved for second line treatment in our setting. Therefore the rate of drug resistance mutations conferring resistance to PI among populations initiating ARV is minimal. This is in accordance with a previous study which showed that only secondary mutations associated with PIs were detected in drug naïve patients in Cameroon during 2000 to 2002 [

 <xref rid="pone.0235958.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This could be explained by the fact that the study had a larger sample size and the utilisation of deep sequencing method was employed which could detect minor mutations conferring resistance to PIs. Of note patients in the rural setting presented with resistance only to the NNRTIs in our study. This is in conformity of a recent study in Cameroon that showed presence of mutation to NNRTIs among naïve patients in rural areas only, with prevalence of PDR to NNRTI being 4.3% [
 <xref rid="pone.0235958.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Another study in rural Cameroon showed PDR among population initiating ARV to be 4.8% [
 <xref rid="pone.0235958.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The low prevalence experienced in rural areas could be explained by the fact that these areas have not been exposed to ARV for a very long period as compared to urban areas where ARV have been the main stay. The low genetic variability of these drugs can also influence their apparition. However there have been an increase in trend of PDR amongst populations initiating ARV in Cameroon from 0% in 1996–99 to 12.3% in 2007 [
 <xref rid="pone.0235958.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] with this increase experienced more in NNRTIs. A recent retrospective study by Hassan et al in Kenya [
 <xref rid="pone.0235958.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] using next generation sequencing (NGS) showed 24% of participants had at least one PDR variant with 8% to NRTIs, 6% to NNRTIs and 12% to PIs. The higher PDR found in their study when compared to ours is explained by the fact they used a more sensitive sequencing technique which detects mutation variants which cannot be detected using the standard sanger sequencing method. However the prevalence of NRTIs and NNRTIs is similar to that of our study. Similarly, a study conducted by Mbunkah 
 <italic>et al</italic> in Cameroon [
 <xref rid="pone.0235958.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] using NGS on dried blood spots found a low prevalence of transmitted drug resistance most especially in PIs, as fewer patients (&lt;5%) are exposed to these regimens in the country [
 <xref rid="pone.0235958.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0235958.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Therefore, efforts for continuous surveillance monitoring for PDR should be intensified with NGS emphasis laid on rural areas that would be much more exposed to HIV drug-resistance as ART scale-up increases.
