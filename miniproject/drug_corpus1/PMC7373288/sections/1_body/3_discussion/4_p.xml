<p>In the urban setting, mutations conferring resistance to both NRTIs and NNRTIs but not PIs were found. The most common mutation to NRTIs found in our study was M41L (13.33%, 2/15). The mutation M41L is a TAM that usually occurs with T215Y. In combination, M41L plus T215Y confer intermediate / high-level resistance to Zidovudine (AZT) and Stavudine (d4T) and contribute to reduced Didanosine (ddI), Abacavir (ABC) and Tenofovir (TDF) susceptibility [

 <xref rid="pone.0235958.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. K65R causes intermediate/high-level resistance to TDF, ddI, ABC and d4T and low/intermediate resistance to Lamivudine (3TC) and Emtricitabine (FTC) but has also been found to increase susceptibility to AZT [
 <xref rid="pone.0235958.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The emergence of K65R in naïve patients in our study strongly suggest reduced efficacy of first line regimens, hence the need for proper surveillance of this mutation among this population. The mutation M184V which on its own confers high level resistance to 3TC and FTC (about 100-fold increase) [
 <xref rid="pone.0235958.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] was detected amongst these patients. The presence of this mutation could be explained by the fact 3TC is one of the principal drugs used in first-line therapy in Cameroon and equally constitute the backbone in the PMTCT of HIV. However, TDF in the presence of 3TC has been shown to induce M184V mutation which enhances the efficacy of 3TC-TDF combination [
 <xref rid="pone.0235958.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The mutations k103N, E138G, P225H. K238T, V179E, M230L and E138A found in the participants in the urban setting conferred resistance to NNRTIs. K103N and M230L conferred high level resistance to the first-line NNRTIs. These findings are similar to that reported in a similar study in an urban setting in Cameroon [
 <xref rid="pone.0235958.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The presence of these mutation is understood because Efavirenz EFV and Nevirapine (NVP) are molecules widely used in the first-line regimen and in addition nevirapine is the key antiretroviral for the PMTCT in Cameroon.
