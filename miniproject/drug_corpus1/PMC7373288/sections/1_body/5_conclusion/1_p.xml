<p>PDR was at a moderate rate in the two settings and higher within the urban populations. Though CRF02_AG is predominant in both urban and rural setting, viral diversity was found to be higher within the rural population. We found no association between HIV subtypes, CD4 staging and the occurrence of PDR mutation amongst these patients. Our findings suggest that there is need for close virological monitoring, use of NNRTI-sparing regimens, or HIV-1 genotyping for patients initiating ART in urban settings, especially with the presence of K65R mutation that jeopardizes the effectiveness of the current preferred first line ART.</p>
