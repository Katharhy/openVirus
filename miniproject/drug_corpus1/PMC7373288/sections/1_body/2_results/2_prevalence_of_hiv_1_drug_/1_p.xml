<p>In the rural setting 30/31 protease-reverse transcriptase samples were successively genotyped as opposed to 31/32 in the urban setting. This gave a sequencing performance of 96.8% in both settings. The pre-treatment drug resistance (PDR) prevalence was found to be 9.8% (6/61) harbouring at least one drug resistance-associated mutation, with a slightly greater percentage of resistance mutations to Non-nucleotide Reverse transcriptase Inhibitors [NNRTIs] (8.2%) against Nucleotide Reverse transcriptase Inhibitors [NRTIs] (4.9%). Four patients in the urban setting (12.9%) had at least one drug resistance while 2 patients in the rural setting (6.7%) had at least one drug resistance. The patients with PDR was almost doubled in the urban setting [12.9% (4/31)] as compared to the rural setting [6.7% (2/30)]; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.352. In four (4) of the patients carrying resistance associated mutations in the urban setting, 6 resistance mutations to NRTIs: [M41L (2), E44D (1), K65R (1), K70E (1), M184V/I (2), K219R (1)] and 6 resistance mutations to NNRTIs: K103N (1), E138A/G (2), V179E (1), M230L (1), K238T (1), P225H (1)] were found. In the two patients carrying resistance mutations in the samples from the rural setting, resistance mutations to only NNRTIs E138A (1) and Y188H (1)] were found. No mutations conferring resistance to Protease Inhibitors [PIs] were found in our study.
