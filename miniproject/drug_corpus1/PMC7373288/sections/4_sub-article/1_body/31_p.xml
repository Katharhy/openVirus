<p>Authors: we thank the reviewer #1 for this remark, the comment is very pertinent. Of the 6 patients who had drug resistances in both settings, 4 patients in the urban setting had at least one drug resistance (12.9%) while 2 patients (6.7%) had at least one drug resistance in the rural setting. The statement has been rephrased for better clarification on the identified section on the manuscripts. See details in pages 9-10, lines 335-339.</p>
