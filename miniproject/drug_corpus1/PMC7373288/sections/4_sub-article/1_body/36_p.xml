<p>Comment #5: Discussion section. The authors should compare their results with the most recent literature published on this field in Africa. In a recent paper based on NGS, Hassan et al defined the prevalence of drug resistance mutations in HIV-1 infected drug na√Øve patients from rural area of Kenya (Hassan et al., PloS One 2019). The authors reported a 24.0% of participants with at least one drug resistance, 12% against PI, 8.0% against NRTI and 6% against NNRTI. Despite the use of NGS, the prevalence of NRTI and NNRTI resistance in this paper is quite similar to those reported by Fokam et al. Differently, the prevalence of PI resistance that is zero in Fokam et al. is similar to that reported by another Cameroonian paper using NGS technology (Koizumi, JAC 2006).</p>
