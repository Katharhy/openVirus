<p>Authors: we thank the reviewer #1 for this comment. The word “more two more genetic variant’ is a duplication which has been corrected. Actually, the statement was aimed at informing the rural setting had two genetic variants which the urban setting didn’t. These variants were CRF06_cpx and CRF11_cpx. The prevalence of subtypes was evaluated based on the clade. Participants were classified as either having CRF02_AG or non CRF02_AG and based on the setting a non-significant p-value of 0.715 was obtained. This is explained in paragraph 1 of “Results, Subtypes of HIV-1 Protease-Reverse Transcriptase sequences paragraph.” See page 10, lines 356-366.</p>
