<p>Minor comment #3: Results, Subtypes of HIV-1 Protease-Reverse Transcriptase sequences paragraph. Please, revise the sentence “the rural setting showed more two more genetic variant [8 subtypes; A1 (3), G (1), F2 (1), CRF02_AG (21), CRF06_cpx (1), CRF11_cpx (1), CRF18_cpx (1) and A1/F2 (1)], compared to the Urban setting [5 subtypes A1 (3), G (3), F2 (1), CRF02_AG (23) and CRF18_cpx (1)].” What does “more two more genetic variant” mean? Add the prevalence of subtypes in rural and urban settings, and p-value.</p>
