<p>Authors: we thank the reviewer #2 for this very pertinent remark. Indeed, we also had the same need in viral load testing throughout for the study. However, this could not be realized because viral load testing was not recommended at ART initiation and the cost of viral load testing was not available. Of note, at the time of the study, viral loads were still payable in Cameroon, and the Cameroon government has only recently adopted free viral loads since January 2020. This has been highlighted in the discussion section, under study limitation. </p>
