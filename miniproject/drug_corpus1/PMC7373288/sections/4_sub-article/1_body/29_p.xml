<p>Authors: We thank the reviewer #1 for this very pertinent comment. As stated in the methodology section; paragraph 5 of analysis, analysis for drug resistance mutations was done using the HIVdb algorithm (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hivdb.standford.edu/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://hivdb.standford.edu/</ext-link>) version 8.5. Following the high precision remark on the revertant mutations at RT position 215, indeed it was considered in the list of mutations from Stanford HIVdb used for analysis. None of the patients had these mutations. A list with all the NRTI, NNRTI and PI resistance mutations has been added in the supplementary material as stated by the reviewer #1. See page 7, lines 266-270.
