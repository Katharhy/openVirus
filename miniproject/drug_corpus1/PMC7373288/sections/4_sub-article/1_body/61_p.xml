<p>Authors: we thank the reviewer #2 for this remark. Indeed, resistance mutations are expressed in percentages. Moreover, the sequencing method has a very important role in the detection of the resistance mutations. For example, the sanger sequencing technic used in our study does not detect viruses with major mutations like M46I unlike other WHO major mutations like K103N that can be easily detected because of its high replicative fitness. The sequencing method used can therefore be improved for better identification of mutations if further deep sequencing is performed, which can henceforth explain the difference in the detected mutations.</p>
