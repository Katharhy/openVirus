<p>Reviewer #2: This work quantifies the prevalence of pre-treatment drug resistance (PDR) in both rural and urban settings in Cameroon. A total of 61 sequences from 61 patients were analysed for NNRTIs and NRTIs resistance mutations. Fifteen resistance mutations were found in 4 patients from the urban setting compared with only two mutations (NNRTIs only) in two patients from the rural setting. Comparison between rural versus urban setting or level of CD4 are limited by the small sample size. The manuscript needs careful reading to correct few typos or English wording. I have only few minor comments</p>
