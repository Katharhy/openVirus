<p>3. Comparing the level of CD4 and the prevalence of mutations shows no statistical difference likely due to the small sample size. Iâ€™m surprised that the level of HIV-1 RNA was not available in the study to compare the presence of mutations according to the level of viral load at genotyping time. I guess that the CD4 count is a proxy of the level of viral load based on the correlation between HIV-1 RNA and CD4 cell count. This point should be discussed.</p>
