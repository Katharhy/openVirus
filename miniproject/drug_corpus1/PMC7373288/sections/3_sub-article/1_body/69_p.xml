<p>1) The authors asserted to have considered for their study pre-treatment HIV drug resistance (PDR) mutations, defined like transmitted or acquired drug resistance. According to what the authors wrote, these mutations may have been transmitted at the time of infection (TDR), or it may be acquired by prior ARV drug exposure. However, which mutations the authors used for their analysis remain unclear. A list with all the NRTI, NNRTI, and PI resistance mutations used for this study should be added in the supplementary material. For example, were the revertant mutations at RT position 215 considered in this list? If not, these mutations should be added for their role in drug resistance. These revertants might easily develop in T215Y/F and their presence by standard sequencing may indicate the presence of T215Y/F as a minority variant.</p>
