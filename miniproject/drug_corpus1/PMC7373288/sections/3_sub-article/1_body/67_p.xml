<p>Reviewer #1: The manuscript provides information about the prevalence of HIV drug resistance in a small population of Cameroonian drug-na√Øve patients enrolled just in 4 months. In addition, the authors tried to find potential correlations between drug resistance and viral load or CD4 cell count, but due to the low number of enrolled individuals, no evidence for that was found. Thus, valuating the clinical impact of drug resistance in this kind of population remains challenging. In order to have a real overview of drug resistance in urban and rural area, and to really evaluate its clinical implication, more patients should be tested in a longer time period. This is the most important limitation for this study, that should be accurately stressed along all the manuscript.</p>
