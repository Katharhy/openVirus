<p>In a controlled, randomized clinical trial conducted in the Democratic Republic of Congo, 175 patients were randomly treated with remdesivir for Ebola. Remdesivir was not an effective therapy because of a high rate of death (53.1%). However, some data on the safety profile of remdesivir were formally collected.
 <xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Results showed that using two other medicines led to superior survival rates compared with remdesivir. Hence, randomization to remdesivir treatment was stopped.

The authors explained that this fact might be associated with a requirement for multiple intravenous infusions of remdesivir.
