<p>In 2020, de Wit et al studied the prophylactic and therapeutic activities of remdesivir against MERS in rhesus macaques (a nonhuman primate model). Results showed that the viral load in the lungs of the treated animals was lower than that of the controls. The severity of lung lesions in the therapeutic treatment group was lower than that in the vehicle-treated animals. The lungs of the prophylactically treated animals were normal. Taken together, the results emphasized the efficacy of remdesivir as a prophylactic and therapeutic agent against MERS.
