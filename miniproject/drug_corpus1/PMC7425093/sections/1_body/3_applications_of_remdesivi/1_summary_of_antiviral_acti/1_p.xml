<p>Remdesivir (GS-5734) was developed by Gilead Sciences. Gilead, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) collaborated to discover drug candidates against RNA viruses with potential to induce a global pandemic (eg Ebola virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses).
