<p>Wang et al (2020) conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial in adult patients with COVID-19 at ten hospitals in China (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT04257656). The 237 patients were randomly divided into the remdesivir (158 cases) and placebo groups (79 cases). Results showed that remdesivir administration is not related to a significant change in the time of clinical improvement. However, patients who received remdesivir had a numerically shorter recovery time compared to those who received placebo.
