<p>A preprint reported new medical research on the first 12 COVID-19 patients in the USA; however, authors indicated that the study has yet to be evaluated and so should not be utilized to guide clinical practice.
 <xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In the report, demographic and clinical information of the subjects, data on course of infection and clinical care were interpreted. Seven of 12 patients (58%) with radiographic signs of pneumonia and clinical or laboratory clues of worsening in the second week of the infection were hospitalized. Three hospitalized patients received investigational antiviral remdesivir for 4 to 10 days. In all patients, following remdesivir start, aminotransferase levels were elevated and temporary abdominal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, gastroparesis or rectal hemorrhage were observed. No post-remdesivir symptom was detected. After recovery of the respiratory symptoms, the drug was stopped.
