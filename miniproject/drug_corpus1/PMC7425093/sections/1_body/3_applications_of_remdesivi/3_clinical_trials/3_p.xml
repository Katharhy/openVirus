 <xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> In both trials, the primary outcome measure is the time to clinical recovery. The time to clinical recovery is defined as the time (in hours) from the start of study medicine (active or placebo) until normalization of fever, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and alleviation of cough, sustained for at least 72 h, or live hospital discharge, whichever comes first.
