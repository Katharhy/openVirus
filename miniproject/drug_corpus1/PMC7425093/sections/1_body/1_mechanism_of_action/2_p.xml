<p>The active form can prevent the replication of several coronaviruses in the lung epithelial cells. The nucleoside analog drug inhibits the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) by competing with the usual counterpart adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The nucleoside analog is incorporated into the generating RNA strand and causes a delayed stop in the viral replication process (

 <xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> As the enzyme incorporates one, two or three more nucleotides, the incorporated nucleoside analog moves back. The drug blocks the enzyme while it reaches into the third position away from the enzymeâ€™s active site. It crashes into a conserved serine (Ser) in the active site of the enzyme and inhibits the enzyme from moving one step forward to incorporate the next nucleotide (
