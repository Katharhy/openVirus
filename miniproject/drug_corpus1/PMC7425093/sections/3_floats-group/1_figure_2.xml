  <p>Mechanisms of action of remdesivir. Remdesivir is incorporated into cells and metabolized into the nucleoside triphosphate analog form (active form) via a sequence of steps. The nucleoside analog drug is used by the viral RdRp and inhibits the enzyme by competing with the usual counterpart adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The nucleoside analog is incorporated into the generating RNA strand and causes a delayed stop in the viral replication process.</p>
