<p id="para0009">We combined viral diversification rate with clinical and epidemiological data to predict where and how many new HIV cases would arise in the future within British Columbia. This is a novel and pragmatic approach, which lent greater predictive power than using epidemiological data alone. We have demonstrated that geographically-aggregated viral diversification rate is a robust proxy for transmission rate that is without biases to clustering thresholds, while still protecting patient confidentiality. Viral diversification rate could also be employed to model the within- and between-host evolution of other pathogens, as well as the HIV epidemic in resource-limited settings.</p>
