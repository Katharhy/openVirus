<p id="para0007">A limited number of studies have explored alternative methods such as a Markov-modulated Poisson Process and a multi-type birth-death branching model process, respectively, to infer the evolution of HIV transmission rates within a phylogeny. However, these methods rely on strong assumptions that transmission rates evolve as discrete states, which is unlikely given the heterogeneity of individualsâ€™ risk activities, time to diagnosis, and travel patterns. There remains room for improvement in resolving HIV transmission activity in order to prioritize treatment and prevention services most efficiently.</p>
