<p id="para0006">We searched PubMed for articles published between January 1996 and December 2018, to limit the search to transmission modeling in the HAART era, in any language that applied phylogenetic methods to infer HIV transmission history using the search terms “transmission”, “phylogenetic”, and “HIV”. The large majority of studies applied some form of genetic clustering to identify sub-populations exposed to higher than average transmission rates. Although HIVTRACE is the most commonly applied clustering method using a threshold for pairwise TN93 genetic distances, there is no strong consensus in the field that this clustering method is the most appropriate. Other clustering methods identify epidemiologically linked sequences using patristic (tree) distance, apply subtree pruning, or have minimum bootstrap support requirements. Previous studies have compared the performance of clustering methods applied to both empirical and simulated epidemics. Clustering methods varied in their ability to distinguish differences in sampling and transmission within the population. Further, the membership, size, and growth of inferred clusters differed between methods.</p>
