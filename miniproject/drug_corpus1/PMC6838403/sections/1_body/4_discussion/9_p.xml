<p id="para0036">In future work, we intend to validate the model on other HIV-afflicted geographies with lower sampling coverage, although the model would likely have to be re-trained to be applicable to widely different localized epidemics. Thus, the model's external validity lies in its premise, while the relationship between geographically-aggregated phylogenetic, clinical, and epidemiological data and the resulting number and location of new HIV cases will likely differ somewhat by geography. Simulating an epidemic could also be useful to assess the effect of down-sampling on the distribution and interpretation of diversification rates. Further, calculating the lineage-level diversification rates of individuals within clusters could increase the resolution of existing prioritization schemes. Lineage-level diversification rate may also represent a useful metric for transmission of other rapidly-evolving pathogens.</p>
