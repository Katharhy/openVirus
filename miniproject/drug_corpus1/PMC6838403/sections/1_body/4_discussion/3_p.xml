<p id="para0030">Multiple measures of aggregated diversification rate were significantly correlated with new HIV cases in the subsequent year. After adjusting for prevalent and incident cases in the previous year, the mean of the top five diversification rates and the number of individuals with large annual changes in diversification rate were both predictive of new HIV cases. This supports the utility of lineage-level diversification rates as estimates of HIV transmission and suggests that the communities where actively transmitting PLHIV reside tend to be those where new HIV cases arise. Though initially counterintuitive, increases in the prevalent PLHIV population of a census tract decreased the risk of new HIV cases in the subsequent year. This was likely because the census tracts with the highest prevalence were well known to public health officials and already had significant prevention and treatment programs in place. Additionally, there may be some element of transmission saturation whereby areas with previously high incidence may now have fewer susceptible people in the population who have never been infected, reducing the local transmission rate. Counter to previous studies 
 <xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, we did not find that any measures of community viral load were predictive of where new HIV cases arose after correcting for other variables, however this could be because our study group was limited to those with resistance tests and reported census tracts.
