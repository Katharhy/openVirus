<p id="para0034">Other attempts have been made to quantify the evolution of pathogen transmission rates across phylogenies 
 <xref rid="bib0034" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. These methods fundamentally differ from the methodology described here as these tree-wide estimates assume that the transmission rates evolve as a discrete state according to either a Markov-modulated Poisson process 
 <xref rid="bib0034" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> or a multi-type birthâ€“death branching model process 
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, in contrast to our lineage-level estimates, which do not rely on assumptions about the evolution of rates.
