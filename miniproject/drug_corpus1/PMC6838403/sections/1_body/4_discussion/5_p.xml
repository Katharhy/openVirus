<p id="para0032">Spatial autocorrelation is a concern when fitting models to spatial data, as the assumption of independent observations may not be met and can lead to overestimates of statistical significance 
 <xref rid="bib0032" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The Moran's tests suggested that while the number of new HIV cases was spatially autocorrelated between adjacent communities, this spatial dependence was accounted for in the model through our included predictors. By including the number of new cases in the previous year as a predictor, for example, we informed the model where values were likely to be similar. A brief comparison of the final ZINB model to a Bayesian hierarchical model that accounted for spatial autocorrelation revealed that the models did not differ greatly in their goodness of fit or coefficient estimates. Future improvements to the model could consider more complex measurements of adjacency and proximity.
