<p id="para0033">Restricting analyses to individuals who resided in a census tract could theoretically introduce geographic sampling bias by excluding those who were in small rural communities not covered by census tracts and those who had insecure housing. However, we found that participants with reported census tracts were comparable to the DTP group with sequences available. A greater sampling bias was likely derived from those who were disconnected from care entirely, as undiagnosed PLHIV might disproportionately contribute to HIV transmission

 <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>; nevertheless efforts should be made to engage hard-to-reach individuals in care in a way that is non-threatening, inclusive, and feasible. Furthermore, we assumed that our study population did not migrate between census tracts within BC during the study period. Although this assumption is surely not true for all individuals, our dataset was restricted to the geography of patient residence at the first viral load test. Migration between census tracts would add noise to the model, leading to an underestimation of the added predictive power of phylogenetic metrics.
