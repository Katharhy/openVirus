<p id="para0031">The full model exhibited an improved correlation of observed and predicted new HIV cases and a higher specificity in both the testing and blind prediction data relative to the reduced model, whereas the reduced model had a higher sensitivity than the full model. There is a trade-off between the two models, as the reduced model detected more true positives, but also more false positives, than the full model. Including diversification rate improved the positive predictive rate, or the proportion of true positives among all detected positives. In the case of allocating limited public health care resources to geographic communities, identifying false positive areas, that in reality will not have any new HIV cases arise within them, as hot spots would waste limited resources. The specificity, in this case, is arguably more important because it permits public health authorities to sift out low priority areas (true negatives) to focus on high priority areas without wasting any resources. While the differences in the models’ predictive powers were modest, they demonstrated that the inclusion of diversification rate measures was informative to the number and location of new HIV cases in the subsequent year. Further optimization of variable selection could improve its predictive power further. The 2018 blind predictions were somewhat hindered by the low percent of new HIV cases with sequences who also had census tract information. The dataset we were working with lacked information related to patients’ sexual behavior, such as marital status, frequency of sexual activity, or consistency of condom use. Incorporating these factors into the model could have further improved the model's predictive power, however their inclusion could also threaten to over parameterize the model.</p>
