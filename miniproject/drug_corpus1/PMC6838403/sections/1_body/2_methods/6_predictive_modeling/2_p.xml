<p id="para0020">Patient attributes and lineage-level diversification rates were aggregated by their census tract of residence. Census tracts are small geographic areas that usually have a population under 10 000, which represent subdivisions of census agglomerations with core populations of ≥ 50 000 in the previous census 
 <xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Further details of patient attributes, aggregated variables, and geographic analysis are presented in the Supplementary Appendix. The modeling outcome was the number of new HIV cases in each census tract in the subsequent year, as estimated by date of first detectable viral load (see Supplementary Appendix for outcome validity discussion). The viral load assay detection limit changed several times prior to 2008, so for consistency, only data from 2008 onwards was analyzed in the final model. Since the outcome a discrete count with a large percentage of zero values and some over-dispersion (Fig. S2), a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) model was deemed most appropriate 
 <xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The ZINB model has two parts: a binomial model to predict whether there were greater than zero new cases and a negative-binomial model to predict the number of cases if cases were greater than zero. Exponentiated coefficients in each model were interpreted as adjusted odds ratios and adjusted relative risks, respectively. A hold out cross-validation supervised machine learning algorithm was applied to train and test the model (Fig. S7). The data was segregated into a training subset (2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2016) and a testing subset of interspersed years (2008, 2011, and 2014). The 2017 dataset (2017 predictors, 2018 new cases) was reserved for a final blind prediction and the full dataset for 2018 was obtained after the final model was selected. To assess how informative diversification rate measures were in predicting new HIV cases, the full ZINB model was reduced to a nested model excluding any phylogenetic measures (referred to as reduced ZINB). The goodness-of-fit of these models, a full zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP), and a full Hurdle model were compared in Table S3. For both the testing dataset and the blind prediction dataset, the predictive fit of the full ZINB and reduced ZINB were compared in terms of their Pearson's correlation coefficient of predicted and observed values (for observed values greater than zero); sensitivity; specificity; positive predictive value; negative predictive value; accuracy; and top 20 agreement, which is the proportion of census tracts predicted as being among the top twenty for highest number of new HIV cases that were observed (
