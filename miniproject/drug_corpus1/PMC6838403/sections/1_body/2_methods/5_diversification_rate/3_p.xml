<p id="para0019">The annual change in diversification rate for each lineage over time was calculated as the difference between the lineage's mean diversification rate across bootstraps for a given year and the preceding year, with a value of zero for the first year a patient entered the cohort. A lineage's diversification rate would increase if a new virus was added to the tree in close phylogenetic proximity. Diversification rate, its distribution over time, and the robustness of estimates to different tree-building algorithms are detailed in the Supplementary Appendix.</p>
