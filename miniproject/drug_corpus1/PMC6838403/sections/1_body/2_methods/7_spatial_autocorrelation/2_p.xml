<p id="para0021">In order to assess whether there was significant spatial autocorrelation in our dataset, we calculated a global Moran's I for the training subset of the outcome data as well as for the final model residuals, then tested whether it was significantly greater than expected using a Monte Carlo simulation 
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Spatial weights were equally divided among neighbors that shared at least one vertex with each other. To further evaluate if the inclusion of spatial autocorrelation in the model would improve the goodness of fit or predictive power, we built a Bayesian hierarchical zero-inflated Poisson model with conditionally autoregressive (CAR) priors using the R package, CARBayes 
 <xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. CAR priors apply a binary neighbor-based matrix, which is appropriate for irregular lattice data, as in the case of census tract level spatial data 
 <xref rid="bib0027" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0028" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The CAR priors were modeled using a single set of random effects, as described by Leroux etÂ al. 
 <xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> A Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation (burn in: 100 000; chain length: 300 000; thinning level 30) was applied to search the posterior space. The goodness of fit and posterior coefficient estimates were compared to the final ZINB model.
