<p id="para0016">In addition to sequences, available data for this analysis included sample collection date; treatment initiation date; treatment regimen; date of first viral load; physician estimated date of seroconversion; plasma viral load (HIV RNA copies/mL); HIV subtype classifications (generated using the SCUEAL algorithm) 
 <xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>; ethnicity; birth year; sex at birth; sex; self-reported risk factors (injection drug use, men who have sex with men, heterosexual contact, any receipt of blood product or exposure to blood risk, other risk exposure); having ever tested positive for hepatitis C infection; having ever had acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS); if applicable date of mortality and cause of death; local health authority, health authority, postal code, census tract (CT), and census metropolitan area (CMA) of patient residence; and forward sortation area (first three digits of postal code) of physician requesting test. Baseline CD4 counts were not available for this analysis. The viral load assay detection limit changed several times prior to 2008, so for consistency, only data from 2008 onwards was analyzed in the final model. The detection limit over that period was 40â€“10 000 000 copies viral RNA/mL plasma using a Roche COBAS HIV-1 Ampliprep Taqman assay 
 <xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. To suit the longitudinal nature of the analysis, patient data was carried over year to year until new data was available (ie more recent viral load), unless participants were removed due to death or migration out of province. HIV sequences and patient information were stored in a secure Oracle database in access-restricted facilities at the BCCfE. Patient data were de-identified and doubly anonymized with randomly generated 6-character identifiers. No document was created linking identifiers to the patient.
