Baseline and follow up plasma samples are routinely collected for viral load monitoring and HIV drug resistance testing; follow up continues until death or emigration from BC. Ethical approval for this study was granted by the University of British Columbia - Providence Health Care Research Ethics Board (H17-01812). No further samples were collected nor were additional patients recruited.
