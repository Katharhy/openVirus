<p id="para0017">A total of 36 271 HIV resistance genotype tests from 9630 people living with HIV (PLHIV) were completed (mean, 3·77; median, 2; range 1–46 per individual). Genotypes comprised HIV 
 <italic>protease</italic> and partial 
 <italic>reverse transcriptase</italic> sequences, hereafter referred to as partial 
 <italic>pol.</italic> See Supplementary Appendix for details on the sequence data. Sequences were aligned to the HXB2 reference genome (GenBank Accession #K03455) using MAFFT version 7.310 
 <xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The alignment was visualized and curated in AliView V1.17.1 
 <xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Insertions and deletions relative to HXB2, as well as amino acids corresponding to WHO recognized drug resistance mutation sites, were removed from the alignment 
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. A set of shuffled bootstrap alignments were generated to infer 100 approximate maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees (in units of substitutions per site), implemented in FastTree2.1 
 <xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Subsequently, trees were pruned to include patients’ oldest samples and then rooted using root-to-tip regression in the R package ape version 5.0 
 <xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Time interval trees for each study year were generated, which only included sequences from that year or earlier, such that each year the trees only had tips added for newly infected (or newly connected with care) participants (Fig. S3).
