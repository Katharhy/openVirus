<p id="para0013">Alternatively, the transmission history of each virus in a phylogenetic tree can be estimated by its lineage-level diversification rate, defined as a tip's splitting rate across the entire tree path, weighted from tip to root

Since transmission of HIV to a new host is equivalent to the formation of a new lineage, diversification rates inferred from between-host phylogenies can approximate historical transmission rates. In previous work, we reported that treatment experienced lineages displayed dramatically reduced HIV diversification rates, providing an independent validation of Treatment as Prevention® (TasP®) strategies
