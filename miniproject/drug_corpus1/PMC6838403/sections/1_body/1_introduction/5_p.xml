<p id="para0014">Using longitudinal data collected from participants in the British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS (BC-CfE) Drug Treatment Program (DTP), we modeled the spatiotemporal distribution of HIV lineage-level diversification rate in BC to predict where new HIV cases arise over time. We hypothesized that a model incorporating geographically-aggregated viral diversification rates would predict the location of new HIV cases significantly better than one incorporating clinical and epidemiological characteristics alone.</p>
