<p id="para0022">Of the 13 431 cumulative Drug Treatment Program participants enrolled up to March 29 2018, 9630 (72%) individuals were represented in the HIV sequence database and 6944 (52% overall) of them reported their baseline census tract of residence or postal code and were included in the final analysis (
 <xref rid="tbl0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The analyzed population was comparable to the DTP population with sequences in most regards including the distribution of sexes (male: 81·3% among DTP participants with sequences, 83·3% among analyzed population); dominant HIV subtype (subtype B: 92·4%, 92·5%); median baseline age (38, 38); and median baseline diversification rate (52·5 (subs/site)
 <sup>−1</sup>, 52·0 (subs/site)
 <sup>−1</sup>). The study population underrepresented participants from the Vancouver Island (10·1%, 7·2%), Interior (5·7%, 2·9%), and Northern (3·6%, 1·9%) Health Authorities, and First Nations people (22·2%, 18·9%). Additionally, the median baseline viral load was somewhat lower in the DTP population with sequences than among those who reported a census tract (4·5, 5·3 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL). Although patient characteristics for the entire Drug Treatment Program population were not available for comparison to the study group, estimated risk exposure characteristics of the prevalent HIV population in 2014 from the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control were comparable to the study population in terms of, for instance, the percent of PLHIV who identified as MSM (BCCDC, 49%; study population, 55.1%), with the caveat that we are comparing different years
