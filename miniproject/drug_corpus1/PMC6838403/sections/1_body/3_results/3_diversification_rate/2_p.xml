<p id="para0023">The distribution of lineage-level diversification rates across a representative approximate maximum likelihood tree from 2018 is presented in 
 <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. Lineages associated with rapid and extensive branching are typified by high diversification rates. We showed that our diversification rate calculations were robust to tree-building methods and HIV genomic region (Supplementary Appendix). Although there was a slight increase in both mean and median diversification rate over time attributable to sampling from a larger tree (see Supplementary Appendix), the population-level distribution of diversification rates did not significantly change across the study period (Kruskal-Wallis,
