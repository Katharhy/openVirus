<p id="para0028">A Markov Chain permutation test for global Moran's I revealed that although there was significant spatial autocorrelation within the outcome (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0·001), the final ZINB model residuals were not significantly spatially autocorrelated (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0·086). To further investigate if explicit incorporation of spatial autocorrelation could improve the model, a Bayesian hierarchical zero-inflated Poisson model with conditionally autoregressive (CAR) priors was constructed. The log likelihood of the CAR model (−1718) was poorer than that of the final ZINB model (−1547) and the AIC value of the CAR model (3108) was nearly indistinguishable from the final ZINB model (3109). Coefficient estimates from the CAR model (Table S6) overlapped greatly with the final ZINB model, further corroborating that the exclusion of a spatial autocorrelation term in the final ZINB model did not artificially inflate coefficient errors.
