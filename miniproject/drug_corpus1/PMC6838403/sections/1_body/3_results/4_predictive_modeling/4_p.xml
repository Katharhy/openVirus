<p id="para0026">Comparing the predictive fit of the ZINB model to its reduced equivalent for the testing dataset, the mean Pearson correlation coefficient of predicted and observed values for the full ZINB model of 0·77 was 17% higher than that of the reduced ZINB model at 0·66 (
 <xref rid="fig0003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>; Table S4). Interestingly, the reduced ZINB model had a 14% higher mean sensitivity than the full ZINB model (0·75, 0·66), but the full ZINB model had an 11% higher mean specificity (0·68, 0·61) due to the reduced ZINB producing more false positives. The mean accuracy was the same for both models (0·67). The top 20 agreement (proportion of census tracts predicted to be among the top 20 highest number of new HIV cases that were observed) was 28% higher for the full ZINB model (0.68) compared to the reduced model (0.53).
