<p id="para0027">Of the 201 new HIV cases with sequences in 2018, only 64 had reported census tracts or postal codes in BC by February 4 2019, a markedly lower percent than previous years (Table S5). Regardless, observed new HIV cases in 2018 were compared to blind predictions from the model using 2017 predictors (
 <xref rid="fig0003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, Fig. S6). The Pearson correlation coefficient between observed and predicted number of HIV cases for the full ZINB model was markedly better than the reduced model by 162% (0·42, 0·16). The sensitivity for both models was high, although the reduced model had a 14% higher sensitivity of 0·90 compared to 0·79 in the full model. The full ZINB model had a 12% higher specificity than the reduced model (0·46, 0·41), a 9% higher accuracy than the reduced ZINB model (0·50, 0·46), and a 100% higher top 20 agreement (0.4, 0.2).
