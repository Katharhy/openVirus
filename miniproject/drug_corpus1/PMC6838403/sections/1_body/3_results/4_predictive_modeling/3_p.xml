<p id="para0025">The mean of the top five ln(diversification rates) was significant in both the binomial and negative binomial parts of the model (
 <xref rid="tbl0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The adjusted odds of a census tract having greater than zero new HIV cases in the subsequent year was 3·10 (95% CI, 1·61–5·97) times higher for every one-unit increase in the mean of the top five ln(diversification rates). In census tracts with greater than zero new HIV cases, for every one-unit increase in the mean of the top five ln(diversification rates) in that tract, the adjusted risk of new HIV cases in the subsequent year was 1·38 (95% CI, 1·28–1·49) times higher. Moreover, for every additional PLHIV with change in diversification rate ≥ 1 (subs/site)
 <sup>−1</sup> in a census tract, the adjusted risk of new HIV cases in the subsequent year was 1·10 (95% CI, 1·07–1·13) times higher. The spatiotemporal distribution of new HIV cases in downtown Vancouver across the study period was heterogeneous and was collectively predicted by the distribution of significant predictor variables (
