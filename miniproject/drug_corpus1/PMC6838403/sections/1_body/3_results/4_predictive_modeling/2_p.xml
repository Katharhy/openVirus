<p id="para0024">The unadjusted relationships of aggregated variables with the outcome were calculated to inform their model inclusion (Table S2). Among the highest Pearson correlation coefficients were new HIV cases in the previous year (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0·74, 
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0·001), the total number of PLHIV with changes in diversification rate ≥ 1 (subs/site)
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0·72, 
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0·001), the sum of PLHIV (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0·69, 
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0·001), and the mean of the top 5 diversification rates (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0·48, 
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0·001). After identifying a final ZINB model, a likelihood ratio test confirmed that it fit the data significantly better than its Poisson equivalent (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0·001), Hurdle equivalent (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0·001), and the reduced ZINB without phylogenetic measures (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0·001) (Table S3). Further, the AIC, BIC, and log-likelihood values for the aforementioned models were all lower for the full ZINB model.
