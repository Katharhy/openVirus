  <p>A combination of epidemiological and phylogenetic variables predicted the spatiotemporal distribution of new HIV cases in downtown Vancouver, BC in the subsequent year. Only predictor values for odd study years between 2008 and 2017 with corresponding new HIV cases in the subsequent years were shown for conciseness, however even years were also included in the analysis. The outcome, 
   <bold>(a</bold>) total new HIV cases, was collectively predicted by 
   <bold>(b)</bold> the total prevalent cases of PLHIV, 
   <bold>(c)</bold> the mean of the top five ln(diversification rates, DR), and 
   <bold>(d)</bold> the sum of PLHIV with annual changes in diversification rate (DR) ≥1 (subs/site)
   <sup>−1</sup>. Grey census tracts have values of zero.
