  <p>A comparison of the predictive power of the full ZINB and ZINB without phylogenetic measures (reduced ZINB). Hollow triangles represent testing data subset values and are summarized by their mean, while the diamonds illustrate the predictive values for the blind prediction of 2018 new HIV cases based on 2017 predictors. Criteria considered for predictive power include the Pearson's correlation coefficient (for observed cases greater than zero to remove the effect of zero-inflation); sensitivity; specificity; positive predictive value; negative predictive value; accuracy; and the top 20 agreement.</p>
