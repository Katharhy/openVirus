    "Background:While the world struggles under the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a variety of antiviral agents and symptomatic treatments are being administered to patients and urgent clinical trials are underway. Under these circumstances, it is important to explore various possibilities for the treatment of COVID-19 including herbal medicines. Among various herbal medicines, Soshihotang (SSHT, Xiao Chai Hu Tang in Chinese) has been prescribed to treat various viral diseases and is used in combination with other herbal medicines depending on the patient's symptoms. Methods:For conducting the present review, we searched electronic databases focusing on the antiviral effect of SSHT in experimental and clinical study until April 2020. The search keywords included SSHT, constituents of SSHT, and antiviral effect. We also searched for materials related to topic directly from websites and published books. Based on these search results, we summarized the results of the included materials in the form of a narrative review. Results:In a number of recent clinical studies, treatment with SSHT improved the infection status of the respiratory and hepatobiliary systems, and experimental studies demonstrated the antiviral effect of SSHT and its components. Furthermore, SSHT are being used in China-where COVID-19 outbreak first took place-and offer a new option to treat COVID-19. Conclusion:Based on the present evidences, it is believed that SSHT is likely to be a new therapeutic option for COVID-19. Conducting further studies might provide improved understanding regarding the use of SSHT in treating COVID-19."
