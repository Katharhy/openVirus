  <title>Results</title>
  <p>In a number of recent clinical studies, treatment with SSHT improved the infection status of the respiratory and hepatobiliary systems, and experimental studies demonstrated the antiviral effect of SSHT and its components. Furthermore, SSHT are being used in China—where COVID-19 outbreak first took place—and offer a new option to treat COVID-19.</p>
