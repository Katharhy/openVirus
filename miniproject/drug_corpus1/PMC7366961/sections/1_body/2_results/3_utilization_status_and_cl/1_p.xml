<p id="par0075">SSHT has been used to treat infectious diseases caused by various bacteria and, particularly, viruses. With respiratory system infections, in particular, there have been reports of SSHT used to treat viral infections such as influenza or the common cold. In a study comparing the effects of oseltamivir in patients with influenza A,

 </xref> SSHT treatment had an antipyretic effect equivalent to that of oseltamivir. The time required for the antipyretic effect was evaluated according to the treatment: oseltamivir (n = 8 participants), Mahwangtang (MHT, 
 <italic>Ma Huang Tang</italic> in Chinese, 
 <italic>Maoto</italic> in Japanese; n = 6), or SSHT (n = 6). The oseltamivir group required 2.0 ± 0.6 days for antipyretic effect, and both the MHT and SSHT groups showed antipyretic effect after 2.3 ± 1.0 days, with no significant difference between the two groups. SSHT has also been reported to be a treatment for the common cold with more than five days progress.

 </xref> SSHT (n = 131) or placebo (n = 119) was administered to patients (25–75 years old) with colds more than 5 days after the onset of illness, accompanied by oral discomfort, anorexia, and tiredness. Within one week (7 days) after treatment, SSHT group showed better results than placebo in the overall improvement (total effective rate: 64.1% vs 43.7%, SSHT vs placebo). The SSHT group showed significant improvement in the symptoms of sore throat and tiredness in 3–4 days compared with the placebo group. After the final SSHT administration, appetite, arthralgia, and muscle pain were significantly improved compared with placebo administration. This result suggests that SSHT might be an effective treatment of the common cold with delayed progress.
