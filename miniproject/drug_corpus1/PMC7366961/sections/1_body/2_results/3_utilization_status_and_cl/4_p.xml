<p id="par0090">SSHT has attracted much more attention for its antiviral effect in chronic hepatitis B and C. Although the Shanghan Lun did not intend for SSHT to be used in liver disease, SSHT has been used for this purpose based on indicative phrases in the text such as “yellow coloration all over the body and the eyes” and “discomfort and fullness in the chest and hypochondriac region”. In cases of hepatitis C, it was confirmed that fever, alopecia, and leukocyte levels were significantly improved following the combination therapy of SSHT and interferon compared with those following interferon monotherapy.

 </xref> Improvements in the levels of aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transferase (ALT), and Knodell's histology activity index, in 38% (9/24 patients) were evident when patients were administered SSHT for 12 months.

 </xref> In another study, SSHT was administered for three years, and fibrosis markers were regularly followed (n = 93). As a result, ALT levels were reduced in both chronic active hepatitis and chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH) patients. In addition, in CPH, procollagen III peptide (PIIIP) was normalized in 69% of cases and 7S collagen in 92% of cases, which suggests a liver fibrosis suppressive effect of SSHT in chronic hepatitis C.

 </xref> There are an increasing number of reports of the use of SSHT in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. In most of these studies, patients are given combination therapy of SSHT with interferon-based chemotherapy. Although there was a slight difference in the results of each study, the adjunctive or single administration treatment using SSHT showed a tendency to improve liver function, partial HBeAg negative, and reduced viral load in patients with hepatitis B compared with chemotherapy alone or placebo.
