 <italic>Hochuekkito</italic> in Japanese) (B group, n = 31), and chemotherapy + BJIGT + SSHT (C group, n = 30). After treatment, all three groups showed increase in peripheral blood lymphocyte count. After 3 months, only group C showed a significant increase in the weight gain compared with group A, and after 5 months, group C and B showed a significant increase compared with group A (A: 3.2 kg vs B: 4.7 kg vs C: 5.3 kg). These results suggest the possibility of SSHT as an adjuvant therapy in pulmonary tuberculosis chemotherapy.
