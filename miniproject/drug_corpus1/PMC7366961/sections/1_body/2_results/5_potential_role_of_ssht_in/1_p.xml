 </xref> QPT has been suggested as a general treatment regimen for diagnosed patients. QPT is a new type of herbal medicine prescription that consists of a total of 21 herbs (Ephedrae Herba, Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Armeniacae Semen, Gypsum Fibrosum, Cinnamomi Ramulus, Alismatis Rhizoma, Polyporus, Atractylodis Rhizoma Alba, Poria Sclerotium, Bupleuri Radix, Scutellariae Radix, Pinelliae Tuber, Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens, Asteris Radix et Rhizoma, Farfarae Flos, Belamcandae Rhizoma, Asiasari Radix et Rhizoma, Dioscoreae Rhizoma, Ponciri Fructus Immaturus, Citri Unshius Pericarpium, and Agastachis Herba) It has been proposed as a prescription that can be widely used in mild to severe cases, and results of actual clinical use are now frequently being reported. In Sichuan, China, a total of 98 patients with COVID-19 were administered QPT with conventional therapies for 9 days.

 </xref> Three days after QPT treatment, mean lymphocyte percentage, AST, ALT, and D-dimer levels were significantly normalized, and all laboratory indices were normalized in 70% of patients. Six days after treatment, mean C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were significantly normalized, and all laboratory indices were normalized in 80% of patients. After 9 days, all laboratory indices were normalized in 90% of patients. CT findings were normalized in 79 patients (80.6%). However, since this study was a single group, non-controlled study, it is difficult to interpret it as showing the definitive effect of QPT on COVID-19.
