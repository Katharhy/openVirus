<p id="par0140">Finally, SSHT could also have a role in the management of liver damage in patients with COVID-19. Recently, Wang et al. emphasized more intensive or customized treatment of liver injury in patients with COVID-19 based on the recent finding that liver dysfunction occurs in 16.1â€“53.1% of patients with COVID-19.

 </xref> Although liver damage in patients with COVID-19 might be caused by drug hepatotoxicity, cytokines storm, or pneumonia-associated hypoxia, considering that the results of pathological studies in patients with SARS or MERS, liver injury in patients with COVID-19 is likely to be directly affected by viral infection of liver cells.

 </xref> Most minor liver injuries will recover without special treatment, but severe liver injuries will result in significant disease burden. As mentioned earlier, SSHT has been utilized in patients with HBV or HCV infection and has shown significant antiviral and hepato-protective effects.
