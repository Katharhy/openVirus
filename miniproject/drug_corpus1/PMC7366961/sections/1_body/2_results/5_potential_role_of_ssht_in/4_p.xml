 </xref> The authors investigated 12 components of SSHT that show anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity (baicalein, beta-carotene, coptisine, formononetin, glycyrrhizic acid, kaempferol, moupinamide, quercetin, saikosaponin A, saikosaponin B2, saikosaponin D, and

Based on these results, it was assumed that SSHT could have effects such as inhibition of SARS-CoV2 activity, blocking of SARS-CoV2-invasion pathway, and suppression of cytokine storm expression. This phenomenon demonstrates multi-target and multi-directional activity, which is an advantage of herbal medicine composed of various herbs (
