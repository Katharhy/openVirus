<p id="par0005">On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared that the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic. The decision came as a result of 120,000 COVID-19 infections and 4300 deaths worldwide. Currently, there are no established treatments other than supportive therapies that treat the symptoms of COVID-19. However, as COVID-19 is a viral infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2,
