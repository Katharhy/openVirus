 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2020</xref>). Stay-at-home (mass quarantines) policies are a common device that dates back hundreds of years, either by social contrivance (e.g., The Black Death) or by conscription (e.g., The Spanish Flu and, more recently, COVID-19). For COVID-19, mass quarantines have been argued to be effective in “flattening the curve” (i.e., reducing new cases or deaths), with economics damages taken as a mostly secondary consideration, at least initially. Over time, economic considerations appear to become more relevant and the economic losses might be especially regressive, as lower-income workers are less able to work from home.
