<p id="Par11">There is no compelling reason to believe that the replication factor 
 <italic>R</italic> should change 
 <italic>after</italic> the quarantine date, 
 <italic>B</italic> (discussed more below). The quarantine, therefore, produces a parallel horizontal shift equal to 56 days. However, geometry has the final say. By day 220, total deaths are nearly indistinguishable between the two plots, as the second plot produces a “second wave” that quickly catches up to where a “first wave” would have landed. So, unless “the cavalry” (e.g., testing, strong therapeutics, or vaccines) arrives “just in time,” a mass quarantine of 56 days might result in a similar amount of total deaths but with a substantially more damaged economy.
