<p>We have not explicitly discussed the case where sick people cannot work (contribute to GDP). It might be easy to embellish the importance of this effect in a discrete time model, as many infected people will be asymptomatic and many symptomatic people recover during normal “paid time off” policies already allotted by many firms (i.e., the time away from production may be used anyway). Of course, death will reduce productivity, although the age bias of COVID-19 reduces this impact as well. Even so, the cost function
