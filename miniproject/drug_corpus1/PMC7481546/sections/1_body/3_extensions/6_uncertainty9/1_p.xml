<p>In reality, the timing of the arrival of “the cavalry” is subject to considerable uncertainty. The graphical analysis presented herein does not easily accommodate this uncertainty. However, the model itself could be easily adjusted to allow for it. The cost function (lost GDP) 
 <italic>f</italic> is strictly convex in the number quarantine days 
 <italic>D</italic>. While mortality is convex across a limited range of 
 <italic>D</italic>, the 
 <italic>difference</italic> in mortality, which conveys the actual value of the quarantine, is nearly linear. The additive nature of the benefit and cost of a quarantine in the objective function (
 <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref>) means that the net benefit (benefit less cost) of a quarantine is largely concave (when positive valued) across its length in days 
 <italic>D</italic>. The third derivative of this net benefit function can be positive or negative, implying that uncertainty over the arrival of the cavalry could raise or lower the optimal length of quarantine 
 <italic>B</italic>.
