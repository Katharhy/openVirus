The most commonly used antivirals were lopinavir / ritonavir, oseltamivir, ribavirin and arbidol, respectively. Route and duration of administration were not reported in most of the studies. The most common route of administration among the studies was oral administration, and the duration of administration varied from two to 14 days. All of the studies used other therapies, such as antibiotics, immunoglobin, interferon, glucocorticoids, methylprednisolone, and antiparasitic and antifungal drugs in addition to the antiviral therapy to manage COVID-19 patients (
