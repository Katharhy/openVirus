<p>An extensive search was conducted in databases, in order to find the existing evidence regarding antiviral therapies for treatment of diseases caused by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are in the same family as SARS-CoV-2. In this section, only clinical trials were supposed to be found. 2004 non-duplicate articles were reviewed, and no clinical trials were performed on the antiviral treatments in managing SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV patients (Figure 1). Only one clinical trial protocol commissioned by a research team in Saudi Arabia existed. This study, named as the MIRACLE trial, was designed to evaluate the efficacy of lopinavir / ritonavir and interferon-Î²1b combination therapy in the treatment of MERS-CoV patients. The study is currently ongoing, and their results have not been published yet (
