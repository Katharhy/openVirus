<p>Many existing guidelines and instructions propose antiviral drugs for management of COVID-19 patients, based on the studies performed on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Therefore, in the current study we aimed to summarize the evidence obtained from clinical trials to determine the level of evidence underlying the mentioned proposal. Surprisingly, no completed clinical trial on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was found, and all of the proposals were based on simulation studies, in vitro studies, pre-clinical studies or at best, observational studies and case-series (

 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). After an epidemic has subsided, researchers are reluctant to perform further investigations on the matter, which is a major pitfall in research and can have several reasons. The first and most important reason is the decline in the number of patients, which severely limits the possibility of performing a clinical trial. Secondly, the previous two epidemics, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, never became a pandemic, and the majority of the cases were in a limited geographic region. Therefore, after the suppression of the epidemics and decline in the number of patients, the two diseases were eliminated from the list of priorities of international organizations. If those international organizations, such as the World Health Organization, had further insisted on the importance of the subject and provided grants for independent researches, maybe a few effective antiviral agents for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV would have existed, which could be helpful in management of COVID-19, decreasing its burden on societies. A lesson should be learned from the COVID-19 pandemic and negligence of health policy makers in setting up clinical trials during SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, so that in the current pandemic and future epidemics, researches and well-designed clinical trials are planned-out while the disease is at its peak, the findings of which can be used when necessary.
