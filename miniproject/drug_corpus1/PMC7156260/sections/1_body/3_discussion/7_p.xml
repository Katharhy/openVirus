<p>Recently, Zhang et al. posted a guideline in the Lancet Respiratory Medicine journal, recommending the administration of Arbidol for management of COVID-19 patients. However, this guideline has limitations. In general, the underlying evidence for this guideline are unclear. Secondly, based on the present systematic review, arbidol was used as the second line of therapy in all of the included studies. Hence, the drug appears to be inappropriate for the first line of therapy (8). Nevertheless, lopinavir-ritonavir being ineffective in management of COVID-19 patients highlights the need to search for other antiviral therapies.</p>
