<p>Findings of the current systematic review indicated that it is not clear whether the currently used antiviral agents are beneficial in improving the outcome of COVID-19 patients or not. One clinical trial and some case-series suggest that these drugs may not have an impact on the final outcome of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, lack of published clinical trials on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which were epidemics in recent years, impedes suggesting a potential antiviral treatment for COVID-19. The current situation is a serious red flag for international organizations such as the World Health Organization. In the time of the current pandemic and future epidemics, organizations such as WHO should pursue more proactive actions and plan well-designed clinical trials to be able to use the results in managing future pandemics.</p>
