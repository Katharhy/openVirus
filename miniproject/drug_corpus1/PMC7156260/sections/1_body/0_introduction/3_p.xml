Several antiviral therapies have been considered to be potentially effective in treating COVID-19, including oseltamivir, ganciclovir, arbidol and lopinavir / ritonavir. Many clinical trials are currently underway to evaluate the efficacy of different medications on the outcome of COVID-19 patients (
