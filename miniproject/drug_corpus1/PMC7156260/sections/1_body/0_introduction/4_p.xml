<p>Treatments used for SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19, due to the fact that all of these viruses are from the same family, and they all cause respiratory diseases. Nevertheless, a consensus is yet to be reached on this matter. The primary objective of the current systematic review is to evaluate the evidence underlying the efficacy and safety of antiviral therapies in treatment of COVID-19 in the current pandemic. Another goal for the present study is to investigate the clinical trials performed in recent years on the effects of antiviral therapies on SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV to propose potential existing treatments for COVID-19.</p>
