<p id="p0100">In our previous article (
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2020</xref>), we had estimated a reproduction number of 6.47 (95% CI 5.71–7.23), which represents a higher value than those so far computed. For instance, the WHO has estimated a reproduction number of 1.4–2.5, Li and colleagues (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2020</xref>) have computed a slightly higher value of 2.2 (95% CI 1.4 to 3.9), while in several other mathematical models which have been so far devised and released as pre-prints or undergone peer-review and published, the reproduction number varies from 1.3 to 4.7.
