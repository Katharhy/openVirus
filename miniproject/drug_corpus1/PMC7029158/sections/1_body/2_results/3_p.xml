<p id="p0085">Near-casting in a rapidly evolving situation requires timely information of the implementation of public health interventions. We emphasize that this information is not only about the policy and decision, but also the implementation which is highly dependent on the resources available. We illustrate this with two simulated predictions: one based on the assumption that the interventions implemented during January 23rd
 <sup>,</sup> 2020 to January 29th
 <sup>,</sup> 2020 will be sustained, and another one based on additional data beyond January 29th
 <sup>,</sup> 2020.
