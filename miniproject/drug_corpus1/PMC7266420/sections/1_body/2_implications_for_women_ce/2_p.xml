<p id="Par6">There is limited research on how to support women living with HIV experiencing IPV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and the best approaches are particularly unclear during the COVID-19 restrictions. Future research can learn from the years of community efforts aimed at reducing IPV and HIV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], including ensuring efforts are grounded in community-based responses allowing for the meaningful participation of women in all their diversities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Research is needed to examine how the COVID-19 pandemic is resulting in increased experiences of IPV, the impact of IPV during COVID-19 on women living with HIV, and crucially how best to respond to, and prevent, IPV for all women, and women living with HIV in particular. As social distancing measures limit access to supports, such as family, friends, and health care provides, that help women living with HIV cope with experiences of violence and histories of trauma, research is needed to understand the unique ways in which women living with HIV have developed resilience and coping strategies during COVID-19 restrictions and how these can be best supported. These results can inform future strategies to reduce experiences of IPV during emergency situations and public health crises [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This research will be critical to supporting women living with HIV’s healing in the aftermath of the COVD-19 pandemic. However, this research will not be easy, and will come with many challenges. For example, virtual data collection while confinement measures are in place may lead to communication being discovered by abusers and thus increase women’s risk of violence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. And in the global South, virtual technologies, connectivity and data are often incredibly limited. Additional methods to reach those most at risk of violence, including women who use drugs, who are unstably housed, and who live in areas of conflict, need to be explored [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. As innovative technologies and responses are rolled out, there is a critical need for additional guidance on how to safely collect such data in these circumstances [
