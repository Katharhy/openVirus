 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and how COVID-19 and relevant responses to the pandemic impact experiences of IPV. The intersections of the co-occurring pandemics of COVID-19 and IPV are critical to the health and well-being of women living with HIV. As we continue to practice important social distancing measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19, it is vital that efforts are implemented to protect those most vulnerable to the virus and the associated adverse consequences of the public health response. This will include continued and accelerated advocacy for stronger judicial and government policies that ensure the protection of all women, including those living with HIV, who may be at particularly high risk of experiencing violence during global COVID-19 lockdowns. By placing womenâ€™s safety at the center of the COVID-19 response, we can recommit to the global goals of ending both AIDS and gender-based violence.
