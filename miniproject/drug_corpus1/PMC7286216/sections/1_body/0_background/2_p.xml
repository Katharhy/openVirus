<p id="Par45">HEV infection can cause fulminant hepatitis failure (FHF), especially in pregnant women, with a mortality rate of up to 30% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In addition, HEV can be vertically transmitted from infected mothers to their infants, with significant perinatal morbidity and mortality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Ribavirin and IFN-α are contraindicated in pregnancy because of the risk of teratogenicity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Therefore, only supportive care is provided for pregnant women with HEV infection. In this review, we provide a summary of the current knowledge regarding HEV and highlight HEV infection during pregnancy, which has been poorly understood until now and deserves the utmost attention.
