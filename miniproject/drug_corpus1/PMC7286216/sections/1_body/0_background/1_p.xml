<p id="Par44">Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a hepatotropic infectious agent that generally causes self-limiting acute hepatitis in healthy adults and chronic hepatitis in immunocompromised individuals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Annually, there are an estimated 20 million HEV infections, 3.3 million symptomatic hepatitis E cases, and 60,000 deaths worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In addition to hepatic manifestations, extrahepatic manifestations, including pancreatitis, neurological symptoms, hematological disorders, glomerulonephritis, and mixed cryoglobulinemia have been associated with HEV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. HEV is classified into 8 major genotypes, with genotypes 1–4 being the predominant strains involved in human infections. Genotypes 1 (HEV-1) and 2 (HEV-2) infect only humans and are transmitted via the fecal-oral route [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], whereas genotypes 3 (HEV-3) and 4 (HEV-4) are zoonotic and are contracted through the consumption of undercooked pork and wild boar meat [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Although swine are the most commonly implicated source of HEV-3 and HEV-4, other animals including shellfish, deer, and rabbits can serve as a source of infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Therefore, HEV-1 and HEV-2 are often associated with epidemics in developing countries due to poor hygiene and sanitation. In contrast, HEV-3 and HEV-4 are prevalent in industrialized countries and are associated with sporadic and clustered cases of hepatitis E in these regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In recent years, the transmission of HEV-3 and HEV-4 through blood transfusions has been increasingly reported in Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], prompting many countries to consider the screening of blood products for HEV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. For these reasons, HEV is now recognized as a global health problem in both developing and industrialized countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Current therapeutics used to treat HEV infection include the nucleoside analog ribavirin and interferon-α (IFN-α). Ribavirin therapy can be fairly efficient in most cases of chronic hepatitis E [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In some specific situations, interferon has also been used successfully [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, until now, there have been no specific direct-acting antiviral agents against HEV, particularly for pregnant women [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A recombinant hepatitis E vaccine, HEV 239, has been demonstrated to be well tolerated and effective in the prevention of hepatitis E in China; however, it is currently only approved for use in China and is not yet available elsewhere [
