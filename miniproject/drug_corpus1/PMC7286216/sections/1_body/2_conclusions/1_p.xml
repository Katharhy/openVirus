<p id="Par65">HEV infection is not limited to certain developing countries; it is also endemic in many high-income countries and is largely zoonotic in nature. Despite increasing knowledge, many questions regarding HEV, especially HEV infection during pregnancy, remain unanswered. In addition to immune and hormonal factors, genome heterogeneity and HEV variants may be related to the severity of HEV infection in pregnancy. Therefore, it may be important to investigate the prevalent HEV genotypes and their virulence as well as morbidity in pregnancy; this information could be used to develop guidelines for the intervention and management of HEV infection in pregnancy. HEV can be transmitted via blood transfusion. Increasing prevalence rates of HEV in voluntary blood donors (VBDs) and transfusion-associated HEV infections have been reported [
