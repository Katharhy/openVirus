<p id="Par66">Considering that HEV infection in pregnant women may progress to fulminant hepatitis, especially in the third trimester, with a high mortality rate, screening for and monitoring HEV infection early in pregnancy should become a focus. In addition, it is also necessary to inform pregnant women of the potential effects of HEV on the fetus; they should be advised to avoid eating and drinking contaminated food and water to prevent possible HEV exposure. An HEV vaccine may hold great promise for reducing HEV-associated mortality in pregnant women. Finally, there is also a substantial need for novel therapies to treat HEV in pregnancy.</p>
