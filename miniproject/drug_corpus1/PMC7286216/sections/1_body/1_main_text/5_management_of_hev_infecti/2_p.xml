<p id="Par64">Considering that there is no established treatment available for HEV infection in pregnant women, preventing HEV infection in pregnancy may be the most important management strategy [

In healthy adults, three doses of HEV 239 (30 μg of purified recombinant hepatitis E antigen absorbed to 0.8 mg of aluminium hydroxide suspended in 0.5 mL of buffered saline) were administered intramuscularly at 0, 1, and 6 months and 100.0% vaccine efficacy was achieved [

Although the safety and efficacy of this vaccine in a large population of pregnant women remain to be determined, this vaccine is promising for HEV infection prevention in pregnancy and may thus decrease HEV-associated morbidity and mortality. Besides advocating for studies of HEV 239 vaccination during pregnancy, it would also seem prudent to advocate for vaccination of at-risk women of childbearing age in endemic regions before they become pregnant. Recently, a phase IV trial has been initiated to assess the effectiveness, safety, and immunogenicity of the HEV 239 vaccine in women of childbearing age in rural Bangladesh, where HEV infection is endemic [
