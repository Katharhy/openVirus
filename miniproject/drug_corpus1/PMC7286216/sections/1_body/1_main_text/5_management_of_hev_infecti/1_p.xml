<p id="Par63">Ribavirin was classified in Pregnancy Category X by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) because of its embryocidal and teratogenic effects in animals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">132</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">133</xref>] Thus, ribavirin is not recommended for use in pregnant women. IFN-α was classified in Pregnancy Category C by the FDA, taking into account its abortifacient effect in animals and adverse effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">133</xref>]. Therefore, IFN-α was not recommended to be administered to pregnant women [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Recently, sofosbuvir showed antiviral activity against HEV both in vitro and in vivo and thus may be a promising antiviral drug against HEV in pregnancy as a pregnancy category B drug [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">134</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">135</xref>]. As far as other antiviral candidates are concerned, interferon λ1–3 was shown to inhibit HEV replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">136</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">137</xref>]. The antisense peptide-conjugated morpholino oligomers (PPMO) HP1, targeting a highly conserved sequence in the start site region of ORF1, can lead to a significant reduction in the levels of HEV RNA and capsid protein, suggesting its potential as a promising antiviral candidate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>]. A recent study showed that nucleoside analogs NITD008, 2′-C-methylguanosine (2CMG), and the non-nucleoside inhibitor GPC-N114 can inhibit HEV in cell culture [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">139</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">140</xref>]. However, more controlled studies are needed before sofosbuvir can be recommended for HEV infection in pregnancy. For the other antiviral candidates mentioned above, there is a long way to go. Therefore, the management of HEV infection in pregnancy is currently supported by diligent monitoring and intensive care [
