<p id="Par50">The combination of other virus infections with HEV infection may enhance the mortality rate. It is estimated that in patients suffering from chronic liver disease (e.g., hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection), these infections often progress to liver failure, with a mortality rate of 27% [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Our unpublished data suggested that there were increased rates of other virus infections in both anti-HEV IgM- and anti-HEV IgG-positive pregnant women. In pregnant women with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection, a marked increase in anti-HEV IgG seropositivity and a significant worsening of the biochemical liver indices have been observed [
