<p id="Par49">China is an epidemic area for HEV, and HEV-4 is currently the dominant cause of hepatitis E [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. HEV infection has considerable potential for transmission in pregnant women in China. It was estimated that the positivity rates of anti-HEV IgM and anti-HEV IgG were 2.6 and 16.2%, respectively, in pregnant women from Shandong Province and 0.6 and 11.1%, respectively, in pregnant women from Jiangsu Province, China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. In contrast, the positivity rate of anti-HEV IgM was 2.56% in pregnant women in Yunnan Province [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. These results may reflect the varied seroprevalence of HEV infection in different areas of China. In addition, anti-HEV IgM seropositivity occurs first and persists for 3–5 months after the initial disease onset [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Shortly after the appearance of IgM, IgG antibodies develop seropositivity and persist throughout the acute and convalescent phases, maintaining high levels for a year [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Therefore, seroprevalence to HEV in pregnant women does not necessarily reflect current HEV-positivity and may result from infection and clearance prior to becoming pregnant. Furthermore, besides the factors related to sex, age structure, and sampling errors, the differences in the specificity and sensitivity of HEV detection attributable to different laboratory diagnostic techniques should also be considered [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. A recent study among pregnant women in Qinhuangdao, China, showed that the positivity rates of anti-HEV IgM and/or anti-HEV IgG were significantly higher in the third trimester than in the first and second trimesters [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], consistent with previous reports. Among these pregnant women, the HEV strain exclusively identified in those with a history of HEV infection was HEV-4 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], which seemingly coincides with the fact that HEV-4 is now the most prevalent strain in China. However, considering that HEV-1 and HEV-3 have also been reported in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], more studies are needed to clarify the HEV genotypes prevalent among pregnant women in China and the correlation between HEV genotypes and maternal and fetal outcomes.
