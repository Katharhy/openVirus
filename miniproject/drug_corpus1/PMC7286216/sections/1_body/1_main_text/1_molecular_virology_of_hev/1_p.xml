<p id="Par46">HEV belongs to the family of 
 <italic>Hepeviridae</italic> and is the sole member of the genus 
 <italic>Orthohepevirus</italic>. HEV is icosahedral in shape and can exist in both nonenveloped and enveloped (eHEV) forms, with diameters of approximately 30 nm and 40 nm, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These two forms of HEV particles may be transmitted via different routes and possess distinct characteristics in the viral life cycle [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The HEV genome is a single-stranded, positive-sense, linear RNA that is approximately 7.2 kb in length [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The RNA genome consists of a 5′ untranslated region (UTR), three open reading frames (ORFs) and a 3′ UTR. ORF1 comprises approximately 70% of the genome (5109 bp) and encodes nonstructural polyproteins, such as methyltransferase (Met), Y-domain (Y), papain-like cysteine protease (PCP) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], hypervariable region (HVR) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], macrodomain (X), RNA helicase (Hel) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], those are necessary for replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. ORF2 and ORF3 partially overlap and are translated from a single subgenomic RNA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. ORF2 encodes both glycosylated ORF2 antigen and viral capsid protein [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. ORF3 encodes a small multifunctional phosphoprotein that is required for virus egress from cells and proposed to perturb numerous cellular pathways [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] (Fig.
