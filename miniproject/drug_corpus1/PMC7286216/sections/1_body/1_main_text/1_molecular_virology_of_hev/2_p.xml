<p id="Par47">The study of HEV replication has been limited to efficient cell culture systems, and replication within the host is not yet fully understood. The HEV capsid protein is believed to be essential for binding to an unknown cellular receptor to initiate viral entry [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The eHEV may have a distinct mechanism of viral entry, considering that it is enveloped and capsid protein is not exposed on the surface [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. After entering the target cell, the virus is uncoated, and the viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm. Following this, viral nonstructural proteins are translated from ORF1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. A negative-sense intermediate RNA is synthesized based on the positive-sense viral RNA genome with the help of RdRp; this product, in turn, serves as a template to produce 7.2-kb positive-sense progeny viral RNA as well as 2.2-kb subgenomic RNA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Subsequently, the subgenomic RNA acts as a template to translate capsid proteins and phosphoproteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The genomic RNA is contained within the capsid proteins, and new virions are generated and finally released by mechanisms still unclear [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].
