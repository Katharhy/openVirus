<p id="Par51">According to previous data, the clinical manifestations of HEV infection are different, varying from asymptomatic to fulminant hepatic failure. HEV usually causes an acute self-limiting hepatitis. The prodromal phase lasts up to 1 week, and the symptoms may be nonspecific, such as malaise, fever, joint pain, nausea, and vomiting. Subsequently, a series of typical symptoms related to acute icteric hepatitis, including jaundice, darkened urine, and pale stools may occur, similar to those seen in HAV infection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Mansuy et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>] studied 62 confirmed cases of acute hepatitis E over a 5 year period in south-west France and found that about 60% of patients became jaundiced. In fact, the jaundice rate of acute HEV infection is likely much lower given that most cases are not recognized or diagnosed. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels are markedly elevated, and bilirubin levels can also rise [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. In immunocompetent individuals, the infection and symptoms typically resolve spontaneously within 4–6 weeks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Compared to nonpregnant women, clinical features do not differ in pregnant women at first [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. However, acute liver failure can develop rapidly in patients with HEV infection during pregnancy. Several complications of fulminant hepatic failure, including cerebral edema, DIC, and encephalopathy, appear to occur at a higher rate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Hepatic encephalopathy is the most common cause of death among these patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Besides maternal mortality, fetal mortality can occur, especially during the third trimester. Preterm delivery, low birth weight, and stillbirth of the fetus or newborn have also been observed in these patients [
