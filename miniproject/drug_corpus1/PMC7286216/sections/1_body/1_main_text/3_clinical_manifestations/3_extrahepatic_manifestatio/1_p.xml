 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>], which include a range of neurological symptoms and impaired kidney function associated with cryoglobulinemia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. Other extrahepatic manifestations documented in the literature include acute thyroiditis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>], thrombocytopenia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>], and acute pancreatitis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. However, it remains uncertain whether extrahepatic manifestations of HEV are attributed to direct infection of extrahepatic tissues or cross-reactive immune responses. As of now, the molecular mechanism of extrahepatic tissue injury caused by HEV infection is unclear, and the roles of pathogenic genotypes and immune function remain to be identified.
