<p id="Par57">Impaired monocyte-macrophage functions and defective Toll-like receptor signaling have been found in HEV-infected pregnant women with ALF, suggesting that inadequate triggers for innate immune responses may contribute to the development and severity of liver injury due to HEV infection in pregnancy [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>]. In pregnant patients with FHF due to HEV, the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB was much higher than those in nonpregnant women and women with acute viral hepatitis (AVH) without FHF. An analysis of the NF-κB complex showed that the expression of p65 was completely absent or dramatically decreased in these patients [

Therefore, the abnormal expression or functioning of immunological factors may cause deregulated immunity and severe liver damage in the context of HEV infection. Other host factors, such as nutritional status, including micronutrient deficiencies and the lack of folic acid, may also influence the immune response to HEV infection in pregnant women [
