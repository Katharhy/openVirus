<p id="Par55">During pregnancy, the maternal immune system must balance the need to maintain robust immune reactivity to protect both the mother and fetus from invading pathogens and tolerate highly immunogenic paternal alloantigens to sustain fetal integrity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. Therefore, the immune alterations that occur during pregnancy are considerably complex. A longitudinal study showed that compared to the postpartum period, the number and activity of natural killer (NK) and T cells decrease during pregnancy, while monocytes, granulocytes, and dendritic cells (DCs) increase in peripheral blood during pregnancy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>], suggesting that adaptive immune responses are weakened, while innate immune responses are strengthened during pregnancy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. Additionally, a shift from a Th1-dominated immune response to a Th2-dominated response, known as a “Th2 bias”, during pregnancy has been proposed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. Th2 cells stimulate B lymphocytes and increase antibody production but inhibit the cytotoxic T lymphocyte response, leading to impaired cell-mediated immunity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. In view of these points, the pregnant mother and the fetus may be protected from susceptibility to initial infection. However, once infected, pathogen clearance may be impaired, resulting in increased severity of the disease, especially for infections such as influenza, cytomegalovirus (CMV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), varicella- zoster, malaria, and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, in which cell-mediated immunity is important [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. Regarding the regulation of cellular immunity during pregnancy, the Th1 / Th2 paradigm has been expanded into the Th1 / Th2 / Th17 and Treg cell paradigm to better explain the mechanism by which the fetus is not rejected by maternal immune cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. The function of effector T cells, such as Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells, is regulated by CD4+ CD25+ Treg cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. Therefore, although the Th1/Th2 paradigm is useful, a host of important immune elements operates during pregnancy to regulate systemic Th1 responses, including higher frequencies of T regulatory cells.
