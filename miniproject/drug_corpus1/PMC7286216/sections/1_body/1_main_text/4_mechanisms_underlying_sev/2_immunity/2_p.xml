<p id="Par56">The immunological mechanisms underlying severe liver injury due to HEV infection in pregnancy are not yet well understood. It has been reported that liver injury resulting from HEV in the general population is due to immune-activated CD8, NK and NKT cells in the liver as well as in peripheral circulation [
