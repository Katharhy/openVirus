<p id="Par60">According to the epidemiology of HEV infection, there were variations in the rates of maternal morbidity and mortality among the different HEV genotypes. According to current data, HEV-1 and HEV-2 are the most common genotypes associated with morbidity and mortality in pregnancy. In contrast, the association of increased incidence and severity of hepatitis E in pregnant women infected with HEV-1 or HEV-2 is not observed for HEV-3 and HEV-4 [

A recent study in an ex vivo model using organ culture from the maternal decidua and fetal placenta demonstrated that HEV-1 replicated more efficiently at the maternal-fetal interface, produced more infectious progeny virions, and caused more severe tissue alterations than HEV-3 [

However, due to the lack of appropriate in vivo and in vitro experimental models and the difficulty of propagating the virus in vitro, no studies have systematically compared the susceptibility, infectivity, replication ability, and virulence of the different HEV genotypes.
