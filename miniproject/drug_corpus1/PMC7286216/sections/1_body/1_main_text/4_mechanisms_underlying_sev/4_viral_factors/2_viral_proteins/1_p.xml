<p id="Par62">The detailed functions of the viral proteins in HEV infection and pathogenesis remain unclear. The D29N and V27A mutations in ORF1-encoded Met were significantly associated with poor outcomes in acute liver failure patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>]. V239A mutation in ORF1-encoded Hel identified in severe hepatitis cases might be associated with increased virulence of the genotype 3 virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>]. ORF1-encoded macrodomain can inhibit the phosphorylation/activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), thus possibly combating the host antiviral response [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>]. In addition, the macrodomain can interact with the light chain subunit of human ferritin and inhibit its secretion, suggesting its possible role in suppressing the innate immune response [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>]. These reports suggest the possible involvement of ORF1-encoded proteins in determining the outcome of HEV infections. Besides ORF1, the ORF2-encoded capsid protein can also antagonize IFN induction by blocking the phosphorylation of IRF-3 via interaction with the multiprotein complex consisting of mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), and IRF3 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>]. Recently published data showed that another ORF2-encoded protein, which is glycosylated and can be secreted into the patient serum or supernatants of HEV-infected cell culture in the form of a dimer, inhibits antibody-mediated neutralization and thus may lead to immune escape [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. These studies revealed that ORF2-encoded proteins might be involved in the interference and/or evasion of the hosts’ innate immunity. In addition, some studies have shown that capsid protein may play a role in facilitating HEV survival or replication in infected hepatocytes. For example, capsid protein inhibits cellular NF-κB activity by blocking ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of IκBα in human hepatoma cells, presumably enhancing survival of HEV-infected hepatocytes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">129</xref>]. Moreover, the capsid protein activates the pro-apoptotic gene CHOP and anti-apoptotic heat shock proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">130</xref>]. HEV ORF3 is proposed to be responsible for HEV-associated coagulopathy. ORF3-encoded proteins may interact with several clotting-related pathways, leading to an imbalance in coagulation and fibrinolysis [
