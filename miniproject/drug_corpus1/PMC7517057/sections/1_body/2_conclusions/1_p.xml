<p id="Par54">Human activities are still the significant determinants of the transmission and spread of (re)emerging infectious diseases. To date, we are still dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is challenging to predict when it will end. However, it is possible to face the disease or to reduce the risk of its transmission and spread by changing human behavior and implementing better early warning systems and effective disease control and prevention. Thus, effective global surveillance, global political will, and multidisciplinary collaboration of all stakeholders will be helpful in responding to any future threats.</p>
