<p id="Par25">Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are diseases recently identified or previously unknown infections that cause public health threats, either locally or internationally [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In contrast, reemerging infectious diseases are known diseases that reappear and increase in incidence but that in the past may have fallen to levels so low that they were no longer considered a public health problem [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In the twenty-first century, these diseases have increasingly become a global concern [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] due to their health and economic impacts in both developed and resource-constrained countries. It has been estimated that out of approximately 400 known emerging pathogens, 25% occur as human pathogens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In other reports, approximately 175 species are associated with emerging diseases, of which approximately 75% are of zoonotic origin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Most of these zoonoses have occurred due to increased contact between humans and animals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These zoonoses account for approximately 44%, 30%, 11%, 9%, and 6% of viruses or prions, bacteria or rickettsia, protozoa, fungi, and helminths, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In the post-1980 period, some zoonotic pathogens were responsible for outbreaks such as 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O157 in the 1980s [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], the avian strain of influenza in Hong-Kong in 1997 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], West Nile virus in 1999 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], the outbreak of chikungunya fever in Italy in 2007 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], the epidemic of Q fever in the Netherlands [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 caused by very virulent strains of new coronaviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and avian influenza, such as A/H1N1 in 1997 in Hong-Kong [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], A/H7N7 in 2004 in the US [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], A/H7N2 in 2007 in the UK [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and A/H7N9 in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Recently, major outbreaks of Ebola virus disease (EVD) threatened populations in West African countries between 2013 and 2016, with 28,603 cases and 11,310 deaths [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) from 2018 to 2020, with 3444 cases and 2264 deaths [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Currently, the entire world is facing an unprecedented pandemic caused by a new strain of coronavirus called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].
