African and Asian tropical countries where high temperatures and high relative humidity are common may be protected from COVID-19 because of their negative effect on the spread of the disease. On the other hand, in Western countries where there are low temperatures and high humidity, its transmission in air-conditioned and temperate climatic environments may be facilitated [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR189">189</xref>]. Closed areas with low airflow and ventilation have been shown to play a role in the increasing risk of COVID-19 infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">162</xref>], which makes developed countries at greater risk than developing countries. For instance, in developing countries, apart from some places in large cities, most people live under more natural atmospheric temperatures than do people in Western countries, where most houses are built with air-conditioning systems. Living in air-conditioned housing in addition to other factors, such as being older, having respiratory diseases or diabetes, or being an immune-compromised person, may increase the risk of transmission of COVID-19 [
