<p id="Par37">Moreover, the domestication of wild animals has narrowed the gap between wild animals and humans. Evidence has shown that domesticated animals that were long ago associated with humans are the ones at the center of those that favor parasite/pathogen transmission not only to humans but also to all other domesticated animals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. It has been revealed not only that humans are victims of the domestication of wild animals but also that the reverse is true. An example is that the occurrence of 
 <italic>Taenia</italic> tapeworms in humans predated the development of agriculture, animal husbandry, and domestication of cattle or swine, and later, it accompanied early human dispersion out of Africa. Swine and cattle are thought to have acquired infections with 
 <italic>Taenia</italic> species during their early domestication [

However, it is possible to reduce the negative impact of the human-wild animal interface, which contributes to the emergence of infectious diseases, by responding before the occurrence of spillover events, epidemics or even pandemics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. For example, people should be educated to stop harvesting bushmeat, especially by avoiding nonhuman primates; future zoonotic spillover events should be prevented through culturally appropriate education, and disease spread should be avoided through better disease surveillance [
