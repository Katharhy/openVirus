<p id="Par44">Another situation concerns human behavior changes related to conflicts. Conflicts of human behavior occur where people are interconnected, and they result from a variety of attitudes, needs, beliefs, and ways that humans react to different situations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">147</xref>]. Conflict situations can potentiate the (re)emergence and transmission of infectious diseases and are characterized by war or civil strife. This usually leads to the displacement of large populations, interruption of primary care and immunization programs, inadequate safe water supply, poor sanitation, and increased exposure to disease vectors [

Displaced populations are prone to viral and bacterial respiratory infections, nosocomial antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections, cholera, cutaneous leishmaniasis, sexually transmitted infections, poliomyelitis, Chagas, schistosomiasis, hepatitis B and C, meningococcal infections, and VBDs [

It would be better to (1) strengthen health systems in all countries; (2) evaluate the detection, containment, treatment and control of infectious diseases, including the implementation of surveillance systems; and (3) devise strategies for epidemics and protect health-supporting infrastructure and health workers during conflict situations and the aftermath, ultimately striving to achieve health equity by key policy actors [
