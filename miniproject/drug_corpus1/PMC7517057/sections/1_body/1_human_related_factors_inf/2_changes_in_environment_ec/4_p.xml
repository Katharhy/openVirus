<p id="Par33">Climate change results in differences in weather conditions and patterns of extreme weather events. Spatiotemporal changes in climate affect the reproduction, development, survival, and livability of pathogens, hosts, and their interaction with human beings. Dramatic and unforeseen changes in weather conditions have profound effects on many infectious diseases. Extreme weather events and meteorological hazards make it more complicated to predict the implications for disease pathogens, hosts, and transmission [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. The United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that an average of 22.5 million people have been displaced by weather-related events or climate since 2008 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The literature on climate variations and infectious diseases demonstrates that climate-sensitive diseases, i.e., vector-borne and food/water-borne diseases, are vastly affected by climate variability and climate change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are the most climate sensitive. They have several climate drivers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], causing over 700,000 deaths annually, accounting for more than 17% of all infectious diseases and having the highest burden in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly affecting the most deprived populations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Some examples of VBDs of significance to humans and animals are malaria, schistosomiasis, dengue, chikungunya, and Lyme disease [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Improving infrastructure and disease surveillance systems worldwide and funding health observatories would help to better detect and attribute the effects of climate change on VBD (re)emergence [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. The burden of food- and water-borne diseases (FWBDs) is found in some parts of developing countries and areas where food and water hygiene are inadequate. For example, in Africa, FWBDs account for 91 million illnesses, resulting in 137,000 deaths, annually [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Important causes of food-borne diseases are noroviruses, 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp., and nontyphoidal 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic>, while those of water-borne diseases remain diarrheal diseases, such as cholera, 
 <italic>Shigella</italic>, and poliomyelitis. Additionally, food-handling practices have been associated with SARS and H5N1 outbreaks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Proper water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions can significantly reduce FWBDs [
