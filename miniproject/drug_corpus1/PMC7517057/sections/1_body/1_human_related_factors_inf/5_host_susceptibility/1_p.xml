<p id="Par42">Human susceptibility may influence the emergence of infectious diseases through genetic polymorphisms, impaired immune function, malnutrition, AIDS, immunosuppressive conditions, aging, and others. Innate and acquired immune defenses help humans to fight against infectious diseases. Genetic polymorphisms are potent natural selective forces for pathogens to induce human defenses against infection [

 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp., and other opportunistic agents that were previously uncommon or unrecognized have increased in populations with cancer chemotherapy, organ, and tissue transplantation, or those infected with HIV [
