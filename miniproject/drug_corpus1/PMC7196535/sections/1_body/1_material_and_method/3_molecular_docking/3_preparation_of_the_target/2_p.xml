<p id="p0040">The high-resolution crystal structure of COVID-19 3CL hydrolase (Mpro) was obtained from PDB (PDB_ID: 6LU7) (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2015</xref>) (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> ). The active site of the protein is centered on the active amino acid site of the original ligand in the crystal structure. The corresponding “active pocket” was constructed. The system searched for the “active pocket” near the active site, and finally −8.669631, 12.384467, and 67.029640 with a point count of 8538 were defined as active pocket.
