<p id="p0030">In our present study, frequency analysis method, association rule mining method and association knowledge network construction method were used to analyze the collected prescriptions. The high frequency CMs were mined by frequency analysis method, and the compatibility rule of prescription was analyzed by association rules. The rules package was called into the formula basket data by R software platform, and the Apriori algorithm was used to mine the data for association rules with Confidence, Support and Promotion as the criteria (

Support value was the percentage of preconditions that were true and used to measure universality; Confidence value was the percentage of preconditions for which records and the conclusions were both true, mainly used for measuring accuracy; Promotion value was used to evaluate the degree to which the appearance of one item set increased the appearance of another (
