<p id="p0140">In conclusion, based on experience of ancient prescription and modern pharmacy research methods, 40 kinds of high frequency CMs, 36 high-frequency CMs-pair and 6 kinds of high-frequency triple-CMs-group were excavated. In addition, the molecular mechanism of the selected key CMs drug pair was preliminarily discussed. 
 <italic>Gancao</italic> (Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma) and 
 <italic>HuangQin</italic> (Scutellariae Radix) CMs-pair with highest frequency show a potential anti-SARS-COV-2 activity by binding with the ACE2 and 3CL hydrolase and regulate the target related to immune system, inflammation, cellular processes, and endocrine system. Our results provide referenced candidate compatibility of CM and active ingredients against SARS-COV-2. The results fully reflected the synergistic mechanism of multi-components and multi-targets of CMs. In view of the limitations of virtual screening results, further experiments 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> are needed to verify the results of this study in the later stage, so as to provide experimental basis for the research and development of antiviral natural drugs.
