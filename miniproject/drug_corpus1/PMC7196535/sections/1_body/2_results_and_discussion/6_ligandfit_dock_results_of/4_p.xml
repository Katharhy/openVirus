<p id="p0105">3C-like protease (3CL
 <sup>Pro</sup>) play an important role in the replication of the virus, which is considered to be an attractive target for drug development (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Acetoside (Consensus scoring = 7) has the strongest binding activity to 3CL hydrolase, which comes from 
 <italic>Shengdi</italic> (Rehmanniae Radix). In Acetoside, hydrogen bonds were formed between phenolic hydroxyl groups and residues THR and PHE, and hydrophobic interaction was formed between benzene ring and target protein GLU (

 <italic>Gancao</italic> (Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma), 
 <italic>Dahuang</italic> (Rhei Radix Et Rhizome) and 
 <italic>Chaihu</italic> (Bupleuri Radix), also have potential anti-activity on 3CL protein (
