<p id="p0110">According to the two binding regions grid3 and grid4 between ACE2 and viral protein conformation (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Niu et al., 2020</xref>), components which may block the binding of the two proteins were screened. Glyasperin F in 
 <italic>Gancao</italic> (Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma) had the strongest binding to site ACE 1(Consensus scoring = 6), and hydrogen bond and σ-p hyperconjugated system was formed between its phenolic hydroxyl group forms and target protein residue LEU (

 <italic>Gancao</italic> (Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma) and 
 <italic>Chaihu</italic> (Bupleuri Radix) has the strongest binding ability to ACE site 2 (Consensus scoring = 6), which mainly formed hydrophobic interaction between benzene ring and residue target protein residue PRO (

 <italic>HuangQin</italic> (Scutellariae Radix), 
 <italic>Chaihu</italic> (Bupleuri Radix) and 
 <italic>Zhimu</italic>(Anemarrhenae Rhizoma), could combined with ACE2 protein.
