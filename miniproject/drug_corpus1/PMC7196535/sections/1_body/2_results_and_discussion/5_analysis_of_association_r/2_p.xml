<p id="p0090">Association rule mining is often used to find possible associations or connections between substance, and it has been applied to study the compatibility of CMs prescriptions (
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). We mined the association relationship (
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) and matrix analysis (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> ) for the compatibility relationship of CMs and built the association knowledge network of CMs (

 <italic>Gancao</italic> (Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma) and 
 <italic>HuangQin</italic> (Scutellariae Radix) were key medicines of these prescriptions for treatment of pestilence or epidemic diseases. Most of the CM prescriptions were designed basing on these two CMs.
