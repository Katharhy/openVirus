 <italic>Dictionary of Traditional Chinese Medicine Prescriptions</italic> is the summary of research achievement in CMs prescriptions, which contains more than 1800 kinds of CMs and 90, 000 prescriptions in related literatures (
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Peng, 1996</xref>). In our study, the prescriptions for treatment of pestilence or epidemic diseases were mined from 
 <italic>Dictionary of Traditional Chinese Medicine Prescriptions</italic>. 574 prescriptions were selected for the treatment of “Wenbing”, “Wenyi”, “Yibing” or “Shiyi”. The age distribution of prescriptions showed that the use of CMs to prevent epidemics could be traced back to Jin dynasty (

It was estimated that it may be due to the academic development of Seasonal Febrile Disease after the Ming dynasty. Dr. Wu Youke from Ming dynasty proposed the etiological theory of “liqi” for the first time, which mean the evil epidemic pathogenic factors in

 <italic>“The wenyi was a disease, not feng(wind), han(cold), shu(heat) or shi(damp), but a strange feeling between heaven and earth”</italic>. In addition, Wu established the thinking mode of syndrome differentiation and created the effective prescription named “Dayuanyin” for treating pestilence diseases. While during the formation of Seasonal Febrile Disease school in the Qing Dynasty, febrile pathologists such as Ye Gui, Wu Jiao, Wang Shixiong and Xue Shengbai not only put forward the academic opinions of Wei Qi Ying Xue from
