<p id="p0120">In the present work, the number of 85 and 34 kinds of active compounds were selected from 
 <italic>Gancao</italic> (Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma) and 
 <italic>HuangQin</italic> (Scutellariae Radix), respectively. The detailed information about those molecules were provided in 
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table S3</xref>. An integrated 
 <italic>in silico</italic> approach was introduced to identify the target proteins for the active compounds of CMs (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2017</xref>). We totally obtained 286 potential therapeutic targets for 119 kinds of candidate compounds from 
 <italic>Gancao</italic> (Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma) and 
 <italic>HuangQin</italic> (Scutellariae Radix). Then, we constructed a PPI (335 nodes and 4237edges) network for the putative targets of the compounds. Based on the average values for degree and distance of 21 and 2.3, respectively, we have identified 30 significant targets from 
 <italic>Gancao</italic> (Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma) and 
 <italic>HuangQin</italic> (Scutellariae Radix) (

 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). In order to directly represent the interpretation of the complex relationships between active compounds and their targets, C-T network was constructed (
 <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>B). Amongst them, those ones with high interconnection degrees were responsible for the high interconnectedness of the C-T network, especially Quercetin (degree = 10), 5,7,2′,6′-Tetrahydroxyflavone (degree = 12), Kaempferol (degree = 12), 4′-Hydroxywogonin (degree = 11), Ganhuangenin (degree = 11), Baicalein (degree = 9), Gancaonin O (degree = 8), and Norwogonin (degree = 8). As shown in the C-T network (
 <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>B), a compound regulated multiple targets, while multiple compounds possibly regulate the same target.
