<p id="p0010">Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by a newly identified coronavirus SARS-COV-2, has been spread to more than 200 countries and regions around the world and posing significant threats to public health (

Given the severity of SARS-COV-2, it is critical to discovery and clinical application of specific drugs against SARS-COV-2 to alleviate the current epidemic situation. It is particularly important to screen possible blockers for the potential target proteins of virus by computational chemical biology techniques such as molecular docking (“dry method”research) in special cases such as the outbreak of SARS-COV-2 (

It has been recommended two main proteins, 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), could be used as available targets for screening drugs that inhibiting the replication and proliferation of SARS-COV-2, benefit from rapid sequencing of SARS-COV-2 coupled with molecular modelling based on the genomes of related viral proteins (
