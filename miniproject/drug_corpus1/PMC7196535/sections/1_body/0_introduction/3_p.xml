<p id="p0015">Chinese Medicines (CMs), a long history system of medicine with distinct features of theories and practices, has been used for thousands of years (

In the “Diagnosis and Treatment Program for Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)” issued by the National Health Commission of China, it is recommended to treat with CMs and had achieved good clinical effects. Thus, it is very significant to explore and mine experiences of CMs in treating of pestilence or epidemic diseases based on the abundant historical classics of CMs combined with modern medical research method. In the present study, data mining and association network were used to mine the high-frequency CMs and formulas from ancient prescriptions. Furthermore, molecular docking approach were used to explore binding rates between the main ingredients in high frequency CMs and the key targets of SARS-COV-2. Then, we preliminarily uncover molecular mechanism by a network pharmacology process (
