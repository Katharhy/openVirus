<p id="Par26">While the 2019-nCov transmission rate is directly dependent upon close contact with the infected person but the possibility of aerosol suspension via droplets from contagious people remains a significant source of secondary infection. A study by [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>] showed that some known coronavirus (HCV/229E) could survive and attain a half-life between 27 and 67 h in conditions with humidity varying between 30 and 50%. Further evidence suggests that a decrease in temperature by 6 °C can increase the half-life of the virus by 3 h, even at 80% humidity [

It is worth noting that all the previous studies have explicitly pointed to the role of humidity and air temperature as the controlling variables in virus spread. However, the consensus is still not clear about the magnitude to which these variables impact the virus spread. Published articles have stated that warmer weathers have a suppressing impact on the contagion spread, but the previous outbreak never happened to the scale that has occurred in 2019–2020, leaving lesser applicability of the inferences of these researches [
