<p id="Par25">Associating environmental conditions with the spread of 2019-nCoV started due to some early work on SARS-CoV, where it was found that out of the four protein structures of the SARS-CoV, i.e. (i) Spike protein (S), (ii) Nucleocapsid (N), (iii) Envelope protein (E) and (iv) Membrane protein (M), the N protein exhibits the highest hydrophilicity and least stability due to absence of disulphide bonds. The high isoelectric point (pI = 10.1) and the absence of cysteine residue, makes N protein the weakest link of the virus [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>], suggested that the poliovirus and rhinovirus have also suffered a similar fate due to viral capsid inactivation at 42°–45 °C following the denaturation of protein structures. A study by Jane-Valbuena et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>] further showed that the few outer capsid proteins are highly thermal sensitive. These studies provided enough excellent reasons for modelling the spread of 2019-nCoV with the external environmental conditions, assuming that the cases of infection will decrease through secondary infection routes due to the inactivation of the virus on different surfaces; however, the possibility of transmission via direct contact remains unchanged.
