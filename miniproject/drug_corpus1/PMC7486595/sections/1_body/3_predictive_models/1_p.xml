<p id="Par13">Earlier knowledge regarding 2019-nCoV hinted at transmission being limited between animals and humans, with lesser development and emphasis in terms of inter-human transmission, making earlier epidemiological predictions [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Recent developments in terms of phylogenesis, molecular epidemiology and refinements in evolutionary models have helped build a broader understanding of the spread and transmission of the current pandemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Phylogenetic evolution can be traced and validated using different mathematical models, primarily aimed at the detection of episodic mutating diversification and pervasive selection, including techniques of projection-based fitting of nucleotide substitution [
