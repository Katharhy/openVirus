<p id="Par14">However, a serious shortcoming in various risk-based projection models is with regards to its predictability of spread of infection, which considerably and dynamically change in response to the social behaviour of the people under time accelerated learning model [

This void creates a large scope for the induction of pure statistics-based mathematical models with various epidemiological considerations taking a back seat and so is the accuracy and precision of the prediction. Therefore, with regard to the stated facts, we have reviewed the historical, mathematical, epidemiological evolution of various models with regards to their capabilities in early detection of (i) disease spread, (ii) co-variability of the virus with environmental factors and (iii) transmission among and between different multi-cellular species.
