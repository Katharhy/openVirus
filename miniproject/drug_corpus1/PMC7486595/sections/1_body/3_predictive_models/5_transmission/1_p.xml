<p id="Par27">The spread of coronavirus is sporadic through human-to-human transmission mainly by droplets produced during coughing or sneezing. There are two pathways involved in transmission one via direct contact with the symptomatic patient and another is indirect contact from the environment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. Direct contact with symptomatic patient implies being in close proximity with COVID-19-infected patient that is within the periphery of 1 m. On the other hand, indirect contact happens via the presence of microbes within droplet nuclei (i.e., particle &lt; 5 μm diameter) in the air or over surfaces [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. These droplet nuclei can survive in the air or on surfaces for a longer period and, therefore, can be transmitted by coming in contact with an infected surface. However, the probability of airborne transfer is dependent upon the retention power of droplet nuclei in the air or on the surfaces. The likelihood of indirect transmission is less likely in comparison to direct transmission. Further, there has been some evidence suggesting oral-faecal transmission of the virus as COVID-19 infects the intestinal tract, thereby indicating the faecal presence of the virus [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. However, this paper, as mentioned above, rules out any such established possibility as of now. Based on the available evidence, the WHO has recommended the use of masks to avoid direct and indirect transmission of the virus.
