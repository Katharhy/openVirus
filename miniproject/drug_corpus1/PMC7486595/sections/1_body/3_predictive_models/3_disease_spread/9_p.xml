 <sub>o</sub> value of 6.49. The most conservative estimate of R

While these epidemiological models are more flexible in terms of incorporating dynamic changes with regards to the spread of the virus, their variability in prediction has led to increased dependency of researchers on statistical trend-based models. In this regard, the study by [
