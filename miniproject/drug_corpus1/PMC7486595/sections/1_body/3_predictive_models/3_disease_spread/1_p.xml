These models often referred to as compartmental models, segregate the population into various broad categories such as (i) susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious (I) and recovered (R). It has gained widespread popularity in the field of epidemic spread due to its greater mathematical emphasis on simulating and adapting under real conditions. Most of these epidemiological models trace their origin in the theory of [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], which stressed on finding the critical causal factor which impacts the severity and frequency of the epidemic. In this regard, a brief overview of their work becomes essential in understanding the assumptions as well as the accuracy of these models. Kermack and McKendrick formulated a simple hypothesis and opined that epidemics propagates in the community via direct contact with an infected person, while other indirect transmission sources being negligible.
