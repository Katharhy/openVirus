<p id="Par16">With the rapid spread of infection, the number of sick people in the population increases, which further stabilizes on account of increasing deaths and recoveries. Also, the chances and prospects of recovery or death or future infection to other persons will change with each passing day in the infection cycle of a sick person. A primary assumption of the theory was that epidemics are usually short-lived, and therefore, cannot change the population at large. Thus, the community under scrutiny for disease spread was kept constant for modelling. The study established that for each set of recovery, death and infectivity, there exists a threshold population density. If the current population of the region exceeds the threshold density, then any addition of a newly infected case will result in the start of the epidemic cycle again. A serious observation was concerning predicting the end of the epidemic. Kermack and McKendrick believed that infection exists in a region as long as its population exceeds the critical population density with the epidemic trying hard to move the community towards the critical threshold value, where it finally wanes away and dies out. The theory was further modified to compare the virulence and severity of different viruses for the population with identical population density, recovery and death rate. To give a mathematical basis to this developed hypothesis, the two researchers divided the time into a large number of small constant units, with the assumption that infection starts at the beginning of the time instant with no occurrence of any outbreak in between the passage of one-time unit to other (eq.
