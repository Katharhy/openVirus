 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] used a more precise estimation method involving epidemiological data concerning hospitalization, death and onset of illness. Further, through a doubly interval-censored likelihood function and Bayesian methods, different parameter values within the intervals were determined. Statistical models have also been used in order to estimate the serial interval (time duration between two successive cases in an epidemiological transmission chain) of nCoV using a similar Bayesian approach [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Few studies have relied on fitting data in different probability density functions to estimate the incubation period of 2019-nCoV to be around 5.1Â days [
