<p id="Par8">However, SARS-CoV-2 needs much more than its genetic material to spread infections. Outside the host, the virus is considered to be non-living, i.e. viron, which is mainly composed of RNA, surrounded by a lipid envelop and cannot self-replicate. Infection is only possible due to the presence of viable virus but not due to the presence of its genetic material in the host body. The virus is said to be viable if it replicates and increases the viral load in the host body. SARS-CoV-2 through its spike proteins (S protein) attach to the host cell receptors (ACE2), which is commonly found in the respiratory or intestinal tract of human beings and subsequently enters into the host cell to replicate [

As PCR targets specific parts of the virus genetic material, the degree to which a virus was affected by several disinfectants present in the wastewater and its viability cannot be addressed by this technique. Hence, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA does not imply the infectious nature of the virus. Therefore, assay-based techniques are more appropriate to study the infectious nature of the virus.
