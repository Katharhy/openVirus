<p id="Par7">Several techniques have been developed to detect viruses and their genetic material in various environmental matrices. In general, while some techniques test infectivity of viruses, others focused on nucleic acid isolation. Most of the approaches to detect and diagnose SARS-CoV-2 are based on the isolation of genetic material of the virus to confirm infection among patients (Fig.Â

Cell culture assays investigate both virus presence and its infectivity by monitoring response (cytopathic effects, cells bursting, plaque) of suitable host cells. However, the difficulty of culturing and slow growth rates discourages the application of this method specifically to the novel virus, where expensive cell culture assay and requirement of biosafety level 3 are of additional concern. Recently, many researchers have reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the wastewater using reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) technique. This technique involves RNA concentration, extraction, amplification to detect its presence at the lowest available concentration without giving much information on the infectious nature of the virus. There is much discussion around the infectious nature of SARS-COV-2 and the role of its genetic material.
