<p id="Par6">Although several recent publications have highlighted the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic materials [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] until today, there is no evidence of faecal-oral transmission of SARS CoV-2. However, presence of virus genetic material in toilet bowls, sinks, saliva and respiratory secretions of infected patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and the raw sewage water in different parts of the globe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] has raised several concerns including enteric involvement of this virus. Available evidence on other SARS and MERS virus suggest that coronaviruses can survive for several weeks and retain its viability for several days at varying temperature range. It has been reported for SARS-CoV where the virus remained viable for 5 days at a temperature ranging from 22 to 25 °C and relative humidity ranging from 40 to 50% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Interestingly, the same virus remained infectious for 2 weeks when the experiment was conducted for 4 °C, but its infectivity reduced drastically to 2 days when the temperature was increased from 4 to 20 °C [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Similarly, a recent study on the SARS-CoV-2 highlighted the computational modelling to study the travel time and survival of the virus from source to wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Considering the proof of faecal discharge for both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and their capacity to stay viable under conditions that could encourage faecal-oral transmission, it is conceivable that SARS-CoV-2 could likewise be transmitted by means of this course. Thus, the enteric involvement of SARS-CoV-2 is of greater concern in developing and underdeveloped countries where poor hygiene practices and open defection are prevalent.
