<p id="Par4">The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the heavily glycosylated S protein of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and attaches to the surface of the host cells leading to receptor-mediated endocytosis of the virion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The viral envelope fuses with the endosomal membrane with the help of host proteases and releases the viral genome into the cytoplasm of the host cell [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The virus generally binds with ACE2 receptors in the lungs and intestinal tract, replicates further, resulting in severe consequences. More than 10% of patients without acute infection experienced diarrhoea and nausea within 1–2 days before the advancement of disease and development of any critical symptoms, including fever and respiratory illness [
