<p id="Par5">This was later confirmed by the presence of the infectious virus and its genetic material (RNA) in the faecal matter of several patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The RNA was continuously detected in the faecal matter of more than 23% of patients ages that ranged from 10 months to 78 years old [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. During the infamous SARS (2002–03) and MERS (2012) outbreak, patients were suffered from several gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea at the beginning of the disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It has been reported that 16–73% of patients with SARS had diarrhoea throughout the malady, for the most part during the first week of the disease outbreak and the viral RNA continued to be found in the faecal matter of the patients even after 30 days of illness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. As the disease progressed, MERS-CoV RNA was also detected in the faecal matter of most of the positive patients attributed to replication in human primary intestinal epithelial cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. While the binding ability of ACE2 receptors decides the infectivity of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 was found to use human ACE2 at a better efficiency compared to other strains of SARS-CoV, including the strain identified in the year 2003 [
