<p id="Par10">Among the enveloped viruses, equine viral arteritis virus was inactivated 100% when exposed to chlorine (0.015%) for 1 min. Similarly, SARS was reported to be disinfected adequately at a free chlorine dose ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 mg/L [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Another enveloped virus, Ebola, was reported to be disinfected 100% at chlorine doses of 5 and 10 mg/L, and a 3.5 log
 <sub>10</sub> reduction was reported in the presence of free residual chlorine 0.16 mg/L under 20 s contact time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Free chlorine is known to penetrate the membrane of modelled enveloped virus (
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> phage Phi6) and reacted rapidly with the proteins and polymerase complex. Instead, the peptides of the enveloped virus are 150 times more reactive than the studied non-enveloped coliphage MS2 virus. In such a scenario, inactivation of the order 4 log
 <sub>10</sub> was reported for Phi6 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Recently, acidic electrolyzed water (EW) having a high concentration of free available chlorine has shown strong potential in deactivating SARS-CoV-2. It was found that virucidal activity of the virus significantly increased with the loss of free chlorine at long residence time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Hence, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through drinking water and wastewater is low where chlorination is carried out as it is expected to inactivate the virus and its genetic materials, which has been seen for other enveloped viruses. However, community exposure through sewage overflow, building having a faulty plumbing system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] or aerosol-mode transmission at the WWTPs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] cannot be avoided.
