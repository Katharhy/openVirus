<p id="Par9">While several studies have identified the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the faecal matter of corona-infected patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], there is a growing concern on the transmission of the virus through water treatment plants (WTPs) and WWTPs. Several studies also detected the genetic material of the virus in raw wastewater across the globe [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Nevertheless, the viability and infectivity of the virus in faecal matter are yet to be documented; the possibility of virus transmission through wastewater and drinking water is of major concern. Previous studies have highlighted the persistence of coronavirus and SARS virus in the wastewater, which ranged from hours to several days in the absence of disinfection practices [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Chlorination is the most commonly used disinfection technique, mainly in both WTPs and WWTPs in developed and developing countries as a tertiary treatment step [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Although the effect of chlorine on disinfection of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been documented, available data on other enveloped and coronaviruses can provide an insight into the viability and infectious nature of viruses. Chlorination was found to be effective against several enveloped viruses, such as vesicular stomatitis virus, African swine fever virus, equine viral arteritis virus and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus within 10Â min of exposure [
