<p id="Par3">Although SARS viruses are of zoonotic origin and several countries have already facing secondary transmission of SARS-COV-2, developing an early warning system always presents a challenge. In addition to WBE, several modelling approaches might aid in assessing the disease spread both at a regional and global scale. While compartmental models have traditionally relied on the researcher’s understanding of human behaviour but its relevance deteriorates as a function of limited understanding about the response of the government and knowledge about the virus as depicted in Fig.

Thus, statistical models have found its relevance at the wrong time as evident from the recent studies that advocated using Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) and Polio vaccination to counter the health implication of COVID-19 based on a simple correlation of early COVID-19 mortality data of countries like Iran and India [

A greater challenge lies in making a wider audience to understand the very foundation on which this assumptive theory of virus predictions is based. Our aim through this article is to simplify these complex models into understandable theories so that the conclusions of the various prediction models may be understood in its context. This paper aims to collate information on recent developments on WBE in monitoring the trend of community-scale SARS-CoV-2 prevalence as well as models to predict virus spread and transmission among populations.
