<p id="Par2">The unprecedented event of COVID-19 pandemic brought by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has claimed more than 0.9 million lives across the globe. The novel coronavirus (nCoV) belongs to the same subfamily of 
 <italic>orthocoronavirinae</italic> as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Still, it is distinctly disparate from the other members, in terms of its contagiousness and evolution rate [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. While it is believed that infants and older people are more vulnerable to infection, young asymptomatic carriers are of significant concern as they aid in virus transmission without their knowledge [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Several reports have already documented the presence of the virus and its genetic material in the faecal matters and urine of infected persons. Additionally, several concerns have been raised, including possible leaching and infiltrations of effluents from health care facilities, sewage, and drainage water [

Thus, in this time of accelerated transmission of the novel coronavirus, it is crucial to have a robust surveillance system to pace the monitoring of the disease spread. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) approach can be used to understand and evaluate the degree of establishment, penetrance, and infectivity of a specific infection in the community [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In this approach, presence and abundance of specific biomarkers (e.g. viral genes) in wastewater are examined, as they may reflect the general status of inhabitants related to the biomarkers within a given wastewater catchment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This approach has proved useful for studying the epidemiology of various infectious diseases and is a crucial tool for disease prevention, control and intervention. Thus, this paper reviews the potential of WBE in establishing a vigilant and robust surveillance system to track down coronavirus spread in the community.
