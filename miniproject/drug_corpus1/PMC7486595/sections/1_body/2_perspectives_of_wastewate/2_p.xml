<p id="Par12">Wastewater-based-epidemiology (WBE) approach could be applied as a monitoring tool for surveillance and early warning systems of transmittable disease hotspots (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). According to recent reports [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], SARS-CoV-2 was shed in the patients’ faecal matter for much longer (e.g. 22 days) than the duration of virus shedding in the upper respiratory swabs (10 days). Hence, identification and quantification of the viral genome in wastewater can be a reliable indicator of disease prevalence among the communities, as revealed for other similar viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Very recently, studies report detections of RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], with detected RNA amount being higher than that expected from reported infection cases. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in wastewater 7–10 days earlier than clinically reported cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. In summary, wastewater analysis is recommended as a non-invasive initial-warning tool that can help in monitoring the trend and status of COVID-19 spread and as a device for tweaking public health response [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Thus, under the present condition, such environmental surveillance tool also has the potential to be implemented in wastewater treatment systems to help authorities to manage/regulate the exit strategy.
