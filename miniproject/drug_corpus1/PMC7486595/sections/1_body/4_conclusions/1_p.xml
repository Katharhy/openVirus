<p id="Par28">The impact of the coronavirus pandemic is devastating. It has raised several concerns among the population due to fear and worries of catching an infection. Although several enveloped viruses are reports to survive for many days, even at 25 °C, countries with hot weather have reported cases of COVID-19. Several factors, including virus transmission, infectivity and inactivation, are crucial before assessing WBE. This review raised the concern on the faecal-oral route of virus transmission, especially in developing countries lacking disinfection steps in water and wastewater treatment plants. Additionally, countries lacking proper sanitation facilities having open defecation practices are more vulnerable to be infected by SARS-CoV-2. The high variance in the prediction capability of various statistical models proves less beneficial for government authorities in dealing with the containment of the disease spread. However, the compartmental models can offer higher adaptability under these circumstances and can offer higher leverage in terms of policy planning.</p>
