<p id="par0040">The Harm Principle and safeguarding the community or the baby rather than benefit to the individual woman may be advanced as justification for intervention. There are echoes to Mill’s argument that ‘…the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant’ [
