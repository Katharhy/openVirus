<p id="par0140">It remains the case that no vaccine or drug that protects against this highly contagious infection is available. Thus, prevention relies on individual actions e.g. handwashing, cough containment and environmental cleaning and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) coupled with population level measures such as testing and contact tracing and social distancing. Many governments introduced population wide social distancing rules, stay-at-home orders, school and venue closures, and workplace restrictions. The ethical justification for these wide-ranging impositions is debatable as the risk of the disease and the burden of prevention affect people, including pregnant women, differently. It is questionable whether Mill’s harm principle can be relevant to situations where harm is neither imminent, direct or intentional or if it justifies restrictions on the pursuit of life routines. Some jurisdictions identified all or subgroups of pregnant women as requiring more stringent protection, social isolation or ‘shielding’. The burden on individuals and their ability or willingness to comply with these stipulates vary. Women who are unwilling or unable to observe recommendations pose a challenge and may endanger themselves, their baby or care providers which raises questions about moral responsibility.</p>
