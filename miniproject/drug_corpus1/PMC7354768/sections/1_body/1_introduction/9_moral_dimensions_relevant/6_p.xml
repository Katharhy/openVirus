<p id="par0160">During the pandemic, much of the available diagnostic testing was directed towards public health rather than the clinical interface. This means that clinical management often proceeded with unknown infection status. Health care professionals face significant dilemma because of the limited availability of tests. The situation is particularly problematic in maternity care where much of the care cannot be delayed and because of the unique requirements of labour ward including prolonged close proximity. Members of staff can be the source of Covid-19 transmission to patients under their care. The need to reduce the risk of transmission involved changes to the way health professionals interact with women and the new born and also changes to standard antenatal care for example, the introduction of unevaluated remote consultations. In many ways, tackling the health crisis has resulted in major disruption to the wellbeing and health care provision for pregnant women, who perhaps are not at higher risk from the Covid-19 exposing a generational divide. Rather than being seen as inevitable, these disruptions ought to be regarded as a result of a particular value judgment that, in turn, had an ethical burden on health professionals. It is unclear whether or to what extent women are, or could meaningfully be, appraised of the potential implications of these disruptions.</p>
