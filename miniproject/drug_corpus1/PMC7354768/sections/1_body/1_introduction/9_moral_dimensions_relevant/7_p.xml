<p id="par0165">The clinical manifestations of Covid-19 vary from the asymptomatic or mild to severe and life-threatening respiratory distress. Initial reports suggested favourable maternal and fetal outcomes but there have been reports of maternal mortality and also concerns about poor outcomes secondary to disruption of services or the introduction of remote consultations. Fetal effects of infections acquired early in the course of pregnancy remain uncertain but there is evidence of viremia, placental pathology and the detection of viral RNA in solid organs and also of IgM in newborn babies. The effects on the fetus including long term neurodevelopmental implications will not be known for some time. This raises important ethical questions about managing infections under considerable uncertainty. Decisions may need to be made about the mode of delivery and its timing including cases that are remote from term in the absence of evidence that such intervention may stabilize deteriorating maternal health. Maternal anxiety or a request for a pregnancy termination can create a significant dilemma. In the absence of treatments known to be effective, those with severe symptoms have received a variety of drug therapies within or outside clinical research protocols. The framework for research participation will necessarily challenge the traditional understanding of 
 <italic>informed</italic> consent and appropriate standards of safeguard needed for patients under condition of extreme desperation is a pressing consideration. Similar considerations apply in relation to clinical research on therapeutics and vaccines. It is unclear how ethics can guide clinical practice under conditions of extreme uncertainty and where the effects of infection can only be known in retrospect. Achieving benefit or best interest and avoiding harm may be rooted in hope rather than expectation. Decision-making becomes more testing at junctures that involve critical life and death decisions. For example, the prioritisation of ventilation and intensive care. Much of decision making in this area relies on likelihoods and probabilities which creates tension at the individual interface particularly given the reports of survival amongst those judged to be extremely ill. The degree of priority given to pregnant or postpartum women is rarely made explicit. Still, there is evidence of racial and age-related differences in outcome amongst peripartum women.
