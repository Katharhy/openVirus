<p id="par0095">Infections can remain asymptomatic despite ongoing deleterious effects e.g. asymptomatic phase of HIV, tuberculosis or hepatitis B or C. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Clostridium difficile (CDIFF) and asymptomatic bacteriuria are other clinically significant carrier states. Women who are carriers of Î²-haemolytic streptococcus can transmit the organism to the baby at birth leading to serious infections. Chlamydia can result in preterm birth or neonatal conjunctivitis or pneumonia. There is evidence for a causative role of infection (including extrauterine maternal infections e.g. pyelonephritis, pneumonia and periodontal disease) and colonisation in preterm labour and prelabour rupture of fetal membranes.</p>
