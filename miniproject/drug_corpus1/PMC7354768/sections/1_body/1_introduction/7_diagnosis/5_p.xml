<p id="par0110">Women may be asymptomatic whilst harbouring infections with significant implications. Hepatitis C infection for example is associated with preterm labour and delivery, intrahepatic cholestasis, gestational diabetes, and postdelivery neonatal abstinence syndrome. There is a risk of in-utero- and intrapartum transmission. Until recently, hepatitis C had no effective treatment without a significant risk of teratogenicity. This, together with cost implications were used to argue against universal screening and in favour of selective testing for high risk women [
