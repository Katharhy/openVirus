<p id="par0020">Management of infections encompasses well-recognised clinical and laboratory-based attempts at diagnosis and treatment. In addition, there can be wider public health and health policy aspects concerned with prevention and containment. Compared to other affections of the body or mind, the means of preventing infections are often more clearly defined. Infections can spread rapidly, as in the case in outbreaks or epidemics. Immunization and the use of antimicrobials have implications beyond the individual. All of this invite consideration of the aims of treatment, and the interface with public health measures starting with disease notification. Determinations will necessarily evolve in relation to the prevailing conceptualisation of the individual and their place and duties in the wider society. This article outlines the areas with relevant ethical concerns but is not intended to resolve the many dilemmas that clinicians dealing with the current Sars-Covid-2 pandemic face. Resolving these matters is outside the scope of a single article.</p>
