<p id="par0055">Vaccines are rarely tested on pregnant women and manufacturers and regulators are likely to take a cautious approach when considering their use during pregnancy. This creates dilemmas for clinicians who have to consider the legal framework whilst balancing their ethical responsibility to individual women with societal interests. On the other hand, it is hard to see how meaningful consent could be achieved in scenarios where research and safety information are absent, rudimentary or unreliable. Inadvertent exposure creates the opportunity to understand the clinical course but are also the very situations where termination of pregnancy could be a consideration. Judgements have to be made in an information vacuum and can therefore only be rooted in heuristics.</p>
