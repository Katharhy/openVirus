<p>Passive immunization (PI) is a method to obtain instant, short-term fortification against infectious agents by introducing pathogen-specific antibodies to patients. These specific antibodies can bind to the pathogen antigens and block its interaction with a cellular receptor. It is extremely applicable in the case of viral antigens that facilitate the attachment to the target receptors [

These antibodies in the blood of a recovered patient can be collected as convalescent plasma (CP) and transferred to the blood of a newly infected patient. Consequently, it can neutralize the pathogen, boost the immunity of that patient [
