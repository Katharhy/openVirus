 <xref rid="B53-pathogens-09-00331" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. It acts through interfering with the viral RNA polymerase and evades proofreading by viral exoribonuclease, leading to a decrease in viral RNA production [

 <xref rid="B55-pathogens-09-00331" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. A recent report found that a combination of remdesivir and chloroquine inhibited SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [
 <xref rid="B56-pathogens-09-00331" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Very recently, the drug gained more attention after a recent clinical trial found that remdesivir is highly effective in stopping the replication mechanism of SARS-CoV-2.
