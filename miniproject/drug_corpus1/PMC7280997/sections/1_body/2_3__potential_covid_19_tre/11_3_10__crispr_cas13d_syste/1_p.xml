<p>Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) is a family of repeated DNA sequences that can be found in the genomes of bacteria and archaea. These fragments are molecular remaining of bacteriophages infections and act as a defense mechanism to the prokaryotic cell. They can detect and destroy specific foreign DNA fragments, most probably from similar bacteriophages subsequent infections. CRISPR with chaperoning Cas proteins is a powerful technique that has been derived from the bacterial defense mechanism and implemented in gene editing of our interest [
