<p>SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes, where it binds to the surface receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), through S glycoprotein found on its surface (

 <xref rid="B33-pathogens-09-00331" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. When S glycoprotein binds to the ACE2, the cleavage of trimer S protein is triggered by the cell surface-associated transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and cathepsin. S glycoprotein includes two subunits, S1 and S2. S1 determines the host range and cellular tropism and facilitates viral attachment to the target cells. S2 is a unit that mediates the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, ensuring viral entry through endocytosis. [

Understanding the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 could provide more insights into the viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets. A recent study showed that the affinity between S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 binding efficiency is 10–20 fold higher than that of SARS-CoV, which could explain the highly infectious ability of SARS-CoV-2 [
