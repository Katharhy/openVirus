  <p>The life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 in the host cells. The S glycoproteins of the virion bind to the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and enters target cells through an endosomal pathway. Following the entry of the virus into the host cell, the viral RNA is unveiled in the cytoplasm. ORF1a and ORF1ab are translated to produce pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins, which are cleaved by the proteases of the RTC. During replication, RTC drives the production full length (−) RNA copies of the genome and used as templates for full-length (+) RNA genomes. During transcription, a nested set of sub-genomic RNAs (sgRNAs), is produced in a manner of discontinuous transcription (fragmented transcription). Even though these sgRNAs may have several open reading frames (ORFs), only the closest ORF (to the 5′ end) will be translated. Following the production of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, nucleocapsids are assembled in the cytoplasm and followed by budding into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–Golgi intermediate compartment. Virions are then released from the infected cell through exocytosis (figure created with
