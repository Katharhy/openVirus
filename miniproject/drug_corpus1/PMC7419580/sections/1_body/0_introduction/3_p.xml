<p>Common bacteria isolated during secondary infections include 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus, S. pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitides, H. influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> and members of the 
 <italic>Proteus, Enterobacter</italic> and 
 <italic>Citrobacter</italic> spp. (

During active viral infections, the route of infection, proximity of infection as well as virulence factors varies between bacterial strains resulting in different outcomes. Effective treatment of both the viral and the secondary bacterial infection(s) is of critical importance. Antiviral treatments deployed initially do not treat secondary bacterial infections (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The preferred treatment for bacterial infections is generally broad-spectrum antibiotics, but this can result in undesirable side effects that have a negative impact on the normal microflora of the host (

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Susceptible individuals within a population can be protected from risk of some common bacterial pathogens that are also capable to cause secondary infections, for example pneumonia, if vaccines are available; furthermore, the immune system is often capable of fighting bacterial infections alone, while during a virus-bacterial infection, the complex immune responses might be inapt to eliminate bacterial-induced disease complications (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). To reduce severe disease progression or lethal outcomes, alternative ways to alleviate complications due to secondary bacterial infections and to eliminate bacterial pathogens while preserving host immunity might be necessary.
