  <title>Proteolytic reaction progression curves of M
   <sup>pro</sup> in the presence or the absence of compounds.

  <p>
   <bold>a–e</bold> In the kinetic studies, 5 nM M
   <sup>pro</sup> was added to a solution containing various concentrations of protease inhibitors and 20 µM FRET substrate to initiate the reaction. The reaction was then monitored for 4 h. The left column shows the reaction progression up to 4 h; middle column shows the progression curves for the first 90 min, which were used for curve fitting to generate the plot shown in the right column. Detailed methods were described in “Materials and methods” section. GC-376 (
   <bold>64</bold>) (
   <bold>a</bold>); boceprevir (
   <bold>28</bold>) (
   <bold>b</bold>); MG-132 (
   <bold>43</bold>) (
   <bold>c</bold>); calpain inhibitor II (
   <bold>61</bold>) (
   <bold>d</bold>); calpain inhibitor XII (
   <bold>62</bold>) (
   <bold>e</bold>).
