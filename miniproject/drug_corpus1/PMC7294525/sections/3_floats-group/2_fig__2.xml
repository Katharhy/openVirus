  <title>Screening of known protease inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 M
   <sup>pro</sup> using the FRET assay.
  </title>
  <p>20 µM of compounds (
   <bold>26</bold> was tested at 2 µM) was pre-incubated with 100 nM of SARS-CoV-2 M
   <sup>pro</sup> for 30 min at 30 °C, and then 10 µM FRET substrate was added to reaction mixture to initiate the reaction. The reaction was monitored for 2 h. The initial velocity was calculated by linear regression using the data points from the first 15 min of the reaction. The calculated initial velocity with each compound was normalized to DMSO control. The results are average ± standard deviation of two repeats.
