<p id="Par22">In summary, this study identified several potent SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors with potent enzymatic inhibition as well as cellular antiviral activity. Further development based on these hits might lead to clinically useful COVID-19 antivirals. They can be used either alone or in combination with polymerase inhibitors such as remdesivir as a means to achieve potential synergistic antiviral effect as well as to suppress drug resistance.
