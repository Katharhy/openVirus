<p id="Par18">Coronaviruses have caused three epidemics/pandemics in the past 20 years including SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. With the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, scientists and researchers around the globe are racing to find effective vaccines and antiviral drugs.

 </sup> The viral polymerase inhibitor remdesivir holds the greatest promise and it is currently being evaluated in several clinical trials.

 </sup> Remdesivir was recently granted emergency use authorization by FDA. The HIV drug combination lopinavir and ritonavir recently failed in a clinical trial for COVID-19 as no significant therapeutic efficacy was observed.

 </sup> To address this unmet medical need, we initiated a drug repurposing screening to identify potent inhibitors against the SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> from a collection of FDA-approved protease inhibitors. The M
 <sup>pro</sup> has been shown to be a validated antiviral drug target for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
 <sup>

 </sup> As the SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> shares a high sequence similarity with SARS-CoV and to a less extent with MERS-CoV, we reasoned that inhibiting the enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> will similarly prevent viral replication.
