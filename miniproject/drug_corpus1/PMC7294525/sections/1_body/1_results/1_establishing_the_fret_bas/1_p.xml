<p id="Par4">The M
 <sup>pro</sup> gene from SARS-CoV-2 strain BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019 was inserted into pET-29a(+) vector and expressed in BL21(DE3) 
 <italic>Escherichia Coli</italic>. with a His-tag in its C-terminus. The M
 <sup>pro</sup> protein was purified with Ni-NTA column to high purity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The determined molecular weight of M
 <sup>pro</sup> is 34,861 Da from native mass spectrometry, which matches the calculated molecular weight of M
 <sup>pro</sup> without the N-terminal methionine (Supplementary information, Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The first methionine might be cleaved by the methionine aminopeptidase as reported before.

 </sup> To establish the FRET assay condition, we designed a FRET based substrate using the sequence between viral polypeptide NSP4-NSP5 junction from SARS-CoV-2: Dabcyl-KTSAVLQ/SGFRKME(Edans).

 </sup> We then tested the M
 <sup>pro</sup> proteolytic activity in buffers with different pH. We found that M
 <sup>pro</sup> displays the highest activity in pH 6.5 buffer (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), which contains 20 mM HEPES, 120 mM NaCl, 0.4 mM EDTA, 4 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT) and 20% glycerol. As such, all the following proteolytic assay was conducted using this pH 6.5 buffer. A standard curve was generated to convert the relative fluorescence unit (RFU) to the amount of the cleaved substrate (nM) such that k
 <sub>cat</sub> can be calculated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Next, we characterized the enzymatic activity of this SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> by measuring the 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>m</sub> and 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> values. When 200 nM M
 <sup>pro</sup> was mixed with various concentration of FRET substrate (0–100 µM), the initial velocity was measured and plotted against substrate concentration. Curve fitting with Michaelis–Menten equation gave the best-fit values of 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>m</sub> and 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> as 28.2 ± 3.4 µM and 31.7 ± 1.6 RFU/s, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). The calculated 
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>cat</sub>/
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>m</sub> was 5,624 s
 <sup>−1</sup> M
 <sup>−1</sup>, which is similar to the previously reported value of 3,426.1 s
 <sup>−1</sup> M
 <sup>−1</sup> by Hilgenfeld et al.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
 </sup>, suggesting that the C-terminal His-tag M
 <sup>pro</sup> is as active as the native M
 <sup>pro</sup>.
