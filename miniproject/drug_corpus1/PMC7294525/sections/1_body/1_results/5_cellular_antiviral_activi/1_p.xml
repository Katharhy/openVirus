<p id="Par12">To test the hypothesis that inhibiting the enzymatic activity of M
 <sup>pro</sup> will lead to the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 viral replication, we performed cellular antiviral assays for the five promising hits (
 <bold>64</bold>, 
 <bold>28</bold>, 
 <bold>43</bold>, 
 <bold>61</bold>, and 
 <bold>62</bold>) against SARS-CoV-2. For this, we first tested the cellular cytotoxicity of these compounds in multiple cell lines (Supplementary information, Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). GC-376 (
 <bold>64</bold>), boceprevir (
 <bold>28</bold>), and calpain inhibitor II (
 <bold>61</bold>) were well tolerated and had CC
 <sub>50</sub> values of over 100 µM for all the cell lines tested. MG-132 (
 <bold>43</bold>) was cytotoxic to all the cells with CC
 <sub>50</sub> values less than 1 µM except A549 cells. Calpain inhibitor XII (
 <bold>62</bold>) had acceptable cellular cytotoxicity with CC
 <sub>50</sub> values above 50 µM for all the cell lines tested (Supplementary information, Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">S1</xref>).
