<p id="Par13">Next, we chose four compounds boceprevir (
 <bold>28</bold>), calpain inhibitors II (
 <bold>61</bold>), XII (
 <bold>62</bold>), and GC-376 (
 <bold>64</bold>) for the antiviral assay with infectious SARS-CoV-2. MG-132 (
 <bold>43</bold>) was not included due to its cytotoxicity. Gratifyingly, all four compounds showed potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in the primary viral cytopathic effect (CPE) assay with 50% effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) values ranging from 0.49 to 3.37 µM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a–d</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Their antiviral activity was further confirmed in the secondary viral yield reduction (VYR) assay (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e–h</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The most potent compound was calpain inhibitor XII (
 <bold>62</bold>), which showed an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.49 µM in the primary CPE assay and an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.78 µM in the secondary VYR assay (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>; Supplementary information, Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). In comparison, remdesivir was reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in the VYR assay with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.77 µM.

 </sup> None of the compounds inhibited the unrelated influenza virus A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus (EC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 20 µM) (Supplementary information, Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">S1</xref>), suggesting that the antiviral activity of the four compounds (boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II, XII, and GC-376) against SARS-CoV-2 is specific. In comparison with recently reported SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), the hits identified herein represent some of the most potent and selective drug candidates with broad chemical diversity.
