<p id="Par5">With the established FRET assay condition, we screened a collection of protease inhibitors from the Selleckchem bioactive compound library to identify potential SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The protease inhibitors are grouped based on their targets and mechanism of action, including proteasome inhibitors (
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>8</bold>), HIV protease inhibitors (
 <bold>9</bold>–
 <bold>14</bold>), γ-secretase inhibitors (
 <bold>15</bold>–
 <bold>22</bold>), HCV NS3–4A protease inhibitors (
 <bold>23</bold>–
 <bold>29</bold>), DPP-4 inhibitors (
 <bold>30</bold>–
 <bold>35</bold>), miscellaneous serine protease inhibitors (
 <bold>36</bold>–
 <bold>39</bold>), cathepsin and calpain protease inhibitors (
 <bold>40</bold>–
 <bold>43</bold>), miscellaneous cysteine protease inhibitors (
 <bold>44</bold>–
 <bold>48</bold>), matrix metalloprotease inhibitors (
 <bold>49</bold>–
 <bold>51</bold>), and miscellaneous protease inhibitors (
 <bold>52</bold>–
 <bold>55</bold>). The inhibitors were pre-incubated with 100 nM of M
 <sup>pro</sup> at 30 °C for 30 min in the presence of 4 mM DTT before the addition of 10 µM FRET substrate. The addition of DTT was to quench non-specific thiol reactive compounds and to ensure that M
 <sup>pro</sup> is in the reducing condition. All compounds were tested at 20 µM, except compound 
 <bold>26</bold>, which was tested at 2 µM due to its fluorescent background. Encouragingly, four inhibitors (
 <bold>24</bold>, 
 <bold>28</bold>, 
 <bold>29</bold> and 
 <bold>43</bold>) showed more than 60% inhibition against M
 <sup>pro</sup> at 20 µM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Among the hits, simeprevir (
 <bold>24</bold>), boceprevir (
 <bold>28</bold>), and narlaprevir (
 <bold>29</bold>) are HCV NS3–4A serine protease inhibitors, and compound MG-132 (
 <bold>43</bold>) inhibits both proteasome and calpain.
