<p id="Par16">Three copies of GC-376 (
 <bold>64</bold>) were found in the crystal structure, one in each protomer active site (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a, c</xref>; Supplementary information, Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). The configurations of GC-376 (
 <bold>64</bold>) were consistent in protomers A and B, where the thioacetal hydroxide is positioned in the “oxyanion hole” formed by the backbone amides of Gly143, Ser144, and Cys145 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>; Supplementary information, Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S4</xref>), resulting in the (S)-configuration. It is noted that aldehydes (
 <bold>11a</bold> and 
 <bold>11b</bold>) also bind the active site of SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> in the (S)-configuration (PDB: 6M0K and 6LZE) (Supplementary information, Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S5a</xref>).

 </sup> In protomer C, however, the same hydroxide group orients outwards from the oxyanion hole, forming hydrogen bonds with His41 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>), which gives the (R)-configuration. This (R)-configuration is consistent with the binding mode of α-ketoamide (
 <bold>13b</bold>) in the active site of SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> (PDB: 6Y2F) (Supplementary information, Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S5b</xref>).

 </sup> These two unique configurations R and S might be a result of the Cys145 thiol nucleophilic attacking the aldehyde of GC-376 (
 <bold>64</bold>) from two different faces (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b, d</xref>). The fact that GC-376 (
 <bold>64</bold>) can adopt two different configurations R and S upon binding to the active site might explain its high binding affinity towards the target.
