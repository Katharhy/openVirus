<p id="Par15">GC-376 (
 <bold>64</bold>) forms an extensive network of hydrogen bonds with the active site while also exhibiting excellent geometric complementarity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). These interactions are coupled with the thermodynamic payoff of covalent adduct formation between the aldehyde bisulfite warhead and Cys145, making GC-376 (
 <bold>64</bold>) one of the most potent SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors in vitro with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.030 ± 0.008 µM (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Along with other known M
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors (
 <bold>N3</bold>, 
 <bold>13b</bold>, 
 <bold>11a</bold> and 
 <bold>11b</bold>) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), GC-376 (
 <bold>64</bold>) mimics the peptide substrate that is cleaved by this enzyme (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>).

 </sup> The glutamine surrogate γ-lactam ring is a cyclized derivative of the P1 glutamine side chain that normally occupies the S1 site; here it forms hydrogen bonds with the His163 and Glu166 side chains and the main chain of Phe140 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a, c</xref>). An amide bond connects the γ-lactam side chain to an isobutyl moiety that embeds itself in the hydrophobic S2 site formed by His41, Met49, and Met169. Normally, this S2 site in SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> can accommodate a variety of hydrophobic substitutions such as isobutyl in GC-376 (
 <bold>64</bold>) and 
 <bold>N3</bold>), cyclopropyl in (
 <bold>13b</bold>), cyclohexyl in (
 <bold>11a</bold>), and 3-fluorophenyl in (
 <bold>11b</bold>) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).

 </sup> A carbamate bond in GC-376 (
 <bold>64</bold>), which forms hydrogen bonds with the main chain of Glu166 and the side chain of Gln189, connects the P2 isobutyl group to a phenylmethyl ester that interacts with the aliphatic S4 site. Compared with previous inhibitors, the phenylmethyl ester of GC-376 (
 <bold>64</bold>) exhibits high complementarity with the S4 site, and the extensive non-polar interactions may contribute significantly to the potency of this compound (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>).
