<p id="Par17">An additional difference between the configurations of GC-376 (
 <bold>64</bold>) in protomers A, B and C is observed in the orientation of the phenylmethyl ester. In protomer C, the CH
 <sub>2</sub> of the phenylmethyl points toward the main chain of Leu167 in a “
 <italic>cis</italic>” conformation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>), whereas in protomers A and B this same CH
 <sub>2</sub> points downwards in a “
 <italic>trans</italic>” conformation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>; Supplementary information, Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). Consequently, this influences the rotameric configuration of the Leu167 isobutyl moiety, where a rotational adjustment of 180° occurs at its “β” carbon. Furthermore, large rearrangements are observed in the flexible loop that consists of residues 45–51 (TSEDMLN in SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup>) and forms the S2 and S3′ subsites (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6f</xref>), explaining the broad substrate scope in the P2 site (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The loop conformations in protomers B and C may be influenced by crystal packing interactions with protomers from adjacent ASUs and resemble the conformations in previously determined structures.

 </sup> Meanwhile, the conformation of protomer A is less restrained and exhibits the most significant conformational divergence. The different loop conformations offer a glimpse of the protein plasticity that allows M
 <sup>pro</sup> to accommodate peptides with differing amino acid composition, and underscores the importance of considering this flexibility when analyzing and modeling protein-ligand interactions for M
 <sup>pro</sup>.
