<p id="Par14">The crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> in complex with GC-376 (
 <bold>64</bold>) was solved in the P3
 <sub>2</sub>21 space group at 2.15 Å resolution (PDB: 6WTT) (Supplementary information, Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). There are three protomers per asymmetric unit (ASU) with two constituting a biological dimer and the third forming a dimer with a crystallographic symmetry related neighboring protomers (Supplementary information, Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). The presence of three protomers in our crystal structure allowed us to capture different binding configurations of GC-376 (
 <bold>64</bold>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), a unique feature that was not observed in previous X-ray crystal structures.

 </sup> The pairwise r.m.s.d among the protomer backbone Cα atoms ranges from 0.435 to 0.564 Å. Previously, SARS-CoV M
 <sup>pro</sup> and SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> crystal structures have been solved most frequently as one protomer per ASU, and occasionally a dimer.

 </sup>, which is supported by our native MS data (Supplementary information, Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). In our crystal structures, all three protomers appear catalytically competent, with the third protomer activated by the N-finger from an adjacent ASU. The well-defined electron density also clearly shows a serine at the protease N-terminus, again indicating that the first methionine in the protease construct was cleaved (Supplementary information, Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S3b</xref>).
