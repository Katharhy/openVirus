<p id="Par11">To elucidate the mechanism of action of hits against SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup>, we focus on five most potent compounds prioritized from the primary and secondary screenings including boceprevir (
 <bold>28</bold>), MG-132 (
 <bold>43</bold>), calpain inhibitor II (
 <bold>61</bold>), calpain inhibitor XII (
 <bold>62</bold>), and GC-376 (
 <bold>64</bold>). For this, we performed enzyme kinetic studies with different concentrations of inhibitors (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). A biphasic enzymatic progression curve in the presence but not absence of inhibitor is typically a hallmark for a slow covalent binding inhibitor. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, the left column shows the progression curves up to 4 h. Biphasic progression curves were observed for all 5 inhibitors at high drug concentrations. Significant substrate depletion was observed when the proteolytic reaction proceeded beyond 90 min. We therefore chose the first 90 min of the progression curves for curve fitting (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, middle column). We fit the progression curves in the presence of different concentrations of GC-376 (
 <bold>64</bold>) with the two-step Morrison equation (Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="">3</xref>) in “Materials and methods” section). GC-376 (
 <bold>64</bold>) binds to SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> with an equilibrium dissociation constant for the inhibitor (K
 <sub>I</sub>) of 59.9 ± 21.7 nM in the first step. After initial binding, a covalent bond is formed at a slower velocity between GC-376 (
 <bold>64</bold>) and M
 <sup>pro</sup> with the second reaction rate constant (k
 <sub>2</sub>) being 0.00245 ± 0.00047 s
 <sup>−1</sup>, resulting in an overall k
 <sub>2</sub>/K
 <sub>I</sub> value of 4.08 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> M
 <sup>−1</sup> s
 <sup>−1</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). However, when we tried to fit the proteolytic progression curves for boceprevir (
 <bold>28</bold>), MG-132 (
 <bold>43</bold>), calpain inhibitors II (
 <bold>61</bold>) and XII (
 <bold>62</bold>) using the same two-step reaction mechanism, we could not obtain accurate values for the second rate constant k
 <sub>2</sub>. This is presumably due to significant substrate depletion before the equilibrium between EI and EI*, leading to very small values of k
 <sub>2</sub>. Accordingly, for these four inhibitors (
 <bold>28</bold>, 
 <bold>43</bold>, 
 <bold>61</bold>, and 
 <bold>62</bold>), only the dissociation constant K
 <sub>I</sub> values from the first step were determined (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b–e</xref>). The inhibition constants (K
 <sub>I</sub>) for boceprevir (
 <bold>28</bold>), MG-132 (
 <bold>43</bold>), calpain inhibitors II (
 <bold>61</bold>) and XII (
 <bold>62</bold>) are 1.18 ± 0.10 µM, 1.57 ± 0.13 µM, 0.40 ± 0.02 µM, and 0.13 ± 0.02 µM, respectively.
