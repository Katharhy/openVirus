<p id="Par9">When plotting the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (log scale) of the inhibitors against M
 <sup>pro</sup> from the FRET enzymatic assay with the melting temperature shifts (ΔT
 <sub>m</sub>) from TSA (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), a linear correlation was observed, and the r
 <sup>2</sup> of the linear regression fitting is 0.94. This suggests that there is a direct correlation between the enzymatic inhibition and protein binding: a more potent enzyme inhibitor also binds to the protein with higher affinity. The stabilization of the M
 <sup>pro</sup> against thermal denaturation was also compound concentration dependent (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).
