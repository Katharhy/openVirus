<p id="Par6">Given the encouraging results from the primary screening, we then further characterized the four hits (
 <bold>24</bold>, 
 <bold>28</bold>, 
 <bold>29</bold>, and 
 <bold>43</bold>) in a combination of assays including dose-response titration, thermal shift binding assay (TSA), and counter screening assays with two other viral cysteine proteases, the enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) 2A and 3C proteases, both of which are cysteine proteases (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The HCV NS3–4A protease inhibitors boceprevir (
 <bold>28</bold>) and narlaprevir (
 <bold>29</bold>) inhibited M
 <sup>pro</sup> with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) values of 4.13 and 4.73 µM, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), more potent than simeprevir (
 <bold>24</bold>) (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 13.74 µM). Both compounds (
 <bold>28</bold> and 
 <bold>29</bold>) also showed strong binding towards M
 <sup>pro</sup> and shifted the melting temperature of the protein (ΔT
 <sub>m</sub>) by 6.67 °C and 5.18 °C, respectively, at 40 µM. Despite their potent inhibition against the HCV NS3–4A serine protease and the SARS-CoV-2 cysteine M
 <sup>pro</sup>, boceprevir (
 <bold>28</bold>) and narlaprevir (
 <bold>29</bold>) did not inhibit the EV-A71 2A and 3C proteases (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 20 µM), suggesting that they are not non-specific cysteine protease inhibitors. The calpain inhibitor MG-132 (
 <bold>43</bold>) had an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 3.90 µM against M
 <sup>pro</sup>, and was not active against the EV-A71 2A and 3C proteases (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 20 µM). The binding of MG-132 (
 <bold>43</bold>) to M
 <sup>pro</sup> was also confirmed in the TSA assay with a ΔT
 <sub>m</sub> of 4.02 °C.
