<p id="Par7">In light of the promising results of the calpain inhibitor MG-132 (
 <bold>43</bold>), we then pursued testing for other calpain and cathepsin inhibitors that are commercially available (
 <bold>56</bold>–
 <bold>63</bold>) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). These compounds were not included in the initial library because they have not been advanced to clinical studies. Among this series of analogs, calpain inhibitor II (
 <bold>61</bold>) and XII (
 <bold>62</bold>) are the most potent M
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.97 and 0.45 µM, respectively. Binding of compounds (
 <bold>61</bold> and 
 <bold>62</bold>) to M
 <sup>pro</sup> shifted the melting curve of the protein by 6.65 and 7.86 °C, respectively. Encouragingly, both compounds (
 <bold>61</bold> and 
 <bold>62</bold>) did not inhibit the EV-A71 2A and 3C proteases (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 20 µM). Calpain inhibitor I (
 <bold>59</bold>) and MG-115 (
 <bold>60</bold>) also showed potent inhibition against M
 <sup>pro</sup> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 8.60 and 3.14 µM, respectively. Calpeptin (
 <bold>56</bold>) and PSI (
 <bold>63</bold>) had moderate activity against M
 <sup>pro</sup> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 10.69 and 10.38 µM, respectively. In contrast, calpain inhibitors III (
 <bold>57</bold>) and VI (
 <bold>58</bold>) were not active (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 20 µM).
