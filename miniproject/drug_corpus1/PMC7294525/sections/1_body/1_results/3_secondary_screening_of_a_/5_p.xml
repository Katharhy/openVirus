<p id="Par10">The binding of the four most potent inhibitors boceprevir (
 <bold>28</bold>), calpain inhibitors II (
 <bold>61</bold>), XII (
 <bold>62</bold>), and GC-376 (
 <bold>64</bold>) to SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> was further characterized by native mass spectrometry (MS) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c–f</xref>). Native MS analysis showed that M
 <sup>pro</sup> formed a dimer complex with a mass of 69,722 Da, indicating that the extra N-terminal methionine in our M
 <sup>pro</sup> construct was cleaved, yielding the native M
 <sup>pro</sup> N-terminus with a serine residue (Supplementary information, Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). A small amount of protomer and dimer with a single C-terminal truncation of the His-tag was also observed, but the intact dimer was the predominant signal (Supplementary information, Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Addition of all four ligands tested, boceprevir (
 <bold>28</bold>), calpain inhibitors II (
 <bold>61</bold>), XII (
 <bold>62</bold>), and GC-376 (
 <bold>64</bold>), showed binding of up to two ligands per dimer (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c–f</xref>), suggesting a binding stoichiometry of one drug per protomer.
