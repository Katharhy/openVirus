<p id="Par8">We also included two well-known viral 3CL protease inhibitors GC-376 (
 <bold>64</bold>) and rupintrivir (
 <bold>65</bold>) in the secondary screening. GC-376 (
 <bold>64</bold>) is an investigational veterinary drug that is being developed for feline infectious peritonitis (FIP).

 </sup> GC-376 (
 <bold>64</bold>) was designed to target the viral 3CL protease and had potent antiviral activity against multiple viruses including MERS-CoV, FIPV, and norovirus.

 </sup> Rupintrivir (
 <bold>65</bold>) was developed as a rhinovirus antiviral by targeting the viral 3CL protease, but it was discontinued in clinical trials due to side effects.

 </sup> In our study, we found that GC-376 (
 <bold>64</bold>) was the most potent M
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitor with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.03 µM. It shifted the melting curve of M
 <sup>pro</sup> by 18.30 °C upon binding. In contrast, rupintrivir (
 <bold>65</bold>) was not active against M
 <sup>pro</sup> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 20 µM). Previous report also showed that rupintrivir was not active against the SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> (M
 <sup>pro</sup>) (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 100 µM).

 </sup> Both compounds (
 <bold>64</bold> and 
 <bold>65</bold>) were inactive against the EV-A71 2A protease, but showed potent inhibition against the EV-A71 3C protease, which is consistent with previously reported results.
