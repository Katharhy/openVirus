<p id="Par29">Prior to analysis, the protein was buffer exchanged into 0.2 M ammonium acetate (pH 6.8) and diluted to 10 μM. DTT was dissolved in water and prepared at a 400 mM stock. Each ligand was dissolved in ethanol and diluted to 10× stock concentrations. The final mixture was prepared by adding 4 μL protein, 0.5 μL DTT stock, and 0.5 μL ligand stock for final concentration of 4 mM DTT and 8 μM protein. Final ligand concentrations were used as annotated. The mixtures were then incubated for 10 min at room temperature prior to analysis. Each sample was mixed and analyzed in triplicate.</p>
