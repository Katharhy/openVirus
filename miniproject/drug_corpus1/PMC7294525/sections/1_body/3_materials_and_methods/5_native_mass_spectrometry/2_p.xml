<p id="Par30">Native MS was performed using a Q-Exactive HF quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer with the Ultra-High Mass Range research modifications (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were ionized using nano-electrospray ionization in positive ion mode using 1.0 kV capillary voltage at a 150 °C capillary temperature. The samples were all analyzed with a 1000–25,000 m/z range, the resolution set to 30,000, and a trapping gas pressure set to 3. Source fragmentation (10–50 V) was applied to all samples to aid in desolvation. Data were deconvolved and analyzed with UniDec.
