 <sup>pro</sup> FRET substrate Dabcyl-KTSAVLQ/SGFRKME (Edans) was synthesized by solid-phase synthesis through iterative cycles of coupling and deprotection using the previously optimized procedure.

 </sup> Specifically, chemmatrix rink-amide resin was used. Typical coupling condition was 5 equiv of amino acid, 5 equiv of HATU, and 10 equiv of DIEA in DMF for 5 min at 80 °C. For deprotection, 5% piperazine plus 0.1 M HOBt were used and the mixture was heated at 80 °C for 5 min. The peptide was cleaved from the resin using 95% TFA, 2.5% Tris and 2.5% H
 <sub>2</sub>O, and the crude peptide was precipitated from ether after removal of TFA. The final peptide was purified by preparative HPLC. The purify and identity of the peptide were confirmed by analytical HPLC (&gt; 98% purity) and mass spectrometry. [M + 3]
