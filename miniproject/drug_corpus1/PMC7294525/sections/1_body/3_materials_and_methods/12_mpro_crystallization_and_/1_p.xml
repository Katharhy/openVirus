<p id="Par38">10 mg/mL of SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> was incubated with 2 mM GC376 at 4 °C overnight. The protein was diluted to 2.5 mg/mL the following day in protein buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 4 mM DTT). Since GC3760 is water soluble, no precipitation was observed, and centrifugation was not necessary. Crystals were grown by mixing 2 μL of the protein solution with 1 μL of the precipitant solution (15% PEG 2 K, 10% 1,6-hexanediol, and 0.2 M NaCl) in a hanging-drop vapor-diffusion apparatus. Crystals were cryoprotected by transferring to a cryoprotectant solution (20% PEG 2 K, 10% 1,6-hexanediol, 20% glycerol) and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
