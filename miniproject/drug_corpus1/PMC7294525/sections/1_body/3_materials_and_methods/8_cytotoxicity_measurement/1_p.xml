<p id="Par34">A549, MDCK, HCT-8, Caco-2, Vero, and BEAS2B cells for cytotoxicity CPE assays were seeded and grown overnight at 37 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere to ∼90% confluence on the next day. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 200 µL DMEM containing 2% FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin, and various concentrations of protease inhibitors were added to each well. 48 h after addition of the protease inhibitors, cells were stained with 66 μg/mL neutral red for 2 h, and neutral red uptake was measured at an absorbance at 540 nm using a Multiskan FC microplate photometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The CC
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated from best-fit dose-response curves using GraphPad Prism 5 software.
