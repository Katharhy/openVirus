<p id="Par28">Edans standard curve was generated as described below: 200 nM SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> was incubated with varying concentrations of FRET substrate (0.5–40 µM) and the reaction progress was monitored until the fluorescence signals reached plateau, at which point we deemed all the FRET substrate was digested by M
 <sup>pro</sup>. The endpoint fluorescence signal was plotted against FRET substrate concentration with a linear regression function in Prism 5.
