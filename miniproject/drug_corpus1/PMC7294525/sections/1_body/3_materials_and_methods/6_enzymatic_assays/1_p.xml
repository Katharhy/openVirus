<p id="Par31">For reaction condition optimization, 200 µM SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> was used. pH 6.0 buffer contains 20 mM MES, pH 6.0, 120 mM NaCl, 0.4 mM EDTA, 4 mM DTT and 20% glycerol; pH 6.5 buffer contains 20 mM HEPES, pH 6.5, 120 mM NaCl, 0.4 mM EDTA, 4 mM DTT and 20% glycerol; pH 7.0 buffer contains 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 120 mM NaCl, 0.4 mM EDTA, 4 mM DTT and 20% glycerol. Upon addition of 20 µM FRET substrate, the reaction progress was monitored for 1 h. The first 15 min of reaction was used to calculate initial velocity via linear regression in Prism 5. M
 <sup>pro</sup> displays the highest proteolytic activity in pH 6.5 buffer. All the following enzymatic assays were carried out in pH 6.5 buffer.
