<p id="Par33">The binding of protease inhibitors to M
 <sup>pro</sup> was monitored by differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) using a Thermo Fisher QuantStudio
 <sup>TM</sup> 5 Real-Time PCR System. TSA plates were prepared by mixing M
 <sup>pro</sup> protein (final concentration of 3 μM) with inhibitors, and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. 1× SYPRO orange (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were added and the fluorescence of the plates were taken under a temperature gradient ranging from 20 to 90 °C (incremental steps of 0.05 °C/s). The melting temperature (T
 <sub>m</sub>) was calculated as the mid-log of the transition phase from the native to the denatured protein using a Boltzmann model (Protein Thermal Shift Software v1.3). Thermal shift that was represented as ΔT
 <sub>m</sub> was calculated by subtracting reference melting temperature of proteins in DMSO from the T
 <sub>m</sub> in the presence of compound.
