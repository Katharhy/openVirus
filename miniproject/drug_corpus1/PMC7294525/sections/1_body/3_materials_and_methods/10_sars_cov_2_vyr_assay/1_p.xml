<p id="Par36">VYR assays were conducted by first replicating the viruses in the presence of test compound. Supernatant was harvested 3 days post infection from each concentration of test compound and the virus yield was determined by endpoint dilution method. Briefly, supernatant virus was serially diluted in log
 <sub>10</sub> increments and then plated onto quadruplicate wells of 96-well plates seeded with Vero 76 cells. The presence or absence of CPE for determining a viral endpoint was evaluated by microscopic examination of cells 6 days post infection. From these data, 90% virus inhibitory concentrations (EC
 <sub>90</sub>) were determined by regression analysis.
