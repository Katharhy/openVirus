<p id="Par35">Antiviral activities of test compounds were determined in nearly confluent cultures of Vero 76 cells. The assays were performed in 96-well Corning microplates. Cells were infected with approximately 60-fold of 50% cell culture infectious doses (CCID
 <sub>50</sub>) of SARS-CoV-2 and 50% effective concentrations (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) were calculated based on virus-induced CPE quantified by neutral red dye uptake after 5 days of incubation. USA-WA1/2020 strain of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from the WRCEVA was used for both CPE and VYR assays. Three microwells at each concentration of compound were infected. Two uninfected microwells served as toxicity controls. Cells were stained for viability with neutral red (0.11% final concentration) for 2 h. Excess dye was rinsed from the cells with PBS. The absorbed dye was eluted from the cells with 0.1 mL of 50% Sörensen’s citrate buffer (pH 4.2)-50% ethanol. Plates were read for optical density determination at 540 nm. Readings were converted to the percentage of the results for the uninfected control using an Excel spreadsheet developed for this purpose. EC
 <sub>50</sub> values were determined by plotting percent CPE versus log
 <sub>10</sub> inhibitor concentration. Toxicity at each concentration was determined in uninfected wells in the same microplates by measuring dye uptake.
