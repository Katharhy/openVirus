<p id="Par24">SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M
 <sup>pro</sup> or 3CL) gene from strain BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019 was ordered from GenScript (Piscataway, NJ, USA) in the pET29a(+) vector with 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> codon optimization. pET29a(+) plasmids with SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> was transformed into competent 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3) cells, and a single colony was picked to inoculate 10 mL of LB supplemented with 50 g/mL kanamycin and grown at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm. The 10-mL inoculum was added to 1 L of LB with 50 g/mL kanamycin and grown to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.8, and then induced using 1.0 mM IPTG. Induced cultures were incubated at 37 °C for an additional 3 h and then harvested, resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 750 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT with 0.5 mg/mL lysozyme, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.02 mg/mL DNase I), and lysed by alternating sonication and French press cycles. The cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 12,000× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 45 min (20% amplitude, 1 s on/1 s off). The supernatant was incubated with Ni-NTA resin for over 2 h at 4 °C on a rotator. The Ni-NTA resin was thoroughly washed with 30 mM imidazole in wash buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT); and eluted with 100 mM imidazole in elution buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT). The imidazole was removed via dialysis or on a 10,000-molecular-weight-cutoff centrifugal concentrator spin column. The purity of the protein was confirmed with SDS-PAGE. The protein concentration was determined via 260 nm absorbance with ε 32890. EV-A71 2A
 <sup>pro</sup> and 3C
 <sup>pro</sup> were expressed in the pET28b(+) vector as previously described.
