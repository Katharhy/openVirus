<p id="Par3">There is currently no antiviral or vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 viral genome encodes a number of structural proteins (e.g., capsid spike glycoprotein), non-structural proteins (e.g., 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL or main protease), papain-like protease, helicase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), and accessary proteins. Compounds that target any of these viral proteins might be potential antiviral drug candidates.

 </sup> In this study, we focus on the viral 3CL protease, also called the main protease (M
 <sup>pro</sup>), and aim to develop potent M
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors as SAR-CoV-2 antivirals. The M
 <sup>pro</sup> plays an essential role in coronavirus replication by digesting the viral polyproteins at more than 11 sites, and it appears like a high-profile target for antiviral drug discovery.

 </sup> The M
 <sup>pro</sup> has a unique substrate preference for glutamine at the P1 site (Leu-Gln↓(Ser, Ala, Gly)), a feature that is absent in closely related host proteases, suggesting that it is feasible to achieve high selectivity by targeting viral M
 <sup>pro</sup>. As such, we developed the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based enzymatic assay for the SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> and applied it to screen a focused library of protease inhibitors. Here we report our findings of several novel hits targeting SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> and their mechanism of action. The in vitro antiviral activity of the hits was also evaluated in cell culture using infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus. Overall, our study provides a list of drug candidates for SARS-CoV-2 with a confirmed mechanism of action, and the results might help speed up the drug discovery efforts in combating COVID-19. The compounds identified herein represent some of the most potent and selective SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors so far with both enzymatic inhibition and cellular antiviral activity.

 </sup> The X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> with GC-376 showed that the compound can adopt two configurations R and S, offering a molecular explanation of the high binding affinity of the aldehyde-containing inhibitors. Significantly, the discovery of calpain II and XII inhibitors as potent SARS-CoV-2 antivirals suggests that it might be feasible to design dual inhibitors against the viral M
 <sup>pro</sup> and the host calpains/cathepsins, both of which are important for viral replication.
