<p id="para0013">The COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown are still occurring during the time this article is being written. Moreover, this situation is unprecedented because of the crisis's extent and the context of social interaction transformation related to the lockdown, but also because of the digital revolution. There is little literature related to adolescent mental health in the context of epidemics or pandemics. We included articles providing specific data on psychiatric disorders in times of COVID-19 pandemic, epidemics, and disasters, focusing on adolescents whenever possible. We also included papers not directly related to adolescents, but related to similar crises, such as 2002â€“2004 SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrom) outbreak, and their impacts upon children as well as adults.</p>
