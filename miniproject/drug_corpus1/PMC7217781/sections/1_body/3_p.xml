<p id="par0020">We used the CANDO platform to generate putative drug repurposing candidates against SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> ). The platform ranks a number of clinical trial candidates listed in Table 1 of Harrison 
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> in the top 1% of predictions and provides relevant target and off-target interaction information for them. We are currently in the process of undertaking 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> validation of top ranked candidates as well as using EHR data to corroborate or negate predictions made by the platform. This pandemic highlights the importance of developing such robust shotgun repurposing platforms that not only make drug discovery more efficient by systematically evaluating multiple uses of a human ingestible drug but may also be rapidly deployed every time a new disease arises.
