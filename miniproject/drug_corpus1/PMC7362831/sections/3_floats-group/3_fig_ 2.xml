  <p>Structure and role in viral translation of the eIF4F complex. eIF4F includes the helicase eIF4A that unwinds the highly structured 5′ untranslated region (5′-UTR) sequence of some viral RNAs, the cap-binding protein eIF4E, and the scaffold protein eIF4G. Flavaglines stabilize the interaction between eIF4A and the 5′UTR by altering the conformation of both eIF4A and the mRNA. As a consequence, eIF4A recycling is blocked, which leads to an inhibition of cap-dependent translation. AUG, translation initiation codon. 40S, small ribosome subunit, m
   <sup>7</sup>G, 7-methylguanosine located at the 5′ end of the mRNA to which eIF4E binds.
