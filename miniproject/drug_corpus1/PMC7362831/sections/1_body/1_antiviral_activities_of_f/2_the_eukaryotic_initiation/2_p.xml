<p id="p0075">Protein synthesis is a complex process tightly regulated by several proteins including eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F), a heterotrimeric complex required for ribosome recruitment to capped mRNAs (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> ). The eIF4F complex is composed of the helicase eIF4A, the cap-binding subunit eIF4E and the scaffold protein eIF4G that recruits the 40S ribosomal subunit to mRNA. The helicase eIF4A unwinds a small number of cellular messenger RNAs (mRNAs), for instance those that harbor guanine-rich motifs forming G-quadruplexes in their 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) to facilitate binding of the 43S preinitiation complex [

 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Importantly, most of these RNAs code for proteins involved in the etiology of cancers, explaining why eIF4A inhibitors exhibit potent anticancer effects without major toxicity to the organism. Flavaglines are the most characterized and potent inhibitors of eIF4A. Their mode action was exemplified with rocaglamide by Iwasaki, Ito, Ingolia and coll [
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Rocaglamide binds to a bimolecular cavity that is formed between eIF4A and a purine-rich RNA. Uniquely, the binding takes place only following an RNA-induced change in the structure of eIF4A. The stable eIF4A-rocaglamide-RNA complexes block scanning ribosomes and consequently repress translation from the targeted mRNAs. In addition, since eIF4A is trapped to mRNAs, it is no longer available to be included in the eIF4F complex, thereby inhibiting eIF4F-dependent mRNA translation and preventing the recycling of eIF4A. As a consequence, eIF4A is no longer available for other mRNAs.
