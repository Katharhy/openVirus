<p id="p0025">Flavaglines, also called rocaglates, represent a distinctive class of cyclopenta[
 <italic>b</italic>]benzofurans produced in nature by plants of the genus 
 <italic>Aglaia</italic> that grow in Southeast Asia [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Some of these plants are used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat contused wounds, cough, diarrhea, fever, and inflammation. Rocaglamide (

 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> ) was originally discovered by King and collaborators in 1982. Since then more than one hundred other natural flavaglines, such as silvestrol (
 <bold>2</bold>) and aglaroxin C (
 <bold>3</bold>), have been identified. Strikingly, these compounds can selectively kill cancer cells, without being toxic to non-cancer cells. They can even protect neurons and cardiomyocytes against the adverse effect of clinically used cancer chemotherapeutics [

 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>]. Flavaglines also possess potent anti-inflammatory effects, in particular in a mouse model of Crohn’s disease [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These pharmacological effects are mediated by two classes of molecular targets: the translation initiation factor eIF4A and prohibitins-1 and 2 (PHB1/2) (
