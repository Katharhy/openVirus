<p id="p0035">The importance of eIF4A during viral infections tends to be virus specific. In fact, viruses can either use it or not use it at all, or they may alternate between requiring and not requiring the eIF4A protein [

Several RNA viruses require eIF4A for the translation of their mRNAs, in particular those that are responsible for Ebola, chikungunya, hepatitis E, poliomyelitis, Zika fever, “hand, foot and mouth” disease, SARS, MERS and COVID-19 (recently reviewed in Ref. [
