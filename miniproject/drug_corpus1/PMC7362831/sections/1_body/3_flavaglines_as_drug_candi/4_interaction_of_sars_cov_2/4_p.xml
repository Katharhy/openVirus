<p id="p0210">Importantly, these authors identified 66 human proteins targeted by 29 FDA-approved drugs, 12 drugs in clinical trials and 28 preclinical compounds. The screening of these compounds revealed 2 families of drugs with extremely promising antiviral activities: the modulators of Sigma1 and Sigma2 receptors and some inhibitors of translation. This latter observation is not surprising, considering the established requirement of eIF4F for the translation of coronaviruses mRNAs. Zotatifin (
