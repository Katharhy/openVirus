<p id="p0200">Recently, Krogan and collaborators identified host proteins that physically interact with each protein of SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Surprisingly, they found that most of these viral proteins interact with both PHB1 and PHB2. The viral proteins that interact with PHBs are the following: three of the four structural proteins (spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E) proteins,) and 14 of the 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1 and nsp2 (papain-like protease), nsp4, nsp5 (3C-like protease), nsp6, nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp10, nsp11and nsp12 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), nsp13 (helicase), nsp14 (3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease), and nsp15 (mRNA cap-1 methyltransferase) and nine accessory proteins with unknown functions (ORF3a, ORF3b, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, ORF9b, ORF9c and ORF10 proteins).
