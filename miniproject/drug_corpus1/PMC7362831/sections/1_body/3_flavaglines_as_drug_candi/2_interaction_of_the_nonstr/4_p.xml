<p id="p0175">Buchmeier and collaborators discovered that PHB1 and PHB2 interact with nsp2 of SARS-CoV probably to divert PHB signaling and promote virus replication or to evade the innate immune system [
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. This protein is located in the cytoplasmic side of the DMVs [
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Although the function of nsp2 remains unknown, nsp2 is not necessary for replication of SARS-CoV in cell culture and may therefore be involved in the inhibition of the host innate immune response. Indeed, Liu and collaborators found that nsp2 of another coronavirus (infectious bronchitis virus) inhibits protein kinase R (PKR) [
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. PKR is a double-stranded-RNA-dependent kinase that phosphorylates eIF2Î± to shut-down translation [
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Whether SARS-CoV-2 also uses nsp2 to preserve protein synthesis and, meanwhile, enhance viral replication, has not been confirmed yet.
