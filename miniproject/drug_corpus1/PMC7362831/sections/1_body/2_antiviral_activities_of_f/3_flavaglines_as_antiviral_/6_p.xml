<p id="p0145">Wang and collaborators found that PHBs in lipid rafts interact with viral glycoprotein E2 to promote the entry of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) into hepatocytes at a post-binding step through the activation of the kinase C-RAF [

 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>3</bold>, 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) were found to prevent the localization of PHBs at the cell surface, and consequently to block C-RAF activation and to reduce HCV infection with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 4 and 0.04 nM (incubation of 48 h in Huh7.5.1 cells) respectively. Thereafter Porco and collaborators synthesized aglaroxin C analogues and showed that two of them, CMLD012043 (
 <bold>8</bold>) and CMLD012044 (
 <bold>9</bold>), showed 3-fold greater inhibition of HCV infection in comparison to aglaroxin C and also with very low cytotoxicity [
