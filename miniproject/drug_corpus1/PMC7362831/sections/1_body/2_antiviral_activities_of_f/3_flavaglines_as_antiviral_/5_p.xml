<p id="p0140">Thereafter this team found that two synthetic flavaglines, FL3 (
 <bold>6</bold>, 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) and FL23 (
 <bold>7</bold>), and another PHB ligand structurally unrelated to flavaglines, were all able to inhibit CHIKV infection in mammalian cells and reduce viral production when cells were treated before infection [
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Pretreatment of cells for only 15 min prior to infection followed by washing out of the compound resulted in significant inhibition of entry and as a consequence virus production, ruling out an involvement of eIF4 in these specific effects. As discussed, silverstol inhibits viral translation [
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], indicating that the effects of flavaglines could be dual. On one hand they could inhibit PHB-dependent entry of CHIKV into microglial cells, and on the other hand they could block viral mRNA translation.
