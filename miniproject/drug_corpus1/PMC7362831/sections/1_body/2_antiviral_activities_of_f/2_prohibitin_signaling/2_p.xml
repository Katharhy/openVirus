<p id="p0120">Prohibitins-1 and -2 (PHB1/2) are evolutionary conserved scaffold proteins that control a myriad of signaling pathways [
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The multiple functions of PHBs are regulated not only by phosphorylation at different positions by Akt, Cam kinase IV, Aurora A, protein kinase C (PKC), Lyn and insulin receptor, but also by 
 <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation, palmitoylation, tyrosine nitrosylation and sulfatation, transamidation, arginine deamination and 
 <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modifications. These post-translational modifications position PHBs in various cellular compartments and also regulate the interaction with their protein partners. PHBs are found in mitochondria, the endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisomes, the cytosol, the nucleus and the plasma membrane [
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In the plasma membrane, PHBs are involved in cell-cell communication, the immune response, the activation of signaling kinases such as C-RAF or IKK, and also in the viral entry of DENV 2, hepatitis C virus (HCV), CHIKV and EV71.
