<p>In addition to the manual annotation of tweets for thematic detection already described, we also visualized all relevant labelled signal tweets to exact longitude and latitude geocoordinates (n = 260) on a geospatial map of the State of Indiana (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0235150.g003">Fig 3</xref>) using ArcGIS Map. Based on the geographic distribution of this data, the majority of tweets were located in areas of higher population density (e.g. Indianapolis), though in all, tweets were detected in 46 of the 92 counties in the state. Scott County (population: 23,000), the location of the HIV outbreak, had only 4 relevant tweets, 3 of which were located in Scottsburg (population: 6,700).
