<p>From the initial 10 million geocoded tweets available for this study, our data filtering and unsupervised machine learning methodology using BTM yielded a total of 1,350 tweets from Indiana that included keywords related to HIV (n = 487), heroin (n = 592), injection drug use (271), and opioids (505), detected during the pre and post period of the 2015 HIV outbreak that we believed to be user-generated signal tweets. Human annotation of this filtered dataset confirmed a total of 358 tweets made by individual users from Indiana that were deemed relevant to the 2015 Indiana HIV outbreak. Of these 358 tweets, 41.9% (n = 150) were associated with HIV, 37.2% (n = 133) were associated with heroin IDU, and 20.9% (n = 75) were associated with opioid use disorder. In total, 32.7% (n = 117) of the relevant tweets in the dataset were in the pre period of the outbreak, while 67.3% (n = 241) tweets were in the post period (see
