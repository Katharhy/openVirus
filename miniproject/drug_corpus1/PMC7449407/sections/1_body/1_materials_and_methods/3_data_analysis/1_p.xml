<p>In order to achieve maximum automation of the data filtering process for study-related tweets, the application of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) is an effective strategy to characterize messages that are unstructured and “free” (i.e. that have not been curated or labelled). Since we did not have a training set to classify messages related to our study aims, we employed an unsupervised machine learning approach designed to detect patterns in the data and summarize the content of the entire tweet corpus into distinct topics. Furthermore, this allowed us to identify and exclude non-behavioral tweets (e.g. news reports, bot traffic, advertisements, etc.) from our final results dataset. These topic modeling strategies are particularly suited for sorting short text into prevalent themes. We utilized the Biterm Topic Model (BTM), that identifies patterns in short texts and that has been used in prior studies examining substance abuse-related topics [
