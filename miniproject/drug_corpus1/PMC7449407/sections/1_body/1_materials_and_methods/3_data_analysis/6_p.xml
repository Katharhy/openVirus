<p>A subset of context-level topics which we believed were relevant to HIV, opioids, or injection drug use behavior were then extracted and analyzed qualitatively by human coders to characterize specific messages. Two human coders (first and second author), informed by a code book designed for this study, manually annotated the filtered subset of tweets generated from BTM themes. First and second author coded posts independently and achieved high intercoder reliability for results (kappa = 0.94). For inconsistent results, both the authors met and reviewed the posts together with the last author and decided on the correct classification of the post.</p>
