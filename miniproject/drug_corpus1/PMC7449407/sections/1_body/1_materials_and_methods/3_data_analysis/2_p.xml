<p>BTM is a topic clustering method that generates similar text into the same set of topics. Before using BTM, data was cleaned with only the text content from each tweet extracted, with links, numbers, special characters, and stop words removed. The resulting text for each filtered keyword was then categorized into topic clusters using BTM. We split all text into a bag of words and then used BTM to produce a discrete probability distribution for all words for each theme with the distribution placing a larger weight on words that are most representative of a given theme [
