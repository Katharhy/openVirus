<p>When manually annotating tweets detected after BTM, we used a coding protocol that focused on isolating tweets originating from human users discussing knowledge, attitudes and behaviors on the three topics, and excluding tweets that were news, other media content or non-drug uses of phrases (i.e. when a drug slang term was used for non-drug related messages). We also removed retweets of news or media articles that originated from individual users. Though the content of news articles can be relevant to public perception and sentiment regarding the outbreak, they do not describe self-reported user behavior or direct observations of second-hand behavior, and hence were excluded. We then iteratively coded the tweets for prevailing themes relevant to the three major topics of HIV, injection drug use, and opioids. Sub-themes detected in these parent categories included: diversion, prevention, usage, treatment, specific mention of drug use, public opinion and sentiment, and political reaction.</p>
