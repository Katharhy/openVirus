<p>Our study has certain limitations. First this study was limited to geolocated Twitter data and we did not purposely sample accounts or weight for user characteristics such as age, gender, or other demographics. Hence, our study results are not generalizable and are not representative of the Twitter user community or Indiana residents. Additionally, the volume of geocoded tweets relative to non-geocoded tweets is relatively low (reported at approximately 1% of the full amount of Twitter content). Hence, it is likely that our filtering for geocoded tweets failed to capture the majority of conversations from users in Indiana, even though it would be equally hard to accurately identify if these tweets were from Indiana users without them being geocoded. Future studies should not only rely on geocoded data, but also examine user metadata and mentions of locations in the text of the tweet or the user account information. We also did not interact with users of verify if they were actually engaged in opioid use disorder, injection drug use, or confirm their self-reporting of HIV risk behavior or status. Given this limitation, we cannot say with certainty that tweets detected regarding user statement of behavior are factual. However, validating the truthfulness of self-reported responses has similar limitations in other survey instruments.</p>
