<p>Our study design identified behavioral tweets reporting heroin injection drug use, opioid use, and HIV status, and also identified themes that are relevant to past and future prevention and health promotion efforts for HIV. Specifically, tweets we identified in our “prevention” theme illustrate that certain users expressed motivation to use prevention methods (e.g. safe sex practices, PrEP, HIV testing) and we also detected conversations circulating in impacted communities that may have both motivated or detracted those in the priority population from seeking proper HIV prevention options. Despite finding tweets related to HIV risk awareness, there were also tweets spreading misinformation about HIV transmission in afflicted communities, which could have potentially impacted vulnerable populations from seeking treatment interventions.</p>
