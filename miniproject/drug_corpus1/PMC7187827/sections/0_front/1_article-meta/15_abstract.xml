  <title>Background</title>
  <p>Mobile phones have become an integral part of modern society. As possible breeding grounds for microbial organisms, these constitute a potential global public health risk for microbial transmission.</p>

 <sec>
  <title>Objective</title>
  <p>Scoping review of literature examining microbial's presence on mobile phones in both health care (HC) and community settings.</p>

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>A search (PubMed&amp;GoogleScholar) was conducted from January 2005–December 2019 to identify English language studies. Studies were included if samples from mobile phones were tested for bacteria, fungi, and/or viruses; and if the sampling was carried out in any HC setting, and/or within the general community. Any other studies exploring mobile phones that did not identify specific microorganisms were excluded.</p>

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>A total of 56 studies were included (from 24 countries). Most studies identified the presence of bacteria (54/56), while 16 studies reported the presence of fungi. One study focused solely on RNA viruses. 
   <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and Coagulase-Negative Staphylococci were the most numerous identified organisms present on mobile phones. These two species and 
   <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> were present in over a third of studies both in HC and community samples. Methicillin-resistant 
   <italic>S. aureus, Acinetobacter</italic> sp., and 
   <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. were present in over a third of the studies in HC settings.

  <title>Conclusions</title>
  <p>While this scoping review of literature regarding microbial identification on mobile phones in HC and community settings did not directly address the issue of SARS-CoV-2 responsible for COVID-19, this work exposes the possible role of mobile phones as a ‘Trojan horse’ contributing to the transmission of microbial infections in epidemics and pandemics.</p>
