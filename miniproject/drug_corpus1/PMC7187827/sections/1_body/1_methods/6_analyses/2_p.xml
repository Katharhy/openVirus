<p id="p0115">We performed a qualitative analysis of the study characteristics and compiled the quantitative data for all studies included in this review to achieve a synthesis of the last 15 years of identification of microorganisms on mobile phones. Selected articles used in this systematic review were checked for their content by two additional co-authors (MC and AB) for quality control and quality assurance to prevent mistakes of information used in this review. Such quality assessment involved re-opening every publication and checking all input values listed in the review tables and so for every microbial species and asserting that results of each publication are complete.</p>
