<p id="p0080">We searched PubMed and Google Scholar for studies that identified and evaluated microorganism populations on mobile phones/smartphones within the health care setting and the general community (non-health care setting). The PubMed database was chosen in order to select for biomedical journals and publications, whilst Google Scholar was chosen to identify free-text articles that would normally be unidentified from the PubMed search. Associated citations and references were manually investigated to identify additional studies of relevance. The last search for the review was performed on 12 December 2019.</p>
