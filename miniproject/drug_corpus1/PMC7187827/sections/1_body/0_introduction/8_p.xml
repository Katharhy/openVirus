Zhao and his team used an Environmental Infection Transmission System (EITS) model to evaluate interactions of fomite characteristics in addition to human behaviours that affect transmission routes. The study demonstrated that regularly touched large surfaces, including public benches and tables, have the highest transmission potential. A 2019 systematic review demonstrated that all surfaces in an aircraft interior (tray tables, armrests, seat covers, door knobs and toilet flush buttons) served as fomites with all harbouring a spectrum of potentially hazardous microbial entities including viruses, posing concerns of biothreat risks for public health [
