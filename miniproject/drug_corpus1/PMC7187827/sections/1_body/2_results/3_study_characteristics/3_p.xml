 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> provides a qualitative overview of the studies included here. Ten studies were comparative between two or more population groups; 47 studies sampled the population of Heath Care Workers, and 18 studies sampled the population in the general community. The terminology of target organisms in the studies was mixed. Some studies targeted identification of ‘microorganisms’ or ‘pathogens’ or ‘microbial flora’ but only reported bacteria. It is unknown whether an attempt was made to detect other types or organisms. All but two publications (54 out of 56) targeted or reported on bacteria isolates; however, in multiple cases, only ‘clinically important’ or ‘pathogenic’ bacteria were presented in the results. One article focused solely on 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species, 5 articles targeted fungi as well as bacteria, and another 10 articles reported on fungi despite targeting only bacteria. One article focused solely on viral RNA (
