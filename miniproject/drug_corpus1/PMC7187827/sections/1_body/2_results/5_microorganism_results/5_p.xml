<p id="p0175">In the community, two other organisms were detected with a frequency greater than 5% (relative to swabs taken and methodologies utlised): 
 <italic>Micrococcus</italic> sp. (148 isolates in 2815 swabs), and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermis</italic> (218/2815). 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (114 isolates, 4.0%), and 
 <italic>Candida glabrata</italic> (132 isolates, 4.7%), as well as other 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species and fungi in general were not the target, or even reported in most of the studies, and a large proportion of these results arises from a single publication [
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. It is, therefore, assumed that 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species are likely to be more commonly detected on mobile phones than is reported here.
