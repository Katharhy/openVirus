<p id="p0185">In terms of prevalence in relation to studies, we have highlighted the species or taxonomic units that were present in more than a quarter of the studies from each population target (community and health care). Seven organisms appeared in more than a quarter of studies in both groups (
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp., CoNS, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus,</italic> and Methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>). An additional four organisms were found in more than a quarter of studies in the health care setting only (
