<p id="p0180">In the health care setting, only one other taxonomic unit is present at a rate higher than 5% of isolates relative to swabs: or Methicillin-sensitive 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MSSA) (316 isolates from 5895 swabs). Antibiotic sensitivity and resistance were not tested in all publications, so it is assumed that this value is under-reported.
