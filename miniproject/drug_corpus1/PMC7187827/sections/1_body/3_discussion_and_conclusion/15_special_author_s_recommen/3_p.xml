<p id="p0260">We hypothesise that the currently spreading novel coronavirus COVID-19 is present on mobile phones (and other devices and other fomites) owned by humans positive to the virus. Unlike hands, these devices are not regularly washed, and since they are neglected from a biosecurity perspective, they can act as Trojan horses and propagate undesirable invisible pathogens including viruses such as the flu and SARS-CoV-2. It is hoped that this paper will raise awareness to authorities and the scientific community alike to consider this hypothesis seriously, and to develop and implement protocols to assist in mitigating the risk of spreading microbes, such as viruses, in both healthcare, passenger air/sea travels, and the community at large.</p>
