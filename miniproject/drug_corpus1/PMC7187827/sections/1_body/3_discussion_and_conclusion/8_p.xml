<p id="p0220">When comparing the microbiome profiles between the community and health care settings, some microorganisms appeared more frequently in health care settings. One example is MRSA, which was present in almost double the proportion of studies in health care settings (detected in 51.1% of studies), compared to community settings (27.8%). In health care settings, the presence of MRSA on the surface of phones is concerning as the nature of the microbes found on such fomites may have detrimental roles in nosocomial diseases and spread of undesirable micro-organisms to immune-compromised individuals. Additionally, it is important to highlight that such devices are rarely subject to decontamination while being commonly used in hospitals, clinics and other health care related settings. First line medical staff fighting actively working as part of the COVID-19 pandemic response have been routinely exposed and contaminated with SARS-CoV2 virus. COVID-19 pandemic images broadcasted worldwide through different forms of media have regularly shown examples of hospital staff with personal protective equipment holding and using their mobile phones (with and without) gloves on. It is our opinion and hypothesis, that mobile phones are most likely contributing to the spread of SARS-CoV2 within different professional settings including hospitals and may play a significant role in viral propagation within the community.</p>
