<p id="p0190">This review has provided a comprehensive, worldwide analysis of publications that explored the presence of microorganisms on mobile phones. The average contamination rate of mobile phones, as calculated here, is 68%. It is important to note that this is likely an under-representation of the real values, as most studies reviewed here aimed to identify only bacteria, and because the identification methodologies used relied on growth of the organisms in media and their subsequent identification. The possibilities for under-representation are three: most studies target only one phylum of organisms; not all organisms can be cultivated; and the identification of microorganisms by traditional techniques is likely to be under-representative (for example, reaching only genus level of identification). We believe that with the advance of improved sequencing methodologies (such as next-generation sequencing), new studies can provide better insights into the identification of microorganisms present on mobile phones (manuscript in preparation).</p>
