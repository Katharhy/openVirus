<p id="para40">Hospitals in some high-income countries have not had enough ventilators to support their critically ill patients. In Venezuela, we know of health-care workers nationwide who are concerned about disproportionate difficulties in providing ventilator assistance for patients with COVID-19. By Feb 26, 2020, there were only 102 ventilators across all 23 states and the capital district; half of these were located in hospitals in the capital Caracas, and the other half were unevenly distributed across the rest of the country.

 </xref> It is clear that the demand for beds and ventilators in hospitals across Venezuela will quickly exceed capacity for patients with COVID-19. Tragically, the decline of the industrial and construction sectors and the depletion of resources will affect Venezuela's ability to undertake temporary construction or increase hospital capacities.
