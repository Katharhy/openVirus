<p>According to the pandemic, COVID-19 is a life-threatening infectious disease, especially in immunocompromised individuals. The main symptoms of this respiratory disease are fever, cough and fatigue. The primary source of these infections is not yet known, but the disease can be transmitted through droplets and close contact. After several months of the spread of this dangerous virus, there are still no specific drugs and definitive treatments for the virus. Definitive and timely diagnosis of this disease and isolating patients can be helpful in treating patients and preventing the spread of the disease. The onset and progression of COVID-19 depend on the interaction between the virus and the immune system. Therefore, the best way to control this disease is disruption of the transmission route, using decoction and vitamins to strengthen the immune system and using drugs to control the progression of the disease. Following recommendations of WHO should be a priority for everyone.</p>
