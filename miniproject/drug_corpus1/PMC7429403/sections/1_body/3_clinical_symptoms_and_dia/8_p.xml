<p>The commonly used nucleic acid diagnosis technique for this disease is real-time semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The authoritative identification approach for SARS-CoV-2 is virus blood culture and high-throughput whole genome sequencing. Nonetheless, the use of high-throughput sequencing technology in clinical diagnosis is limited due to high price and equipment dependency.
