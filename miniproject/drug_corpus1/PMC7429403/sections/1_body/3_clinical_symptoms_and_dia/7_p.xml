<p>Among four structural proteins (S, M, E, and N) in the coronavirus family, S and M proteins seem to contain antigenic sites for the development of serological tests for COVID-19 detection. Serological tests have focused on detecting serum antibodies for S proteins of the coronavirus spike. S proteins are determined with the S gene and are functionally divided into S1 and S2 subunits. Another protein that seems to be a significant antigenic site for the development of serological tests for COVID-19 detection is the N protein, which is a structural constituent of the helical nucleocapsid.
