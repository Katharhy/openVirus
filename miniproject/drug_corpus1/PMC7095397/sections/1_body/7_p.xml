<p id="Par9">It is time to reshape our conception of mutations. Mutations are not indicative of outlandish and devastating new viral characteristics. Instead, they can inform our understanding of emerging outbreaks. Any claims over the consequences of mutation demand careful experimental and epidemiological evidence. Mutation is an inevitable consequence of being a virus. The pattern and time course of mutations in a virus genome are key for estimating phylogenetic trees, which, in turn, depict the course epidemics in effectively real time

 </sup>. The developing field of genomic epidemiology is currently being employed in the mitigation and control of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. The rapid and open access deposition of virus genomes, most of which differ by mutation, is enabling precise investigations into patterns of spread. To this end, websites like
