<p id="Par4">Unlike science fiction, however, the dramatization of virus mutation is not innocuous, and we need only look to other recent outbreaks to realize the extent to which overinterpreting the impact of mutation directly affects our health and safety. For example, a mutation in the Zika virus membrane region (prM-S139N) emerged in a viral lineage preceding the devastating epidemic in the Americas. Both in vitro and mouse studies suggested that this mutation enhanced neurovirulence

When Zika was detected in India in 2018, these false claims motivated the Indian government to develop policies under the incorrect assumption that the emergent virus could not cause foetal harm, citing the absence of the ‘microcephaly mutation’ to defend their decisions
