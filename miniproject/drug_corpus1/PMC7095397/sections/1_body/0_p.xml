<p id="Par2">The meaning of the word ‘mutation’ in the vernacular does not reflect the complexities of evolutionary theory. In science fiction, to ‘mutate’ is to undergo a significant transformation. Characters in 
 <italic>Marvel Comics</italic>, for example, possess incredible new abilities due to mutation. In the entertainment industry, the dramatization of evolution to portray disease outbreaks is a common trope. In Michael Crichton’s 
 <italic>The Andromeda Strain</italic>, an extraterrestrial microorganism continuously ‘mutates’ to acquire new biological properties, including the ability to degrade plastic and escape containment. The exaggerated book 
 <italic>The Hot Zone</italic> inspired the 1995 thriller film 
 <italic>Outbreak</italic>, in which a fictional Ebola-like virus rapidly mutates into a highly infectious strain capable of aerosolized transmission. Given the accessibility and mass appeal of these works, it is unsurprising that, during a real-life outbreak, journalists and scientists are sometimes predisposed to draw upon these fictional views.
