<p id="Par5">In this case and that of SARS-CoV-2, mutations consume the narrative, even though individual mutations seldom become fixed during outbreaks nor modulate complex virological traits. Rather, mutation is a humdrum aspect of life for an RNA virus. Because these viruses employ an intrinsically error-prone RNA polymerase for replication, their genomes will accumulate mutations during every copying cycle. Moreover, these cycles can occur on the order of hours, ensuring that a diverse virus population will be generated within a single infected host. While this amazing capacity to mutate fuels the engine of evolutionary change, most mutations adversely impact some aspect of virus function and are removed by natural selection. Hence, although a mutation that changes how a virus is transmitted or its virulence may readily appear in a virus population, it will not spread to high frequencies unless it is selectively advantageous. At the same time, epidemiologically relevant traits like the viral mode of transmission and virulence can be controlled by multiple genes. As such, they are likely beholden to stringent evolutionary constraints because they require multiple mutations to evolve. Indeed, across a broad swathe of viruses it is unusual to find those that have changed or expanded their mode of transmission over short evolutionary time-scales despite high rates of mutation

 </sup>. Together, these constraints beget uncertainty around what characteristics are favoured by natural selection and how quickly they will spread in a population.
