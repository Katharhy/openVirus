<p id="p0015">A 55-year-old man with a medical history of peripheral artery disease was admitted to our hospital for cough and febrile dyspnea with suspected COVID-19. The polymerase chain reaction was positive, and the computed tomography scan demonstrated bilateral crazy paving. Forty-eight h after admission, he complained of chest pain. His 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrated inverted T waves in the inferior leads. Hs-TnI was at 355 ng/l, then 570 ng/l 3 h later (normal values &lt;7 ng/l). Transthoracic echocardiography showed a left ventricular ejection fraction at 60% without wall motion abnormalities, no diastolic dysfunction, and a mild mitral regurgitation. Coronary angiogram performed via radial approach demonstrated a chronic total occlusion of the posterior descending artery with epicardial collateral from the left anterior descending artery (Rentrop 3) (

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed in the right coronary artery and confirmed the spontaneous dissecting coronary hematoma with an intimal rupture (
