<p id="p0020">Coronary artery dissection may be related to intraplaque hemorrhage resulting in an intra-adventitial hematoma, spreading longitudinally along the coronary artery, dissecting the tunicae (

Lessons from the previous coronavirus and influenza epidemics suggest that viral infections can trigger acute coronary syndrome primarily owing to a combination of a significant systemic inflammatory response plus localized vascular inflammation at the arterial plaque level (

In this pandemic period, almost all the physicians’ attention is captured by the symptoms of COVID-19. This report shows that true acute coronary syndrome can occur in this setting and should be appropriately characterized. Whether specific mechanisms are triggered by this virus requires further scrutiny.
