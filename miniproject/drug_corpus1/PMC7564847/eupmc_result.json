    "Recently, several viruses have emerged or reemerged from obscurity to become serious global health threats, raising alarm regarding their sustained epidemic transmission. One of the main public health concerns of these emerging viruses is their sustained circulation among populations of immunologically na√Øve, susceptible hosts. With every new viral emergence or reemergence, comes the call for rapid vaccine development and the induction of protective immunity through vaccination can be a powerful tool to prevent this concern by conferring protection to the population at risk. Vaccines are considered a critical component of disease prevention against emerging viral infections because, in many cases, other medical options are limited or nonexistent. While the classic approaches to vaccine development are still amenable to emerging viruses, the advent of latest technologies in molecular techniques has profoundly influenced our understanding of virus biology, and immune responses and vaccination methods based on replicating, attenuated, and nonreplicating virus vector approaches have become useful vaccine platforms. Together with a growing understanding in the biology of newly emerging virus diseases, a range of new vaccine strategies, vaccines against new and reemerging viruses may become a possibility."
