<p id="p0025">In those using opioids chronically or misusing opioids, where immune depression and a propensity to respiratory depression is likely, COVID-19 infection may be all the more deadly. At the time of writing I am not aware of any published clinical data to support this prediction, although Shanthanna and colleagues

 </xref> suggest that patients with chronic pain taking opioids might be more susceptible to COVID-19. Individuals who are opioid dependent also present with a range of additional co-morbidities, social deprivation, and homelessness. Whilst not suggesting these are a direct consequence of opioid misuse, they may be linked and combining to a major public health issue. With respect to COVID-19 protection, the UK Government defines a category of clinically vulnerable people where those with ‘mild to moderate respiratory disease’ and those with a ‘weakened immune system as the result of certain conditions or medicines they are taking’ are advised to take extra care.

 <italic>Surely those using chronic opioids therapeutically or those misusing opioids should be included in the clinically vulnerable group</italic>?
