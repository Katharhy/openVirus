 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">2020b</xref>). The new emerging disease was first identified in humans in 2012 and interested mainly the Kingdom of South Arabia with the majority of reported cases (Zaki

 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In comparison to SARS, MERS is still active and sporadic outbreaks have been reported until now. This respiratory disease is particularly severe, accounting for 2465 cases confirmed by laboratory analyses, with a fatal rate of 35% (de Wit

Interestingly, MERS-CoV- like viruses have been identified in different bat species suggesting that bats functioned as the source of this new human CoV as well. Furthermore it was demonstrated that MERS-CoV can infect bat cells by exploiting the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), the same receptor used to infect human cells (Raj

 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Indeed, the number of known CoVs harboured by bats identified in the field studies could increase in the next future.
