<p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) are important pathogens for humans and animals, usually associated to respiratory and gastro-intestinal infections. CoVs are spherical enveloped viruses with a diameter of 100–160 nm. Each particle contains a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome of 27–32 kb that interacts with the nucleoprotein. Viral envelope includes three different proteins: Membrane (M), Envelope (E) and Spike (S) proteins. M protein binds nucleocapsids and is involved in viral assembly and budding; E protein contributes to viral morphogenesis and release as well as to pathogenesis. Finally, S protein forms homotrimeric spikes that recognize the cellular receptor, thus allowing viral entry into target cells (Chen, Liu and Guo
