<p>Recently, Wang and co-workers reported that Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue prodrug initially developed for the treatment of Ebola and Marburg virus infection, and the anti-malarial drug chloroquine are effective to inhibit 2019-nCoV replication 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (Wang 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Finally, the development and use of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, as proposed in the case of SARS and MERS, could be envisioned for 2019-nCoV control as well (Kim 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Goo 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Many monoclonal antibodies neutralizing SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections have been identified, and some of them displayed a potent inhibitory effect in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. In fact, it has been shown that antibody administration fully protected mice from viral challenges (Jin 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Thus, as reported for Ebola virus, the use of monoclonal antibodies to treat severe CoVs infections could be a promising strategy (Jin 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
