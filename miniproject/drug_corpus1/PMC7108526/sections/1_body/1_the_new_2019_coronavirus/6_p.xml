<p>In addition and in parallel to a deep biological characterization, research is currently focused on the crucial aspect of developing effective prophylactic and/or therapeutic interventions to control infection and/or spreading of this novel CoV. So far, treatments adopted are based on previous experience with SARS, MERS or influenza virus. For instance, a combination of interferon-alpha and lopinavir/ritonavir is under evaluation as anti 2019-nCoV therapy. Lopinavir and Ritonavir are known anti-retroviral drug targeting protease of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, CoVs are characterized by a 3C-like protease (3CL) which differs from the aspartyl protease of HIV. As the HIV-1 protease inhibitors are structure-based designed drugs their efficacy on 2019-nCoV has to be proven. Although lopinavir/ritonavir have been adopted for the treatment of SARS, as they lack elements of specificity towards CoV protease, their efficacy is not expected to be sufficient to control viral infection.</p>
