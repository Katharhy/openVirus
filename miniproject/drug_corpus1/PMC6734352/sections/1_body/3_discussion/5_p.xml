<p id="Par33">It has been reported that due to increase in surface hydrophilicity, PEGylation leads to reduced cellular uptake of nanoparticles [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. On the other hand, influenza viruses carry out their transcription and replication entirely inside the cell [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Here, the question is that how the PEGylated ZnO nanoparticles can exert the higher antiviral activity than the bare ZnO nanoparticles? This obvious discrepancy can be rationalized by the explanation that PEGylation of nanoparticles using the severe mechanical ball milling in our study led to production of smaller particle size. It should be noted that smaller nanoparticles are more likely to be passively internalized by cells [
