<p id="Par19">MDCK-SIAT1 cells (5.0 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>) were seeded on sterile glass coverslips (Nunc, Denmark) in a 24-well plate and grown until 80–90% confluence. The media was discarded and the cells were incubated with 200 μL of 100 TCID50/mL H1N1 virus suspensions for 1 h at 35 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. The virus inocula were then discarded from the wells, and the cells were washed three times with PBS. The maximum non-cytotoxic concentrations of nanoparticles (75 and 200 μg/ml of ZnO-NPs and ZnO-PEG-NPs, respectively) suspended in serum-free DMEM supplemented with trypsin-TPCK, HEPES buffer, and BSA were then added to the wells and the plate was incubated at 35 °C with 5% CO2. The virus and cell controls were also included in this experiment. After 24 h, the cells were fixed with cold acetone (4 °C) for 20 min, and the fixed cells were overlaid with anti-influenza A monoclonal antibody (Chemicon-Millipore, USA), followed by incubation at 37 °C for 45 min. In the next step, the cells were washed three time with PBS, and were then overlaid with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated mouse anti-human antibody (Dako, Germany), followed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. Afterwards, the cells were washed three time with PBS and coverslips were mounted in slides with glycerol buffer. Ultimately, the cells were visualized under the Olympus BH2-RFCA fluorescence microscope (Tokyo, Japan).
