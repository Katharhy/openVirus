<p id="Par16">The confluent monolayer of MDCK-SIAT1 cells (2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) in all wells of a flat-bottomed 96-well microtiter plate were incubated with 100 μL of 100 TCID50/mL H1N1 virus suspensions for 1 h at 35 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. The virus inocula were then discarded from the wells, and the cells were washed three times with PBS for removing unattached viruses. Different non-cytotoxic concentrations of ZnO and ZnO-PEG nanoparticles suspended in infection medium were then added in triplicate to the wells and the plate further incubated for 48 h at 35 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. The virus control (virus + DMEM) and the cell control (uninfected cells in DMEM) were also included in this experiment. This assay was also carried out for oseltamivir and soluble polyethylene glycol.
