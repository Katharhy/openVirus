<p id="Par12">The cytotoxicity of nanoparticles was assessed by MTT assay. Briefly, MDCK-SIAT1 cells at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL were seeded in a flat-bottomed 96-well microtiter plate (SPL Life Science, South Korea), and were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. A range of concentrations from 25 to 225 μg/ml of nanoparticles was prepared using the cell culture medium and was added to the plate in triplicate. After 48 h, the treatments were removed, and 10 μL of MTT reagent and 100 μL RPMI (Bio-Idea, Iran) were added to each well and incubated for a further 4 h. The medium was then removed and 50 μL of DMSO solution was added to the wells. Finally, the plate was read at 550 nm by a microplate reader (Hiperion MPR 4+, Germany).
