<p id="Par15">The co-treatment assay was performed to evaluate the functions of nanoparticles in inhibiting viral binding. MDCK-SIAT1 cells were grown in a flat-bottomed 96-well microtiter plate at the density of 2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well. The media was removed from all wells and 100 μL of nanoparticles suspensions at their non-toxic concentrations and 100 μL of 100 TCID50/mL viral suspensions were added simultaneously to the cells in triplicated and incubated for 1 h at 35 °C. The virus and cell controls were also included in this assay. Following 1 h incubation, the solution on the cells was discarded and the cells were washed three times with PBS, and were overlaid with infection medium. The plate was incubated for an additional 48 h at 35 °C with 5% CO2.
