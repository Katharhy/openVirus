<p id="Par11">Influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1; PR8) was also obtained from the Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute, and propagated in MDCK-SIAT1 cells. For virus-stock preparation, MDCK-SIAT1 cell monolayer in 25-cm
 <sup>2</sup> flask (SPL Life Science, South Korea) was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Bio-Idea, Iran), and the cells were infected with the virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 for 1 h at 35 °C. Afterwards, the virus inoculum was removed and the cells were overlaid with infection medium containing serum-free DMEM, 2 μg/ml trypsin-TPCK (Merck, Germany), 25 mM HEPES buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), and 0.14% of bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich, USA), and the flask was then incubated at 35 °C for an additional 48 h. The virus-containing supernatants were harvested at 48 h post infection, clarified by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 10 min at 4°, and filtered by sterile syringe filter 0.22 μm (Millipore, Ireland). The virus was then aliquoted into sterile cryovials and stored frozen at − 80 °C until use. Virus was titrated using the tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) method according to the Reed and Muench formula [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and was used for the next in vitro experiments at the titer of 100 TCID50/mL.
