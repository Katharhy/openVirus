<p id="Par14">The confluent monolayer of MDCK-SIAT1 cells (2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) in a flat-bottomed 96-well microtiter plate were pre-incubated with different concentrations of ZnO and ZnO-PEG nanoparticles in non-toxic concentration ranges in triplicates for 3 h at 37 °C. The media containing nanoparticles was discarded from the wells, and the cells were washed three times with PBS and then incubated for 1 h at 35 °C with 100 TCID50/mL virus. Afterwards, the virus inocula were removed from the wells, and the cells were washed three times with PBS, and were then overlaid with infection medium. The plate was further incubated for 48 h at 35 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. The virus and cell controls were kept as described above.
