<p id="Par13">To evaluate direct effects of ZnO and ZnO-PEG nanoparticles on H1N1 influenza particles, equal volumes of the viral suspensions (100 TCID50/ml) and nanoparticles suspensions in non-toxic concentration ranges were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. The mixture (100 μL) was then added in triplicated wells of the confluent monolayer of MDCK-SIAT1 cells (2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) in a flat-bottomed 96-well microtiter plate and further incubated for 1 h at 35 °C. The virus control (infected but untreated) and cell control (uninfected untreated cells) were kept in each plate prepared throughout the experiment. After 1 h incubation, the mixture was discarded, and the cells were washed three times with PBS to remove non-absorbed viruses and overlaid with infection medium. The plate was then incubated for 48 h at 35 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.
