<p id="Par18">To determine influenza viral load, a quantitative system using Real-Time PCR assay was carried out. Total RNA was extracted from the supernatants using the AccuPrep® Viral RNA Extraction Kit (Bioneer, South Korea), based on manufacturer’s protocol. The extracted RNA was then subjected to reverse transcription using the cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Germany), according to manufacturer’s recommendations. Finally, quantitative Real-Time PCR was performed using the Genesig® Advanced kit (PrimerDesign Ltd., United Kingdom), according to manufacturer’s instructions. The kit contains primers and probe designed for detection of all influenza A subtypes. The assay was performed using the Rotor-Gene Q instrument (Qiagen, Germany) under the following conditions: 5 min activation of Taq DNA polymerase at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 10s at 95 °C and 60s at 60 °C.</p>
