<p id="Par27">The antiviral activities of ZnO-NPs and ZnO-PEG-NPs against H1N1 influenza virus were further confirmed by quantitative Real-Time PCR. It was observed that the antiviral activity was in a dose-dependent manner, so that the ZnO-PEG-NPs at the concentration of 25, 75, 100, and 200 μg/mL led to inhibition rates of 0.6, 78.2, 80.3, and 94.6%, respectively. The inhibition rates were calculated based on the influenza viral loads. It is obvious that the anti-influenza activity of ZnO-PEG-NPs is greater than that of ZnO-NPs. The maximum antiviral effect of ZnO-NPs was obtained at the concentration of 75 μg/mL with the inhibition rate of 52.2% (Fig.
