<p id="Par26">The striking finding of our study is that nanoparticles exert their antiviral effects only when added after viral infection of the cells, which could be resulted in a significant decrease in viral titer. Post-exposure of H1N1 influenza virus with PEGylated ZnO-NPs at the concentrations of 75, 100, and 200 μg/mL could be led to 2.2, 2.4, and 2.8 log10 TCID50 reduction in virus titer when compared to the virus control, respectively (

Moreover, the polyethylene glycol at its maximal non-cytotoxic concentration (200 μg/mL) could resulted in 0.7 log10 TCID50 reduction when compared to control (
