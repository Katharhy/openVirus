<p id="Par28">To study the inhibitory impact of nanoparticles on the expression of influenza virus antigens on the MDCK-SIAT1 cells surface, an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was performed. In this assay, we used the highest non-toxic concentration of ZnO-NPs and ZnO-PEG-NPs which showed the greatest antiviral effect in the previous experiments. In parallel, both negative and positive controls were also included. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> shows a substantial decrease in fluorescence emission intensity in influenza-infected cell treated with ZnO-PEG-NPs at the concentration of 200 μg/mL compared to the positive control, and with lower intensity in influenza-infected cell treated with ZnO-NPs at the concentration of 75 μg/mL.
