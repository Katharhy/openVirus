<p id="Par24">Cytotoxic effects of ZnO-NPs, ZnO-PEG-NPs, polyethylene glycol, and oseltamivir on MDCK-SIAT1 cells were determined using the MTT assay. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, polyethylene glycol and oseltamivir did not show significant cytotoxic effects toward MDCK-SIAT1 cells. The results obtained in the MTT assay revealed that the cytotoxicity of ZnO-PEG-NPs was significantly lower than that of ZnO-NPs, so that the viability was determined greater than 90% up to the concentration of 75 and 200 μg/mL of ZnO-NPs and ZnO-PEG-NPs, respectively.
