<p id="Par23">In addition, ICP-MS measurement confirmed the high purity level of ZnO-NPs. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the ZnO-NPs and ZnO-PEG-NPs is presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The ZnO-PEG-NPs showed a significant weight loss of 32.22% at a temperature of 400 °C, whereas the ZnO-NPs showed a small weight loss of 3.6% at the same temperature. This corresponds to loss of polyethylene glycol, which was coated on the surface of ZnO-NPs.
