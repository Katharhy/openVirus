<p id="Par21">The FE-SEM images of ZnO-NPs and ZnO-PEG-NPs are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The average diameters of ZnO-NPs ranged between 20 and 50 nm, whereas the ZnO-PEG-NPs were ranged from 16 to 20 nm. This reveals that PEGylation of ZnO-NPs by severe ball milling technique has led to a substantial decrease in the size of nanoparticles. The both nanoparticles were also spherical shaped and uniform. Surface coating of ZnO-NPs was also observed in Fig.
