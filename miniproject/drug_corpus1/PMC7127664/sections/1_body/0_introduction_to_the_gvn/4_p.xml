<p id="p0045">In addition to plenary lectures and workshops that were held at the SEV-GVN joint meeting, contributions in the format of short oral presentations were arranged to include a wide spectrum of issues addressed by member-scientists of GVN. Poster sessions allowed an interesting discussion among essentially younger scientists from Spanish laboratories and participants from other countries. With this perspective for the first time GVN established travel grants that consisted of partial financial help to encourage participation of younger members of GVN centers. In contrast to previous GVN meetings (4â€“5 oral presentations on related subjects in each block) sessions were arranged as a series of talks that covered a quite diverse repertoire of issues of interest to virologists around the world.</p>
