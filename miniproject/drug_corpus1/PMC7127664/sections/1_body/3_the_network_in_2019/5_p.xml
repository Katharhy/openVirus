<p id="p0350">The GVN is also working on the development of Regional GVN Chapters to shift towards a flexible, global organization. Although the GVN is headquartered in Baltimore, it is believed that GVN presence needs to be truly global and therefore each GVN center needs to meet specific geographic challenges found particularly in Southeast Asia, South America, and Africa. This year, GVN has established the Africa GVN Regional Unit, in a meeting co-Organized by Dr. Pontiano Kaleebu, Director, UVRI and Dr. Glenda Gray, President, MRC South Africa. The meeting took place in Entebbe, Uganda and helped delineate collaboration as well as plan for future joint training initiatives.</p>
