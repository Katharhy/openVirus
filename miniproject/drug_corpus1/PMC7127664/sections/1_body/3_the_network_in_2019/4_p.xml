<p id="p0345">The GVN is currently developing the “GVN Academy” initiative, which is an investment in a small group of outstanding mid-career virologists. For our pilot program, the idea is to match a selected number of outstanding early and mid-career from low- and-middle-income countries virology researchers with our senior leaders in the field to provide a series of mentoring and networking opportunities.</p>
