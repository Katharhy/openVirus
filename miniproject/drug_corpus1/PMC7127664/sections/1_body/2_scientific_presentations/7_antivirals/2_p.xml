 <bold>Johan Neyts</bold>, Rega Institute for Medical Research, University of Leuven, Belgium, started the session by giving an overview of the antiviral agents now available for the treatment of infections with HIV, HBV, HCV, influenza and RSV infections. Dr. Neyts pointed out that for many other viruses that cause life-threatening infections and many of which are considered emerging and/or neglected pathogens, there are no drugs available. He then described the robotized lab-in-a-box automated platformed in a BSL3+ environment for high-throughput screening now installed at the Rega institute.
