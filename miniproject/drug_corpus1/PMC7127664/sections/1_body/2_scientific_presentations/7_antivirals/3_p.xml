<p id="p0260">Dr. Neyts presented the current state of Rega Institute's development of potent antivirals against flaviviruses (such as dengue), alphaviruses (such as chikungunya) and enteroviruses as well as against noroviruses, the hepatitis E and the rabies virus. Several excellent molecular targets for the selective inhibition of viral replication (and that have remained largely unexplored) have been identified, such as the non-structural protein NS4B of flaviviruses, the capping machinery of alphaviruses and the 2C helicase of enteroviruses. The Rega Institute now has molecules that target the NSB4 of the dengue virus with pan-serotype antiviral activity in the low nM to pM range. Dr. Neyts also reported that the anti-flu compound Favipiravir (T705), also active against flavi-, arena-, bunya-, and filoviruses, protects mice from infection with chikungunya virus (CHIKV). A new class of CHIKV inhibitors, targeting viral capping active in the low microM range have now also been described (
