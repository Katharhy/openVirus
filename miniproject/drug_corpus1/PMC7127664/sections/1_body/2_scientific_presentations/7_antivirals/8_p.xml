<p id="p0285">Several mechanisms of selection of mutants resistant to antiviral agents have been identified including amino acid substitutions termed RAS (resistance-associated substitutions) at the viral protein targeted by the antiviral agent, and antiviral resistance mediated by high viral fitness, documented with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Both mechanisms affect standard inhibitors and mutagenic agents active in lethal mutagenesis (
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Perales et al., 2019</xref>). Intra-host selection of resistant mutants affects treatment efficacy and the choice of rescue treatments. Resistant mutants can acquire epidemiological relevance, therefore affecting step (ii) of virus evolution. Epidemiological dominance of resistant mutants may render ineffective the relevant antiviral agents, a problem with similarities to antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Possible approaches to minimize selection of escape mutants inspired in quasispecies dynamics will be suggested.
