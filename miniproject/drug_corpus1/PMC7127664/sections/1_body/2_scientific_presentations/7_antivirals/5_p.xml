 <bold>Raymond Schinazi</bold> of Emory University School of Medicine presented his recent efforts to develop HBV capsid effectors that may offer an option to aid in a combination therapy aimed at curing chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections. This virus affects over 250 million people globally and causes 686,000 deaths worldwide per year. HBV persists due to the formation of covalently-closed circular DNA (cccDNA) – the viral minichromosome – in the nucleus of hepatocytes, and current nucleoside analogs and interferon therapies have a low rate of cccDNA clearance and require lifelong treatment (

 <sub>50</sub> in the low nM range with a therapeutic index of &gt;10,000. In a humanized mouse model stably engrafted with human hepatocytes and infected with HBV, GLP-26 displayed a major effect on HBeAg secretion and HBsAg in addition to a promising pre-clinical profile. More interestingly, long term combination treatment with Entecavir (ETV) in this model induced a four 
 <sup>10</sup>log decrease in viral loads and viral antigens reductions that were sustained for up to 12 weeks after ceasing treatment. Dr. Schinazi also briefly describe the activity of novel norovirus protease inhibitors which were also interestingly effective against certain enteroviruses at nM levels. Enterovirus protease has some similarity with norovirus and coxsackievirus protease.
