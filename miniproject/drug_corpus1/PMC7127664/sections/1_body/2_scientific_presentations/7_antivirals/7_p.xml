 <bold>Esteban Domingo</bold>, Centro de Bilog√≠a Molecular Severo ochoa (CSIC-UAM), Spain, discussed the development of antiviral resistance. The evolution of viruses involves two major steps: (i) intra-host (short-term) and (ii) inter-host (long-term) evolution. Step (i) is influenced mainly by random genome variations and quasispecies dynamics, and its description is based on mutant spectrum analyses. Step (ii) is guided by the multifactorial epidemiological fitness and transmission-associated random drift of genomes, and its description is based on phylodynamic approaches (

 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Domingo and Perales, 2019</xref>). How events in step (i) influence events in step (ii) is an open question. Selection of mutants resistant to antiviral agents, one of the major problems in antiviral therapy, occurs at step (i) and its consequences are felt in steps (i) and (ii).
