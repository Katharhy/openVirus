<p id="p0265">As for entero/rhinoviruses, besides the target for capsid binders like pocapavir (
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Thibout et al., 2012</xref>), the researchers at the Rega Institute have found a novel druggable pocket formed by the viral proteins VP1 and VP2 in the virus capsid and have now identified analogs targeting this pocket with broad spectrum activity (

 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2019</xref>). A lead compound in the series (MADAL385) prevented binding and internalization of the virus but did not, unlike classical capsid binders, stabilize the particle. Dr. Neyts stated that also potent inhibitors of the enterovirus virus helicase are under way. Other viruses for which antiviral substances are tested for at the Rega Institute include diarrhea causing viruses like human norovirus (for which zebra fish larvae has been found to be a replication model) and rota virus, rabies virus, and hepatitis E virus.
