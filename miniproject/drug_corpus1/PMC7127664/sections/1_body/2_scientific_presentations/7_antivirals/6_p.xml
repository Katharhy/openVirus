 <bold>María Jesús Pérez Pérez</bold>, Instituto de Química Médica (IQM) Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC), Spain argued that antiviral drug development has particular characteristics when compared to other therapeutic fields in drug discovery. As an example, it is indicated that phenotypic screening is still one of the main strategies do identify novel classes of antiviral agents while for other therapeutic areas target-based or fragment-based screening has often become more relevant (

Once a hit with antiviral properties has been identified, its optimization to become a lead is a multiparameter process, that can also be determined by the mechanism of action of the compound. Dr. Pérez Pérez’ group's own experience in triazolopyrimidines as inhibitors of CHIKV replication was presented to illustrate how proactive and collaborative efforts among academic groups can lead to the identification and optimization of antivirals exploring a new mechanism of action (
