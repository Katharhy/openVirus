 <bold>Leo Poon</bold>, (The University of Hong Kong), reviewed the emerging influenza viruses like H5NX and H7N9 circulating in southeastern China. These viruses continue to reassort with different avian influenza viruses and spread to other geographical locations via wild birds. Dr. Poon reported on a study of 96 low pathogenic avian influenza virus genomes detected from wild bird samples collected from 2010 to 2017. Their phylogeographic analysis indicated several independent trans-regional reassortment events during the period. All of these reassorted viruses acquired at least one segment from avian influenza viruses found in North/South America.
