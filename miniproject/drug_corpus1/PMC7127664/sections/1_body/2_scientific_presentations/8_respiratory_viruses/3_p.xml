 <bold>Yungmee Jee</bold> (National Institute of Health, South Korea) reported on the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreaks in 2015 and 2018 in South Korea. She emphasized the lessons learned from their experience, which were as follows: A single, missed case may trigger a huge, nationwide outbreak. The first line of defense is not the thermal scanner at the airport, but doctors in the community clinics/hospitals. Superspreading events may occur in healthcare settings, especially at the emergency department. Early detection and isolation are critically important. Aggressive strategy for quarantine maybe necessary, especially when a large number of individuals are exposed in the health-care settings.
