 <bold>Enric Mateu</bold> (Department de Sanitat I Anatoia Animals, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Spain), described the virulence of and immunity against Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) as two sides of the same problem. He emphasized that the genetic basis for the differences in virulence is multigenic and is related to (i) the damage caused by the virus, (ii) the damage caused by the immune response of the pig and, (iii) the interaction of the virus with the functionality of the immune system. Neutralizing antibodies, cell-mediated immunity, ability or disability to induce type I interferon from macrophage and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, make the complexity of the disease outcome.
