<p id="p0325">Basic research was represented by the work of 
 <bold>Dr. Heinz Ellerbrok</bold> (Robert Koch Institut, Berlin, Germany) who developed new three-dimensional cell culture infection models based on a biological extracellular matrix (decellularized equine pericardium) with primary human keratinocytes (

Using these models for studying antiviral susceptibility in cowpox virus infection, Ellerbrok and colleagues showed that the inhibitory potency of host-directed epidermal growth factor receptor-blocking molecules such as gefitinib and cetuximab was considerably higher in three-dimensional cell culture models than in conventional two-dimensional models, suggesting that the classical monolayer cell cultures could underestimate the potential inhibitory effect of an undetermined number of antiviral drugs.
