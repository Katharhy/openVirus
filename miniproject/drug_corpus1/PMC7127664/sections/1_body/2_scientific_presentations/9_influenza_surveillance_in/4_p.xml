<p id="p0315">Two studies on virus evolution were presented by Drs. 
 <bold>Dieter Hoffmann</bold> (Technische Universität München, Munich, Germany) and 
 <bold>Richard Scheuermann</bold> (J Craig Venter Institute, La Jolla, USA). 
 <bold>Dr. Hoffmann</bold> and colleagues studied norovirus evolution in chronically infected patients using next-generation sequencing. They had previously shown that norovirus capsid gene sequences evolved quickly and accumulated non-synonymous mutations reflecting positive selection (

Interestingly, Dr. Hoffman's group has now reported that in infected individuals, progression of the infection associates with increased concentrations of capsid-specific antibodies.
