<p id="p0320">The presentation by 
 <bold>Dr. Scheuermann</bold> concentrated on enterovirus evolution. An enterovirus (EV) D68 outbreak in the summer of 2014 coincided with a spike in the number of cases of polio-like acute flaccid myelitis/paralysis (AFM). Subsequent outbreaks in 2016 and 2018 raised concerns about the possibility of EV D68 being a new public health threat. Comparative genomics analysis showed the emergence of new EV D68 lineages in recent years. Cell culture and animal studies revealed that these emerging viruses have acquired the ability to infect and kill neuronal cells (
