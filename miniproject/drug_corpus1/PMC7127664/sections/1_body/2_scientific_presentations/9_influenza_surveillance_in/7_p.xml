 <bold>Dr. Luis Menéndez-Arias</bold> (Centro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa, Madrid, Spain) presented new data on how HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) connection subdomain mutations and non-nucleoside RT inhibitors modulate polypurine tract (PPT) removal during initiation of plus-strand DNA synthesis (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Betancor et al., 2015</xref>). Using different HIV-1 and HIV-2 RT variants, this study showed that major determinants defining the correct cleavage site at the PPT/U3 junction of the HIV genome reside at the connection subdomain between positions 342–351. These observations together with the fact that nevirapine, doravirine and efavirenz alter the efficiency of the PPT/U3 cleavage and impair the initiation of (+)-strand DNA synthesis, suggest that this step of reverse transcription could become a specific target for antiretroviral intervention.
