 <bold>Dr. Shyam Kottilil</bold> (Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland, Baltimore, USA) presented their impressive efforts in monitoring hepatitis B virus (HBV) in Western districts of Arunachal Pradesh (India). As part of this GVN-lead program, researchers interviewed &gt;11,800 patients and collected &gt;11,500 samples for HBV testing. They found high HBV seroprevalences in most of the studied communities (4.8â€“12.9%), particularly in the Nyishi and Miji tribes. An interesting observation was the abundance of C/D recombinant genotypes, which had been previously found only in the neighboring Tibet, probably a consequence of migration across the Chinese border.
