 <bold>Dr. Richard Njouom</bold> (Centre Pasteur of Cameroon, Yaounde, Cameroon) showed data of influenza surveillance in Cameroon for the last 10 years. Although influenza virus strains circulate in the country all year round, larger prevalences were observed in the rainy season, with a major peak between September and December. Both types of influenza (A and B) were detected every year, although the A (H3N2) strain was the most prevalent when all data were considered. Unfortunately, the surveillance system revealed that in many seasons, the influenza vaccine compositions available were not a good match for the types and subtypes that circulated in Cameroon.
