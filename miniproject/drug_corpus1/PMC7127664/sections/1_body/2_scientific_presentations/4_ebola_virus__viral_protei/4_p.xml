 <bold>Kariem Ezzat</bold> from Stockholm University presented tantalizing data on the role of viral protein corona in viral pathogenesis and amyloid aggregation. Viruses rely on the intracellular host machinery for replication, production of viral proteins and assembly. However, outside cells, viruses share many biophysical properties with nanoparticles. Based on these features, viruses have the capacity to accumulate a host-derived protein corona layer in extracellular environments similar to nanoparticles. To evaluate this possibility and its implications, protein corona layers of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) in different biological fluids such as human plasma and bronchioalveolar lavage fluid were analyzed using proteomics, electron microscopy, infectivity, and dendritic cell activation assays. It was found that RSV and HSV-1 accumulate rich protein corona layers that are unique for each biological fluid and corona pre-coating differentially affects viral infectivity and immune cell activation. In addition, like nanoparticles, viruses should be able to function as nano-surface catalysts that enable accelerated extracellular amyloid protein aggregation.
