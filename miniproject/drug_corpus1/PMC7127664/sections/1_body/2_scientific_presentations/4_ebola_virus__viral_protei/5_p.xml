 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Ezzat et al., (2019)</xref> showed that unlike the viral genome coded surface proteins, the viral protein corona is an acquired structural layer that is dependent on the viral microenvironment resulting in different viral identities based on the target tissue and the target organism. Additionally, the viral corona-driven heterogeneous nucleation of amyloids illustrates convergence between viral and amyloid pathologies suggesting a direct physical mechanistic link that warrants further investigation.
