 <bold>Richard Zhao</bold> from the University of Maryland presented data on the virologic differences in severity between historical and epidemic Zika virus-mediated infection and neurocytotoxicity. The 2015 Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in the Americas have had a severe impact as it in Brazil alone left &gt;3000 babies with ZIKV-associated neurological disorders (ZAND) including microcephaly. Even though the causal relationship between the ZIKV and ZAND have been confirmed, the reasons why the ZIKV suddenly became so pathogenic and caused ZAND in humans remain largely unknown. To help answer this question, the virologic differences and the underlying molecular mechanisms between the representative historical African MR766 ZIKV strain and the epidemic Brazilian BR15 ZIKV strain were examined. Glioma SNB-19â€¯cell line and 3-D neurospheres were used to evaluate both primary and chimeric viruses. Notable differences were found between strains with regard to viral attachment, permissiveness and replication, as well as, the induction of neurocytopathic effects in host neuronal cells.
