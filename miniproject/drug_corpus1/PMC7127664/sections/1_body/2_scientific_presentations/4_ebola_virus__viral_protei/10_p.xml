 <bold>Ramesh Akkina</bold> from Colorado State University reported on the ZIKV mediated pathology on human hematopoietic cells. While many previous studies have focused on ZIKV viral effects on the CNS, few have explored the viral effects on the human immune and hematopoietic system. Dr. Akkina presented both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies conducted on human cells. 
 <italic>In vivo</italic> studies involved humanized mice (hu-mice) that harbor a transplanted human immune system. These mice generate human T cells, B cells, NK cells, monocytes and macrophages, as well as, dendritic cells that orchestrate both humoral and cellular immune responses and thus are ideal models to examine viral effects and interactions with human immune cells (
