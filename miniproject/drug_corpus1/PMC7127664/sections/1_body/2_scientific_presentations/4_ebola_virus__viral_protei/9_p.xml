<p id="p0170">Chimeric virus analyses suggested that the ZIKV E protein correlates with the viral attachment, and the C-prM region contributes to the permissiveness and ZIKV-induced cytopathic effects. Furthermore, the prM protein and its cleaved Pr product, but not the mature M protein, induces apoptotic cell death in the SNB-19â€¯cells. The Pr region, which resides on the N-terminal side of prM protein, is responsible for prM-induced apoptotic cell death. Mutational analysis further identified four amino-acid residues that have an impact on the ability of prM to induce apoptosis. These findings suggest that functions of the structural prM-E proteins contribute in part to the difference in ZIKV-mediated viral pathogenicity between the historic and epidemic strains. Ongoing studies are likely to identify the role of other viral proteins with regard to neuropathogenesis.</p>
