<p id="p0185">Currently several murine models of ZIKV neuropathogenesis exist. Since standard mice are not susceptible to ZIKV, mostly IFN deficient mice that lack an innate immune system and thus permitting ready viral infection are used. A significant drawback with these models is that viral infection leads to rapid fatalities, which is not a common feature with ZIKA. In the studies presented BALB/c RAG2−/−γc−/− mice (also known as BRG mice) with intact IFN pathway were used. Neonatal mice when exposed to ZIKV developed severe microcephaly and other important CZS features such as eye deformations and stunted growth. This model is likely to be useful as an experimental neonatal ZIKV infection model. With regard to human cell infections, these findings highlighted the utility of hu-mice as valuable human surrogate experimental system to directly assess ZIKV effects on these cells
