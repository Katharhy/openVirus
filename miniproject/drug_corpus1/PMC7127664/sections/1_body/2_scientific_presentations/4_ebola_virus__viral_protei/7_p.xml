 <bold>Ken Olson</bold> from Colorado State University reviewed the RNAi and arbovirus interactions. Such infections in 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> allows transmission of yellow fever, dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses throughout the mosquito's lifetime. The mechanisms of viral persistence in mosquitoes, which involves the production of virus RNA-derived siRNAs and piRNAs, are not well understood. The RNA interference pathways involve double stranded RNAs that degrade target RNAs and mediate gene regulation. In his studies, siRNA and piRNA product depletion, small RNA sequencing, piRNA product expression profiles, immunoprecipitation, and arbovirus assays were used to dissect the viral and host-cell interactions. It was found that the Piwi-family protein Piwi4 has antiviral activity in 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> Aag2 cells and in mosquitoes infected with arboviruses and insect-specific flaviviruses. Although these RNA viruses encode no reverse transcriptase, circular episomal DNA in arbovirus-infected 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> cells consisting of hybrid sequences of arbovirus-derived cDNA (vDNA) and retrotransposable elements were found. These episomal DNAs appear to be acquired during reverse-transcription by a discriminatory process of vDNA recombination with retrotransposons. Transcripts from vDNA may serve as precursors for antiviral vpiRNAs. Integrated viral-derived (vDNA) can also be detected in the mosquito genome as endogenous viral elements (EVEs) that are often associated with piRNA clusters in the mosquito genome. EVEs are transcribed to produce piRNAs that associate preferentially with Piwi4. Importantly, EVE-derived piRNAs can inhibit the replication of a cognate virus. These findings suggest that the 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> Piwi family of proteins and episomal vDNA, and EVEs provide a means of moderating viral load in mosquito cells and a potential mechanism for transgenerational virus tolerance in the mosquito.
