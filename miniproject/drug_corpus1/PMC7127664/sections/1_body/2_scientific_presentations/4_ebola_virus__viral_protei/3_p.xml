 <bold>Sara Lenderas Bueno</bold> from the Scripps Research Institute explained that several of these proteins are multifunctional in the viral cycle, and some of these are also multi-structural, adopting different forms at different times to mediate different, essential functions. Using crystallography, electron microscopy and biochemistry, it was found that two essential proteins in infection; the nucleoprotein NP and the matrix protein VP40 display different conformations. NP is involved in viral nucleocapsid formation and facilitates viral transcription and replication. To avoid premature self-polymerization and non-productive binding to cellular RNAs, NP is chaperoned by the viral phosphoprotein VP35. NP complexing with the amino-terminal portion of VP35 was delineated at 2.3 Å resolution and electron microscopy indicated the importance of this binding interaction to control NP polymerization. Structure-directed mutagenesis studies identified conserved critical residues in the NP-VP35 interface which could be targeted by broadly effective antivirals. With regard to the matrix protein VP40, another multi-structural protein, it rearranges into three alternative structures, each with its corresponding function at different stages of the life cycle. How these structural changes are triggered has remained unclear. New data revealed that the binding of the VP40 dimer to specific nucleotide sequences is enough to form the octameric structure/form responsible for regulation of viral RNA replication. These findings provide the molecular basis for the multifunctionality of these proteins and reveal attractive targets for therapeutic intervention.
