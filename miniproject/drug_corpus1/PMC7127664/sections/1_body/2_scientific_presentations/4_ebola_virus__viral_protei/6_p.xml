 <bold>Ana Isabel Nunez</bold> from IRTA-CReSA, Barcelona, Spain, discussed novel findings on mosquito molecular responses to arbovirus infection, particularly related to Rift Valley fever phlebovirus (RVFV) and 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic>. In the literature, the 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>-Dengue virus (DENV) combination is the most studied in terms of gene expression. However, there is a general paucity of information on mosquito genes involved in vector competence and immune responses with regard to other important vector-virus interactions. RVFV causes an emerging significant public health zoonotic disease which is commonly transmitted mainly by the Culex and Aedes genus mosquitoes. In her talk, molecular responses of 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> to RVFV infection were presented, particularly those related to genes implicated in the innate immunity pathways (Toll, IMD, JAK/STAT) and RNAi. A total of 445 differentially expressed genes (DEG) were identified. The gene expression profiles varied at different days post infection. A total of 445 DEG were found wherein 42 DEG were immune function related. Among these genes, some are involved in innate immunity pathways; Cactus or Defensin-A in the Toll pathway or Piwi4 and Drosha in the RNAi pathway. Specifically, three immune pathways Toll, IMD and RNAi and apoptosis were affected by RVFV infection. Conversely, JAK/STAT pathway seems not to be involved in 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> response to RVFV. Toll and Imd pathways are suppressed after infectious blood feeding, for example AMP (Defensin-A) was down-regulated. The RNAi pathway was mainly down-regulated in the course of the RVFV infection. All these immune system responses would allow the establishment of the RVFV infection in 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> mosquitoes. These results form a basis for future in depth studies to better understand the functionality of immune related DEG in relation to vector competence to develop new strategies for vector control programs.
