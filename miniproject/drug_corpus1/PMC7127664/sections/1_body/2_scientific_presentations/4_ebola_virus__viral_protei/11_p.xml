<p id="p0180">In studies presented at the meeting, further investigations were carried out on the ZIKV infection on human B cells 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> to determine any adverse effects such as cell death or cell dysfunction, as well as, viral persistence. Viral exposure of mature naïve B cells resulted in the loss of one subset and aberrant proliferation of another. Upregulation of markers indicative of B cell progression into the plasmablast stage was seen in the expanding subset. 
 <italic>In vivo</italic>, results from ZIKV infected hu-mice showed the presence of ZIKV + B cells in the periphery during acute infection and later in bone marrow during the chronic stage. It was also found that CD34 
 <sup>+</sup> HSC were susceptible to ZIKV infection 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and could be detected in the bone marrow of infected hu-mice. B cell loss can lead to delayed viral clearance, whereas aberrant B cell activation may have implications in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as Guillain-Barré syndrome. Infection of CD34 
 <sup>+</sup> HSC has implications for hematopoietic cell differentiation and viral persistence.
