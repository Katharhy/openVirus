 <bold>Elena García Sánchez</bold> (Center of Molecular Biology “Severo Ochoa”, Madrid, Spain) reported an outbreak of African swine fever (ASF) affecting wild boars and domestic pigs that started in the Caucasus in 2007 and spread across Russia and Eastern Europe. This more recent geographic expansion of ASF further increases the threat to the global swine industry (

Dr. García Sánchez presented information on genes involved in immune evasion and those hypothetically involved in attenuation of virulence of the genotype I parental ASFV NH/P68. Based on the information obtained, the research team generated putative live attenuated vaccines (LAV) prototypes by constructing recombinant NH/P68 viruses lacking specific genes and containing markers for DIVA tests (

A bottleneck for the production of live attenuated virus vaccines has been the lack of permanent cell lines able to sustain productive virus infection. In the studies presented, porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) were used to propagate the viruses. The results showed that naturally attenuated ASFV NH/P68 strain induced full protection against both homologous (genotype I) Lisbon 60 (L60) and heterologous (genotype II) Armenia07 virulent strains. The recombinant viruses carrying specific deletions were all fully protective against parental homologous (genotype I) Lisbon 60 (L60) strain but only slightly protective against the heterologous (genotype II) circulating Armenia07 strain. More studies are required to assess the basis for the lack of heterologous protection of the recombinant vaccine strain, which could be related to the cell line used to produce the vaccine (
