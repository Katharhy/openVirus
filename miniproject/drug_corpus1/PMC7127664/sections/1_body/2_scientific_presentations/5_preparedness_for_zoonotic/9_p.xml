These seniors were randomized to receive an alum-adjuvanted recombinant HepB vaccine, either subcutaneous (SC) or intramuscular (IM) injection, with the inoculum site guided by Computerized Tomography (CT) imaging. The immunological response, expressed as anti-HBs antibody titers at day 210, demonstrated that volunteers who received their vaccinations IM were over three-times more likely to be responders to the HBV vaccine than volunteers receiving SC vaccinations (54% versus 16%, P = 0.004) (

The low seroconversion rate even in the IM group showed a progressive decline with increasing age of the cohort and was associated with significantly lower IgG2 and IgG1 isotypes suggesting a marked shift in Th1 responses. Moreover, the percentage of seniors that showed T-cell mediated responses was significantly reduced and also lower in intensity compared to young adults (

These data show qualitative and quantitative deficits in B and T cell responses to alum adjuvanted protein antigens, even in strictly healthy elderly cohorts (
