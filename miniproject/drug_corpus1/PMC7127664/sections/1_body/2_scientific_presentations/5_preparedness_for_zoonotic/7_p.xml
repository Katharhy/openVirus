 <bold>Wendy K. Jo</bold> (RIZ, TiHo, Hannover, Germany) described a new flavivirus (genus 
 <italic>Pestivirus)</italic> detected in a toothed whales from the North Sea harbor porpoise 
 <italic>Phocoena phocoena</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Tautz et al., 2015</xref>). High-throughput data obtained by using next generation sequencing (NGS) and analyzed using an 
 <italic>in-house</italic> metagenomics pipeline, followed by 
 <italic>de novo</italic> assembly and phylogenetic analyses, allowed the identification of a novel pestivirus in two out of three investigated harbor porpoises. The complete genome of 11,880 bp, were reconstructed by 
 <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of sequence reads, and confirmed by Sanger sequencing of the full-length genome. Alignment of the complete genomes of pestivirus species showed that the newly identified virus is evolutionary closest to porcine LINDA virus and porcine Bungowannah virus with 60% homology at the amino acid level. 
 <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization showed strong granular staining in the cytoplasm of multiple cell types. Based on the new sequence information RT-PCR screening of samples from more than 100 stranded harbor porpoises, collected from the North Sea indicated that about 9% of these animals were positive for the novel pestivirus. The identification of a novel pestivirus in harbor porpoises suggests that the host spectrum of pestiviruses extends to members of the order Cetacea (whales, dolphins, and porpoises), which are considered to have evolved from artiodactyls (even-toed ungulates) (
