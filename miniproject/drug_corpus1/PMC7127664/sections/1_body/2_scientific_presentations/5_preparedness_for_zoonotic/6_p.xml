<p id="p0210">Dromedaries are the natural reservoir, but alpacas have also been reported as potential hosts for MERS-CoV (
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2014</xref>). Since handling dromedary camels is not an easy option, especially under biocointantment conditions, and based on preliminary data showing that alpacas is a valuable model to study early MERS-CoV infection events, the Catalan scientists set out to develop an 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> model derived from the latter animals. Dr. Rodon described the isolation of respiratory tissues to assess the early local immune events elicited upon infection. Isolated nasal mucosa and tracheal explants were maintained 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and infected with MERS-CoV/Qatar 2015. Samples obtained at different times from 0 to 96â€¯h post-inoculation were used to quantify viral RNA by RT-qPCR, detect virus antigen localization by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and to isolate virus. This work indicated that nasal mucosa and tracheal explants from alpaca are suitable 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> models to study MERS-CoV replication and molecular mechanisms leading to viral infection and/or virus clearance. The researchers hope to further develop the system to explore antiviral therapeutic approaches (
