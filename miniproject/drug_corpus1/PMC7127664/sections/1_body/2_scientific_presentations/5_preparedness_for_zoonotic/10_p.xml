Clinical research during epidemics is crucial to build an urgent response and, yet, requires thoughtful oversight by research ethics committees to ensure the protection of vulnerable subjects facing health uncertainties. To appropriately address the regulatory aspect should be cultivated in anticipation of epidemics and pandemics, rather than in response to them (

The University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) institutional review board (IRB) response during the 2014–2015 Ebola epidemic provided an example of research ethics review under a rapid response model. This IRB provided rapid review of multiple protocols during the epidemic, typically with 24 h or less from submission to approval. Since then, UNMC has been developing a centralized IRB for two national networks, both focused on public health emergency research with a vision of establishing a rapid response resource for these networks (
