 <bold>NÃºria Busquets</bold> (Centre de Recerca en Sanitat Animal, Spain) highlighted the importance of arboviruses as pathogens and focused on the surveillance of vectors and animal reservoirs. She gave a short overview on the emergence of arboviruses which over the last 40 years has become an important global public health threat causing significant morbidity and mortality among humans and animals. While for Chikungunya, Dengue, and Zika virus carrying mosquitos easily can spread also other arboviruses, e.g. Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV), and West Nile virus (WNV), there is a critical role for vertebrate hosts as animal reservoirs.
