 <bold>Marion Koopmans</bold> (Erasmus MC, Netherlands) elaborated in her presentation on the complex interplay between man-made disturbances of ecosystems and the resulting increase in number and amplitude of emerging viral disease outbreaks. She presented several examples to underline how changes in environmental conditions and in human behavior can create conditions that result in an increase of pathogen transmission, spill-over to new hosts, broad dissemination of infection, and changes in viral properties. The recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa and the ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo illustrate how demographical and political changes can affect spreading of diseases.
