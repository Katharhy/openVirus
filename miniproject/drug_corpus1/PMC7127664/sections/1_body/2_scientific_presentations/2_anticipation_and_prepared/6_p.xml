<p id="p0080">Dr. Busquets stressed that good surveillance data are the base for intervention strategies thus helping to protect public health and to save money. Thus, detailed knowledge on which mosquitoe species are competent hosts for the virus and where and when these mosquitoes are present, as well as, on which the vertebrate hosts are the reservoir and their presence are important. So is the knowledge on the kinetics of infection, viremia and virus shedding, the immune response and last but not least good, reliable, and rapid diagnostic tools. She pointed out that virus circulation in vectors and in animal reservoirs precedes human exposure and infection. During an arbovirus outbreak in humans, clinical signs might only be detected when the peak of an outbreak has already been passed. However, virus circulation in vectors and the animal reservoir will precede human infections (
