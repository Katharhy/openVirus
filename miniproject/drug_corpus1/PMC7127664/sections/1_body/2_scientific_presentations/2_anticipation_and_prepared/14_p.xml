<p id="p0120">Shifting the burden of disease detection from clinicians to early detection and forecasting of spillover through surveillance of reservoir hosts would mean a paradigm change in the surveillance of emerging infectious diseases from reactive to pro-active measures. Early detection allows timely control and thus mitigates the number of human cases (
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Karesh et al., 2012</xref>). Matching these surveillance data with data on demographic development, global travel and trade, and climate change might allow to predict potential international spread of pathogens. The utility of such approaches will very much depend on a switch from the detection of single pathogens to an “open view” surveillance with multiplex assays, broad antibody profiling, metagenomics approaches, and an efficient way of data sharing.
