 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Weaver et al., 2016</xref>) the task force, which was supported by a private donation, established the GVN ZIKV Serum Bank. This serum bank collected and characterized more the 100 sera from donors who had been exposed in different countries all across South and Latin America. They made this collection of highly characterized sera available to international expert labs by providing lyophilized aliquots. They further provided a collection of ZIKV strains, different virus antigens, and two cDNA infectious clones.
