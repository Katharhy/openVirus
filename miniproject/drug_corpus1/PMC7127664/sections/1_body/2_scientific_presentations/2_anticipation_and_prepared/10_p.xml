<p id="p0100">While the cellular receptor for HTLV-1 is ubiquitous (
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Manel et al., 2003</xref>) the provirus is mainly detected in CD4
 <sup>+</sup> effector/memory T cells 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, it was not clear if HTLV-1 preferentially infects these cells or if infected precursor cells differentiate into these cells. Analyzing tax expression as a marker for viral replication in STLV-1 infected Japanese macaques as a model for HTLV-1 infection in humans, Matsouka and colleagues showed that elevated tax expression is mainly seen in the bone marrow suggesting 
 <italic>de novo</italic> infection of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Further, in HAM/TSP patients they detected identical integration sites of HTLV-1 proviruses in neutrophils, monocytes, B cells CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells and CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells indicating that these cells are all derived from HTLV-1 infected HSCs
