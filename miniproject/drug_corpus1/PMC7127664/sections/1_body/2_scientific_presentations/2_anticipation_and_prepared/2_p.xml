 <bold>Scott C Weaver</bold> (University of Texas Medical Branch Galveston, USA) gave an overview on the history and the distribution of Zika virus (ZIKV). He summarized the recent epidemic of ZIKV in the Americas and depicted the association between ZIKV and microcephaly that was established late in 2015. He then illustrated the reaction of GVN with the assembly of a global Zika Task Force that was established within three months after the association between ZIKV infection and microcephaly was recognized. This task force gathered experts on flaviviruses, arboviruses, and viral congenital diseases from 13 GVN centers from 13 countries.
