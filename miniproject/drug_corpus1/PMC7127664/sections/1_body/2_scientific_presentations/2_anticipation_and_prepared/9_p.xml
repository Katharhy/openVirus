 <bold>Masao Matsouka</bold> (Kumamoto University, Japan) gave a detailed insight into aspects of the strategy and pathogenesis of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). In his presentation he focused on two viral proteins, the transactivator of viral gene expression (Tax) and the HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ). HTLV-1 is the causal agent of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) in adults. It has close relatives in several non-human primates and is an important human pathogen with a global distribution of infection foci and an estimated 10 million people are infected (

HTLV-1 is transmitted only through cell-to-cell contact passing the virus from mother to infant through breast milk and from male to female through semen. Therefore, living infected cells are essential for transmission and in order to enhance transmission the virus increases the number of infected cells.
