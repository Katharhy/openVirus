<p id="p0105">While Tax has an important role in the upregulation of anti-apoptotic genes and the maintenance of cell populations it is only expressed transiently, most likely because the Tax protein is highly immunogenic and a major target for CTL. In leukemic cells Tax is expressed only in a minor fraction of the cells and only for a short period of time (

HBZ is encoded on the antisense strand of the provirus and has a low immunogenicity. In contrast to Tax it is expressed constantly in all ATL cells. HBZ regulates several different pathways in infected cells, enable immune escape, trigger inflammation through the induction of IFNg expression, and enable the infection to overcome immune suppressive effects. HBZ also induces expression of the chemokine receptor CCR4 allowing infiltration of infected T-cells into tissues. Seen that HTLV-1 is transmitted through cell-to-cell contact he suggested that HBZ-induced CCR4 expression enables HTLV-1 infected cells to migrate into breast milk and into semen, thus allowing efficient transmission of the virus between humans.
