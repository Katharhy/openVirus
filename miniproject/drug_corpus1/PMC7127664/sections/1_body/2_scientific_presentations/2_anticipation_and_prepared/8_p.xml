In both cases dead bird surveillance and identification of equine infections was an important for WNV surveillance as an early warning system. Dr. Busquets concluded that arbovirus surveillance provides a realistic picture of the epidemiological situation and allows for monitoring the effectiveness of intervention measures. Surveillance in vectors and in vertebrate hosts enables detection of arbovirus circulation before clinical onset in humans. However, countries need to adapt their surveillance scheme to their epidemiological situation, surveillance objectives and capacities. Effective early warning requires the interaction between multiple disciplines like entomologist, veterinarians, biologists, clinicians, epidemiologists, etc.
