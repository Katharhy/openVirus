<p id="p0250">Availability of adequate resources in ‘peacetime’ was another hot topic, since investment in a preventive and preparedness scenario should be done in preparation for emerging infections, and not ‘when the house is on fire’. Unfortunately, both at national and the international levels, current reality shows a generally reactive rather than proactive willingness to invest in preventive and preparedness scenarios. The title of the roundtable (“One Health: fact or fiction?”) was intentionally provocative. The impact of deadly infectious diseases is far different when comparing developed and developing countries, which further emphasizes the lack of a global, coordinated and effective agenda on One Health. Interestingly, the concept One Health has been highlighted regularly in the scientific literature (more than 1800 peer-reviewed articles), but only few manuscripts propose methodologies to measure the true impact of the implementation of this concept. Moreover, only few suggested quantitative indicators to follow, but no common methodology proved to be available (
