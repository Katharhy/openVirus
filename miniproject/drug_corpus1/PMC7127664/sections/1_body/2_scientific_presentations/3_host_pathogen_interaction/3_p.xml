<p id="p0130">Infection by mosquito-borne viruses has increased over the past few decades due to globalization, increase in societal mobility and climate change. 
 <bold>Juana Diez</bold> from the Universitat Pompeu Fabra in the lovely host city of Barcelona continued the session by exploring how viruses such as Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are able to express their genomes at high levels in cells from diverse species. The four bases of the genetic code create 64 codons, of which 61 are translated into 20 amino acids and 3 are stop codons. Synonymous codons differ principally at the third base or wobble position. Different species, including mosquitoes and humans, vary widely in which codons are used for protein translation. Dr. Diaz and her team integrated subcellular fractionation and transcriptome-wide analyses of translation in human cells, to show that CHIKV infection induces a host adaptation to viral codon usage into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the preferred site of CHIKV protein expression. The tRNA modification enzyme methyltransferase 9 (KIAA1456) methylates uridine in the wobble position and enhances speed of translation of certain mRNAs, including CHIKV mRNAs. KIAA1456 mRNA is translationally activated up to 40-fold by CHIKV infection. Overexpression of KIAA1456 increases CHIKV replication and KIAA1456 mRNA silencing decreases replication. These findings demonstrate an unexpected interplay of viruses with the host tRNA epitranscriptome that favors viral protein expression. This mechanism appears to be conserved among viruses that replicate effectively in more than a single host species, which opens the intriguing possibility of future exploitation of a broad-spectrum antiviral target.
