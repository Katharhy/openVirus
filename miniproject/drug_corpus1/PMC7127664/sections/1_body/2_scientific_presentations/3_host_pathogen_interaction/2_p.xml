 <bold>Thomas Rasmussen</bold>, a Senior Researcher at the National Veterinary Institute of Virology in Australia, presented an update on the potential use of latency-reversing agents (LRAs) for HIV elimination. The great success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV Infection is tempered by the fact that treatment must be maintained for life. Rasmussen reviewed work showing that HIV can remain in a latent state where the immune system or ART cannot eliminate the virus. Rebound viremia occurs when ART is stopped even in individuals with no detectable virus in cells or plasma. An experimental approach to clear latent HIV and thus cure HIV infection has been dubbed “shock and kill.” LRAs are used to activate latent HIV allowing the reactivated cells to be targeted and killed by ART and/or the immune system. Administration of LRAs alone have thus far not demonstrated an effect on the frequency of latently infected cells or the time to virus rebound following interruption of ART (“shock, no kill”). For example, in the DIORR trial (
 <underline>D</underline>olutegravir 
 <underline>I</underline>ntensification Effect 
 <underline>O</underline>n 
 <underline>R</underline>esidual virus 
 <underline>R</underline>eplication on ART) lead by Rasmussen there was no change in levels of HIV DNA or RNA. Negative results where mechanisms for failure are carefully examined are important because they can demonstrate which strategies will not work and provide guidance to strategies that do work. Elimination of latently infected cells (particularly those that are long-lived) may require HIV-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell effector functions similar to those of so-called elite controllers of HIV-1 infection. Various strategies to boost anti-HIV immunity currently under development including therapeutic vaccines, toll-like receptor agonists, broadly neutralizing antibodies, immune checkpoint inhibitors, interferon-α and interleukin therapy should be investigated. Immune checkpoint blockade could also play a role in developing an HIV cure by re-invigorating exhausted T cells and potentially reversing HIV latency in CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells.
