<p>A number of studies in the available literature suggest an association between pre-existing CVD and severe COVID-19 (

Analysis of an outpatient and inpatient cohort of 1099 patients with COVID-19 identified that patients who had severe disease were likely to have an increased rate of any coexisting disorders (38.7% vs. 21.0%), DM (16.2% vs. 5.7%), HT (23.7% vs. 13.4%), CAD (5.8% vs. 1.8%), and cerebrovascular disease (2.3% vs. 1.2%) [

Increased case fatality rates in the previously referenced analysis of 44,672 confirmed COVID-19 cases from Wuhan, China were noted in patients with CVD (10.5%), DM (7.3%), and HT (6.0%), all remarkably higher than the overall case fatality rate of 2.3% [
