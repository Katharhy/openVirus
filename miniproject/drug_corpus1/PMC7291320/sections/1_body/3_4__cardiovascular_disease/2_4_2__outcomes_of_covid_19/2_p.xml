<p>Cardiovascular risk factors are increasingly recognized to overlap with pathways that regulate immune function. Aging is the strongest risk factor for CVD and its effect on the immune system [
 <xref rid="B45-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] may be crucial for the severity of COVID-19. Chronic diseases such as HT and DM also correspond with elevated risk of incident CVD and attenuate innate immune response [
 <xref rid="B12-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. For instance, metabolic disorders in DM patients may dysregulate immune function by impairing macrophage and lymphocyte function [

In sum, prevalent CVD may be a marker of accelerated immunologic aging/deregulation and relate indirectly to COVID-19. An increased rate of adverse CVD events following COVID-19 infection might also play a role in prognosis, similar to other viral infections, such as influenza [
