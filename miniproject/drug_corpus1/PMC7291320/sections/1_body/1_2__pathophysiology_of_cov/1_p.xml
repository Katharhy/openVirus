<p>Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses that are distributed broadly among humans and cause respiratory, hepatic, and neurologic disease [
 <xref rid="B10-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Until recently, six different coronavirus strains were known to infect humans. Four viruses, 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1, are prevalent and typically cause common cold symptoms in immunocompetent individuals [
 <xref rid="B11-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The two other strains include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which are zoonotic in origin and have been linked to sometimes fatal illness [
 <xref rid="B11-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 was initially identified from the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019 [
 <xref rid="B10-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Like other members of the Coronaviridae family, SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus with a nonsegmented, single stranded, positive-sense RNA genome [

 <xref rid="B12-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The SARS-CoV-2 is less genetically similar to MERS-CoV (around 50% nucleotide identity), but has 88% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-like coronavirus and 79% with that human SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B13-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The virus is thought to spread mainly from human-to-human through respiratory droplets produced by an infected individual [
 <xref rid="B14-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2, as well as SARS-CoV, binds its viral spike (S) proteins to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) proteins for cell entry and uses the cellular serine protease transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) for S protein priming [

 <xref rid="B17-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. ACE2 is highly expressed in lung alveolar cells (principally type II alveolar cells) and serves a role in lung protection; therefore, viral binding to this receptor deregulates a lung protective pathway, contributing to viral pathogenicity [
