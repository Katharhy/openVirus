<p>Currently, no proven specific therapies are available for COVID-19, other than supportive care [

 <xref rid="B38-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Available evidence suggests that carefully selected patients with severe ARDS who do not benefit from conventional treatment might be successfully supported with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) [

 <xref rid="B39-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Nevertheless, careful patient selection for ECMO is needed because patient age and comorbidities appear to influence outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID-19. A large number of patients have received off-label and compassionate use therapies such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir-ritonavir, remdesivir, ribavirin, favipiravir, interferon, convalescent plasma, steroids, and anti-IL-6 inhibitors, based on either in vitro antiviral or anti-inflammatory properties [

However, caution should be taken because no clinical evidence currently supports the efficacy and safety of any drug against any coronavirus in humans, including SARS-CoV-2. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have been launched around the world, which may find optimal treatments for COVID-19.
