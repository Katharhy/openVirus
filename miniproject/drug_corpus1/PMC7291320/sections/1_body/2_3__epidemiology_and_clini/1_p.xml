 <xref rid="B2-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As of May 8th 2020, more than 3,900,000 cases have been reported positive for COVID-19, resulting in more than 272,000 deaths.

 <xref rid="B21-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and MERS-CoV (&lt;1) and similar to that of SARS-CoV (2 to 3) [
