<p>In sum, myocardial injury in COVID-19 appears common but various mechanisms seem to overlap in individual cases. Given the frequency and nonspecific nature of abnormal troponin results among patients with COVID-19, the American College of Cardiology states that “abnormal troponin should not be considered evidence for an acute myocardial infarction without corroborating evidence” [

Unfortunately, until now, no specific treatments have been recommended for acute myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19. However, it may be reasonable to triage patients with COVID-19 according to the presence of underlying CVD and the evidence of myocardial injury for prioritized treatment and even more aggressive treatment strategies.
