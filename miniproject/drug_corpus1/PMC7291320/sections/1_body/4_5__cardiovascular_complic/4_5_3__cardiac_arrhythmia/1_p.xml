<p>High influenza activity has been reported to increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmia [
 <xref rid="B68-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. In a study of 121 SARS patients, tachycardia was the most common finding (72%), and other complications were hypotension (50%), bradycardia (15%), and transient paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in only one patient [

In hospitalized COVID-19 patients, cardiac arrhythmia was reported in 16.7% of 138 patients and was more common in ICU patients compared to non-ICU patients (44.4% vs. 6.9%) [

A recent cohort study reported by Guo et al. described that higher incidence of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation was observed in patients with myocardial injury than those without myocardial injury, suggesting a strong relationship between cardiac involvement and arrhythmia in patients with COVID-19 [
