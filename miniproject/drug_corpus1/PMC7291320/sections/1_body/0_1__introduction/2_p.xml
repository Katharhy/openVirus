<p>SARS-CoV-2 can cause multiple system infections in various animals and mainly respiratory tract infections in humans, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [
 <xref rid="B3-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The majority of patients have mild symptoms, but some patients progress rapidly with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and shock, which are followed by multiple organ failure (MOF). Although the typical symptoms in the early stage are fever, fatigue, cough, and muscle ache [
 <xref rid="B3-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], COVID-19 often enters the differential diagnosis of dyspnea at rest and chest pain, which requires engagement of cardiovascular (CV) specialists [

 <xref rid="B6-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Moreover, COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been reported to be at high risk of adverse outcomes; and infection, itself, is associated with CV complications [
 <xref rid="B7-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Remarkably, recent retrospective studies have demonstrated that acute myocardial injury is a common condition among patients with COVID-19 and is associated with disease severity and mortality [
 <xref rid="B8-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Finally, several therapeutics for COVID-19 have the potential for adverse CV side-effects and interactions with CV medications. This review was therefore performed to characterize the epidemiology, clinical features, the direct and indirect impact of COVID-19 on CV systems, and the potential interaction of current available therapies with CV medications and their CV toxicities.
