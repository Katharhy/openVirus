<p>The first randomized control trial using the combination protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir, which has been used in HIV, failed to show significant reduction in 28-day mortality or diminish throat viral RNA detectability compared to standard care [

 <xref rid="B104-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. In a recent single-arm study including 53 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, improvement of oxygen-support status was observed in 68% of patients treated by remdesivir. Several ongoing randomized trials were designed to test this drug on moderate and severe COVID-19 patients (NCT04257656, NCT04252664, NCT04292899, NCT04292730). Chloroquine, which has been used as an antimalarial agent, blocks SARS-CoV-2 cell entry in vitro by increasing the endosomal pH required for virus/cell fusion [

 <xref rid="B105-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Patients treated with hydroxychloroquine showed a significant reduction in viral carriage by day 6 compared to the control group. Several larger size RCTs are planned to confirm the beneficial effects of this drug (NCT04325893, NCT04318444). Camostat mesylate, an inhibitor of the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2, can block the ACE2-dependent entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells [

Antiviral medications used for influenza (oseltamivir, arbidol, and favipiravir) have been applied, without clinical efficacy data available. Lastly, methylprednisolone is another drug under investigation (NCT04323592) that is currently being used to treat severe cases of COVID-19 that are complicated by ARDS [
