<p>It is noteworthy that several therapies have potential interaction with CV medications and CV toxicities. Lopinavir/ritonavir may prolong PR and QT interval, and caution should be taken in patients with underlying CVD including pre-existing conduction abnormalities or those taking other QT prolonging drugs [

 <sub>12</sub> inhibitors through CYP3A4 inhibition, which results in decreased serum concentrations of active metabolites of clopidogrel and prasugrel and increased serum concentration of ticagrelor. Cardiac side effects of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine are rarely reported, but in some cases can be severe and irreversible [

 <xref rid="B108-jcm-09-01407" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. It is thought to be due to the inhibition of lysosomal enzyme in the myocyte which leads to conduction abnormalities and cardiomyopathy [
