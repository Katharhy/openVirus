<p>Importantly, people with a weakened immune system or cardiorespiratory functioning are more likely to be infected with pathogens and develop complications. Accordingly, disproportionately high case-severity and case-fatality among elderly and individuals with pre-existing conditions, including cardiovascular disease, are observed among COVID-19 patients. This is also observed in relatively younger patients with co-morbid conditions or detrimental risk profiles â€“ population characteristics common in many low-income populations [

For example, age and comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, CVD) were consistently found to be independent significant predictors of adverse outcomes in viruses impacting the respiratory system such as SARS [

Consequently, the value of beneficial, healthy behaviours and lifestyle to improve immune functioning and lower adverse consequences of COVID-19 are increasingly being emphasized. Here we discuss seven key health behaviours that may assist in reducing unfavourable COVID-19 outcomes whilst having important co-beneficial impacts on non-communicable disease prevention (Figure
