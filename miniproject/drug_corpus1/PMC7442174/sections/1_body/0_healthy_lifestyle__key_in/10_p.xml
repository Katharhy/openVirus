<p>Although these recommendations could improve immune function and overall health, implementation faces challenges. First, behaviour has proven difficult to change, even after facing detrimental disease, and it is unclear whether COVID-19 concerns would suffice to motivate individuals to change behaviour [

To illustrate, people living in food deserts, with limited access to healthy foods, often have high caloric diets low in nutritional value. Poor urban planning (e.g., limited infrastructure compactness) and overcrowding can lead to lower means to do physical activity [

Fourth, prevention and treatment services have been severely disrupted. Hence, medication availability might be affected by lockdown measures and the concentration of healthcare systems on pandemic management, limiting medication adherence. Furthermore, many populations already have poor access to effective, equitable healthcare, including cardiometabolic medications. Finally, inequalities in economic, cultural, and social resources my shape inequalities in abilities to adapt health behaviours, having potential to exacerbate health inequalities [
