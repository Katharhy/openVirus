Therefore, while no direct evidence on sleep deprivation and the risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes currently exist, it seems reasonable that consistent, high-quality sleep may be immune-supportive. Recommendations include: 1) set a consistent sleep schedule by fixing the bedtime and wake-up times, 2) maintain good duration of sleep (7–8 hours/day), 3) avoid day-time naps which may affect night-time sleep, 4) open windows/blinds to ensure natural light exposure, which supports circadian rhythm, 5) reserve your bed for sleeping (do not ‘work-from-bed’), 6) limit the exposure to digital screens specially before sleep [
