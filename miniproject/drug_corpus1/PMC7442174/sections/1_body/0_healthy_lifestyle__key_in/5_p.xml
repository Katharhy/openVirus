 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and arginine is essential for nitric oxide generation by macrophages [

Additionally, some evidence suggests that nutritional supplements might be beneficial in preventing acute respiratory tract infections and adverse outcomes, including COVID-19. For example, it has been recommended for people at risk of influenza and/or COVID-19 to consider taking 10,000 IU/d of vitamin D
 <sub>3</sub> for a few weeks to raise 25(OH)D concentrations, followed by 5000 IU/d [

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, appropriate caution should be taken to avoid the potential risk of overdose, and natural food sources are preferred. Those at risk of malnutrition or those malnourished should take extra precautionary care, ideally assisted by a trained dietician [
