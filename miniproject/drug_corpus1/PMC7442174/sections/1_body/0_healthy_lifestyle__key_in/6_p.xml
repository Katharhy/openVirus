 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Acute exercise (moderate-to-vigorous, up to 60 min/day) is considered as important immunoregulator, supporting optimal exchanges of distinct, highly active immune cell subtypes between tissues and circulation [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Nevertheless, prolonged home-stays result in increased sedentary behaviour and lack of physical activity, leading to chronic health conditions, anxiety, and lower immunity. It is therefore advised to keep physically active, whilst following safety precautions. There is a plethora of ways to keep physically active. Examples recommended, but are not limited to, include: 1) using household chores to be active (e.g., cleaning tasks), 2) freehand exercises at home, 3) joining online exercise classes, 4) muscle-strengthening activities if feasible, and 5) indoor playground games for children [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A multicomponent exercise program (aerobic resistance, balance, coordination, and mobility training) is considered most adequate for older people [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It is imperative that all safety precautions and infection control measures should be followed when undertaking any form of physical exercise at or around the home [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For instance, the right activity should be chosen to maintain physical distancing, reduce the risk of injury, and exercise should be avoided if there is a symptom (e.g., fever, cough or breathing difficulty). Furthermore, public gyms or pools are best avoided.
