<p>The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a public health emergency of international concern with more than 17 million confirmed cases [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Without effective treatment or vaccines, strategies to control COVID-19 are focused on non-pharmaceutical interventions such as good hygiene practices and limiting person-to-person transmission. Whilst these measures contribute effectively in managing the pandemic, they will not prevent all individuals from becoming infected. This is particularly relevant as it is unclear for how long preventive measures can be maintained, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and as several countries may prematurely be easing restrictions triggering secondary peaks in COVID-19 cases. Thus, it is of importance to explore what individuals could do to mitigate adverse outcomes.
