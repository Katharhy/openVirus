<p>Another important factor which describes a diagnostic test is the analytical specificity. It is the ability of a test to detect a specific target, e.g., a virus. It is of great importance to check whether the starters used in PCR test are specific to a given virus. There are two components of analytical sensitivity: cross-reactivity and interference. Cross-reactivity may occur if, in a sample collected from a patient, there are organisms which are genetically related that imitate the virus analysed, which causes test starters to cross react. As shown in 
 <xref rid="diagnostics-10-00434-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, the producers have analysed their tests from the perspective of cross-reactivity; unfortunately, that analysis is selective and does not concern the same micro-organisms.
