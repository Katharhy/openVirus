<p>Real Time RT-qPCR genetic tests are meant for the identification and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 in the material/specimens collected from patients with COVID-19 symptoms, by detecting RNA sequences unique for SARS-CoV-2. The genetic material of the virus is extracted from specimens (sputum, tracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage, swabs from nasopharynx and pharynx, blood, urine, or stool) and amplified by means of the PCR technique in real time, with the use of reverse transcription (RT), and detected by means of fluorescent reporter probes specific to SARS-CoV-2 [
