<p>In accordance with WHO recommendations, RT-qPCR tests must enable the detection of three genes in a single reaction: 
 <italic>E</italic> gene, 
 <italic>N</italic> gene, and 
 <italic>RdRP</italic> gene. This allows us to detect viruses from the beta-coronavirus group (
 <italic>E</italic> gene), as well as to identify SARS-CoV-2 virus (
 <italic>N gene</italic> and 
 <italic>RdRP, ORF1ab</italic>). Such a design guarantees double confirmation in cases of infection, it also limits the risk of obtaining false negative results in case of detecting only one target for SARS-CoV-2. This reduces the possibility of obtaining doubtful results, in which case the necessity of verification occurs [
