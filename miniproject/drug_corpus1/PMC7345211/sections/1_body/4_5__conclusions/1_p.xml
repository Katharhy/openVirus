<p>The optimization of laboratory diagnostics is the most dynamically developing field in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, supporting contemporary medicine, government decisions and healthcare strategies. The efforts of scientistâ€“clinician teams focus, first of all, upon implementing the most reliable diagnostic tools; however, because COVID-19 is a new nosological entity, there are not enough data as of yet that would enable the determination of standards for the interpretation of serological POCTs. As with any other infectious diseases, the diagnostic value of a test is not only about the method of collecting the material, the quality of the sample and the equipment applied. Equally essential pre-analytical considerations are also the time point when a sample is collected, as well as a suitable procedure (storage and handling) prior to analysis, from the moment of collecting the biological material to the assaying stage.</p>
