<p>The search for new diagnostic methods is continued. Because SARS-CoV-2 is spread by droplets, while the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity index for RT-qPCR tests is the highest for broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) (higher than for sputum or nose/throat swabs), scientists recently proposed the use of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) for diagnostic purposes. EBC is most similar in its biochemical composition and origin to BAL. Examinations with the use of EBC are a relatively novel diagnostic method, used mainly to assess inflammation within the respiratory tract, and its components reflect the composition of the fluid lining the bronchi and alveoli. EBC is a condensed form of small droplets of the fluid lining the lungs, which is usually exhaled, it contains various components, from small ions to proteins and organelles; it may even contain viruses, fungi, and bacteria. Taking samples of the condensate is safe, totally non-invasive, easy to perform, it may be repeated many times, it may also be performed on patients with severe complications of COVID-19; its enormous advantage is that in may be performed in small children, with the use of special facial masks. The course of the examination is such that the patient is requested to exhale, when breathing uneventfully for some 10-15 min, to an apparatus provided with a cooling system, which allows us to accumulate the condensate in which SARS-CoV-2 may be detected. The application of this method seems justified from a public health perspective. The false positive results that are presently obtained contribute the continued spread of the virus worldwide [
