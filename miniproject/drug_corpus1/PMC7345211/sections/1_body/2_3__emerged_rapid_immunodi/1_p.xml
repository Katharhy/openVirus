<p>Immunological methods are, most often, the chemiluminescent assaying of immunoglobulin IgG and IgM for SARS-CoV-2 from blood on an analyzer, or immunochromatographic assessment in the form of rapid POCTs, not requiring additional equipment. The methods of detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, despite the ongoing research to develop them further, may or even should be applied during the coronavirus epidemics [

After about a week from the first clinical manifestations, the sensitivity of molecular diagnostics (PCR) diminishes gradually for SARS-CoV-2 infections, due to the decreasing amount of virus particles in the respiratory tract epithelium. In such cases, patients may have false negative results, despite the ongoing infection.
