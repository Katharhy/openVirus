<p>Undoubtedly, the scalable and reliable POCTs used in the community and outside laboratories would have the opportunity to reduce the time to obtain COVID-19 diagnostic results and might support early implementation of isolation resources and infection control measures. From a medical workforce point of view, antibody- and antigen-detecting tests appear to have a significant role in identifying healthcare workers who recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, to assess their suitability to provide frontline health services. On the other hand, the false negative serology tests could cause spread of COVID-19, unjustified reassurance and a change in public behavior. Undoubtedly, the negative results of serology tests (swabs) should not be treated as definitive for ‘ruling out’, but a positive test results are beneficial to ‘rule in’ coronavirus infection. The sufficient accuracy of serology tests used more widely will allow us to make an appropriate decision regarding lifting restrictions on a national level. Nevertheless, the wider implementation of POCD will ultimately support public health strategies about the potential lifting of social distancing restrictions in future [

Moreover, with the limited data available at present, for antibody-detecting and antigen-detecting rapid POCD, further intense research into their potential diagnostic utility is highly encouraged. If these tests demonstrate adequate accuracy, it is likely that they could potentially be used as triage tests for quick identification of patients who are suspected of contracting COVID-19, reducing the need for expensive reference molecular PCR testing [
