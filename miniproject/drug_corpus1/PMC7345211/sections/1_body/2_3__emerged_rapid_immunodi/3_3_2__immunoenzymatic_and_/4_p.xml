<p>In serological IVD, the so-called ‘window period’ is of much importance—that is, the time when specific antibodies are not yet detectable in a patient’s blood. In the initial phase of an infection, the production of antibodies is initiated, but their level is still low, and thus test results may prove negative. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies appear quite late, i.e., a few days after clinical manifestations, which is why serological tests cannot be used as a basic tool in diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infections [
