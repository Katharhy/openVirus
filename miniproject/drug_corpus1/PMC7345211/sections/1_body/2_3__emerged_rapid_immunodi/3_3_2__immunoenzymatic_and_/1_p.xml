<p>The detection of specific SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies allows for a rapid, cost-effective, and reasonably sensitive clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, as immunoglobulins such as IgM provide the initial humoral response during the first stage of viral infection, prior to the onset of the adaptive, high-affinity IgG response essential for long-term immunological memory. Research indicates that after SARS infection, antibodies of the IgM class may be detected in patientâ€™s blood about 6 days after the infection, while IgG may be already detected after 8 days. As SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the same large family of viruses, which includes those causing Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), it should be assumed that the process of producing antibodies will be similar to that in case of other viruses belonging to that family, while the detection of IgG antibodies and IgM antibodies acting against SARS-CoV-2 may be an indication of infection. Moreover, the detection of IgM antibodies usually indicates a recent exposure to SARS-CoV-2, whereas the detection of IgG antibodies in case of COVID-19 indicates exposure to the virus some time ago [
