  <p>Effects of HIV-1 Tat and morphine on BBB leakiness and on antiretroviral brain concentrations. After 14 days of Tat induction, there was a significant increase in the 10 kDa (Cascade Blue®) tracer leakage into the brain in Tat + placebo as compared to Tat − placebo mice (*
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and in Tat − mouse brains upon exposure to morphine as compared to Tat − placebo mice (*
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) (
   <bold>a</bold>). There was a significant main effect of morphine, resulting in reduced integrity of the BBB and increased leakage of the higher molecular weight (40 kDa and 70 kDa) tracers in morphine-exposed groups as compared to the those groups (Tat + and Tat − together) not exposed to morphine (placebo) (
   <sup>#</sup>
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; significant main effect of morphine) (
   <bold>b, c</bold>). Data represent the fold change in mean fluorescence intensity ± SEM; 
   <italic>n</italic> = 8 Tat−/placebo, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 6 Tat+/placebo, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 9 Tat−/morphine, and 
   <italic>n</italic> = 7 Tat+/morphine mice. Additionally, morphine exposure increased horseradish peroxidase (HRP) extravasation from the vasculature into the perivascular space and/or parenchyma in the striatum (
   <bold>d, e</bold>). HRP antigenicity was detected by indirect immunofluorescence (red) in tissue sections counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (blue) to reveal cell nuclei and visualized by differential interference contrast (DIC)-enhanced confocal microscopy. HRP extravasation into the striatal perivascular space/parenchyma was especially prevalent in morphine-exposed mice (arrowheads; left-hand panels in 
   <bold>e</bold> versus 
   <bold>d</bold>). The dotted lines (············) indicate the approximate edge of the capillaries/post-capillary venules; while intermittent dotted lines (· · · · · · ·) indicate the approximate edge of a partly sectioned blood vessel that appears partially outside the plane of section. The asterisks (*) indicate white matter tracts within the striatum. Representative samples from ≥

   <bold>f</bold>) and abacavir (
   <bold>g</bold>), but not lamivudine (
   <bold>h</bold>), within the striatum, as compared to placebo. (*

   <italic>n</italic> = 9 Tat+/placebo, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 6 Tat−/morphine, and
