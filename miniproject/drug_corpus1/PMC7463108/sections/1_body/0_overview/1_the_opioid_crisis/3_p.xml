<p id="Par5">The current opioid crisis did not happen quickly; in fact, it has been described as occurring in three phases. The first phase began in the late 1990s with an increase in the number of prescription opioids. This led to overdose deaths that were attributable to natural and semi-synthetic opioids, such as methadone (Kolodyny et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2017</xref>). The second phase began in 2010 in which heroin took the lead as the principal cause of overdose deaths. The most recent, third wave, began in 2013 in which highly potent synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl and its analogs became the main cause of mortality (Kolodyny et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR247">2015</xref>; CDC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2017</xref>). The entry of fentanyl and its analogs into the clandestine market has changed the dynamics of the opioid market in the U.S. The synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, are several orders of magnitude more potent than morphine, easily smuggled, and frequently and inconsistently mixed with lower quality drugs increasing the probability of overdosing. According to the National Forensic Laboratory Information System of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), fentanyl accounted for one-third of the illicit opioids seized in 2017 (UNODC
