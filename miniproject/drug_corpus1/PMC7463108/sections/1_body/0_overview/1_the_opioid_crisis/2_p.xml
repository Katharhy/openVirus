Not only are individuals with OUD more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 and liable to spread the infection, social-distancing practices create isolation, despair, and economic hardships, heightening opioid abuse (with inherent respiratory depression depending on the amount of tolerance developed) and the probability of overdose (Becker and Fiellin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2020</xref>; Wakeman et al.
