<p id="Par19">Unlike in astrocytes, opiate and HIV interactions in microglia tend to be self-limiting (Turchan-Cholewo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR515">2009</xref>). Opiates initially trigger large increases in the production of proinflammatory cytokines (Hauser, unpublished), reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) species (Turchan-Cholewo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR515">2009</xref>), and the release of glutamate (Gupta et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR195">2010</xref>) and ATP (Sorrell and Hauser 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR477">2014</xref>) extracellularly in Tat-exposed microglia. The release of glutamate is mediated by the catalytic subunit of the cystine-glutamate antiporter x
 <sub>c</sub>
 <sup>−</sup> (xCT) (Gupta et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR195">2010</xref>). Interestingly, following acute increases in the release of cytokines (e.g., TNF-α; unpublished), morphine no longer increases Tat-induced cytokine levels at 24 h; instead, their levels are reduced by opiate-dependent proteasome inhibition. The proteasome inhibitor, MG115, mimics the effects of morphine in decreasing proteasome activity at 24 h and blocks TNFα, IL-6, and CCL2 release from microglia, but does not increase ROS or RNS production (Turchan-Cholewo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR515">2009</xref>). The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is typically viewed as contributing to opiate tolerance and physical dependence by modulating MOR downregulation (Massaly et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR314">2014</xref>; Caputi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2019</xref>), rather than MOR activity constraining the UPS. Thus, while HIV-exposed, MOR-expressing microglia show a burst of ROS and proinflammatory cytokine production in response to morphine, the cytokine release collapses within 24 h seemingly because sustained opiate exposure inhibits the UPS thereby preventing degradation of the IκB subunit and nuclear translocation of NF-κB (Turchan-Cholewo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR515">2009</xref>).
