<p id="Par14">Although translational, “bench-to-bedside”, research is important, reverse-translational approaches and multiple preclinical models are essential to better understand complex disease and improve established therapies (Singer

Preclinical studies assessing opioid interactions with HIV or viral proteins permit mechanistic understanding of how particular CNS cell types, including neurons, astroglia, and microglia are affected and contribute to accentuating effects of opiates on neuroHIV, which are discussed in detail below.
