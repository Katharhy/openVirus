<p id="Par26">Taken together, BBB damage from HIV and/or opiates can disrupt the homeostasis within the brain. Breakdown of paracellular processes, through decreases in tight junction proteins and increased cellular adhesion proteins, increased leakage of circulating molecules into the brain and increased monocyte/MDM adhesion and transmigration into the brain, which if infected, can serve to replenish viral reservoirs within the CNS. Furthermore, alterations in drug transport proteins within the brain can decrease ARV efficacy by decreasing drug concentrations. Collectively, these changes serve to maintain HIV infection within the brain (see Fig.
