<p id="Par42">The ability of opiates to modulate HIV infection and HIV neuropathogenesis/disease progression may be partly due to the interactive effects seen between the opioid and chemokine receptors, specifically MOR and CCR5 or CXCR4 (Rogers and Peterson

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR481">2003</xref>; Szabo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR498">2003</xref>; Festa and Meucci 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">2012</xref>). The potential mechanisms for this interaction can include heterologous cross-desensitization via downstream signaling (Rogers et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR435">2000</xref>; Steele et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR480">2002</xref>; Song et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR476">2011</xref>) and/or potentially via direct opioid-chemokine receptor dimeric or heteromeric interactions (Suzuki et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR495">2002</xref>; Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2004</xref>; Nash and Meucci 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR356">2014</xref>). MOR and DOR activation can heterologously desensitize CCR5 responsiveness to CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 in monocytes (Grimm et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR189">1998</xref>; Szabo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR498">2003</xref>; Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2004</xref>). The cross-desensitization appears to be regulated by MOR-dependent PKCÎ¶ activation and CCR5 phosphorylation and downregulation (Song et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR476">2011</xref>). Alternatively, MOR-induced downregulation of CCL2 and CCL4 mRNA reciprocally upregulates the expression of their associated receptors, CCR2b, CCR3, and CCR5 (Mahajan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR302">2005</xref>). A previous study reported significant upregulation of CCR5 and CXCR4 expression in CD14 monocytes with [D-Ala
 <sup>2</sup>, N-MePhe
 <sup>4</sup>, Gly-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO), a MOR ligand, exposure with enhanced replication of both X4- and R5-tropic viral strains of HIV (Steele et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR481">2003</xref>). For CXCR4, bidirectional heterologous desensitization is less evident with MOR but has been reported for KOR, with Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> signaling experiments suggesting that cross-desensitization occurs within seconds of KOR or CXCR4 activation in a concentration-dependent manner (Finley et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">2008</xref>). Thus, opiates acting at different opioid receptors in the presence of HIV appear to activate chemokine receptor signaling and can contribute to the synergistic effects of HIV and opioid drug co-exposure seen in neuroHIV progression.
