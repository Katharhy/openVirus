<p id="Par44">The cell type specific interactions between CCR5 and MOR were noted when using a bivalent ligand derivative of maraviroc linked to an opioid antagonist, naltrexone, with HIV-1 entry being significantly blocked in astrocytes but not microglia (El-Hage et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">2013</xref>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Interestingly, maraviroc’s antiviral effects are completely negated in both astrocytes and microglia when morphine is present suggesting that maraviroc therapy may not be effective with opiate co-exposure. Importantly, unlike maraviroc, the bivalent compound blocked HIV entry in astrocytes irrespective of morphine treatment, while exacerbating HIV infectivity in morphine co-exposed microglia and revealing fundamental differences in the regulation of MOR and CCR5 expression in these glial types. Whereas, MOR and CCR5 expression appear to be similarly regulated in astrocytes, their expression patterns in microglia appear to be inversely correlated upon HIV and/or morphine exposure, with CCR5 being expressed at much higher levels than MOR (see El-Hage et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">2013</xref>). The differential effects of the bivalent ligand in astrocytes compared to microglia might be due to the fact that the expression levels of MOR and CCR5 are differentially regulated by HIV in each of the cell types (El-Hage et al.
