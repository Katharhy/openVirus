<p id="Par45">The importance of CCR5 activation in glia, but not neurons, in mediating the neurotoxic effects of morphine-dependent MOR activation is further supported in a recent study demonstrating that the loss of CCR5 from glia (but not neurons) eliminated neurotoxicity due to Tat and morphine interactions (Kim et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR237">2018</xref>) or MOR (Zou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR560">2011</xref>) from glia completely protects MSNs from morphine’s ability to exacerbate Tat neurotoxicity. However, deleting CCR5 from glia only revealed a paradoxical neuroprotective effect of morphine on Tat toxicity that is mediated by opioid receptors and appears to involve alterations in BDNF processing and signaling (Kim et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR237">2018</xref>).
