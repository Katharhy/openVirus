<p id="Par46">Mature BDNF (mBDNF) activates tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) and is neuroprotective, while the precursor to BDNF, pro-BDNF, binds p75
 <sup>NTR</sup> and can activate cell death pathways. Based on findings of significant, reversible reductions in glially produced BDNF after exposure to HIV-infected cell supernatant ± morphine (Masvekar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR315">2014</xref>), altered BDNF processing in lymphocytes from PWH (Avdoshina et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2011</xref>), and following exposure to HIV-1 gp120 (Bachis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2012</xref>), the pro-BDNF:mBDNF ratio was analyzed in supernatants from wild-type vs. CCR5-null striatal glial cultures exposed to Tat ± morphine for 6 or 24 h (Kim et al.
