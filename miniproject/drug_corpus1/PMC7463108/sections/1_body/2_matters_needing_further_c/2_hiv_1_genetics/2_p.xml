<p id="Par36">When considering effects of HIV clade variants in the presence of opioids, the overall toxicity in MSNs seen with clade C Tat (30% neuronal losses)â€‰was considerably less than with clade B (70% losses) (Zou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR560">2011</xref>). Although clade B HIV predominates in Western countries, future clinical longitudinal studies are necessary that employ HIV clade testing in HIV-1 infected opioid users to confirm the hypothesis that opioid interactive effects on HAND pathogenesis depend on the HIV clade assessed.
