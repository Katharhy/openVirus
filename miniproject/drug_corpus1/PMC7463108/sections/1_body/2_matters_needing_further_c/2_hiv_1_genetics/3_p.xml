<p id="Par37">Besides HIV genetic diversity, differences in HIV tropism add another level of complexity. Morphine interactions can differ significantly between X4 and R5-tropic gp120 variants depending on the outcome measure (El-Hage et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">2011b</xref>; Podhaizer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR402">2012</xref>; Balinang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2017</xref>; Kim et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR237">2018</xref>). Increased infectivity in the presence of morphine was noted for the R5-tropic HIV-1
 <sub>SF162</sub> strain in a human hepatoma Huh7.5.1 cell line model, whereas the infectivity rate with the X4-tropic HIV-1
 <sub>LAI/IIIB</sub> strain was unaffected by morphine (El-Hage et al.
