<p id="Par39">Host genetic variability can be a major determinant in individual susceptibility to HIV infectivity and may influence neuroHIV progression in the context of opiate co-exposure. The importance of CCR5 for HIV infectivity and polymorphisms in this gene are well established. Individuals who are homozygous in the CCR5 gene (CCR5Δ32) are highly resistant to infection by CCR5- (R5-) tropic HIV as demonstrated by individuals heterozygous for CCR5Δ32 who display partial resistance to infection and slower disease progression (Huang et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR288">1996</xref>; van Rij et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR522">1999</xref>). Besides CCR5, polymorphisms of other chemokine co-receptors and/or their cognate ligands have been implicated in HIV infectivity, including CCR2 (Smith et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR324">2000</xref>), and CXCL12 (Winkler et al.
