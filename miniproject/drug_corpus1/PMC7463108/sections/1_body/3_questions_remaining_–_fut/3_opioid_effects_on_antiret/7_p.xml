<p id="Par65">Using experimental data from SIV-infected, morphine-addicted macaques, mathematical modeling suggests that morphine exposure increases the proportion of cells with high susceptibility to SIV infection, at least in part, because of increased co-receptor expression (Vaidya et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR521">2016</xref>). In addition to promoting a higher steady state viral loads and larger CD4 count declines, the model also predicts that morphine exposure results in the need for more efficacious ARV treatment than would be necessary for animals not exposed to morphine (Vaidya et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR521">2016</xref>). Although the direct impact of morphine on ARV concentrations was not investigated, the study provides evidence supporting morphineâ€™s negative impact on ARV efficacy.
