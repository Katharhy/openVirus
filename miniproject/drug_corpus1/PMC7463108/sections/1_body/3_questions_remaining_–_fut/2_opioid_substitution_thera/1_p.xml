<p id="Par55">Although morphine, methadone, and buprenorphine all activate MOR, each can impart different signals through MOR, related to the nature and timing of their coupling to Gα, Gβγ, β-arrestin and/or regulators of G protein signaling (RGS), since each downstream effector couples into unique cell functions. Functional selectivity occurs at each opioid receptor type, and for most endogenous opioid peptides at all three receptor types (Gomes et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">2020</xref>). Moreover, opioid receptors can be expressed on a subset of virtually every cell type in the CNS—with second messenger coupling to each opioid receptor type potentially being unique, cell-type specific, and context dependent. Thus, the “pluridimensional” (Galandrin and Bouvier

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2016</xref>) actions of any opiate at MOR are sufficiently complicated that it is not possible to predict whether, e.g., morphine, methadone or buprenorphine, would similarly effect any aspect of neuroHIV pathology without empirical testing. Despite their significant use as medication-assisted therapies for treating opioid addiction, few studies have directly compared commonly used opiate substitution therapies (Bell and Strang
