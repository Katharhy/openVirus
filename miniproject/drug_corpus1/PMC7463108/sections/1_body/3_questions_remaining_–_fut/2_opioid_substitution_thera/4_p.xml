<p id="Par58">In the context of HIV, it has been shown that selective MOR agonists such as endomorphin-1, but not DAMGO or morphine, significantly increase HIV-1 replication in infected microglia (Peterson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR396">1999</xref>). This effect might be due to an apparent bias of endomorphin-1 towards arrestin recruitment and receptor phosphorylation, which was significantly correlated with agonist-induced internalization of MOR (McPherson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR330">2010</xref>). It is suggested that ligands that display bias towards G protein-mediated pathways and away from Î²-arrestin 2 recruitment may have improved therapeutic profiles against the development of tolerance and dependence/addiction (McPherson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR330">2010</xref>).
