<p id="Par7">HA is assembled as homotrimers consisting of two domains, the membrane-distal globular head domain and the membrane-proximal helix-rich stalk domain (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). Based on the antigenicity, HA can be divided into 18 subtypes, which fall into 2 groups, including group 1 (H1, H2, H5, H6, H8, H9, H11, H12, H13, H16, H17, H18) and group 2 (H3, H4, H7, H10, H14, H15) (Du
