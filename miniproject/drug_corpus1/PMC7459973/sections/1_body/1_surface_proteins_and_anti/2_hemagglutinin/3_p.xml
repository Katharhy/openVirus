<p id="Par9">Glycosylation and conformational mobility (shape-shifting) of surface glycoproteins can help viruses to mask sensitive epitopes and evade the immune system. Interestingly, two latest studies revealed that glycan repositioning within either head or stem domains of HA can facilitate the elicitation of protective cross-reactive antibody responses. Huang 
 <italic>et al.</italic> reported that removing glycosylation at residue 144 and deletion of lysine at position 147 can synergize to elicit broadly-reactive H1N1 influenza antibodies (Huang 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2019</xref>). A study by Boyoglu-Barnum 
 <italic>et al.</italic> showed that introduction of the group 2 glycan at Asn38HA1 to a group 1 stem-nanoparticle can broaden antibody responses to cross-react with group 2 HAs (Boyoglu-Barnum 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>). Although the precise sites that are vulnerable by glycan repositioning are not identified yet, they may provide novel target epitopes to achieve universal protection.
