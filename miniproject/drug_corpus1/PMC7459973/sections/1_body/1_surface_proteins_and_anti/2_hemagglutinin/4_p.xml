Primarily, the epitope is occluded at the contact surface between HA head domains, while the reversible HA “breathing” conformational dynamics can cause exposure of the interface. Antibodies targeting this cryptic epitope were shown to be protective against broad-spectrum subtypes of IAVs, suggesting the HA head interface is a new potential immunogen component for influenza universal vaccine design (Bajic
