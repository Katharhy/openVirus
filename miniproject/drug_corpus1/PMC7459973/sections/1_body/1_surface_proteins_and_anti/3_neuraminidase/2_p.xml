<p id="Par12">Interestingly, Doyle 
 <italic>et al.</italic> reported a unique universally conserved sequence (amino acids 222–230, located in the vicinity of enzymatic active site) amongst all IAV NA subtypes, and a mAb targeting this specific epitope was demonstrated to inhibit all NA subtypes and protect mice from lethal doses of mouse-adapted H1N1 and H3N2 (Doyle 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2013</xref>). More recently, Stadlbauer 
 <italic>et al.</italic> identified three broadly-protective mAbs targeting the NA active site that is highly conserved among all NA subtypes (Stadlbauer

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2019</xref>). These conserved NA epitopes, either subtype specific or universal, may be attractive immunological target for universal influenza vaccine design.
