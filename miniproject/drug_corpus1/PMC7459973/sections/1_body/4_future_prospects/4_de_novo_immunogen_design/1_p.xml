<p id="Par36">The computational design of new proteins sparks hopes in the field of rational vaccinology, particularly to elicit targeted neutralizing antibody responses (Correia 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2014</xref>; Sesterhenn 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2019</xref>). While most de novo proteins designed so far are either functionless or present functions that are encoded by regular, continuous secondary structures. Interestingly, a great progress has been made recently by Sesterhenn 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, who developed a novel computational design strategy to build de novo proteins presenting complex structural motifs (Sesterhenn 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2020</xref>). By using this strategy, the authors further engineered epitope-focused immunogens mimicking irregular and discontinuous RSV neutralization epitopes. And excitingly, the de novoâ€“designed immunogens can induce robust neutralizing responses against the respiratory syncytial virus in both mice and nonhuman primates (Sesterhenn 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
