<p id="Par34">The huge growth in high-resolution 3D structures of proteins promotes the emergence of a novel paradigm in the study of biomolecular recognition, the design and synthesis of protein epitope mimetics. Based on the natural structure of interested epitope, the mimetics (synthetic peptides) can be designed and synthesized, with diverse chemistries and cross-links (e.g., helix-stabilizing staples) harnessed to achieve desired folding (Zerbe
