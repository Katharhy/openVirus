<p id="Par35">Recent technological advances have suggested the promising potential of synthetic peptides as antigens to generate focused immune responses. By coupling a mimetic of the V3 loop from HIV-1 GP120 to synthetic virus-like nanoparticles, Riedel 
 <italic>et al.</italic> successfully designed a candidate HIV-1 vaccine which can elicit antibodies in rabbits that recognized recombinant gp120 (Riedel
