<p id="Par3">Vaccines provide cost-effective protection against influenza. Currently, seasonal influenza virus vaccines predominantly induce antibody responses against the hemagglutinin (HA), one of the two major surface glycoproteins of the virus (Krammer

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2013</xref>). Amino acid residues on the surface of this immunodominant head region vary substantially among different strains and change continuously (referred to as antigenic drift), leading to new circulating virus strains (Wang and Palese 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2011</xref>). Therefore, current influenza vaccines have to be reformulated each year based on surveillance and prediction, which is cumbersome, and their effectiveness is highly variable depending on the accurate forecasts of the circulating strains in each year (de Jong 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2000</xref>; Gerdil 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2003</xref>). Moreover, the protection conferred by seasonal influenza vaccines does not cover emerging pandemic influenza virus strains.
