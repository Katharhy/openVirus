<p id="Par2">More than 100Â years past the catastrophic 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, influenza viruses remain a constant global health threat. Three types of influenza viruses infect humans: type A (influenza A virus, IAV), type B (IBV) and type C (ICV). Two IAV subtypes (H3N2 and H1N1pdm09) and two IBV lineages (Yamagata and Victoria) co-circulate annually, causing seasonal epidemics and up to 650,000 respiratory deaths globally, while ICV is detected less frequently and usually causes mild infections (Krammer
