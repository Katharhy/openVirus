<p id="Par5">Most universal vaccines in development aim at inducing broadly protective antibody responses, while some others focus on inducing T cell responses alternatively (Nachbagauer and Krammer 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2017</xref>). In either case, the conserved immunogens of the virus need to be targeted, and the mechanism of protection mainly depends on the immunogens of choice (Nachbagauer and Krammer

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2019</xref>). This review will discuss the conserved antigenic regions/epitopes of influenza viruses that can facilitate immunogen design and contribute to the development of universal influenza vaccines.
