 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses to influenza virus and their role for host protection against influenza infection have received increasing attention (Wilkinson 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2012</xref>). It has been well demonstrated that CD4
 <sup>+</sup> memory T cells can help in directing a faster antibody response via cytokine secretion in response to mutated or immunologically novel viral antigens, leading to limited virus shedding and disease severity, possibly due to the direct lysis of infected epithelial cells (Poon 
 <italic>et al.</italic>

 <sup>+</sup> or CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T responses against highly conserved regions of the influenza proteins may overcome the limitations of current season influenza vaccines (Sheikh 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2016</xref>). More importantly, universal T cell-inducing vaccines in combination with universal antibodies can confer increased protection against influenza (Asthagiri Arunkumar
