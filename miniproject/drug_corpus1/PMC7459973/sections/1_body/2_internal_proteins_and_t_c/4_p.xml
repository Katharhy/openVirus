<p id="Par18">Interestingly, a recent study identified a universal PB1 epitope (PB1
 <sub>413</sub>), which is derived from a core motif (residues 406â€“422 of IAV-PB1 protein) present in the viral RNA-dependent polymerases (Koutsakos 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2019</xref>). PB1 is the most conserved protein across IAV and IBV, with about 60% amino acid identity. Vaccinating against the T cell epitope PB1
 <sub>413</sub> might provide universal protection in humans. Besides, CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell targets from IBV HA and NS1 proteins also have been identified and shown IBV-specific protection in mice, suggesting them as ideal targets for IBV-wide influenza vaccines (Koutsakos
