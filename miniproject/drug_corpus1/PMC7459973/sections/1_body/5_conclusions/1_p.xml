<p id="Par37">The ever-changing influenza surface proteins, HA and NA, arouse the desire of a universal flu vaccine. By offering life-long protection against all influenza strains, an universal vaccine can greatly reduce the need for yearly vaccine reformulations and vaccination. So far, many universal influenza vaccine candidates that are in clinical trials focus on targeting conserved epitopes of influenza, including either surface proteins or highly conserved internal proteins. Moreover, the new identified highly conserved epitopes and advanced techniques will lead to the fast development of next-generation universal flu vaccines.</p>
