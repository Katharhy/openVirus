<p id="Par23">More recently, Weidenbacher and Kim developed a novel method, called protect, modify, deprotect (PMD), for creating immunogens aimed to elicit antibodies targeting a specific epitope (Weidenbacher and Kim 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2019</xref>). A monoclonal antibody that recognizes the specific epitope is used to protect the target epitope on the protein, followed by modifications of the remaining exposed surfaces of the protein to render them nonimmunogenic. After removal of the monoclonal antibody, the epitope is deprotected and the resultant protein is modified at the surface other than the target epitope (Fig.Â
