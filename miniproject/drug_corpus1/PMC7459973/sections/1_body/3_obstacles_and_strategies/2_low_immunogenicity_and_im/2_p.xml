 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2010</xref>). Notably, the latter strategy requires maintaining the conformation of the stalk domain in absence of the head domain, which is challenging. Nevertheless promise progress has been made to achieve the stable native structure of trimeric HA stalk, either in soluble form or presented on nanoparticles (Lu
