<p id="Par27">Recently, Kanekiyo 
 <italic>et al.</italic> developed a novel immunosubversion strategy by enhancing the avidity of immunogens to cross-reactive B cells (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C) (Kanekiyo 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2019</xref>). Heterotypic influenza hemagglutinin antigens were co-localized on a single nanoparticle, generating a mosaic array. After vaccination, the avidity advantage of conserved epitopes to B cells can be achieved over strain-specific B cells, i.e., the B cell responses can adaptively target conserved antigenic surfaces, promoting cross-reactive antibody secretion. This heterotypic mosaic nanoparticle immunogen provides a new tool to combat viral genetic plasticity and antigenic variation.
