<p id="Par26">To further include head-specific cross-reactive epitopes into consideration for universal vaccine design, Krammer and Palese proposed a novel concept of mosaic HAs, which were constructed by replacing the immunodominant antigenic sites in the head with sequences from exotic, avian HA subtypes, instead of changing the whole head domain (Fig.
