<p id="Par25">However, immunodominance can be subverted by various strategies. For example, an “antigen imprinting” strategy was inspired by the phenomenon that natural infection and vaccination with pandemic H1N1 in 2009 preferentially boosted broadly binding antibodies in humans including antibodies targeting the stalk domain (Wrammert

Generally, immune response against newly emerging strains of influenza virus would be affected by immune memory acquired by past influenza exposure; memory B cells that are cross-reactive with newly emerging strains is activated, while induction of strain-specific antibodies is prevented (Henry

In this strategy, chimeric HAs that share the same stalk domain but express different head domains were constructed and used for vaccination sequentially, allowing repeated exposure of the same stalk in the context of an irrelevant globular head domain (Fig.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2017</xref>). The first immunization with a chimeric HA construct leads to a primary response against the globular head domain and, though much less efficiently, against the stalk domain. Upon subsequent booster vaccinations, a recall response against the stalk is anticipated, but immune response against the immunodominant head domain is restricted.
