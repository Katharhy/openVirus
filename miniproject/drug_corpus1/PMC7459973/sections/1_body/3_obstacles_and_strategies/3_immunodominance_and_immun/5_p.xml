<p id="Par28">Of note, a latest study using an African green monkey IAV model revealed that although mismatched prime-boost generated a pool of stem-specific memory B cells, head-specific B cells and serum Abs still substantially dominated the immune response (Jegaskanda

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2019</xref>). Moreover, itâ€™s theoretically proven that, at least in prime-boost model of mice, memory B cell (MBC) clones seldom reenter secondary germinal centers upon boosting (Mesin 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2020</xref>). The rearrangement of MBC clones were therefore blocked, and the diversity and specificity were limited, restricting the breadth and effectiveness of the ensuing antibody response (Mesin 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2020</xref>). If this clonality bottleneck is also the case of humans, our ability to elicit antibodies to non-immunodominant epitopes may be further improved once the bottleneck is solved in future.
