  <p>T-cell response and influenza viral internal proteins. 
   <bold>A</bold> CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cell response. Virus-derived peptide antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex-I (MHC-1) at surface of virus infected cells can be recognized by CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cells through specific T cell receptors (TCRs), resulting in lysis of target cells. 
   <bold>B</bold> A model of influenza viral particle with internal proteins. M1, Matrix protein 1; NP, nucleoprotein; PB1, polymerase basic-1. *, CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cell targets from IBV HA and NS (nonstructural protein 1) proteins also have been reported.
