  <p>Immunofocusing approaches for a universal flu vaccine. 
   <bold>A</bold> Head masking. The “Head” region of trimeric HA was hyperglycosylated, leaving only the HA stalk immunogenic. 
   <bold>B</bold> Mini-HA. The “Head” region of trimeric HA was removed completely, while the conformation of the stalk domain maintains well. 
   <bold>C</bold> Schematic of the PMD strategy. First, the epitope of interest is protected by binding of specific mAb. Then the surface of the protein·mAb complex is modified and rendered nonimmunogenic (shown as grey). By removal of the mAb, the epitope is deprotected and exposed as PMD antigen.
