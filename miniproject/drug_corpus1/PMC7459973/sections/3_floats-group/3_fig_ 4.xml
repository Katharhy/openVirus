  <p>immunosubversion strategies for a universal flu vaccine. 
   <bold>A</bold> Chimeric hemagglutinin (cHA) constructs and vaccination strategy. The cHAs consist of a conserved stalk domain in combination with “heads” from different avian influenza virus HA subtypes. Vaccination with the first cHA leads to primary antibody responses mainly targeting the immunodominant head domain and low-level priming against the stalk domain. Upon boosting with a second cHA that has the same stalk domain but a completely different head domain, the immune system induces a primary response against the novel head domain and a strong memory response against the stalk domain. 
   <bold>B</bold> Mosaic hemagglutinin (mHA) constructs and vaccination strategy. Only the variable immunodominant antigenic sites in mHAs are replaced with antigenic site equivalents from different influenza virus HA subtypes, and the resulting mHA displays conserved epitopes in both the stalk and head domains. Vaccination with the first mHA likely induces a strong primary response against the grafted antigenic sites and low-level priming for conserved epitopes in the stalk and head domains. Revaccination with a second mHA with antigenic sites that have been grafted from a different subtype might result in a primary response against the antigenic sites and a strong recall response against conserved epitopes in both the head and stalk domains. 
   <bold>C</bold> Model of immunosubversion approach with mosaic antigen array. Colored and black simbols indicates strain specific and conserved antigens respectivley. B cells possessing BCRs specific to multiple antigenic variants are colored accordingly. The avidity advantage of the mosaic antigen to cross-reactive B cells over mono-specific B cells is anticipated, promoting proliferation of cross-reactive B cells.
