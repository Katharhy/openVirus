<p id="p0015">SARS-Cov-2 which hit the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late December 2019, and subsequently spread rapidly to all provinces of China and all countries worldwide, has had a devastating impact on global public health [
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. SARS-Cov-2 is characterized by a high contagiousness. In 85% of cases it causes subclinical or mild disease, but compared to the flu it more easily causes respiratory complications (e.g., severe pneumonia (ground glass opacities) and interstitial pneumonia) in 10–15% of cases. 5% of infected patients require ICU admission [

 <italic>Middle East respiratory syndrome</italic> (MERS) of 2012, both of them related with higher mortality (9.5% and 34.4%, respectively) [
