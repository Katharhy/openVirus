<p id="p0030">Firstly, several experimental and clinical studies have clearly shown that propolis extracts from temperate climate presents a potent and broad-spectrum antiviral activity against a diverse panel of viruses, including HSV-1, HSV-2, Influenza virus type A and B, Parainfluenza virus, Adenovirus, HIV, infectious bursal disease virus and avian reovirus, Newcastle virus disease, bovine rotavirus, pseudorabies virus, feline calicivirus, canine adenovirus type 2, and bovine viral diarrhea virus [
