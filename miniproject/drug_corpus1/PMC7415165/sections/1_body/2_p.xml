 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Despite this fact, it is also important to note that not all physicians and researchers are prepared to deepen their knowledge about biomimicry, probably because of a lack of exposure to biomimicry during training [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Biomimicry (from the Greek words 
 <italic>bios</italic>, meaning “life,” and 
 <italic>mimesis</italic>, meaning “to imitate”) it is an area of science that studies nature's models and then emulates these forms, processes, systems, and strategies to solve human problems [

Regarding our proposal on propolis, it is already established in the literature that one of the ways that honey bees’ colonies maintain health and immunity is for the formation of a propolis envelope within the nest that acts as an important antimicrobial layer [
