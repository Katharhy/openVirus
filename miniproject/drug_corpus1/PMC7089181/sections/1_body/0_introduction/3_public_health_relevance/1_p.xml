<p id="Par4">Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) cause the highest mortality in human hosts among all known viral agents. Encephalitides and severe respiratory infections caused by a range of viruses are other diseases with often severe clinical outcomes. The recent emergence of such infections from geographical hotspots is mainly a consequence of the rapid development of ground and air transport. Vector-borne infections are also affected by climate change. Large-scale outbreaks were first described for Monkeypox virus in central Africa in the 1970s [

The rapid and uncontrolled spread of Ebola fever in Africa has been considered as a threat for the national security of developed countries with regard to the risk of imported cases but also for economic reasons. The Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology (IMB) was involved in the international effort to contain Ebola fever in West Africa during the 2014–2016 outbreak [

Antiviral compounds and their possible role in biodefense were a special theme during the MBDC in 2018. The selection of topics with a focus on pox-, alpha- and flaviviruses was guided by the NATO AMedP-6 ‘Handbook on the medical aspects of nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) defensive operations—Part II.’ Smallpox, albeit eradicated in nature, continues to be perceived as a threat for several reasons, one of them being the risk that variola virus might be brought back with the methods of synthetic biology. Military forces and first responders in many countries were revaccinated in the early 2000s for fear that Iraq might have weaponized smallpox virus (which it had not, as was revealed later on). Emergency plans were developed to deal with a deliberate release. While no licensed drug was available at the time to treat infections with variola virus, a drug effective against orthopoxviruses, tecovirimat, has recently been approved by the United States Federal Drug Administration [
