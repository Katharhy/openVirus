<p id="Par6">VHFs are caused by infection with RNA viruses. The standard of treatment for RNA virus infections where it shows efficacy, is ribavirin, developed in 1963 [

Where possible, early start of treatment of acute virus infections gives the best results and, in this context, accurate and rapid virus diagnosis is essential. The crucial role of a well-organized public health system and classic quarantine approaches was demonstrated in the recent Ebola outbreaks in West- and Central Africa. However, the need for new antiviral agents had generally been recognized and been reviewed by David Freestone as early as 1985 [

While many virus infections are asymptomatic, new or improved antiviral drugs are needed for the prevention and/or treatment of a number of significant conditions caused by viruses which at present cannot be controlled by alternative measures, including vector control, immunization and treatment with existing antiviral drugs. The need for specialized BSL-3/BSL-4 facilities with trained personnel for experiments with life viruses, and animal challenge, has further restricted research to a few high-security sites worldwide. As a result, there are no FDA-approved antivirals for Ebola or the causative viral agents of many other viral hemorrhagic fevers, viral encephalitides, and respiratory infections. Few therapeutic interventions are available except for supportive therapy.
