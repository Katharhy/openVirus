<p id="Par20">Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) cause the highest mortality in human hosts of all known viral agents and treatment options are a serious concern both in public health and in biodefense scenarios [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. If specific antiviral treatment options are not available, supportive care is the mainstay of clinical interventions in VHF, including hemodynamic, hematological, pulmonary and neurological support treatments. Treatment with corticosteroids, vasoactive substances, hemodialysis, and mechanical ventilation saves the patients with the worst clinical symptoms. The only currently widely available antiviral drug, ribavirin, is not approved by the FDA for intravenous application in VHF and is used under compassionate use protocols only. Intravenous ribavirin reduces mortality of HFRS if combined with hemodialysis and both morbidity and mortality in the case of Lassa fever (LassaF). Ribavirin (Copegus™, Rebetol™, Virazole® ICN/Valeant (IND)) is used for the treatment of infections with African arenaviruses (Lujo- and Lassa fever) and bunyaviruses (HFRS, Crimean-Congo fever, and Rift Valley fever). However, intravenous ribavirin does not show any benefits for the treatment of any of the VHFs caused by filoviruses, or in infections with RNA viruses causing severe encephalitis [
