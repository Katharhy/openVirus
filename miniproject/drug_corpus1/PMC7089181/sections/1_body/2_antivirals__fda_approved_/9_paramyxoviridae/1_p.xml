 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> are fast-moving airborne pathogens infecting animals and humans. Hendra (HeV) and Nipah (NiV) viruses, in the genus 
 <italic>Henipavirus</italic>, are considered zoonotic agents in Australia (horses) and South-East Asia (pigs), respectively. Both viruses may be able to infect other domesticated mammals, and there is a real concern in the veterinary and biodefense communities about spill-over infections and the high fatality rate in humans (632 human NiVcases: 59% case fatality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">131</xref>]. Henipaviruses have so far not caused global epidemics, but due to a high percentage of severe outcomes, as well as lack of vaccines or treatments, HeV and NiV are designated biosafety level (BSL-4) agents [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>]. They are currently not on the NATO AMed P-6 list of biological threat agents but their potential as agents for bioterrorism has been discussed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. Other Paramyxoviruses causing diseases in animals are canine distemper virus (CDV), endemic in Europe (dogs/humans; [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]), Newcastle disease virus affecting birds, and rinderpest virus infecting cattle. Human parainfluenza viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are major causes of bronchiolitis, bronchitis and pneumonia in infants and children. Measles (morbilli, rubeola) caused by measles virus (MeaslesV) was responsible for around 733,000 deaths globally in 2000 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], mostly due to viral pneumonia, secondary bacterial infections due to immune suppression (B cell tropism), and encephalitides [inclusion body encephalitis (MIBE); subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE)]. A very successful vaccine (MeaslesV strain Edmonston) has been used with the goal to eradicate measles in 2010 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. However, anti-vaccine movements have led to the loss of herd immunity and the reemergence of measles in many developed countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Paramyxoviruses are a family of enveloped viruses with a negative-sense ss-RNA genome (mononegavirales) replicating in the cytoplasm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. 
 <italic>Anti-paramyxovirus drugs</italic>. Ribavirin administered with cyclodextrin has been shown to be effective in a mouse model for measles encephalitis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. A very promising candidate antiviral against measles is ERDRP-0519, which has been shown effective against canine distemper virus in a ferret model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]; however, early resistance development has been described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Favipiravir has a protective effect against Nipah virus infections in the hamster model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and remdesivir inhibits a number of paramyxoviruses in vitro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. ddBCNAs (see sections “
 <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">Poxviridae</xref> ”and “
 <xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">Flaviviridae</xref>”; [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]) and the plant extract naphthoquinone droserone have anti-measles activities in vitro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. The nucleoside-analogue 4′-azidocytidine (R1479; balapiravir) was developed to inhibit HCV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>], paramyxoviruses, and filoviruses in vitro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], but showed low efficacy and high toxicity in hepatitis C patients in early clinical trials [
