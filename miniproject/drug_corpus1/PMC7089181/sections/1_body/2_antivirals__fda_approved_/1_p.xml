<p id="Par9">Complementing the recent review by De Clercq and Li [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] this section will focus on small-molecule antiviral compounds and discuss a selection of compounds that are either FDA approved or lately proved effective against viruses associated with a biothreat risk in in vitro experiments, animal or phase I–III clinical studies. Subsections give a brief overview of the viral agents in the order of relevance for biodefense, the FDA-approved treatment options, and antivirals in development, with top candidates highlighted in yellow in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, which lists virus-specific compounds in the same order of relevance, detailing compound class, target and stage of development.
