<p id="Par18">Combination treatments with antiviral compounds using different modes of action (MoA) are further increasing efficacy and, by means of individual dose reduction, allow for lower toxicity of the individual compounds. This exploits possible synergies between synthetic small molecules and natural extracts, virus-specific and broad-spectrum agents, and cell-targeting compounds. The use and potential benefits of multidrug cocktails, mainly reduction of resistance mutation and toxicity through dose reduction, have been pointed out by many authors, including in the context of yellow fever treatment [
