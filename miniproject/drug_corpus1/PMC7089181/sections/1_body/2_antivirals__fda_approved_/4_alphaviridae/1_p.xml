<p id="Par12">Alphaviruses are mosquito-borne viruses, but some can be effectively transmitted via the aerosol route from contaminated rodent feces. Rodents, birds and possibly marine species are maintenance reservoirs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Alphaviruses can cause a number of diseases in humans, including Chikungunya fever, Eastern, Western and Venezuelan equine encephalitis. The handling of the respective viruses requires BLS-3 containment. Two type species, Venezuelan and Eastern Equine Encephalitis viruses (VEEV and EEEV), are considered potential biological threat agents [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>] with up to 70% mortality in unprotected populations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">142</xref>] and represent category B select agents. While human infections with VEEV and EEEV are rare, sporadic and unpredictable but explosive epidemics caused by Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) have occurred in the last decade mainly in South-East Asia and in South America, Central America and the Caribbean, globally amounting to millions of cases. Autochthonous cases of Chikungunya fever have been reported in Italy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. Viremia with rashes and fever usually lead to death of cells lining joints, causing arthritis and joint pain. CHIKV infections of neurons can result in potentially fatal encephalitis. Fatal infections, mainly seen in human infants, are rare, but long-lasting polyarthralgia and encephalitis cause significant morbidity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. Alphaviruses are enveloped viruses with positive-sense ss-RNA genomes. Most experimental antivirals target the viral RNA polymerase. There are no licensed antiviral drugs against alphaviruses causing arthritis and encephalitis, and the treatment of infections is mainly supportive (anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids). 
 <italic>Anti-alphavirus drugs</italic>. While pox- and filoviruses are highly lethal biological agents, alphavirus infections are rarely fatal, but can lead to large numbers of incapacitated individuals, due to severe arthralgias and headaches. In this sense, alphaviruses might be effective biological threat agents where incapacitation and saturation of medical care facilities are the goal of a perpetrator (incapacitating agents). Specific antivirals should be able to pass the blood brain barrier (BBB) to control post-exposure encephalitis. Intravenous Ribavirin, which is FDA approved for HCV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, does not pass the BBB, thus alleviating peripheral symptoms but not providing cure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Intranasal ribavirin may be more effective. Ribavirin resolves joint swelling in CHIKV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>], but has no activity against VEEV in vitro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Sofosbuvir, an FDA-approved antiviral drug against HCV, which has been suggested for repurposing against various viruses, has been evaluated for in vitro activity against CHIKV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Among the most promising novel compounds is the broad-spectrum antiviral candidate favipiravir (T-705), initially developed to treat human influenza, which shows a potent antiviral effect in small animal models. The drug is licensed in Japan, while FDA approval is pending [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. An in vitro comparison between ribavirin and favipiravir revealed that efficacy is cell-type dependent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Efficacy was also shown in a mouse model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Other compounds of interest (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) include drugs approved for other medical conditions and tested for repurposing. Those are the old antiparasitic suramin, which shows ameliorating effects against CHIKV infection in mice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>] and the anthelmintic ivermectin, which shows in vitro activity against a range of alphaviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">141</xref>]. Compounds with known cellular targets include the cancer drugs mefenamic acid and sorafenib, inhibiting replication of CHIKV and other alphaviruses via eIF4E dephosphorylation in vivo [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>], and halofuginone, a prolyl t-RNA synthetase inhibitor in veterinary use that is active in vitro against both alpha- and flaviviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Also promising is the virus-specific antiviral ML336 that inhibits Nsp4 of VEEV and EEEV in vivo [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Less well-described compounds are LL-37 peptide, an alphavirus entry inhibitor in vitro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], compound 25 that was identified in silico and optimized to inhibit CHIKV replication in vitro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], Prest-37 and -392, with in vitro activity against VEEV nsP1 capping enzyme [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], and baicalin, which inhibits CHIKV replication in vitro by interfering with a cellular target [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>].
