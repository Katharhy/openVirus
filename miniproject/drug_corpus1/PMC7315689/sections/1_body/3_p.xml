<p id="Par4">We employed a cross sectional study design. The study was conducted at the University Teaching Hospital of Kigali (CHUK), ART clinic (IRB approval: EC/CHUK/036/2020). CHUK is the largest referral hospital in Rwanda. The ART clinic provides care and treatment services to approximately 2100 clients. Records from all clients with a scheduled follow-up appointment for ART collection in the period 21 March to 30 April 2020 were included. In this study, 382 records met the criteria and were available for review. Three source records were reviewed for this study namely pharmacy register, client file and linkage register. For each of these sources; clients records are linked by a unique identifier called a TracNet ID. The data abstraction form collected information on TracNet ID, client demographics (sex; age; residence), WHO clinical stage, date and result of last viral load test, current regimen, last date for ART collection and next date of appointment. Two trained health professionals abstracted the relevant data from the source records and performed quality control for accuracy during the period 21â€“30 May 2020. We used the chi-square test to determine association between categorical dependent and categorical independent variables.</p>
