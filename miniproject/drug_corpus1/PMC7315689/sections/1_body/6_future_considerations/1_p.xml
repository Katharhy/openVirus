<p id="Par7">It is well-established that without the ability to maintain consistent HIV therapy, some patients face rapid treatment failure. This calls for HIV programs to have appropriate contingency plans wherever crises that hinder PLWH from accessing care services may occur [

On World AIDS Day in 2016, Rwanda launched the national Differentiated Service Delivery Model (DSDM) for HIV/AIDS treatment and service provision; a strategy which includes provision for reducing the frequency of routine healthcare visits for stable, low-risk HIV patients [

This has been working well with ensuring health providers focus care and treatment efforts on higher-risk patients and new patients while stable patients spend less time and money traveling to healthcare facilities, since visits are spaced further apart. While this may be the case, there is need for advance planning to develop programs that can function during a crisis such as a nation-wide lockdown that limits people movement. The lockdown has accentuated the need for a rapid programmatic response to ensure consistent provision of care and treatment services to PLWH. Further, there is a need to strengthen effective patient tracking for individuals who miss appointments especially during a national crisis.
