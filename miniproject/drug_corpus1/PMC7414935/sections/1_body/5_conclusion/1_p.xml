<p>Currently, CoVs have caused three major global epidemics (SARS, MERS, and COVID-19) that have affected the lives and health of tens of thousands of people. Progress has enabled humans to improve methods for acquiring animal-source foods, from hunting and domestication to modern farming. This has resulted in massive increases in the quantity and quality of animal-source foods. At the same time, human hunting of wildlife and consumption of raw animal-source foods has continued to increase, resulting in epidemics caused by viruses. For there are currently no effective vaccines or drugs for CoVs, deviant consumption mentality should be curbed. Meat is an indispensable nutrient source for humans. As viruses can infect livestock and cause a potential threat, pathogen transmission from food sources requires food safety measures during processing to control virus transmission.</p>
