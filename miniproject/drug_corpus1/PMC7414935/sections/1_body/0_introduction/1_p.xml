<p>Coronaviruses (CoVs), systemically classified as 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>, are enveloped viruses that can infect poultry, domestic animals, and humans. The 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>, which belongs to the order 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic>, was first isolated from chickens in 1937 and from humans in 1965.

Animal-animal transmission occurs for most CoVs, while only a few CoVs can infect humans through intermediate hosts. Human infections result in diverse symptoms and diseases of the respiratory tract, digestive tract, and nervous system. For example, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) caused Middle East respiratory syndrome after infecting dromedary camels. Currently, there are seven known CoVs that can infect humans, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
 <xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> CoVs usually cause self-limiting and mild respiratory tract infections; the main symptoms include fever, coughing, runny nose, and wheezing. Therefore, these infections are often misdiagnosed as pneumonia.

 <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 have infected many people, resulting in thousands of deaths. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are designated as category B infectious diseases by the National Health Commission, and prevention and control are carried out according to measures used for category a infectious diseases.
