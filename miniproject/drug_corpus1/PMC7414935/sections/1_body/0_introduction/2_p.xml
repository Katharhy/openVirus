<p>CoV outbreaks mostly occur during winter and spring in temperate regions. Domestic camels have been shown to be one of the hosts for CoVs. Other species of livestock, poultry and warm-blooded animals may be intermediate hosts for CoVs.
 <xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Currently, CoVs with high mortality rate mainly infect humans through intermediate hosts and “host jumps.” In addition, there is no specific drug or vaccine available for CoVs, and thus only symptomatic treatments are used. Increasing movement of people and international commerce has led to global dissemination and epidemics of CoVs that severely affect human health and the global economy.
 <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The present paper outlines the biological, epidemiological, and diagnostic characteristics of CoVs and describes the control and prevention measures for CoVs. The overall goal is to prevent CoVs from harming public health through animal-source foods.
