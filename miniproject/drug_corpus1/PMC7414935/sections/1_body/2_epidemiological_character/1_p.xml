<p>CoV infections are distributed globally but show regional differences. Humans are generally susceptible and can develop self-limiting acute or chronic persistent infections and can suffer repeated infection and coinfection by multiple respiratory viruses. CoV infections mainly occur during winter and spring. HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are among the most common CoVs, accounting for 10–30% of common colds. Outbreaks occur once every 2–4 years during winter and spring, but pandemics are rare. The infection rate of HCoV-HKU1 is 0.3–4.4%. HCoV-NL63 mainly cause epidemics during summer and autumn. The virus can infect people of all age groups, although infants, elderly people, immunosuppressed patients, and patients with underlying disease are most susceptible. The incidence is around 2%, while the detection rate is higher than for other human CoVs, and epidemics occur yearly. Serological studies have shown that almost everyone will be infected with HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, or HCoV-OC43 in childhood. However, repeated infections may occur throughout life due to reduction in antibody titers and viral mutation.

 <xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Although human CoV infections often cause mild upper respiratory tract infections, deaths still occur when patients suffer from certain underlying diseases. In 2002, SARS-CoV appeared in southern China before spreading to the rest of the world. Ultimately, SARS-CoV resulted in 8096 infections and 774 deaths in 32 countries, with a mortality rate of 9.56%.
 <xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> MERS-CoV first appeared in Saudi Arabia in 2012, causing epidemics in the Middle East. Subsequently, 2494 people were infected, and 858 deaths occurred in 27 countries for a mortality rate of 34.4%.
 <xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> There are 203 countries, areas or territories and more than 13876441 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2, where the virus infects all age group. There have been 593 087 of deaths from this virus. The crude mortality rates in males, females, and people aged more than 80 years are 2.8%, 1.7%, and 14.8%, respectively. The mortality rate is higher in patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, or hypertension.
