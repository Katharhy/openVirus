<p>The emergence of many zoonotic human diseases, which intimately associated with contact between animal species and with humans, as well as with human diet, has climbed during these decades. For example, SARS, Marburg hemorrhagic fever, and Ebola hemorrhagic fever are associated with human consumption of wildlife. And Public Health England (PHE) also indicated that 60% to 80% of emerging infections are derived from an animal source. And “Bush meat” harvested from remote forested areas remains a risk for animal-derived emerging infections.

 <xref rid="cit0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> Consumption of pangolins, illegal but frequent, is present throughout the world that might be an infection pathway of COVID-19. In addition, excessive emphasis on food freshness has resulted in the prevalence of cold foods, raw foods and other consumption methods. However, most bacteria and viruses (eg Ebola virus, SARS-CoV) have strong infectivity under room temperature and refrigeration conditions, causing possible food poisoning or foodborne infections in humans and providing conditions for viral and bacterial outbreaks in human societies. Therefore, China has revised the Wild Animal Conservation Law and adjusted the list of “animal sources of epidemics” to ban the consumption of wildlife. Evidently, CoVs can infect humans, and positive test results for serum antibodies have been attained in civet cats, wild boars, pheasants, cats, rabbits, frogs, camels, and birds. Therefore, it is a high risk of infection from uncooked animal-source foods such as milk and meat.
