<p>Even there are some unknown reservoirs, current studies indicate that bats are the main reservoir for CoVs (

The virus detection rates of intestinal and stool samples are higher than for respiratory tract or urine samples, indicating that before entering the human population the virus might be easier to infect animals through food residues and stools than other pathways.
