<p>Although there are limited intermediate hosts for CoV transmission from bats to humans, certain bats can migrate for long distances, thereby increasing the possibility of contact with livestock and increasing the distribution range of CoVs.
 <xref rid="cit0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> Existing studies have shown that compared with other livestock, pigs tend to promote cross-species transmission of viruses and are more susceptible to bat CoVs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1</xref>). SeACoVs isolated from pig guts are different from known porcine CoVs and are phylogenetically close to the bat CoV HKU2.

 <xref rid="cit0058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> The sequence similarity between porcine and human CD26 receptors is 94.5%, which is sufficient for cross-species transmission to occur. In addition, CoVs have been shown to have the potential for recombination in animals.
 <xref rid="cit0059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> Therefore, preventing bat invasion of animal farms should be implemented in addition to monitoring viruses in bats.
