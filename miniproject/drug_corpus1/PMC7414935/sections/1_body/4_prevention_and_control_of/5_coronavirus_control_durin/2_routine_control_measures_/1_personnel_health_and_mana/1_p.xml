<p>A personnel health management system should be established, and annual physical examinations should be conducted. Personnel should only be employed after a health certificate has been obtained. Staff with dysentery, hepatitis A and other digestive tract diseases, pulmonary tuberculosis, or exudative or purulent skin diseases should not be employed.
 <xref rid="cit0060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> During CoV epidemics, foodstuff companies should monitor the temperatures of staff every day, and make some steps to protect workers. For instance, the federal Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OHSA) recommended providing clean face coverings for employers, rearranging facilities so that workers can remain six feet apart and providing short breaks to allow workers to wash their hands more frequently. When outbreaks occur near the factory, staff should stay home and avoid entering/exiting the factory; personnel movement should be reduced; dormitories should be disinfected daily, and the health status of staff should be recorded. When staff with suspected symptoms occur, work must be immediately stopped; consultation should be carried out at a suitable time, and medical quarantine should be initiated for close contacts.
