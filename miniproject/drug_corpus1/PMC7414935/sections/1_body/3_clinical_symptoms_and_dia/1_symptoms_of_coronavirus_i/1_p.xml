<p>The incubation period of human CoV infection
 <xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> is around 2–5 days, and the disease course is 6–7 days. CoV infection mainly causes fever, runny nose, cough, and headaches, while gastrointestinal symptoms occur in some cases. However, symptoms are normally mild. Bronchitis, pneumonia, or severe respiratory diseases may result in infants, elderly people, and immunocompromised people. HCoV-229E has a higher proportion of runny nose symptoms compared with other common respiratory diseases. HCoV-OC43 often causes more severe symptoms than HCoV-229E, but asymptomatic infections and occasional severe lower respiratory tract infections may be present. HCoV-HKU1 does not have specific characteristic symptoms and is often diagnosed as bronchiolitis or pneumonia, but infants tend to develop convulsions and febrile seizures. HCoV-NL63 may cause severe cold symptoms and acute respiratory symptoms in infants and immunocompromised adults.
