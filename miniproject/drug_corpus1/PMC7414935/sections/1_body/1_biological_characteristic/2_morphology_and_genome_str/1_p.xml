<p>Mature CoVs are spherical, oval, or polygonal particles with a diameter of 60â€“220 nm and a helical and symmetrical nucleocapsid. CoVs are coated with a lipid membrane and appear corona-shaped or crown-shaped under the microscope. A large amount of nucleocapsid protein (N protein) is attached to the viral RNA, and the surface of the virus particle contains spike protein (S protein), membrane protein (M protein), and envelope protein (E protein). A few viruses possess the hemagglutinin-esterase protein (HE protein).
 <xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The N protein has a low degree of polymerization; it can induce cellular immunity and bind to viral RNA to form the nucleocapsid.
 <xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The S protein recognizes specific receptors (N-acetyl-neuraminic acid) on the cell surface during infection to penetrate and lyse the cell membrane so that viral nucleic acid can be injected into cells and induce cellular immunity.
 <xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> During infection, the M protein enables transmembrane nutrient transportation, determines virus budding sites, and triggers virus particle assembly and the formation of new viral envelopes.
 <xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The E protein is smaller and is mainly bound to the envelope. The E protein can trigger the assembly of virus particles and can induce apoptosis.
 <xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The HE protein can cause erythrocyte aggregation.
 <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In addition, the virus particle also contains the Nsp3 protein (multi-domain protein), Nsp5 protein (cysteine protease), Nsp2 protein, ORFb, and ORF3a, but the functions of those proteins are still unknown.
