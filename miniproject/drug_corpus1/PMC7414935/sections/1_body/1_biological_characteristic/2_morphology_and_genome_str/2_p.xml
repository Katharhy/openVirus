<p>CoVs are single-strand, unsegmented positive RNA viruses, and the genome size is 27–32 kb, making it one of the largest RNA virus genomes that is currently known.
 <xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The 5ʹ end of the CoV genome contains a methylation cap followed by a 65–98 bp guide sequence (loader RNA) and a 209–528 bp 5ʹ untranslated region (UTR). The 3ʹ end also contains a 288–506 bp UTR and a poly A tail. Both UTRs are extremely important for the translation and replication of viral RNA in the host. The remaining middle sequence contains 7–9 open reading frames (ORFs) that encode for various structural proteins, non-structural proteins, and accessory proteins.
 <xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> There are 2–4 genes that encode for RNA polymerase and 4–5 genes that encode for structural proteins in CoVs. The gene fragments encoding RNA polymerases account for two-thirds of the entire genome; these comprise two open reading frame fragments (ORF1a and ORF1b), while the remaining third of the genome encodes for structural proteins and accessory proteins.
 <xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The genome structure of CoVs from the 5ʹ end to 3ʹ consists of the 5ʹ end-RNA polymerase-(HE protein-S protein-E protein-M protein-N protein-3ʹ end).
