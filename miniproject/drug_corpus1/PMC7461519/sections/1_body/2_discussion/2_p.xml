<p>The nine essential stakeholder engagement practices enumerated in the GPP‐EP are applicable to the planning and conduct of COVID‐19‐related clinical trials in sub‐Saharan Africa, but the culture of the societies in the region may require adapting the practices while in the field. The collectivism/communitarian nature of the societies will influence the choice of clinical trial design; considerations for informed consenting; the development of stakeholder engagement; communications and issues management plan; and decisions about third‐party access to standard of care and/or prevention. Policies on the management of trial‐related physical, psychological, financial, and/or social harms should recognize the limited access of trial participants to health insurance and the limited capability of the region's weak public and clinical health systems to deal with these challenges. Finally, the procedures of trial closure, dissemination of results, and post‐trial access to trial products or procedures can benefit from the biomedical HIV prevention and treatment research on managing expectations for results; plans must be made upfront for post‐trial access to trial products. The formative research will help identify cultural ‘landmines’ that should be negotiated when planning COVID‐19‐related clinical trials in sub‐Saharan Africa, and stakeholder engagement prior to conclusion of the study protocols will help reach consensus on trial implementation.</p>
