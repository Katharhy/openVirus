<p>Community monitoring of clinical trials, including COVID‐19 trials, should therefore be encouraged. Through community monitoring, community members collect and analyze data about the clinical trial being implemented and use the information to advocate for change if it is needed.

Many civil societies in Africa have developed competencies to conduct community‐led monitoring programs for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria programs in the region.

 </fn> Support for civil societies to monitor COVID‐19 clinical trials and regularly report their findings to ethics committees should enable them to determine that clinical trials are important and should be pursued.
