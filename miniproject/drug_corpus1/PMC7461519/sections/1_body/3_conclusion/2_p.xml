<p>Stakeholder engagement in the designing, implementing, monitoring, and disseminating COVID‐19 clinical trials is an important ethical consideration for collective societies like those in sub‐Saharan Africa, and the stakeholder engagement needs to be promoted and monitored by clinical trial regulators. The GPP‐EP is a good framework for guiding stakeholder engagement in COVID‐19 clinical trials. Guidelines that are cognizant of the sociocultural context of the region increase the stakeholder engagement. Documented successes with COVID‐19 clinical trials will help in achieving stakeholder engagement in future trials to be conducted in the region.</p>
