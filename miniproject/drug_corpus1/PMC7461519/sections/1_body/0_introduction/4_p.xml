<p>Pandemics and epidemics of international concern often require vaccines for public health prevention and concurrent treatment to reduce the morbidity and mortality of persons affected. Ethical considerations require that research conducted during epidemics be integrated into the national emergency response in ways that do not draw away critical resources, with further negative impact of the epidemic on trade, tourism, national security, gross domestic product, developmental indicators, and citizen well‐being.

 </fn> The research should also have scientific and social value: respect for the rights and dignity of study participants and their welfare should be a core concern. The research also should have a favorable risk‐benefit balance: there should be justice in the distribution of benefits and burdens, and post‐trial access to tested agents that had been proven effective should be ensured and community engagement facilitated.
