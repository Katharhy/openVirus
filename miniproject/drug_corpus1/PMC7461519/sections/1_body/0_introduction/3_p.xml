<p>There is a critical need for competency to conduct clinical trials in sub‐Saharan Africa because the biological, economic, and sociopolitical factors associated with the emergence of diseases, epidemics, and pandemics are overrepresented in many countries of the region.

 </fn> Biological factors include human susceptibility to infection, microbial adaptation and change, and changes in ecosystems. Economic and sociopolitical factors include changing human demographics and behavior; economic development and land use, as noticed with transitioning economies; international travel and commerce; breakdown of public health systems and measures; poverty and social inequality; and war and famine. Over 1770 outbreaks/epidemics of 38 known and 2 unknown diseases were reported in the 5250 administrative units in Africa between 1970 and 2016.

 </fn> Those outbreaks include diseases with no known treatment and/or preventive vaccines, e.g., Lassa, Crimean Congo, Marburg, Rift Valley fever, Dengue, West Nile virus, Chikungunya, Zika virus, and plague. Lessons learnt from the COVID‐19‐related clinical trials will likely inform the design and implementation of clinical trials of therapies and vaccines for pathogens that are responsible for causing these outbreaks/epidemics.
