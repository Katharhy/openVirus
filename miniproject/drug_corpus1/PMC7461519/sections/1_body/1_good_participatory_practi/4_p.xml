<p>The stakeholder and communication management plan for COVID‐19‐related clinical trials will need to be developed through close collaboration between community stakeholders and the risk‐ communication and community engagement programmers for the COVID‐19 response in the countries hosting the trials. Whereas the programmers are invested in educating the public about COVID‐19 control, stakeholder and communication management for trials should be focused on education about the trial. It is important to work closely with the risk‐communication and community engagement programmers to ensure that the COVID‐19‐related messages align with and jointly promote an optimal public‐health response. The research and public health team, working in tandem to achieve the national goal, must also ensure that communication about research is clear, so that the research is not mis‐assumed to be a public health program.</p>
