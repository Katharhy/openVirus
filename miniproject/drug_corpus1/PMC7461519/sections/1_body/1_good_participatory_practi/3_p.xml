 <bold>A stakeholder engagement plan and a communications and issues management plan</bold> developed by the research team, should be based on the findings of the formative research. These plans aim to consolidate and promote relationships with a broad range of local, national, and international stakeholders such as members of representative organizations of populations eligible for the clinical trials, community leaders at clinical trial sites, civil society organizations and policy makers. The plan creates a supportive and conducive environment for the conduct of trials; and anticipate and address issues that may arise during the trials. Research teams that plan to implement COVID‐19‐related clinical trials in sub‐Saharan Africa should use audiovisuals, rather than pure text, to build literacy about COVID‐19 clinical trials.
