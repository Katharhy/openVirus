 <bold>Protocol development</bold> by the research team should be shaped by the findings from formative research with stakeholders. These findings should shape the rationale, objectives, design, methodology, statistical considerations, ethical considerations, and implementation of the trial.

 </fn> Cultural norms and practices must determine the design and conduct of clinical trials. The importance of cultural considerations in protocol development are highlighted by the debates that occurred during the conduct of clinical trials of vaccines and treatment of Ebola, and of the resolution that a placebo‐controlled randomized clinical trial, though scientifically rigorous, was not appropriate for a collectivist society like that of West Africa. During the Ebola outbreak, it was agreed that offering experimental therapy for some community members and a placebo to others, when they all faced the same risk of death, was not acceptable. In a communal society with collective values, a clinical trial that randomizes individuals within the same community to different arms of a clinical trial may be considered as pitting individuals against each other; this situation is especially problematic in the face of a deadly epidemic.

 </fn> The step‐wise design of the Ebola ca Suffit (or ‘ring’) vaccine clinical trial was rigorous enough to contribute data towards the vaccine licensure, yet did not take away communal access to the experimental product during the life of the intervention.
