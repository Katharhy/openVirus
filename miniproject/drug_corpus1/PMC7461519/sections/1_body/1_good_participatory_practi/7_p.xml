 <bold>The informed consent process</bold> requires that study participants fully understand the information needed for them to decide whether to participate in research, which must be free of coercion, undue influence or inducement, or intimidation.

 </fn> A key consideration in the informed consent process in sub‐Saharan Africa, is the engagement of third parties, who are important in the decision‐making processes of individuals – husbands, mothers‐in‐law, community leaders.

 </fn> While care should be taken to ensure that this decision making does not undermine the autonomy of women and young people, not planning for third‐party consent could be a major encumbrance for research conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa; permission of third‐party figures should be sought where needed for recruitment into trials. The permission should, however, not preclude obtaining informed consent from study participants.

 </fn> Care should be taken that the third party does not coerce participation of another person or persons. Consideration should be given also to facilitating the participation of eligible participants who are willing to give consent to study participation in the absence of permission from third‐party figures. The informed consent document and process are best developed in collaboration with community representatives to ensure that community nuances are taken into consideration.
