 <bold>Trial accrual, follow‐up, exit trial closure, results dissemination, and post‐trial access to trial products or procedures</bold> should be discussed with stakeholders, who can provide pertinent information on how to design socially and culturally acceptable strategies.

 </fn> Plans for disseminating the results of trials and strategies to manage expectations about trial results should be laid. Lessons from research on biomedical HIV prevention have shown how planning for the dissemination of trial results to stakeholders can endear continued public support for the research, despite multiple failures. At trial closure, community members are taken through possible trial outcomes, open discussions about the implications of the results are held, and consensus is reached on the next line of action. This approach has helped prevent the proliferation of negative stories about failed HIV prevention trials and, rather, helped maintain support for investment in trials.

 </fn> For COVID‐19, agreement on post‐trial access to products or diagnostics – produced with the national government as a stakeholder – are critical and pertinent, as the region has no manufacturing capacity for these items. Access to effective products can be a challenge for countries in sub‐Saharan Africa when there is a crisis of demand, as there may be for COVID‐19 diagnostic tools, which are not produced in Africa.

 </fn> Discussions with government may facilitate planning for production of study products in collaboration with regional partners, international stakeholders, and the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many countries are preparing to manufacture COVID‐19 vaccines, but with little of the discussions emanating from Africa.
