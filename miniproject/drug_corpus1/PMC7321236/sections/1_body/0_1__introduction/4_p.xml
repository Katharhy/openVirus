<p>Lopinavir and ritonavir designed and approved for the treatment of AIDS were the first protease inhibitors used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 [

 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-02529" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Both drugs were proposed as promising agents for the treatment of SARS-CoV-1 by an in silico study conducted in 2016 which had evaluated the probable activity of several HIV-1 protease inhibitors against the SARS-CoV-1 protease using docking analysis [
