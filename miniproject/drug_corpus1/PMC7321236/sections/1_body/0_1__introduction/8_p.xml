<p>As far as cleavage recognition motifs are concerned, the SARS-CoV-2 main protease cleaves the viral polyprotein at no less than 11 sites, recognizing the sequence Leu-Gln ↓ Ser/Ala/Gly [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-02529" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The HIV-1 protease recognizes nine cleavage sites in its polyprotein substrate, with sequence differences that keep the feature of cleavage, most commonly, between Phe and Pro. Alternatively, it cleaves between amino acids with hydrophobic or aromatic side chains (Tyr/Met/Leu/Phe ↓ Pro/Phe/Tyr/Ala/Leu/Met) [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-02529" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The HCV protease cleaves its polyprotein substrate at four sites, recognizing a Glu/Asp-Glu/Asp-XXX-Cys ↓ Ser general motif [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-02529" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The human organism protease DPP-4 preferentially cleaves at X ↓ Pro or X ↓ Ala sites [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-02529" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], whereas thrombin preferentially cleaves at the Gly/Ala/Val/Ile/Pro-Arg ↓ Ser/Ala/Gly/Thr/(notE/D)-X(notE/D)-Arg/(notE) motif [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-02529" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The coagulation Factor Xa cleaves after Arg, recognizing a motif Val/Pro/Ile-Gln/Asp/Glu-Phe/Gly-Arg ↓ Ser-Leu [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-02529" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Renin recognizes the sequence Ile-His-Pro-Phe-His-Leu↓ [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-02529" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], while angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) recognizes the angiotensin I sequence Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe ↓ His-Leu [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-02529" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].
