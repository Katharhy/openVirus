<p>In the present study, the 3D structure of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease was compared with the 3D structures of proteases which are drug targets with approved inhibitors. In addition, a number of approved inhibitors of the above proteases were evaluated by docking analysis for their ability to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, interacting with the active site of the enzyme.</p>
