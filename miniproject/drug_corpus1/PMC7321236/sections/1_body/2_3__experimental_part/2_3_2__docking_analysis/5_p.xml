<p>For comparison reasons, the estimated binding energy of the compounds to their initial targets was also calculated. The structures chosen were the HCV structure 2WF8 in complex with asunaprevir (center: x = 38.317, y = 14.227, z = 18.86, box x = 35, y = 40, z = 30), the DPP-4 structure 4FFW in complex with sitagliptin(center: x = 20.71, y = −9.22, z = 53.53, box x = 25, y = 25, z = 25), the a-thrombin structure 1DWE in complex with the inhibitor D-phenylalanyl-
