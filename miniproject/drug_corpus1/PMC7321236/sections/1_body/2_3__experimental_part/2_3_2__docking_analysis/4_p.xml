<p>For better estimation of the probable inhibitory effect of the selected compounds, a second protein structure of the SARS-CoV-2 protease complexed with the inhibitor 5,6,7-trihydroxy-2-phenyl-4H-chromen-4-one was also used (PDB ID: 6M2N). In this structure, both subunits were included in the PDB file and the whole enzyme constructed by the two identical subunits was used. The use of the two subunit form was preferred as it could enable the evaluation of a probable interference of the second subunit in binding of the inhibitors, since Glu166 which commonly participates in complex stabilization interacts with Ser1 of the other protein chain. The docking center was set at x = −61.73, y = −35.18, z = 23.26 and the docking box was set at x = 20, y = 20, z = 20.</p>
