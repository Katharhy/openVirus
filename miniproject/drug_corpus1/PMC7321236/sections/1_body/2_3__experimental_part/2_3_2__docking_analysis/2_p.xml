<p>The protein structures chosen from the Protein Data Bank and the docking center and docking box chosen for each docking analysis were as follows: for docking analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease enzyme, the structure 6LU7 of the enzyme in a complex with the competitive inhibitor N3 (xavlxx:

 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-02529" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] was used. This was the first enzyme structure in complex with an inhibitor that was released in the Protein Data Bank on March 18th, 2020 and was the only one available when the preliminary docking studies of this research were performed. Although the enzyme is in the form of a dimer of identical subunits, only one subunit was available in the form of a PDB file at the PubMed structure. The docking center was kept at x = âˆ’10.46, y = 4.1037, and z = 73.009 and the docking box was set at x = 30, y = 40, and z = 25 to surround the binding site of the inhibitor (active site of the enzyme).
