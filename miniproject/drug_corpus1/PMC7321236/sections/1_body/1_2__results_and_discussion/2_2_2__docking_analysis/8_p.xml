<p>In the case of the substrate analogue N3, in addition to polar or hydrophobic interactions, a hydrogen bond (Hb) is formed between the His163 side chain and O of the lactam ring which serves as a mimetic of the Gln amino acid of the natural substrate [

A second Hb is formed between the H of the closest to the lactam ring NH group of the backbone of the ligand and the CO of the main chain of His164 of the enzyme, while the NH group of the backbone of Leu amino acid of the ligand interacts with the CO of the backbone of Gln189 of the enzyme. The lactam ring as a mimetic of the Gln amino acid of the substrate is also present at the structure of the a-ketomide inhibitors designed by Zang et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-02529" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In this case, the H of the NH group of the lactam ring forms two hydrogen bonds with the CO of the main chain of Phe140 and the carboxylate of Glu166, while the CO oxygen of the lactam moiety forms a hydrogen bond with the imidazole of His163. In the most active compound of this series, the P2 Leu of the natural substrate has been replaced by a cyclopropane, while the pyridon ring at the P3 position participates in complex stabilization through hydrogen bonds with the O of the side chain of Gln189 and the NH of the main chain of Glu166.
