<p>In linagliptin, the N of the piperidine ring participates in hydrogen bond interactions with the O of the CO group of the main chain of Glu166 of the S1 subsite, while the NH
 <sub>2</sub> substituent of the ring forms Hb with Pro168. The His41 of the S2 subsite participates in complex stabilization by polar interaction with the N atom of the methylquinazoline and by hydrophobic and pi interactions with the carbons of this moiety, while Met49 also forms hydrophobic interactions. Additional stabilization is achieved by the interaction of Met165 with the dihydropurine moiety (
