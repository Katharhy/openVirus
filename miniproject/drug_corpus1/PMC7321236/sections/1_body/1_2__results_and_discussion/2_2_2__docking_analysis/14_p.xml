<p>In the case of melagatran, a curved conformation is adopted. The catalytic amino acid, Cys145, forms hydrophobic interactions with cyclohexan, while Asn144 of the S1 subsite strongly contributes to complex stabilization via polar interaction with the 
 <italic>N</italic> atom of the aminoacetyl acid group. At the S2 subsite, the NH group of the side chain of His41 participates in hydrogen interaction with the O of the methyl carbamoyl bridge, while Met49 is involved in hydrophobic interactions with the phenyl ring of the molecule. In addition, the OH group of the nearby Ser46 participates in hydrogen bond formation with the NH
 <sub>2</sub> of the benzimidamide group (
