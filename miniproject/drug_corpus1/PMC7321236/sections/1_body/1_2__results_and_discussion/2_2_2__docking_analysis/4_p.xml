<p>Docking analysis of both SARS-CoV-2 protease structures gave similar results. Interestingly, 20 out of the 24 compounds which were selected for evaluation exhibited lower estimated binding energy than the initial inhibitor of the 6M2N structure (−7.45 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>) [

 <sup>−1</sup>) [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-02529" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Docking of the compounds to the target proteases for which they were designed showed a generally higher binding probability (lower estimated binding energy) for the initial targets compared to the SARS-CoV-2 protease but the most active compounds showed comparable results for the two targets. For example, faldaprevir exhibited an estimated binding energy of −11.27 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup> for the SARS-CoV-2 protease and −11.15 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup> for the HCV protease, while teneligliptin showed −9.87 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup> for the new protease and −9.16 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup> for its initial target.
