<p>The two above substrates constitute peptidomimetics with peptide bonds between amino acid mimetic moieties. In both cases, the catalytic amino acid Cys145 forms a covalent bond with the ligand. Most of the approved drugs proposed as SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitors according to in silico studies are not peptidomimetics. According to docking analysis, various groups may be placed at the S1 subsite such as the 7-methoxy-8-methyl-quinoline moiety of simeprevir [
