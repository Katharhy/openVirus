<p>Since the evaluation of the randomly selected HCV protease, DPP-4, Î±-thrombin and coagulation Factor Xa inhibitors showed promising results, we proceeded to the evaluation of a more extended sample of approved drugs of these categories, including a number of drugs currently in phase III clinical trial (

 <xref rid="molecules-25-02529-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). For better estimation of the probable inhibitory effect of the selected compounds, a second protein structure of the SARS-CoV-2 protease was also used (PDB ID: 6M2N). The whole enzyme, including both protease subunits, was selected for the process. For comparison reasons, the estimated binding energy of the compounds to their initial targets were also calculated. For the same reasons, for some of the most promising SARS-CoV-2 candidate inhibitors, the estimated binding energy to the HIV-1 4RVJ protease structure was calculated.
