<p>Hydrophobic moieties at distances of approximately 9 Å, 11 Å, 14 Å and 16 Å are present in all potent compounds. Met165, His41, Cys44, Cys145, Leu167 of the Mpro active site are mainly involved in hydrophobic and pi interactions, with a maximum distance between them of approximately 18 Å (

Polar or hydrogen donor/acceptor moieties are present at multiple distances, with a distance of 8 Å being common in active compounds. Glu166 and His 41, at a distance of approximately 13 Å, participate in hydrogen bond and polar interactions of the most potent gliptins (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02529-f006">Figure 6</xref>), while Ser46, Thr25 and Asn142, at a distance of approximately 12 Å, participate in hydrogen bond formation of faldaprevir. In the SARS-CoV-2 protease, amino acids involved in hydrophobic and polar interactions are distributed in all the active sites, although pi interactions are mostly observed at the region of His41. Distances of approximately 5 Å, 9 Å, 11 Å and 16 Å are observed between amino acids participating in polar and hydrophobic interactions.
