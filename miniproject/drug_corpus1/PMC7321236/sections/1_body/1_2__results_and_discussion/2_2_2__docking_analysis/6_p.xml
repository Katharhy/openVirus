<p>Teneligliptin and gemigliptin are the most promising drugs among the DPP-4 inhibitors. In the group of anti-coagulants, inogartan and argatroban of the first randomly selected compounds were the most promising among a-thrombin inhibitors and edoxaban among Factor Xa inhibitors. Docking analysis of the whole enzyme indicated that the enzyme active site is the first preferred binding site for all the HCV protease and DPP-4 inhibitors presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-02529-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> but the third preferred site for inogatran and the second for edoxaban. Consequently, the expected inhibitory action of inogatran and edoxaban are to be lower than that predicted based on their relative binding energy to the active site. In conclusion, faldaprevir, teneligliptin and gemigliptin are the compounds expected to exhibit the highest activity against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.
