<p>In the case of thrombin inhibitors, a number of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions mainly stabilize the complex. His41, Ser46 and Met49 participate in hydrogen bond formation between melagatran and Mpro enzyme, while Leu27, His41, Met49 and Cys145 are involved in hydrophobic interactions. Although these interactions lead to a substantially low estimated binding energy of the compound, the significantly higher hydrogen bonds, pi bonds, polar and hydrophobic interactions may be responsible for the much better prediction results for binding to the initial protease target. Ala189, Ala190, Gly219, Cys191, Cys220, Trp215, His 57 and Leu99 seem to be involved in binding to thrombin.</p>
