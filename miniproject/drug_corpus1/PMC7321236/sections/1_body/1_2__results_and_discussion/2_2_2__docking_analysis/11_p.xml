<p>In gemigliptin, the tetrahydropyridine ring and the 2-amino-4-oxobutyl bridge are placed at the S1 subsite between Glu166 and Cys145. A hydrogen bond between the CO group of the backbone of Glu166 and the NH
 <sub>2</sub> group of the 2-amino-4-oxobutyl bridge contributes to complex stabilization, while Cys145 participates in hydrophobic interactions with carbons of the bicyclic moiety (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02529-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The trifluoromethyl pyrimidine moiety interacts with His41 of the S2 subsite which stabilizes the complex by halogen bond formation with the F atoms and pi interactions with the pyrimidine ring. Halogen bonds are also formed between the F atoms of the fluoropiperidinone ring and amino acids Val186, Arg188 and Thr190.
