<p>To investigate this possibility further, we proceeded to docking analysis of randomly selected approved or on-trial inhibitors of the selected proteases (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-02529-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). An exception from the random selection was made for the HIV-1 inhibitors where lopinavir and ritonavir were selected because they have already been proposed for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. The rest of the drugs that were selected are the anti-HCV drugs telaprevir and boceprevir, the DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin, the renin inhibitor alisliren, the ACE inhibitor captopril, the thrombin direct inhibitors argatroban and dabigatran and the coagulation Factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban.
