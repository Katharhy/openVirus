<p>The structural similarity between the SARS-CoV-2 protease and some of the selected proteases, in combination with the existence of the same amino acids at certain positions of the substrate cleavage site, such as Ser at the P1â€™ position of the recognition sequence of the HCV protease and thrombin are promising features in the effort to identify effective SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitors among the approved drugs of the selected proteases.</p>
