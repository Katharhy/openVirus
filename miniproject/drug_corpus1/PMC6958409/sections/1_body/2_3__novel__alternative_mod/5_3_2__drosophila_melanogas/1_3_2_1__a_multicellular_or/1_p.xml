<p>Unlike yeast, the fruit fly 
 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (
 <italic>Drosophila</italic>) is a multicellular organism. It has served, therefore, as a model for not only studying intracellular processes, but also for addressing the mechanisms of development and differentiation, and the functions of tissues and organs [
 <xref rid="B197-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">197</xref>]. At the same time, similar to the yeast model, 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> is highly permissive to genetic manipulations, convenient and cheap to handle in the laboratory and has a short life span. These characteristics made it a pivotal model in biology and a variety of powerful experimental tools have been developed, including a library of mutants, mechanisms for tissue-specific expression, protocols for high-throughput screening for mutants and drugs, as well as the ability to control gene expression via RNAi [

 <xref rid="B198-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>,
 <xref rid="B199-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>]. Also, some 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic>-derived cell lines are available, allowing scientists to address biological questions at the tissue-culture level in parallel to verification and advancing at the whole-organism level [
 <xref rid="B200-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">200</xref>]. Taking advantage of the unusual properties of this fly, in combination with the effective experimental tools, it was possible to establish fly models for most critical human diseases. For example, expression in the fly of mutated α-synuclein caused loss of dopaminergic neurons and other effects that recapitulate the essential features of Parkinson’s disease [

 <xref rid="B202-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>]). Furthermore, genes that are defective in Alzheimer’s disease (e.g., Amyloid β; Tau) are conserved in 
 <italic>Drosophila,</italic> allowing their study in the simple system [

 <xref rid="B204-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">204</xref>]. The conservation of most processes responsible for metabolism and homeostasis, growth and development between 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals made it an excellent model for studying obesity, diabetes and aging (reviewed in Galikova et al., 2018 [
 <xref rid="B205-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">205</xref>]; Inoue et al., 2018 [
 <xref rid="B206-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>]) and for investigating oncogenic pathways and cancer (reviewed in Mirzoyan et al., 2019 [
 <xref rid="B207-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>]; Enomoto, 2018 [
 <xref rid="B208-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">208</xref>]). Notably, the concept of ‘tumor suppressors’ and the discovery of the first ‘recessive oncogene’ were established in 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> [
