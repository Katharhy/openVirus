<p>The 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> model was used to report that influenza NS1 was able to suppress RNA-silencing-based antiviral response (RSAR), which is a host defense against RNA viruses [
 <xref rid="B227-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">227</xref>]. A cell-based screen was performed using 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells to identify new RNA silencing suppressors. The coding sequence of GFP was used in-frame with the start of B2 ORF of flock house virus (FHV) RNA1 to obtain pFR1gfp. This was based on the previous observation that FHV B2 could inhibit the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway in FHV infection [

Using this technique, where GFP would be expressed once the RNAi pathway was silenced, it was observed that co-transfection of NS1 (A/WSN/1933 (H1N1)) plasmid with pFR1gfp plasmid could rescue GFP expression. This result shows that influenza NS1 functions as a RNA silencing suppressor through its N-terminal dsRNA-binding domain. It was shown that a single D92E mutation in NS1 increased the rescue efficiency of pFR1-ΔB2 (FR1 gene mutant that carried an untranslatable B2, similar to the pFR1grp) compared to WT A/NS1, which is associated with lethal H5N1 influenza A virus [

 <xref rid="B199-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>]. Upon induction of these transgenes in tissue-specific drivers, it was observed that NS1A was not an effective inhibitor of RNA silencing in transgenic flies. A later study reported that NS1 does not suppress RNAi in mammalian cells, an observation that supported the findings in 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> [
 <xref rid="B230-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">230</xref>]. Using the same fly system to study NS1 function, NS1 cDNA from A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) strain was expressed specifically in the wing. NS1 expression caused an increase of the distance between wing veins, a phenotype indicative of spatially broadened hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Several known mutations inserted into NS1 did not alter the Hh-modulating activity of NS1 in the fly’s wing. Yet, an unbiased mutagenesis screen provided a new NS1 mutation, A122V, located in the effector domain, which reduced the NS1-induced wing phenotype. Different Hh modulation among various viral strains exists (Udorn, swine flu and PR8), with the PR8 strain having the highest Hh modulation activity. Confirming the new effects of NS1, it was observed that Hh gene expression is altered in influenza-infected mice. In addition, the PR8-A122V virus was found to be more pathogenic than the PR8-WT virus in mice, suggesting that lower levels of Hh target gene induction may be protective against influenza infection [
