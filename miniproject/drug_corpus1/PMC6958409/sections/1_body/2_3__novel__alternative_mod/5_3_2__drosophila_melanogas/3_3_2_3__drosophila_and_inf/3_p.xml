<p>An RNAi screen in 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell culture was used to identify new host genes required for viral replication and demonstrate the feasibility of using this system for genome screens in influenza [
 <xref rid="B232-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">232</xref>]. Notably, a particular disadvantage of fly cells with respect to influenza is the fact that they do not express the influenza virus receptor α2,6-linked sialic acid, which is required for viral attachment to cells. Therefore, a modified virus, Flu-VSV-G, was designed, in which the HA and NA genes were replaced to encode the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) glycoprotein G. With these modifications, the influenza virus was able to enter 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells. A screen for host genes that affected virus-directed luciferase expression was carried out with Flu-VSV-G-R.luc (which expressed the 
 <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase gene) and an RNAi library against 13,701 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes (~90% of all genes). A total of 176 of the screened genes inhibited luciferase expression, as identified in two independent tests. Several human homologues of encoding components in host machineries that are known to be involved in life cycle of the virus, e.g., 
 <italic>ATP6V0D1</italic> (endocytosis pathway), 
 <italic>COX6A1</italic> (mitochondrial pathway) and 
 <italic>NXF1/TAP</italic> (mRNA nuclear export machinery) were selected by the authors showing the importance of the 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> system in the discovery of novel influenza virus–host targets.
