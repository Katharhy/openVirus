<p>Several studies have focused specifically on ATI cells, revealing an important transcription factor Nrf2 in the host-response to influenza, inducing the transcription of HO-1, important in the antioxidant defense system [
 <xref rid="B291-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">291</xref>]. Overexpression of Nrf2 protected cells from infection as it decreased viral replication and increased IL-8 expression, which may be due to increased GSH levels observed with Nrf2 overexpression. To study viral effects of specific mutations, recombinant viruses of NY1682 with PB2-D701N were used to infect ATI cells [
 <xref rid="B292-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">292</xref>]. The NY1682-D701N was observed to have higher titers than the wild type virus and there were lower levels of IFN-Î», which represents an important antiviral type III interferon in ATI cells. While the PB2-D701N substitution has been shown to cause increased viral replication in mice and guinea pigs [
