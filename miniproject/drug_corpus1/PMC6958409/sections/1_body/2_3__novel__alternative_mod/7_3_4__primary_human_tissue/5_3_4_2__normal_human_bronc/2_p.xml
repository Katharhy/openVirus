<p>To validate these cells as a model for influenza, NHBE cells were compared with MDCK cells and NHBE cells were found to have better correlative data in terms of replication abilities of live attenuated viruses isolated from different strains [

This reflects that NHBE cells were able to better model virus replication and infectivity of various viral strains from human and avian sources in humans compared to MDCK cells. Histological and electron microscopy studies revealed that NHBE morphology was similar to that of carina and distal trachea. The conjugated NY312-AF594 virus (A/NY/312/01) was shown to have similar binding patterns in NHBE cells as to those observed with human respiratory tissues. The replication kinetics of pandemic 2009 virus strain (A/CA/04/2009 (H1N1)) were similar to the NY312 virus in NHBE [
