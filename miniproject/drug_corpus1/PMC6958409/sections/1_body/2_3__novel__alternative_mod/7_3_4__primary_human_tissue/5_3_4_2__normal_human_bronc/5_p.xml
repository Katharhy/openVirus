<p>NHBE cells have been used to provide a better understanding of the host response to influenza infection in the bronchial tissues. Proteomic studies performed with human NHBE infected in vitro have revealed signaling pathways which could be important, including RhoA-associated signaling pathway (RhoA is a GTPase that regulates actin cytoskeleton[
 <xref rid="B279-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">279</xref>]) and reduced Hippo signaling (required to suppress virus-induced interferon production) [

 <xref rid="B281-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">281</xref>] identified proteins which were associated with host cell defense response, endocytosis and GTPase activity. Influenza virus was also found to increase apoptosis and pyroptosis [

For example, TVB024 (a small molecule inhibitor against ATPase) was tested and found to inhibit viral replication in patient NHBE cells [
 <xref rid="B284-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">284</xref>]. The results were confirmed in bronchial explants obtained from the same patients. Using TVB024 prophylactically, the combination of TVB024 and oseltamivir reduced viral shedding and this was more effective than oseltamivir alone in inhibiting epithelial infection. In addition, infected NHBE cells were used to predict patients’ response to H7N9 infection [
 <xref rid="B285-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">285</xref>]. Viral RNA levels in cells taken from older patients (≥65 years) were significantly lower compared to young patients. Obese patients tended to have increased viral RNA levels but lower cytokine levels. Finally, NHBE cells were used as an ex vivo model to test DAS181 efficacy in removing sialic acid and inhibiting influenza infection [
 <xref rid="B286-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">286</xref>]. Given these results, DAS181 has currently reached phase II clinical trials [
