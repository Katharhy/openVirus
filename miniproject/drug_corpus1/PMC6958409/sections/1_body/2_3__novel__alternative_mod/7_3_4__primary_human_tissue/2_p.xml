<p>The ability of the primary culture to faithfully preserve properties of the original tissue is exemplified in the primary lung cells that secrete a class of proteases that can cleave influenza HA for viral entry [
 <xref rid="B247-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">247</xref>], and when cultured at air-liquid interface (ALI), undergo polarization and produce mucus [
 <xref rid="B248-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">248</xref>]. At ALI, the mucus readily forms about a week after air exposure and can shield the virus from escaping apically into the liquid medium. This forces the virus to travel laterally to the neighboring cell, similarly to the events occurred in a natural infection [
