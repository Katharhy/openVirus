<p>The zebrafish 
 <italic>(Danio rerio)</italic> belongs to the 
 <italic>Cyprinidae</italic> family, the same family as the carp and the goldfish. It has been a model of choice that bridge the gap between lower animals and mammals. As vertebrates, zebrafish are closer to humans than fruit flies on the evolutionary scale. Compared to mice, they are easier to work with and study. The benefits of the zebrafish is that it has a fully developed immune system [

 <italic>M. marinum</italic>, a bacteria species used to model tuberculosis (which is the same genus as 
 <italic>M. marinum</italic>) in zebrafish [
