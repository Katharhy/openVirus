<p>In the context of the influenza A virus (IAV), zebrafish embryos were reported to have α2,6-linked sialic acids, which enables the virus to enter and infect the embryos. Local infection of 5 days post-fertilization (dpf) embryos in the swimbladder resulted in zebrafish mortality. Moreover, antiviral genes were found to be induced in the fish, particularly

Microscopy and histopathological analysis of the zebrafish found edema and tissue destruction similar to those observed in human infection. At 48 hours of infection with PR8, necrosis of the liver and gill tissues were also observed. With X-31 infection, there was necrosis of the renal hemopoietic tissue. Moreover, treatment with zanamivir, beginning with 3 hpi, was found to be protective against IAV infection by reducing mortality, viral replication and burden using a GFP-tagged NS1 in PR8. Hence, zebrafish can serve as a model for studying host-virus interaction and for drug screening [
