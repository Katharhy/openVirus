<p>2 dpf zebrafish were infected with PR8 and muscle fiber damage was observed [
 <xref rid="B244-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">244</xref>]. Muscle damage seemed to worsen at 48 hpi compared to 24 hpi. A NS1-GFP virus showed that the virus infected skeletal muscles of the fish. Using transgenic 
 <italic>(fli1:gfp)</italic> zebrafish, in which GFP expression was controlled by an endothelial-specific promoter, IAV increases vascular permeability and compromised sarcolemma integrity. There was also failure of the muscle fiber-ECM adhesion, which resulted in muscle fiber death. This effect could be due to pro-inflammatory innate immune signaling cascades being induced via the NFkB pathway (suggested by using NFkB reporter line

 </italic> where GFP expression was controlled by the neutrophil-specific myeloperoxidase (
 <italic>mpo</italic>) promoter, it was reported that neutrophils infiltrated muscle tissue and was localized to the unanchored end of retracted fibers after infection [
 <xref rid="B244-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">244</xref>]. This could be mediated by the p38 MAPK, Rho/ROCK and PKC pathways [
 <xref rid="B244-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">244</xref>]. Finally, using a zebrafish muscular dystrophy model 
 <italic>(sapje/dmd)</italic>, infected zebrafish were found to have severe muscle degeneration in almost every muscle segment, with increased mortality at 4 and 5 dpi compared to the PBS injected mutant zebrafish. These studies clearly display zebrafish as a relevant model for influenza studies.
