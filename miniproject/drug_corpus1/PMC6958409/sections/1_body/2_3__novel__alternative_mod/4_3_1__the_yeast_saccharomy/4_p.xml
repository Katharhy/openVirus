<p>In cases where viral proteins impose an easily measurable phenotype on the yeast cells or in cases where the purified protein is an active enzyme, the systems could be used for the isolation of new inhibitors (molecules that reverse the phenotype or the activity) via high-throughput, rapid and efficient screens. Part of the Fujian H5N1 strain virus NA (HNA) was expressed in yeast and was shown to be functional and could be inhibited upon addition of oseltamivir and zanamivr [

The toxicity imposed on yeast by of NS1 expression has indeed been harnessed for drug screening. Approximately 2000 compounds from the National Cancer Institute Diversity Set library were screened for compounds that would restore normal growth. Of the nine compounds identified, two were found to be toxic to MDCK cells and three showed no activity against influenza virus replication. Of the other four, three were able to activate anti-viral IFN-β in MDCK cells in a similar way to cells infected with delNS1 virus (virus lacking NS1) [

One of the derivatives, termed compound 63, was found to inhibit the native M2, and, importantly, also S31N- and V27A-mutated M2 protein, which are amantadine-resistant mutants [
