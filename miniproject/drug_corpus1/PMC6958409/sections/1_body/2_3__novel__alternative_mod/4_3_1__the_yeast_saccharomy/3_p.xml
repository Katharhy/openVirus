<p>The yeast model and the powerful tools that come with it have been assisting influenza research in several ways. A common approach is expressing the viral proteins in yeast and thus, studying the properties of single viral proteins in an isolated in vivo environment. In 1985, A/WSN/1933 HA was expressed in 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, and it was found that the HA protein was glycosylated and membrane bound [

Also, yeast cells expressing HA were found to lose the expressing plasmid overtime, a phenomenon that may indicate the protein’s toxicity. The yeast system was used to study structure–function relationships within the HA protein by expressing different deletion mutants. HA500 (lacking the C-terminal transmembrane anchor and cytoplasmic domain) and HA325 (containing only HA1 region and lacking the entire HA2 region) were glycosylated and stable compared to the other mutants [
 <xref rid="B127-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. However, HA500 was retained intracellularly, while HA325 was found to be secreted to the extracellular medium and was hyperglycosylated. This demonstrated the usefulness of yeast for studying structure-function relationships of important influenza proteins and the properties of mutated viral proteins. NS1 and NS2 were expressed via a copper inducible promoter [

 <xref rid="B129-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>] and NS1 expression was found to be toxic and to be localized to the nuclear fraction [
 <xref rid="B128-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>], while NS2 was similarly localized to the nucleus in yeast, but was not toxic [
 <xref rid="B129-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. Hence, yeast can also be used to study subcellular localization of the viral protein and its impact on cellular function. Expression of the M2 ion channel in yeast affected growth [
 <xref rid="B130-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>] and the use of a reversible M2 channel inhibitor, BL-1743, caused an increase in transmembrane proton flux due to the re-establishment of the proton gradient by M2. Interestingly, when the influenza PA-X protein was expressed in yeast, 29 unintended mutations appeared in PA-X. 24 of the PA-X mutants seem relevant to mammalian systems as they caused a reduced antiviral shutoff activity when tested in mammalian cells [
 <xref rid="B131-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. These models proved useful for characterizing the localization and function of the viral protein, for identifying potential mutation sites and for recognizing host processes affected by the viral protein. It seems, however, that the full potential of yeast as a model for understanding each viral protein has not been harnessed yet.
