<p>As mentioned above, mammalian models, animals and cell lines, are obviously biologically relevant for influenza studies but do possess serious limitations. Prominent drawbacks of these systems are their weak permissiveness for biochemical and genetic methods. In addition, the mammalian systems are intricate, putting significant obstacles in addressing the specific direct effects of the virus on cellular metabolome, proteome and transcriptome. Finally, these systems are not very handy for high-throughput screening for mutants, inhibitors and interacting proteins. </p>
