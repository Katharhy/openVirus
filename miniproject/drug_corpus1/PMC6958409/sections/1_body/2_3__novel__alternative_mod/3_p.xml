<p>Below we provide a summary of how yeast, 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> and zebrafish have been used so far better understanding of influenza. In addition, the use of primary human cells derived from patients provides advantages and benefits that current immortal cell lines do not. As these cells are prepared from patients, they can be used immediately at the translational level. The primary cells are the only system that enables the study of patient factors, prediction of drug effects on individual patients (personalized medicine) and understanding of environmental and social factors on the disease. While many simple model organisms, such as 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic>, have been used for other biological research, no influenza studies have been attempted in these models and will not be discussed in the review.
