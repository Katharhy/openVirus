<p>To date, only two antiviral drug classes, with some usefulness, are available and very few are under development or in trials [
 <xref rid="B8-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The drugs available in the clinic are Matrix 2 (M2) ion channel inhibitors, (e.g., amantadine and rimantadine) and neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (e.g., oseltamivir and zanamivir) [
 <xref rid="B6-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The emergence of resistant virus strains have rendered M2 inhibitors useless and there is also growing resistance against NA inhibitors such as the H274Y mutation found in the 2009 H1N1 strain that made the virus oseltamivir-resistant [

 <xref rid="B22-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, there is an obvious fitness cost to viruses holding NA resistance which results in low frequency of such mutations over the years. Newer drugs, such as favipiravir, a nucleotide analog that targets the viral polymerase approved in Japan, and baloxavir marboxil, which is a cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor, have been approved in Japan and the US [
 <xref rid="B23-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], with pimodivir, a PB2 inhibitor, having pre-approval access by the FDA (NCT03834376). Some new drugs are being tested (C10)(C11) in clinical trials, including DAS181 (removes sialic acid receptors from glycan structures), Nitazoxamide (interferes with HA assembly) and HA monoclonal antibodies, such as VIS410 and MHAA4549A [
 <xref rid="B24-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. There are potential drugs, such as a class of compounds called naphthalimides, which antagonize NS1. This class of compounds has yet to undergo future development and reach clinical trials [
