<p>The influenza virus life cycle can be divided into the following stages: host cell entry, uncoating, viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) entry into the nucleus, transcription and translation of the viral genome, vRNPs export from the nucleus, viral assembly at the host cell and budding through the plasma membrane [

The acidification within the endosome (assisted by the M2 ion channel) induces the viral envelope to fuse with the endosome. The fusion releases viral contents, which are the genetic material in the form of vRNPs. Viral replication occurs via synthesis of the positive-sense intermediate. Transcription of negative RNA into positive sense mRNA creates the proper platform for translation of viral proteins. Viral proteins and vRNPs migrate to the plasma membrane and are bundled into new virions. The new virions then bud from the plasma membrane to infect other cells [
