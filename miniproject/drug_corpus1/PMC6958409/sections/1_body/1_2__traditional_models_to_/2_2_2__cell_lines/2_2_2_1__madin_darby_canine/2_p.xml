<p>Based on the observation that MDCK cells support multiple rounds of virus replication, up to 35 serial passages, it was proposed that dogs might be natural hosts of the virus [

 <xref rid="B62-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]). This compound was able to inhibit plaque formation in MDCK cells even up to 72 hours post infection (hpi) with A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) (PR8) virus. T-705 also inhibited viral growth at MOIs of 0.0001 to 1 and its activity was not affected by virus multiplicity. In cells that were treated with T-705 at 1 μg/mL, both supernatant and cells had up to 1000 times lower virus yields than non-treated controls. When the dose of T-705 was increased to 10 μg/mL, no productive infection was observed. The drug was then further tested in mice and is now approved in Japan for treatment of influenza infection [
