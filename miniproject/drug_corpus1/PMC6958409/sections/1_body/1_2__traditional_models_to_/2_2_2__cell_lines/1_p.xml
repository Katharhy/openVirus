<p>Influenza was initially shown to infect human embryo lung and kidney and primary monkey kidney cells [

 <xref rid="B42-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]). Also, cell lines that cannot be infected could still absorb the virus upon transfection of viral DNA using reverse genetic approaches where plasmids containing viral cDNA are introduced into the cells [
 <xref rid="B43-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Some cell lines are far more widely used than others, mainly due to better replication of the virus or because of their physiological relevance. In addition, there are current efforts to use various cell lines such as MDCK and HEK293 cells for vaccine production (reviewed in Milian E., et al., 2015 [
 <xref rid="B44-pharmaceuticals-12-00147" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]). The most widely used, MDCK and the immortal lung-derived cell lines A549 and Calu-3, HEK293 and Vero cells, are described below.
