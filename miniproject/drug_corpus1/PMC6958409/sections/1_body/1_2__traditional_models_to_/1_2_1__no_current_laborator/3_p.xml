<p>In the course of the establishment of immortal cell lines, some of those have been found to be infectable with influenza. Prominent examples are Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK), Vero cells, Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293 and lung epithelial cells such as A549 and Calu-3. In addition to the models used for studying the entire scope of infection and viral life cycle, new insights into influenza could be derived from studying the intrinsic biochemical properties, structure-function relationships and specific functions of each viral protein. These aspects cannot be studied in the context of cellular or animal infection as the proteins may be regulated and controlled by the complex mammalian machinery. </p>
