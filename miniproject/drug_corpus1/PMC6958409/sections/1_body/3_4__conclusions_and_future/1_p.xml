<p>Although it may seem not relevant on a first glance, when studying aspects of influenza infection in yeast, 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> and zebrafish provide knowledge and a conceptual understanding that could not have been obtained in other experimental systems. The use of primary cultures, primarily with patient-derived cultures, is also of great value for personalized medicine and for understanding social and behavioral aspects of the disease. In spite of this understanding and in spite of the proven achievements, alternative models still remain underutilized. In fact, the 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> and zebrafish systems are in their infancy of contributing to the field of influenza research and the vast potential they hold in helping better understand of influenza awaits more extensive use of these models. Most of the studies carried out so far in yeast and 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> were specific to a given viral protein or for a specific host protein. And yet, only several of the influenza proteins have been expressed in yeast, flies and fish. In addition, the whole virus has yet to be reconstituted in yeast.
