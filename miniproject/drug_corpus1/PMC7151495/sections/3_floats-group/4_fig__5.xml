  <p>The excision step catalyzed by nsp14. Close-up of nsp14 ExoN active site (PDB: 5NFY). Modelling of active site ions and RNA was done using a superimposition of the related Lassa virus ExoN structure complexed with RNA and ions (PDB: 4FVU and 4GV9). 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Reference position of RNA and ions in the excision of an RNA 3â€²-end nucleotide. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Position of RNA and ions in the case of GS-441524-MP excision. GS-441524-MP is structurally superimposed to the ribose of nucleotide in position of 
   <bold>A</bold>. The distorted base of GS-441524-MP would force the ribose to move in place of the ions preventing the proper distances for an efficient two metal ion catalysis to happen. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Same view as 
   <bold>B</bold> detailed with catalytic (DEED) and binding residues (FHN) in stick and transparent surface.
