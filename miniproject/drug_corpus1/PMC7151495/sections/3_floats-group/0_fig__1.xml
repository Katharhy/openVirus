   <bold>(A)</bold> Amino acid sequence alignment of selected coronavirus nsp12 protein, including: SARS-CoV2 (YP_009724389), SARS-CoV (NC_004718); BatHK9 (NC_009021). SARS-CoV2 nsp12 secondary structure (derived from PDB: 6NUR) is indicated on top. Fully conserved residues are in red font and boxed, whereas partially conserved residues are displayed in red font (above 70% conservation). A consensus sequence is generated using same criteria uppercase is identity, “.” is no consensus, ! is any of I,V; $ is any of L,M, % is any of F,Y; # is any of N,D,Q,E,B,Z. Red star marked the mutation between SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV. The NiRAN and the polymerase domains are separated by a dashed line. The polymerase conserved motifs (A–G) are shown under the consensus sequence. Alignments were made using Seaview (

   <bold>(B)</bold> Cartoon representation of nsp12 SARS-CoV (PDB: 6NUR). The motifs are colored as follows: A, yellow; B, cyan; C, orange; D, forest green; E, blue; F, pink; G, light green. Around the structure are WebLogo (
   <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Crooks et al., 2004</xref>) highlighting the A-G motifs. All structural models were made using Chimera (
