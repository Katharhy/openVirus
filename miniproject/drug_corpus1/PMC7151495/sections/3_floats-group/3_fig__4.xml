   <bold>(A)</bold> Amino acid sequence alignment of selected coronavirus nsp14 proteins: SARS-CoV-2 (YP_009724389), SARS-CoV (NC_004718); BatHK9 (NC_009021). SARS-CoV nsp14 secondary structure (derived from PDB: 5NFY) is indicated on top. Fully conserved residues are in red and boxed, whereas partially conserved residues are displayed in red only (above 70% conservation). A consensus sequence is generated using same criteria as in 
   <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. Residues marked with a red star show polymorphisms between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. The N-terminal exonuclease (ExoN) and C-terminal methyltransferase domains are separated by a dashed vertical line. The ExoN catalytic residues (motifs I, II, and III) are underlined in orange. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Cartoon representation of the crystal structure of the nsp14 SARS-CoV (PDB: 5NFY). The nsp14 ExoN domain, catalytic site is highlighted in orange; and star residues are shown in red. None of the mutations are in the vicinity of the catalytic site.
