 <caption>
  <p>Cartoon representation of nsp12 SARS-CoV polymerase domain (PDB: 6NUR) pre-incorporation of GS-441524-TP and mutation mapping. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Top view of V 557 with RNA strands and NTP in pre-incorporation position. V 557 forms a hydrophobic wall upon which the template base is stacked. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Close up of RNA strands with GS-441524-TP in a pre-incorporation position at the catalytic site. Template strand is in blue, newly synthesised strand is in light green, and GS-441524-TP in purple. Key residues of active site (from motif A, B and C) are shown in stick and labelled. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Remdesivir resistance mutations highlighted in red on the cartoon representation of nsp12 SARS-CoV polymerase domain. F 480 faces a patch of hydrophobic residues shown in green that indirectly impact motif B (in cyan). V 557 is located on the side of the template groove and is at the end of motif F (in pink). NTP in pre-incorporation position is shown in stick. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> View of the newly synthesised RNA in mix representation stick from position 1 to 4 and ribbon for position five and above, for clarity reason template RNA is not shown. Shown is a NTP in a pre-incorporation position and newly nascent RNA. In position +4 the conserved R 858 is poised to make a steric clash with the 1â€²-CN group of GS-441524 once it has been incorporated and translocated.
