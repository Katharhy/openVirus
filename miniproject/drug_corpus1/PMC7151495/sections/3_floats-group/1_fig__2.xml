   <bold>(A)</bold> Cartoon representation of nsp12 SARS-CoV-2 with spatial arrangement of RdRp motifs complexed with a modelled RNA template (blue) and neo synthesised (light green). Models are derived from either PDB model 6NUR or 6M71; the latter has a 2.9 Å resolution (biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.993386v1.full.pdf) and they exhibit a RMSD of 0.612 Å over 790 amino acids, which means that the model is valid in both. Color code is the same as in 
   <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Close up of the NTP entry and catalytic sites with NTP in position to be incorporated. Position of RNA and NTP was obtained by superimposition of references crystal structures of poliovirus and T7 RNA polymerases elongation complexes (PDB 4K4S and 1S76). 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Chemical structures of nucleotides discussed throughout the manuscript including: 
   <bold>(a)</bold> ATP 
   <bold>(b)</bold> GS-441524-TP 
   <bold>(c)</bold> Remdesivir.
