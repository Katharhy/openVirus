<p id="p0045">To date, neither prophylactic nor therapeutic options are available for the control or treatment of any human CoV. Recent compassionate clinical trials of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as well as Remdesivir (see below) have been conducted, and await publication in scientific journals. The rapid global emergence of SARS-CoV-2 outlines the importance of and immediate need for antivirals. Potential broad-spectrum targets include viral gene products that are widely conserved and do not exist in the host cell, or that are structurally and functionally different enough from cellular homologous to achieve selective inhibition. For RNA viruses, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) presents an optimal target due to its crucial role in RNA synthesis, lack of host homolog and high sequence and structural conservation. The RdRp remains the target of choice for the treatment of several viral diseases, including chronic liver disease caused by hepatitis C virus infection. Arguably the most promising, broad-spectrum class of viral RdRp inhibitors are nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs). Upon delivery into the host cell, nucleoside/nucleotide prodrugs are metabolized into an active 5′-triphosphate form (5′-TP) which competes with endogenous nucleotides as substrates for the viral RdRp. The NAs are subsequently incorporated into the nascent viral RNA by the RdRp, accounting for the antiviral effect through several mechanisms of action (MoA).</p>
