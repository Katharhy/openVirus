<p id="p0055">A second MoA exists without termination or slow-down of RNA synthesis, but rather through high level incorporation of NA-TPs throughout the nascent RNA. These NAs are unable to be recognized as ‘regular’ Watson-Crick nucleobases during subsequent rounds of RNA synthesis from the NA-containing template. This results in an increase in mutations and ultimately leads to non-viable genomes, a process known as ‘lethal mutagenesis’ (
