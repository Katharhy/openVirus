<p id="p0035">The recent emergence of a new SARS-like coronavirus in December 2019 (now named SARS-CoV-2) likely from the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan China, is the cause of significant global health concern. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to be closest related (~88%) to two bat-derived SARS-like CoVs (bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21), with ~79% overall sequence identity to SARS-CoV and ~50% to MERS-CoV. At the present time, any mention of the number of cases, affected countries, and case/fatality ratio will be outdated at print time.</p>
