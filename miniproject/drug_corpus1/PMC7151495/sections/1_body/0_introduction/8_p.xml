<p id="p0065">Coronaviruses stand out as a particularly challenging case for NAs drug design due to the presence of an additional, CoV-specific mechanism which impairs NAs potency. NAs incorporated into RNA can be removed by the CoV exonuclease (ExoN) residing in the N-terminal domain of nsp14 (

 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Snijder et al., 2003</xref>). The CoV ExoN interacts with the very processive trimeric RNA polymerase complex consisting of the viral RdRp (nsp12) and associated cofactors (nsp7 and nsp8) to perform proofreading activity (

However, 3â€²-terminal Rbv-MP is readily excised from RNA by the SARS-CoV ExoN, a removal that is thought to jeopardize NA potency against CoVs (
