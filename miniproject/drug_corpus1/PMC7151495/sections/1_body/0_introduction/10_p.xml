<p id="p0075">Here we perform structural-based sequence alignments of the RdRp and ExoN domains of the SARS-CoV to those of the SARS-CoV-2. We report the high level of sequence conservation in key motifs within these enzymes supporting the conjecture that NAs can be used as broad-spectrum antivirals to treat different CoVs. We review the molecular mechanism of resistance against Remdesivir brought by the F480L and V557L mutations (

 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Sexton et al., 2016</xref>), as well as possible nucleoside structural determinants (modifications at the ribose and nucleobase) for optimal NA efficiency. Likewise, using the crystal structure of SARS-CoV nsp14 Exo as well as structural alignment with other homologous DE (D/E)Eh ExoN enzymes, such as that of the N protein of Lassa virus (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>), we map the contacts of the RNA terminated with GS-441524-MP at the 3â€²-end with the SARS-CoV ExoN active site. Coupling NAs with ExoN inhibitors may be an attractive option, and may further reduce viral escape potential.
