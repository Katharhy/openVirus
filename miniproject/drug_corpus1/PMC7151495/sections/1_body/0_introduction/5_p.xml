<p id="p0050">Firstly, NA incorporation may cause termination of RNA synthesis. This can be either obligate, 
 <italic>i.e.</italic> the analogue lacks a 3′-OH required for RNA chain extension, or non-obligate, 
 <italic>i.e.</italic> the analogue perturbs the product RNA structure enough to stop further synthesis by the polymerase. Sofosbuvir is a pro-drug of 2′F-2′C-ME-UMP that has a 3′-OH but acts as a chain-terminator nonetheless (
