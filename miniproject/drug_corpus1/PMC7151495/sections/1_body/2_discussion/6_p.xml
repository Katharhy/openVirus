<p id="p0170">The increased efficiency of Remdesivir relative to other NAs indicates that its metabolite GS 441524-TP must be incorporated by the polymerase at a level superior to that of the excision rate of the GS 441524-MP by the ExoN, and/or be less accessible or removed less-efficiently by the ExoN. In contrast, while Rbv-TP also appears to be efficiently incorporated into the nascent RNA by the RdRp, it is likely to be excised just as efficiently by the ExoN.</p>
