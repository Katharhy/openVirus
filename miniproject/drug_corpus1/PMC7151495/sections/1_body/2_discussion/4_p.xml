<p id="p0160">Interestingly, MHV V553 had been previously identified as a potential fidelity-regulating residue in CoVs based on comparison with known fidelity-altering mutants in the coxsackie B3 polymerase (
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Sexton et al., 2016</xref>). A V553I mutation engineered into murine hepatitis virus CoV was associated with a decrease in accumulation of mutations over time (a.k.a increased fidelity) and was shown to confer resistance to the mutagens 5-fluorouridine (5-FU) and 5-azacytidine (5-AZC). The conservation of fidelity-regulating residues between distantly related RNA viruses indicates that these RdRps function in an analogous manner due to a high level of structural-conservation, despite limited sequence-similarity.
