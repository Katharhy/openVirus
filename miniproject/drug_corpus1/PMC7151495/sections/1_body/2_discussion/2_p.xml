<p id="p0150">As proven by the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the emergence of new, significant human pathogens from zoonotic CoVs is a threat, and the development of broad-spectrum antivirals remains a priority. The RdRp domain remains an extremely attractive target for antivirals due to the high level of structural-conservation across diverse RNA viruses; denoting the potential for broad-spectrum applicability coupled with the advantage of having a relatively high barrier for resistance mutations. NAs constitute an attractive option, with success against several diverse RNA viruses. Nevertheless, CoVs are a particularly challenging case due to the additional presence of a unique exonuclease activity in their nsp14 gene product, which confers resistance to several commonly used NAs including Rbv via an error correcting mechanism.</p>
