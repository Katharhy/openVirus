<p id="p0155">Remdesivir (GS-5734) remains one of the most promising NA candidates for the treatment of CoV infections, and has recently been advanced to phase 3 trials clinical trials for SARS-CoV-2 based on encouraging pre-clinical results for SARS-CoV (

 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Agostini et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we have mapped the two resistance mutants, F480L and V557L, on the SARS-CoV nsp12 structure and describe the structural and functional implications of these changes. While neither mutant directly impacts the catalytic site nor substrate-binding pocket, both result in an increase in free-energy and consequentially a structural relaxation which likely affects the polymerase fidelity-check performed prior to nucleotide incorporation.
