<p id="p0175">CoV RdRps are able to accommodate a wide variety of different chemical modifications of NAs (e.g., on the ribose, on the base, on both) (
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Pruijssers and Denison, 2019</xref>). The ability of the ExoN domain to recognise these diverse modifications should therefore be taken into consideration, and represents a potential avenue which could be exploited for NA drug development. Studies which analyse the difference in recognition, incorporation of GS 441524 5â€²-TP and excision of GS 441524-MP compared to other NA-TPs by the CoV RdRp, ExoN and other replication machinery will provide crucial insights into proper design of novel NAs.
