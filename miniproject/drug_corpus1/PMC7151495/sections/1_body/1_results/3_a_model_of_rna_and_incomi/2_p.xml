<p id="p0090">In the absence of an X-ray or Cryo-EM structure of a ternary complex of a CoV RdRp bound to RNA template-primer and incoming nucleotide triphosphate (NTP), we took advantage of the structural and phylogenetic relatedness to picornavirus RdRps, for which the structures of several ternary RdRp-RNA-NTP elongation complexes exist (
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Kirchdoerfer and Ward, 2019</xref>). Using the SARS-CoV nsp12 cryo-EM structure (PDB 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:6NUR" id="intref0015" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">6NUR</ext-link>), we built a model by stacking nsp12 onto a set of related RdRps described by 
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Peersen (2019)</xref> and used the T7 RNA polymerase ternary complex (
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Yin and Steitz, 2004</xref>) to position both RNA and the incoming NTP. RNA and ATP were subsequently modelled at the SARS-CoV nsp12 active site. Overall, the structure is similar to that of the poliovirus polymerase: Motifs A-G encircle and constitute the polymerase active site, with an open NTP entry tunnel leading to the catalytic center (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A). In CoV nsp12, motifs A,B,C,D and F the most conserved, and this conservation extends to 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> families (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Campagnola et al., 2015</xref>): it is thus reasonable to extrapolate that the mechanism of action is similar to that of other viral RdRps, and in particular to 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> with which CoVs share the “small thumb” feature (
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Peersen, 2019</xref>). The ribose moiety of the NTP poised to be incorporated is properly positioned by a conserved serine located in motif B and probably by residues of motif F (
