<p id="p0130">The overall identity of nsp14 sequences from the SARS-CoV Frankfurt isolate and the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-1 isolate is 95% regarding both the entire nsp14 gene and the ExoN domain alone (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A). Out of the 14 amino-acid changes in the ExoN domain, four involve non-conserved amino-acids. The ExoN active site has been structurally defined with three conserved motifs, DXE, W(X)
 <sub>4</sub>EL, and DAIMTR (
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Ogando et al., 2019</xref>). None of the amino-acid changes map to these motifs, which is confirmed by a structure based alignment performed in a similar way as that of 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. Amino-acid changes can thus be considered as polymorphisms, and the SARS-CoV nsp14 ExoN domain can be considered a valid model for that of SARS-CoV-2.
