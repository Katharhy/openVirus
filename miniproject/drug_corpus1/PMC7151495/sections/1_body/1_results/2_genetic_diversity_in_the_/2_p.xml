<p id="p0080">As of Feb 17, 2020, 90 complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences have been published and analyzed in the Nexstrain repository (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Nextstrain.org" id="intref0010" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Nextstrain.org</ext-link>), with the first sequence deposited December 2019. Alignment of nsp12 for the whole CoV family indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 is almost identical to that of the SARS-CoV (96% identity 98% similarity): a total of 31 amino acid (aa) changes are present along the protein of 804 amino acids (

 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Lehmann et al., 2015</xref>); a large domain located N-terminal of the RdRp core that does not appear to play a structural nor functional role in polymerase activity (Shannon &amp; Canard, unpublished).
 <sup>.</sup> While the NiRAN is a genetic marker for the Ni

Furthermore, while a nucleotidylation activity has been defined for the small-genome arterivirus equine arteritis virus (EAV) (
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Lehmann et al., 2015</xref>), the exact role of the NiRAN domain in the Nidovirus viral life-cycle is unknown. The remaining nine mutations are located in the C-terminal RdRp domain of nsp12 (
