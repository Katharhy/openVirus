<p id="p0085">We subsequently performed a structure-based alignment using the available Cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV nsp12 to evaluate the potential structural and functional impact of the SARS-CoV-2 amino acid changes (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B). The SARS-CoV RdRp domain adopts a classical right hand fold with “Fingers”, “Thumb”, and “Palm” subdomains (
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Kirchdoerfer and Ward, 2019</xref>). At both the structural and sequence levels, the conserved, canonical A to G motifs can be readily identified, and none of the mutations map within these motifs. We conclude that the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp structure and function is unlikely to differ significantly from that of SARS-CoV, which allows the latter to be considered as a faithful surrogate for structure/function analysis.
