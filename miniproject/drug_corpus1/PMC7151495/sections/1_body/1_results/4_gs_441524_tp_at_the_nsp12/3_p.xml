<p id="p0100">Remdesivir (GS-5734) is one of the few nucleotide analogues reported to be active against SARS-CoV (reviewed in (
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Pruijssers and Denison, 2019</xref>)). It carries a cyano group on the 1′ position of the ribose (1′-CN) and a 4-aza-7,9-dideazaadenosine nucleobase (pseudo-adenine) linked to the ribose by a C–C bond (

 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A shows the natural substrate ATP poised to receive the catalytic nucleophile attack on its α-phosphate. Modelling GS 441524-TP at the nsp12 active site shows that the 1′-CN group is freely accommodated in the close vicinity of motif B (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B), a motif that has been reported to act as a fidelity check-point during active site closure with a conserved serine (here S682, see below) (
