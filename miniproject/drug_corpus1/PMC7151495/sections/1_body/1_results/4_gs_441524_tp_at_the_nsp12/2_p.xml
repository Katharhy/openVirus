<p id="p0095">The spectrum of NAs active against human pathogenic CoVs has been recently reviewed (
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Pruijssers and Denison, 2019</xref>). Five NAs; Remdesivir, Î²-D-
 <italic>N</italic>4 hydroxycytidine, Gemcitabine, 6-Azauridine, Mizoribine and Acyclovir-Fleximer, show moderate-to-potent activity against three human pathogenic CoVs (SARS-CoV, MERS- CoV, and HCoV-NL63). One striking feature of this activity spectrum is the structural peculiarity of analogues relative to their potency towards CoVs as well as other RNA viruses. Obviously, the activity spectrum can be linked to either a modified ribose, a modified base, of both.
