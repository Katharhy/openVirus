<p id="p0140">Fig. 5A shows that the modeling a regular 3′-terminal nucleotide in the active site is possible without any major structural distortion, as expected. When this model is built with GS 441524-TP, it shows that the cyano group at the 1′-ribose position of GS 441524-TP would fit easily (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B). However, no proper positioning of the pseudo-adenine can be easily achieved. Superimposition of the ribose so as to position the metal ions for proper catalysis implicates a potential steric clash of the GS 441524 pseudo-adenine with surrounding nucleotides (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>C). In other words, if the pseudo-adenine base-pairs properly, the α-phosphate would be pushed away and unaligned for catalysis with the metal ions. It is thus likely that excision of GS 441524-MP is significantly less efficient than that of a regular nucleotide. Alternately, the GS 441524-MP might remain stuck in the polymerase active site as described above for delayed chain termination, and be inaccessible for excision.
