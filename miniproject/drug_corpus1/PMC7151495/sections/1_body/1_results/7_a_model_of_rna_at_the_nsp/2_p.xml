<p id="p0135">We took advantage of the SARS-CoV nsp14 crystal structure and the exonuclease structure of Lassa N protein (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>). Both proteins belong to the same DE (D/E)Dh family, and the Lassa N exoN domain has been crystallized with dsRNA, which thus allows modelling of the dsRNA into the nsp14 ExoN active site (
