<p id="p0115">The conserved F480L mutation reduces the amount of interactions within the hydrophobic core, thereby retaining the overall conformation while lowering the structural rigidity. The resulting increase of free energy should allow a greater degree of freedom of the secondary structure elements which harbors those hydrophobic residues. In related viral RdRps, the serine of motif B is thought to be responsible for allowing the proper positioning of the ribose moiety of the incoming NTP via the establishment of a hydrogen bond network with the 2â€™ OH group of the ribose (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A). The structure of motif B is considered loose, but its conformational change upon binding the NTP is considered as a fidelity check point of viral RdRps (
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Peersen, 2017</xref>). Therefore, one possible interpretation is that phenylalanine to leucine mutation allows a relaxation in the positioning of the serine, leading to an altered fidelity check. Only detailed experimental work using,
