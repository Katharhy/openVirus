<p id="p0105">In a recent study, Agostini et al. evaluated the mode of action (MoA) of Remdesivir (GS-5734)
 <sup>21</sup>. Passage of wild-type (WT) MHV with the Remdesivir (GS-5734) and/or parent nucleoside GS-441524 resulted in phenotypic resistance associated with two nonsynonymous mutations in the predicted fingers subdomain of the nsp12 RdRp (F480L and V557L SARS-CoV numbering). Given the potential of NAs as broad-spectrum antivirals for the treatment of CoV infections, it is imperative to understand the structural and functional implications of these mutations. The SARS-CoV nsp12 structure (
