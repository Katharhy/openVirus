<p id="p0110">Neither of the resistance mutations directly impact the catalytic site nor substrate-binding pocket, but rather cause minor structural alterations which likely impact an NTP ‘checking step’ performed by the polymerase before catalysis (

 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C). The phenyl ring is orientated towards hydrophobic residues from the palm (V637, L638) and the fingers (I579, V693), and plays a structural role in tightening the two domains by a strong mesh of hydrophobic interactions. In contrast, residue V557 is located at the end of motif F on the second strand forming the side of the RNA template entry channel (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A). Based on the theoretical model derived from the poliovirus polymerase elongation complex (4K4S) (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Gong et al., 2013</xref>), it can be predicted that the valine side chain faces the template RNA and interacts with the base to be paired with the incoming NTP. F480 is completely buried while V557 is partially exposed to solvent with solvent accessibility of 4.2 and 35.2% respectively. Nevertheless, the server of protein thermodynamic stability changes upon single-site mutations (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Dehouck et al., 2009</xref>) and predicts for both mutations a slight increase in Free energy (ΔG) of the protein, corresponding to a structural relaxation.
