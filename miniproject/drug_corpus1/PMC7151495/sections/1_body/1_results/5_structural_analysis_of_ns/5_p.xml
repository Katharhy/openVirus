<p id="p0120">Valine 557 is also located in the vicinity of motif B (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A and C). The consequence of a valine to leucine mutation is an extended hydrophobic side chain, generating a steric hindrance with the template RNA. As a result, it is expected that the RNA would be deviated from the grove away from the serine of motif B. Again, it is possible to hypothesize that this deviation would alter the serine fidelity check, allowing easier incorporation of ATP relative to GS 441524-TP thus resulting in discrimination against the latter. Again, validation of this hypothesis requires detailed kinetics investigating nucleotide incorporation at the nsp12 active site.
