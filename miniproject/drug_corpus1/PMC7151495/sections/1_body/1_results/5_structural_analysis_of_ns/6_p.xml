<p id="p0125">It is interesting to note that the nucleotide at the 3′-end shows some possible room at its 1′-position, hinting that GS 441524-TP, once incorporated, could potentially translocate (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>D). However, after about 4 translocation events, we anticipate a major steric clash of the 1′-CN group with R858, suggesting that GS 441524-TP might act as a delayed chain terminator. Delayed chain termination mediated by GS 441524-MP has been demonstrated for Respiratory Syncitial virus (

 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>) RdRps, and more relevant to this discussion for the MERS-CoV RdRp complex (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>). Likewise, the action of the ExoN remains to be determined once GS 441524-MP has been incorporated and buried in the nascent RNA chain. Future biochemical experiments should address these issues which have implication not only for Remdesivir MoA but also for any up-coming therapeutic NA.
