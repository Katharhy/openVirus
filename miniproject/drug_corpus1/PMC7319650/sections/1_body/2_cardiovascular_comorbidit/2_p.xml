Hemodynamic heart failure by severe respiratory syndrome, hypercoagulability by sepsis and endothelial dysfunction, inflammatory state, oxidative stress, and heme dysfunction are trigger factors that in patients over 60 years with cardiovascular comorbidities induce a greater risk of heart damage, thromboembolism and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with inauspicious prognosis and death.
