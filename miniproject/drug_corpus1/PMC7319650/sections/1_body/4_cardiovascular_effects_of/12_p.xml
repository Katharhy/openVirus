<p id="par0150">Recent studies have shown that azithromycin (AZM), and the closely related drug roxithromycin, both act as drugs that can target and selectively remove senescent cells, with an efficiency of nearly 97 % [
 <xref rid="bib0385" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Used in cystic fibrosis, is has an anti-fibrotic effect by targeting myofibroblast cells and functionally acts as an anti-inflammatory drug and reduces mediators, such as IL-1beta and IL-6 [

Clinical trials indicate that the risk of ventricular arrhythmia with the use of azithromycin is likely to be due to the patient's health rather than due to the drug itself. The QT interval prolongation is not observed in the association between chronic AZM therapy [

ACE2 is essential in the mechanism by which anti-RAAS inhibitor drugs work to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease due to hypertension and diabetes. Concerning cardiovascular risk in positive SARS-CoV-2 subjects taking antihypertensive and hypoglycaemic therapy, the literature produced so far is confusing. Contrary, some authors indicate overexpression of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection [
 <xref rid="bib0430" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0435" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>], which we could explain as a rebound effect [
 <xref rid="bib0440" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. ACE2 is expressed in different cell types and also in the kidney and heart, but mainly in the lung as well as ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) (11,12). Considering the pathogenesis and the effects produced by SARS-CoV-2 in the lung, it is more reasonable to believe that there is a down-regulation. In both cases, there is no scientific evidence that patients using anti-RAAS or ACE inhibitors have a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or that they have a higher cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, an up-regulation would favor greater treatment efficacy and protection rather than risk. Some authors suggest the protective role of ace inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 infection as opposed to others. However, we still have doubts about how to truly interpret the role of ACE inhibitors which, unlike anti-RAAS [

 <xref rid="bib0435" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref>,
