<p id="par0140">Cardiotoxicity with potential conduction or structural abnormalities on electrocardiogram (ECG) has been reported. An association between cumulative HCQ dose above the median and structural ECG abnormalities (left ventricular hypertrophy or atrial enlargement) was reported; however, it is not shown a statistically significant association with ECG structural abnormalities. The cumulative AM decreases the odds of ECG conduction abnormalities (prolonged corrected QT interval, short PR interval, left bundle branch block (LBBB), right bundle branch block (RBBB) and atrioventricular block (AVB), premature atrial complex, tachycardia, bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, ectopic atrial rhythm, premature ventricular complex and ventricular bigeminy [
