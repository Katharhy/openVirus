<p id="par0050">Cardiovascular mortality is known to be higher in all influenza pandemics than in all other causes. Acute respiratory viral infections, such as coronaviruses are well known to trigger factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) [

During COVID-19 pandemic, the literature produced in a few months report that the increase in morbidity and mortality is found in particular in the elderly and in those who present comorbidities. The most prevalent comorbidity were hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases [

 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Compared to lung, data concerning cardiovascular involvement are less described [
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This makes it difficult to draw a line between complications of comorbidity and possible direct cardiovascular damage by COVID-19. There are autopsy data relating to the infection produced by SARS CoV in 2003 and by MERS-CoV in 2012 that can help better understand the involvement of the cardiovascular system. However, these data are affected by the difficulty of autopsy diagnosis made in a particular background. For example, an autopsy study reported post-mortem examinations in 8 patients who died of SARS in which 4 patients had pulmonary thromboembolism and 3 patients with deep vein thrombosis. One patient had a subendocardial infarction with occlusive coronary artery disease. One patient had valve vegetations along with heart attack, kidney, spleen, and brain [

The reported presence of increased D-Dimer and alteration of coagulation parameters highlights the need to understand whether positive CoV-2 patients have a greater risk of hypercoagulability than negative patients with comorbidity and the need to understand the correct use of the antiplatelet therapy. Some clinical trials have compared the clinical characteristics, coagulation parameters, and mortality between the COVID and non−COVID groups both with underlying chronic diseases including hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and lung disease, and antiplatelet therapy and D-Dimer evaluation. In the COVID group, significantly lower mortality was found in users of heparin with markedly high D-dimer compared to non-users, while no difference in mortality among heparin users compared to non-users was found in the non−COVID group. No significant improvement in clinical symptoms. However, further studies on the role of anticoagulants are still needed [
