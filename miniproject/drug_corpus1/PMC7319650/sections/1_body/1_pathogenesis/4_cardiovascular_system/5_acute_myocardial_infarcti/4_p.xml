Since Covid-19 binds to ACE2 which is expressed in different cell types and the kidney and heart, a mechanism of direct damage to cardiomyocytes is conceivable but the systemic inflammatory responses, destabilized coronary plaque and aggravated hypoxia constitute now the only obvious modes of heart damage (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The induction of an abnormal inflammatory state is the first cardinal point implicated in cardiovascular complications and acute myocardial infarct responsible for the death. Already in previous SARS-CoV epidemics, the studies have shown that an increase of proinflammatory cytokines in serum (e.g. (IL) -1, IL-6 e IL-12, IFNÎ³, IP10 e MCP1), associated with lung inflammation and extensive lung damage as well as in patients SARS-CoV-2 positive probably leading to activated T-helper-1 (Th1) cell responses [
