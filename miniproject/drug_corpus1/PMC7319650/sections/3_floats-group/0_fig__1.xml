  <p>SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells through ACE2 receptors. The virus can act on the cardiovascular system increases the risk of damage and sudden death in people with comorbidities.</p>
  <p>The figure shows the main hypothesized mechanisms of interaction between the virus and the cardiovascular system with the causes of damage most reported in the literature. Damage mediated by the release of inflammation mediators, by direct action on the vascular endothelium that acts on the determinism of hypercoagulability and hypoxic damage by alterations of perfusion (acute coronary syndrome, IMA, thromboembolism, DIC), and by the immune response responsible in the first instance of myocarditis with myocardial damage. The damage mediated by the proposed downregulation or up-regulation of the ACE2 Receptor with a consequent imbalance of the normal circulatory and inflammatory homeostasis. The surface glycoprotein competition mechanism for the binding of porphyrin to iron in HEMA formation. In red the inhibition pathways, and green the main activation pathways both of the virus infection modality, of the pathogenetic mechanisms of the damage, and when taking the drugs used in people with hypertension, diabetes, and vascular disease.</p>
