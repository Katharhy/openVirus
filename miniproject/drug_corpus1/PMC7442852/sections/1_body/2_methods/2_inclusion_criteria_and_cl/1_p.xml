In brief, during the first 5 years of IRIS (December 2008 to March 2013), both adults and children aged ≥1 year were eligible for enrollment when positive for influenza virus by rapid test and/or upon display of influenza-like signs and symptoms within 48 hours (≤96 hours for hospitalized adults, no time limit for hospitalized children) [
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Since resistance mutations were more prevalent in children during the first 5 years of the study, the inclusion criteria for the last 2 years of the study (March 2013 to September 2015) were modified to recruit only children aged ≤13 years on antiviral treatment. Clinical management, including prescription of antivirals, was at the discretion of the healthcare provider.
