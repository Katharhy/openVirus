<p>Qualitative, quantitative, and mutation-specific real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on collected nasal and throat swabs on days 1 (study enrollment), 3, 6, and 10 to determine the influenza virus (sub-)type, viral load, and resistance mutations in the neuraminidase (NA) gene (H275Y, R292K, E119V, R150K, D197N, N294S) [
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Viral RNA loads (RNA copies [log
 <sub>10</sub>/mL]) were determined by converting the cycle threshold value to viral particle counts (viral RNA copies), by processing electron microcopyâ€“counted influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34, and B/Lee/40 virus stocks (Advanced Biotechnologies Inc, Maryland) in parallel to the patient samples.
