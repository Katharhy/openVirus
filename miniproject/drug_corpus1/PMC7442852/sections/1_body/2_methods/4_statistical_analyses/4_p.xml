<p>Kaplan-Meier plots for time to nondetection of viral RNA by quantitative RT-PCR and for time to symptom resolution were generated for various age strata using the recorded symptoms diary cards of children aged â‰¥1 year. Data were censored at the date of the last available sample, if patients were lost to follow-up, if samples were inadequate, or if RNA was still detected at the final visit. Wilcoxon and log-rank tests were used to compare outcomes between the age groups and influenza virus (sub-)type.</p>
