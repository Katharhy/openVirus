<p>Continuous data, such as viral load, were summarized as means and standard deviations (SDs); medians and ranges were calculated/reported to 1 decimal point. Categorical data were summarized as frequency and percentage of the appropriate study population. The area under the curve (AUC) of the virus load was determined using the trapezoid rule. The Student 
 <italic>t</italic> test was used to compare AUC values between age groups.
