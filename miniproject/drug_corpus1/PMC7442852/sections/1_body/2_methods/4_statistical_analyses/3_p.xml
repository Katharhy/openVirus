<p>Logistic multivariable analyses were performed to explore the associations between duration of viral RNA detection and baseline viral load, age (years), antiviral treatment, virus subtype, influenza virus vaccination status during the previous 4 months, and emergence of resistance in the postbaseline samples. The dependent variable was “cleared” or “not cleared” depending on RNA detection on day 6. The associations of emergence of resistance mutations with baseline viral load, age (years), and influenza virus subtype were analyzed using a regression analysis. Results of the regression analyses are shown as odd ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs) with significance determined by χ 
 <sup>2</sup> test.
