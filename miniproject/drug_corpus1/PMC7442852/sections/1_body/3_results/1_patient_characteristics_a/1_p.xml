<p>A total of 2131 children aged ≤13 years tested positive for a single influenza virus (sub-)type by RT-PCR (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref> for study flow chart). Baseline characteristics stratified by age are summarized in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">2</xref> [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Relatively few infants (aged &lt;1 year) were included in IRIS and were positive for influenza virus (N = 23). A total of 683 children were infected with A/H1N1pdm09, 825 with A/H3N2, and 623 with influenza B virus. No infants aged 6 months−1 year had influenza B virus infection. Gender was distributed similarly across all age groups. The majority of children received antivirals (61%). Pulmonary (13.4%) and cardiovascular (0.8%) comorbidities were relatively uncommon, as was influenza vaccination coverage in the previous 4 months (8.3%).
