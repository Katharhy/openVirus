<p>The mean AUC of the viral load was calculated over the course of infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). A/H1N1pdm09-infected infants (aged &lt;1 year; 37.3 log
 <sub>10</sub>/mL*time) and young children (aged 1−5 years; 26.2 log
 <sub>10</sub>/mL*time) had significantly higher mean AUCs of 1.60- and 1.12-fold, respectively, than older children (aged &gt;5 years; 23.3 log
 <sub>10</sub>/mL*time) (**.01 &gt; 
 <italic>P </italic>&gt; .001 and ***
 <italic>P &lt; </italic>.001). The same trend was observed for influenza B virus infection with a 1.37- and 1.04-fold larger total mean quantity of virus detected in infants (aged &lt;6 months; 39.6 log
 <sub>10</sub>/mL*time) and young children (aged 1−5 years; 29.5 log
 <sub>10</sub>/mL*time), respectively, compared with older children (aged &gt;5 years; 28.4 log
 <sub>10</sub>/mL*time). Infants (aged &lt;1 year; 16.2 log
 <sub>10</sub>/mL*time) infected with A/H3N2 virus shed a smaller amount of virus than older children (*.05 &gt; 
 <italic>P </italic>&gt; .01). The mean AUCs of A/H3N2 virus–infected children aged 1−5 years (28.3 log
 <sub>10</sub>/mL*time) were 1.24-fold higher compared with older children (22.8 log
 <sub>10</sub>/mL*time; **.01 &gt; 
 <italic>P </italic>&gt; .001 and ***
 <italic>P &lt; </italic>.001). When corrected for treatment status, these age-related effects on the total quantity of viral RNA load persisted (
