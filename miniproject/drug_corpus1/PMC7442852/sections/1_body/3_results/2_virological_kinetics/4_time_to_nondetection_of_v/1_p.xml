<p>The median time to A/H1N1pdm09 virus RNA clearance was longest for young children (aged &lt;5 years [N = 320]; median range, 9.9–11.5 days) compared with older children (aged &gt;5 years [N = 363]; median range, 7.2–9.0 days; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Viral RNA clearance in A/H3N2 virus–infected older children (aged &gt;5 years [N = 451]; median range, 8.7–8.9 days) was faster compared with younger children (aged 1−5 years [N = 364]; median range, 10.0–10.6 days). Infants (aged 6 months−1 year) cleared the A/H3N2 virus faster than all other children (
