<p>The change in viral RNA load over time relative to the baseline viral load was calculated for all children in order to determine the rate of viral RNA clearance (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In most cases, children aged 10âˆ’13 years cleared viral RNA faster than younger children. For A/H1N1pdm09 virus, the higher rate of viral load reduction in older children was only significant at day 6. For A/H3N2 and influenza B virus, this effect remained significant until day 10 postbaseline.
