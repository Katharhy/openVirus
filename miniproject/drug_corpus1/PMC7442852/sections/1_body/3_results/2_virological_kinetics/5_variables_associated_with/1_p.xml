<p>Logistic regression analyses confirmed the relationship between duration of virus shedding and older age (OR, 1.08; CI, 1.05–1.12; 
 <italic>P &lt; </italic>.0001). Additionally, vaccination (OR, 1.72; CI, 1.22–2.43; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .0017) and antiviral treatment (OR, 1.74; CI, 1.43–2.12; 
 <italic>P &lt; </italic>.0001) were associated with shorter duration of virus shedding. High baseline viral loads (OR, 0.57; CI, .52–.62; 
 <italic>P &lt; </italic>.0001) and the emergence of resistance mutations (OR, 0.05; CI, .01–.20; 
 <italic>P &lt; </italic>.0001) were independently associated with longer duration of virus shedding. Infection with A/H3N2 (OR, 0.71; CI, .57–.90; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .01) or influenza B virus (OR, 0.78; CI, .61–.99; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .01) decreased the odds of viral RNA clearance compared with infection with A/H1N1pdm09 virus.
