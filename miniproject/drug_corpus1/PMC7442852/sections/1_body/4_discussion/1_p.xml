<p>The viral load at baseline and the rate of viral clearance both contribute to the total viral RNA load in patients with influenza virus infection. The presented data demonstrate that, over the duration of their infection, children aged 1−5 years shed a 1.04- to 1.24-fold higher total quantity of influenza virus compared with older children. This higher total viral burden in young children was observed in both untreated and oseltamivir-treated children’s age groups.</p>
