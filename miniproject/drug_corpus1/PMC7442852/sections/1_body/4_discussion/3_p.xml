<p> Surprisingly, compared with older children, infants infected with A/H3N2 virus had a low baseline viral load and cleared viral RNA faster, whereas the opposite was observed for A/H1N1pdm09 virus. Technical reasons for the observed low baseline viral load in these infants were ruled out first, since the same sampling and virological assays were used for all patients included in this study. Second, parents with sick infants tend to seek professional care earlier upon symptom onset compared with parents with older children [

However, in this study, the time from symptom onset to study baseline in infants was either similar or higher than in older children. As infants were not included during the first 5 years of IRIS, only a small number of young children, primarily from the United States, were included in this study. This small sample size and the observed substantial variation in the detected viral loads makes it difficult to draw any solid conclusion from this group.
