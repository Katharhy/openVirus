<p>Interestingly, despite the low observed vaccination coverage, in accordance with previous data, the present study showed that both vaccination and antiviral treatment reduced the duration of virus shedding [

However, IRIS was a nonrandomized clinical study that was not designed to determine the efficacy of antiviral treatment. Therefore, no conclusions were drawn regarding oseltamivir usage with clinical symptoms. Previous studies have suggested that antiviral therapy is associated with the development of resistance mutations [

The prevalence of resistance in this study was highest in children aged &lt;5 years and almost absent in older children, which may suggest that the protracted viral RNA shedding in young children allowed for the influenza viruses to evolve and acquire resistance mutations upon selective pressure of antiviral therapy. Similar to a previous study, emergence of resistant viruses did not affect symptom resolution in influenza A–infected children (data not shown) [
