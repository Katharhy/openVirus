<p>Similar to previous data, no age-related differences were observed in the baseline viral load of infected children in this study (excluding infants aged &lt;1 year infected with A/H3N2 virus), indicating that baseline viral load did not have a direct effect on the high total quantity of virus shedding detected in the upper respiratory tract of infected young children [
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The relatively low rate of viral RNA clearance observed in children aged 1−5 years may have led to their high viral burden, and it most likely resulted from their immature immune response and/or the absence of prior exposure to influenza A viruses [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In contrast to the data presented here, several studies reported no difference in viral burden between children of different age groups [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12–14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, those studies did not take the timing of symptom onset into account. The influenza virus load depends on the time when a sample is obtained in relation to disease onset [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. When corrected for the date of symptom onset, this study showed that viral RNA shedding was, in general, still prolonged in young children compared with older children. Ultimately, this age-related viral load difference was no longer observed for children who were included ≥2 days after symptom onset. Therefore, by not correcting for the date of disease onset, previous studies may have failed to detect differences between age groups [

 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].
