<p>Children are more likely than adults to be infected with influenza virus during epidemics [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Annually, pediatric infections are associated with a high number of emergency room visits and hospitalizations [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2–5</xref>]. This susceptibility of children to influenza virus infection largely results from the absence of preexisting acquired immunity [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Thus, children can serve as a major reservoir for further prolongation of outbreaks in the community [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8–10</xref>]. Although several studies report prolonged influenza virus replication in children compared with adults, this finding is not consistently reported and remains to be elucidated [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8–14</xref>].
