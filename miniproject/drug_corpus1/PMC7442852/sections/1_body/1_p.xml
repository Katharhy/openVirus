<p>To gain further insight into the drivers of pediatric viral replication and antiviral resistance, studies with sufficient numbers of patients are needed to compare kinetics between the different age strata. The Influenza Resistance Information Study (IRIS) provided a unique opportunity to capitalize on the knowledge of influenza viral kinetics and the incidence of antiviral resistance in children [

With more than 2000 children included, it was possible to analyze the effect of age, baseline viral load, antiviral usage, emergence of resistance, and vaccination status of children on viral shedding and clearance for influenza A (A/H1N1pdm09, A/H3N2) and influenza B viruses.
