 </xref> More recently, monkeypox is being recognized as an increasing public health threat, particularly in regions in West Africa, where there is close interaction between humans and wild animal reservoirs. Global concern has been raised about its emergence as well as the resemblance of its clinical presentation to that of smallpox, a deadly disease globally eradicated by vaccination 40 years ago. During outbreaks, it has been challenging to clinically distinguish monkeypox from chickenpox, an unrelated herpesvirus infection. Outbreaks of buffalopox have occurred with multiple human cases in India. Similarly, during outbreaks of vaccinia virus infection in cattle in Brazil, there is documented evidence of human infections.
