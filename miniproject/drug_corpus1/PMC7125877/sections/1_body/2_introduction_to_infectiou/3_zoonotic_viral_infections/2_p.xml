 </xref> Viral hemorrhagic fevers represent a group of diseases caused by enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to 6 taxonomic families: Filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg); Arenaviruses (Lassa and other Old World arenaviruses and New World arenaviruses); Hantaviruses, Nairoviruses, and Phenuiviruses (Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever, Rift Valley fever, Huaiyangshan virus, and Hantavirus); and Flaviviruses (Dengue, Yellow fever, Omsk hemorrhagic fever, Kyasanur Forest disease, and Alkhumra viruses). Chikungunya (CHIK) was first described in 1952 in southern Tanzania.

 </xref> It is a disabling and debilitating zoonotic disease of humans caused by the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), which is transmitted by infected 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp mosquitoes, which sustain sylvatic and human rural and urban CHIK cycles. The past 5 years has witnessed an alarming global increase and spread of CHIKV to more than 100 countries across Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas. The virus is maintained in a complex sylvatic and rural cycle, progressing to an urban cycle every 5 to 20 years, causing global pandemics. Recently, the Indian Ocean and Indian epidemic CHIKV strains have emerged independently from the mainland of East Africa. This Indian Ocean Lineage caused repeated outbreaks from 2005 to 2014.
