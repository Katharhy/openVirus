 </xref> The first human case of EVD was described in 1976 near the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and the first outbreak of EVD affected 284 people, with a mortality of 53%. This was followed a few months later by the second outbreak of EVD in Yambuku, Zaire (now DRC). Until 2013, EVD outbreaks consisted of small numbers of cases that were contained by basic public health and containment measures. The largest EVD epidemic occurred in West Africa between 2013 and 2016, and detection of EVD cases in the United Kingdom, Sardinia, Spain, and the United States focused global attention on the epidemic. There is an ongoing EVD epidemic in the DRC. The first human case of LF was discovered in 1969 in Nigeria. Fifty years after its first discovery, LF outbreaks continue in West Africa. Annually, an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 cases of LF occur in West Africa with up to 5 to 10,000 deaths.
