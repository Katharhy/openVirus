<p id="p0025">Human infections due to highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) were initially detected in Hong Kong in 1997 before spreading to other continents, with a case fatality rate close to 60%. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus emerged and led to a pandemic in 2009 and has remained a common circulating strain. Human infections with the novel avian influenza A(H7N9) virus emerged in China in March 2013, whereas sporadic human cases of avian A(H5N6), A(H10N8) and A(H6N1) have been increasingly detected since 1997.

 </xref> An outbreak of a novel H7N9 virus caused zoonotic disease in eastern China in the early spring of 2013. Six epidemics of human cases of H7N9 virus infection with 1564 laboratory-confirmed cases and 612 deaths occurred in China through September 2017, typically during the fall, winter, and spring months, including a large fifth epidemic during 2016 to 2017. As of May 2019, 1568 laboratory-confirmed H7N9 virus infections acquired in China had occurred since 2013. At least 10 human cases of infection with avian influenza A viruses acquired in China have traveled overseas and were diagnosed elsewhere.
