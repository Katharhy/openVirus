 </xref> Five biologically unrelated hepatotropic viruses cause most of the global burden of viral hepatitis: hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C viruses (HCV), hepatitis D (delta) virus (HDV), and hepatitis E viruses (HEV). A large proportion of deaths from viral hepatitis is due to hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Globally, an estimated 257 million people were living with HBV and 71 million people were living with HCV. In 2017, 1.4 million people died of the consequences of viral hepatitis infection, and 90% of this burden was due to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, which are consequences of chronic hepatitis B and chronic hepatitis C. HBV, HCV, HDV, and occasionally HEV, can also produce chronic infection.
