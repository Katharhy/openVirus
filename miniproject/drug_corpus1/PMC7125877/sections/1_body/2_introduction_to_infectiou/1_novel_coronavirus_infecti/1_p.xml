<p id="p0020">Two new lethal zoonotic coronaviruses of humans with epidemic potential have emerged in the past 17 years. A novel Î² coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus emerged in November 2002 as a lethal zoonotic human pathogen in China and rapidly spread worldwide, disappearing in 2004, never to be seen again.

 </xref> was first identified in 2012 in a lung sample of a 60-year-old patient who had died of respiratory and multiorgan failure in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Since then, MERS-CoV has remained on the radar of global public health authorities because of recurrent nosocomial and community outbreaks, and its association with severe disease and high mortalities. From June 1 to July 31, 2015, MERS-CoV caused the largest outbreak outside of the Arabian Peninsula, occurring in the Republic of Korea and resulting in 186 confirmed MERS cases with 38 deaths. This occurred when a Korean traveler returning from a trip to Qatar, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain became ill with a respiratory illness and visited several hospitals in Seoul before finally being diagnosed as having MERS-CoV infection. This outbreak clearly illustrated the epidemic potential of MERS-CoV, spreading from person to person. MERS-CoV continues to circulate in the Middle East and causes intermittent community and hospital outbreaks. As of July 2019, 2458 cases of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases (848 deaths, 34% mortality) were reported to the WHO.
