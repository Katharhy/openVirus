<p id="p0050">The global spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens now threatens global health security and is a priority global public health issue. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) affects more than half a million people worldwide, causing significant morbidity and mortality. In 2018, there were an estimated 558,000 new MDR-TB cases globally, and only a fraction of them were diagnosed. Of concern is that the number of MDR-TB cases continues to increase every year. Recent advances in rapid point-of-care diagnostics and introduction of all oral and shorter treatment regimens provide hope for improving treatment outcomes.
