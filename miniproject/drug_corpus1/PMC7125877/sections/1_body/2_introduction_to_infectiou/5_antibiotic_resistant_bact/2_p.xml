 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic>, and Enterobacteriaceae are common pathogens causing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) globally. 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>Burkholderia pseudomallei</italic>, and 
 <italic>Acinetobacter baumanii</italic> are also important causes of CAP in the Asia Pacific regions. The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in 
 <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>M pneumoniae</italic> has been documented over the years, impacting the need for more prudent use of antibiotics. Antimicrobial resistance associated with the common bacterial infections causing CAP and the known mechanisms of resistance are reviewed by Margaret and Jeffery.
