<p id="Par38">ETI and mechanical ventilation remain the mainstay of treatment for unstable patients with ARDS and acute respiratory insufficiency. High levels of PEEP are generally required in COVID-19 patients with ARDS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], and in case of severe ARDS, prone positioning is recommended [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. As regards NMD patients, anaesthetic risk varies widely, as it depends mainly on baseline muscular and ventilatory function and the presence of comorbidities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. In some cases, the atrophy of masticatory muscles and limited mobility of the cervical spine may complicate ETI procedure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. In these cases, intubation should be performed following guidelines for difficult airway management [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Another reason for concern in this kind of patients is the potential of side effects from neuromuscular blockers and anaesthetic agents. Depolarizing muscle relaxants (succinylcholine) are contraindicated in NMDs because of the risk of fatal hyperkalemia and rhabdomyolysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Non-depolarizing muscle relaxants (e.g. rocuronium, rapacuronium, atracurium) should be used with caution and require dose reduction and careful titration in some categories of NMDs (myotonic disorders, myasthenia gravis, Lambertâ€“Eaton myasthenic syndrome, spinal muscular atrophy, polymyositis, and immune-mediated neuropathies) that present impaired production of choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase, and reduced concentration of acetylcholine at the endplate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. As concerns sedation, intravenous anaesthetics are preferable to volatile agents in most neuromuscular patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].
