<p id="Par36">Hypercapnia is not a classic feature of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, and its appearance might signal the onset of respiratory muscle weakness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, extensive interstitial pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) usually does not respond to oxygen therapy alone, even when oxygen is delivered via a face mask with reservoir bag, as a hypoxemic respiratory failure in ARDS is usually the result of intrapulmonary ventilation-perfusion mismatch or shunt and therefore requires mechanical ventilation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Indeed, acute hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring respiratory support was the main reason for ICU admittance in large cohorts of COVID-19 patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The median arterial blood oxygen (PaO
 <sub>2</sub>) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO
 <sub>2</sub>) ratio on ICU admission spanned from 136 to 169 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], very low levels, thus requiring high levels of Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP). Thereby, the need of endotracheal intubation (ETI) and invasive mechanical ventilation in published studies on critically ill COVID-19 patients ranged from 30% (Wuhan, China) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], 42% (Wuhan, China) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], 47% (Wuhan, China) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] to 71% in Washington State, US [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and 88% in Lombardy region, Italy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].
