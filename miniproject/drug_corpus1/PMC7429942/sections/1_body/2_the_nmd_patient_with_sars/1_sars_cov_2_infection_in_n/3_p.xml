<p id="Par24">Patients, caregivers, and their physicians and neurologists should bear in mind that, in an emergency setting, such as during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, hospitals may have to apply a ceiling of care based on age and pre-existing conditions [

However, the differences between outcomes and treatability of different neuromuscular conditions might not be known to all emergency and intensive care specialists, thus neurological consult should be sought and promptly provided whenever doubts arise regarding the proper treatment of NMD patients. Even in the case of critically ill NMD patients, the role of the NMD specialist remains crucial. To guarantee a fair provision of intensive care to NMD patients, the NMD specialist should establish a close collaboration with respiratory and intensive care specialists. As there is great variability among NMD patients in terms of prognosis, treatability, and disease stage, these patients should not be denied life-saving treatments only based on their disability and without consultation with a neurologist or NMD specialist [

To facilitate decisions in case neurological consult is not promptly available, the French Rare Health Care for Neuromuscular Disorders Network developed a list of neuromuscular diseases usually carrying a good prognosis, that could be eligible for admission in ICU, and, for other conditions not on the list, criteria suggesting a favorable outcome in case of ICU admission [
