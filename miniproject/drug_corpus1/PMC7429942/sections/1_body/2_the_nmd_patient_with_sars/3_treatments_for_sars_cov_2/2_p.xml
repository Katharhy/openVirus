<p id="Par40">Chloroquine (CQ) and its less toxic derivative, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), have been developed as antimalarial drugs; nowadays, they are used also for chronic rheumatic diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (AR). These drugs also show antiviral activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>], and recent reports have drawn attention to a possible beneficial effect against SARS-CoV-2 at high doses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. One open-label study and one randomized (high vs. low dose) study were conducted, but definitive evidence regarding its efficacy is still lacking [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/RTV) is an antiviral drug used for the treatment of HIV. A randomized Chinese trial found no efficacy of LPV/RTV compared to standard supportive care in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>], but other studies are currently ongoing (

Remdesivir is a novel nucleotide analogue developed for the treatment of Ebola and Marburg viruses. Remdesivir was shown to have in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>] and, in a cohort of patients with severe COVID-19 treated with remdesivir, the majority showed clinical improvement [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. However, a randomized study conducted in China failed to show statistically significant differences between treated and placebo group, although a slightly faster clinical improvement was observed in the former group [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Further studies are now underway to better clarify Remdesivir efficacy (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>). Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that may be able to suppress inflammation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>] and be effective as adjunctive therapy in ARDS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. It is now being studied as an adjunctive treatment for patients with COVID-19, with apparently positive results, but validation in randomized trials is needed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), inhibiting signal transduction and, thus, counteracting the effects of pro-inflammatory interleukin-6 (IL-6), that was shown to be involved in inflammatory storms in severe COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. For this reason, the use of Tocilizumab was advocated in severe COVID-19 patients, and many clinical trials are now ongoing (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>), although published reports so far are scarce and anecdotal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. Eculizumab is another monoclonal antibody directed against complement component 5 (C5), a member of the complement cascade, inhibiting its cleavage into C5a and C5b, both with proinflammatory and prothrombotic properties. The use of Eculizumab for treatment of severe COVID-19 is currently being investigated in a clinical trial (NCT04288713), and preliminary results on 4 critically ill patients were favourable [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Notably, Eculizumab has recently been studied as a therapeutic agent in generalized MG [
