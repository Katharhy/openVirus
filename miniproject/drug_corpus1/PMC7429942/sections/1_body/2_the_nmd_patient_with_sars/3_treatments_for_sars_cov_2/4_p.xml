<p id="Par42">Treating the underlying NMD disease in SARS-CoV-2 patients may be challenging. One report describes the therapy of an MG exacerbation presenting with dysphagia, neck weakness, and diplopia during the infection. Anand et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] administered intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) (2 g/kg/die) and increased dose of steroids (from 2.5 mg every other day at basal to 20 mg per day during the infection). In another report, a SARS-CoV-2 case with ETI experienced an MG crisis involving the proximal upper and lower extremities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. This patient was treated with prednisone (increased from 20 to 40 mg twice daily), pyridostigmine, and IVIg (0.4 g/kg for five days). Due to a worsening of the proximal weakness of upper and lower limbs, another course of IVIg (650 mg/kg for two days) was performed. In both cases, the outcome was favourable.
