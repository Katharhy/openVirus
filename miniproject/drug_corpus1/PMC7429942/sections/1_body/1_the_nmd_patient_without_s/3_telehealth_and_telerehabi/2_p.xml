<p id="Par15">Overall, three unblinded studies on the use of teleneurology in ALS patients reported satisfaction among patients, caregivers, and health-care providers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Two studies point out the same level of care [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and comparable survival [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] in ALS patients treated with at-distance approaches versus in-person visits. In addition, virtual approaches seem to reduce emergency room access and acute hospitalizations in ALS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Telehealth services for the initial and follow-up evaluation in patients with myopathies are associated with comparable results between virtual and in-person neurology consultations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. A teleneurology study based on a small cohort (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4) of patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy suggested that this approach is considered acceptable by patients and it correlates with a reduction of hospital admission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In another study, a telehealth-based clinical grading scale for patients with polyneuropathies shows high sensitivity (98%), specificity (91%), and acceptable concordance with in-person examination [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Other studies on the suitability of this remote evaluation system for polyneuropathies are emerging [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Considering telerehabilitation for neurologic patients, a Cochrane review highlights low-level evidence for telerehabilitation to improve disability, fatigue, and quality of life in MS patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. A similar comprehensive analysis lacks for NMD patients. However, a small retrospective study evaluating telehealth-guided rehabilitation on 26 patients with mixed neuromuscular disorders reported improvement in cognitions, self-care, quality-of-life, and mobility [
