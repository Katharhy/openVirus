<p id="Par16">During the pandemic, the need for prevention and mitigation strategies has moved telemedicine towards the front lines of clinical practice. Professional societies are sharing guidelines on the correct implementation of telehealth approaches for neurological patients (e.g.

Muscle strength might be evaluated by movement against gravity, assessed with weights or resistive tools, or by functional activities, such as standing up from a sitting position with or without assistance. The nuances of deep tendon reflexes may be challenging via virtual approaches; however, a caregiver, if present, may be instructed to grossly evaluate briskly increased, reduced or asymmetric reflexes by tapping with fingers or objects [

Particularly, Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Life (MG-ADL) for myasthenia gravis are validated, disease-specific scales potentially useful for remote evaluations. Other proposed, non-disease-specific scales include Myo-FRS for myopathies and Nerve-FRS (N-FRS) for neuropathies, which may be practical tools for assigning a functional score [
