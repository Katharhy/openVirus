<p id="Par11">During the first days after the virus spread in our area, the need for intensive and sub intensive care beds in hospitals selected as “COVID Hubs” (appointed by the authorities), the shortage of PPE and the increased infection risk for patients imposed consistent changes in the management of our NMD patients. Elective or “non-urgent” patient visits were postponed to avoid unnecessary exposure for patients and clinical staff, favouring virtual encounters. Other services, such as electrodiagnostic tests, muscle, and nerve biopsies, were suspended unless urgent cases required further evaluations (such as new diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, myasthenia, myositis, or immune-mediated neuropathies). Ancillary services needed reorganization of personnel and resources: pulmonary assessments were stopped due to increased risk of viral shedding from tested patients; tests for dysphagia were performed for cases at increased risks of complications or unplanned hospitalizations; speech therapy and neuropsychological evaluations, whenever possible, were conducted on virtual platforms.</p>
