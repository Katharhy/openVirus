<p id="Par2">Since the end of December 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has claimed the lives of more than 400,000 individuals worldwide (

Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a wide spectrum of symptoms (referred to as “Coronavirus Disease 2019”, COVID-19), such as fever, dry cough, and fatigue in milder cases and systemic manifestations in severe disease courses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In parallel, SARS-CoV-2 infection poses a greater risk for old, oncologic, and immunosuppressed patients, which also include many individuals with hereditary and acquired neuromuscular disorders (NMD) that may already present increased risks due to the underlying disease (see “
 <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">Risk assessment and stratification</xref>” section). As already reported in other papers, the first phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has seen the overwhelming access of COVID-19 patients to the Emergency Departments prompting an urgent reorganization of personnel and facilities in worst-hit areas, such as Wuhan [

In this sense, sharing the experience gained from centres directly involved in COVID-19 management may help the neurologic community facing common challenges.
