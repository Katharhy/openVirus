<p id="Par44">In this work, we have reviewed the existing literature regarding the management of NMD patients with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection, addressing the concerns and challenges on the recommendations on disease-modifying therapies, the use of oxygen and ventilatory support, the contraindications and complications of drugs used in COVID-19 patients, and the implementation of telehealth approaches for NMD patients. Besides, we have shared our experience from Lombardy, one of the SARS-CoV-2 worst-hit areas worldwide, our thoughts on the role of NMD specialists in the pandemic and our view on the current and future role of NMD centres, hoping to help the Neurological community in this common effort against the coronavirus.</p>
