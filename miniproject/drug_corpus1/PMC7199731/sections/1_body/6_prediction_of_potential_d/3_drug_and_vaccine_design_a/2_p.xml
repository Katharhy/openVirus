<p id="p0140">There is an urgent need for the development of anti-viral drugs and vaccines against the 2019- nCov virus due to the high mortality rate of patients. During the epidemic and pandemic outbreak of new viral pathogens, the conventional method of development of drugs and vaccination is not possible to control as it is a time-consuming process [

 <xref rid="bib129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. Consequently, the rapid approach based on in-silico informatics has become very popular with recent advances in the sequencing of many pathogen genomes and protein sequence databases [

 <xref rid="bib133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. The aim of this is to use to computational approach to design both anti-viral drug and vaccine candidates. The spike protein in the novel coronavirus sequence is used to design both anti-viral drug and vaccine candidates. For anti-viral drug design, receptor-binding protein of novel coronavirus present in the N-terminal of spike protein is homology modelled and used as a protein receptor [

 <xref rid="bib136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. For vaccine design, the full sequence of the spike protein of novel coronavirus is used to predict B-cell and T-cell epitopes. The select best T-cell epitopes based on antigenicity used as peptides and docked with human allele protein.
