<p id="p0155">Great efforts are being made for the discovery of antiviral drugs, but there are no licensed therapeutic or vaccine for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection available in the market. Developing an effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 is, therefore, a research priority. It is time-consuming and expensive to design novel vaccines against viruses by the use of kits and related antibodies [

Thus, choosing the method of immune-informatics is more efficient and more applicable for deep analysis of viral antigens, B- and T-cell linear epitope prediction, and evaluation of immunogenicity and virulence of pathogens. Among those can be analyzed, B-cell can recognize and activate defense responses against viral infection, T-cell and antibody reactions may recover extreme respiratory infection (
