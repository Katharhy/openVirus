<p id="p0150">Structural proteins are important targets for vaccine and anti-viral drug development due to their indispensable function to fuse and enter into the host cell [
 <xref rid="bib140" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes glycosylated spike (S) protein to gain entry into host cells. The S protein is a trimeric class I fusion protein and exists in a metastable prefusion conformation that undergoes a dramatic structural rearrangement to fuse the viral membrane with the host-cell membrane [
 <xref rid="bib141" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib142" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. The S protein includes the receptor binding S1-subunit and the membrane fusion S2-subunit. The S1 subunit receptor-binding domain (RDB) is specifically recognized by the host receptor. When the S1 subunit binds to a host-cell receptor, the prefusion trimer is destabilized, resulting in the shedding of the S1 subunit, and the state transition of the S2 subunit to a stable postfusion conformation [
