<p id="p0130">Lopinavir and Ritonavir were identified in earlier studies to target the Main protease (Mpro) of SARS virus. The protein sequences of COVID-19 Main protease (Sars-CoV-2 Mpro) and SARS-CoV Mpro are 96% identical [
 <xref rid="bib126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. In several early studies, the similarities in the sequence of a potential target for COVID-19 to that of the SARS Mpro were utilized to build a model for the structure of SARS- CoV-2 Mpro [

 <xref rid="bib122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. The sequence similarity of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro to the SARS Mpro is sufficiently high to build a good model for the structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro [

 <xref rid="bib127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. However, the predictions of virtual screening studies and binding energy calculations are generally more accurate if a high-resolution experimental structure of the target is available.
