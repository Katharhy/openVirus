 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Before the emergence of Sars-CoV-2, there are 6 known human coronaviruses, including the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The symptoms caused by Sars-CoV-2 infection include acute respiratory distress syndrome (~29%), acute cardiac injury (~12%) or acute kidney injury (~7%) [
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], implying that Sars-CoV-2 may infect various human tissues. COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease [
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] associated with high mortality [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, is a betacoronavirus [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The previous name for this virus was Sars-CoV-2. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 has been sequenced [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 has 96% similarity to the bat-coronavirus and 76.5% identity to the SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Although there are no approved drugs or vaccines for COVID-19, some clinical trials are in progress [
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Lopinavir and Ritonavir were used in preliminary clinical studies [
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].
