 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In this review, the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid N-terminal domain (termed as SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD), as a model for understanding the molecular interactions that govern SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD binding to ribonucleotides is described. and the unique RNA binding site characteristics are discussed, which in turn will aid in the development of new drugs that interfere with viral N protein and viral replication in SARS-CoV-2, and highly related virus SARS-CoV. Furthermore, it is attempted to propose suitable vaccine candidates by identifying B-Cell and T-cell epitopes with computational approaches for drug and vaccine design.
