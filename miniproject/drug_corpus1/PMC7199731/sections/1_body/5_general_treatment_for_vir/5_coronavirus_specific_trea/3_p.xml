<p id="p0105">Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is a type I integral membrane protein which that functions as a carboxypeptidase and is the first human homolog of ACE. Besides, ACE2 is also a functional receptor of SARS-CoV and it mediates virus entry into the cell through binding with spike (S) protein [

 <xref rid="bib101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>] reported that COVID-19 used ACE2 as a sole receptor for the entry, but did not use other coronavirus receptors, aminopeptidase N and dipeptidyl peptidase, for the entry. Blocking the binding of S protein to ACE2 is important for the treatment of SARS-CoV infection [

One recombinant human monoclonal antibody (mAb) (single-chain variable region fragments, scFvs 80R) against the S1 domain of S protein of SARS-CoV from two nonimmune human antibody libraries. The mAb could efficiently neutralize SARS-CoV and inhibit syncytia formation between cells expressing the S protein and those expressing the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 were found by Sui et al. [
