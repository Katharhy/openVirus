<p id="p0090">Vitamin A supplementation reduced morbidity and mortality in different infectious diseases, such as measles, diarrheal disease, measles-related pneumonia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and malaria, as described by Semba et al. [
 <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Keil et al. [
 <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] had reported that vitamin B2 and UV light effectively reduced the titer of MERS-CoV in human plasma products. Atherton et al. [
 <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] had reported that vitamin C increased the resistance of chick embryo tracheal organ cultures to avian coronavirus infection. In addition, the decreased vitamin D status in calves had been reported to cause the infection of Bovine coronavirus [
 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Vitamin E deficiency had been reported to intensify the myocardial injury of coxsackievirus B3 (a kind of RNA viruses) infection in mice [

 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Dietary selenium deficiency that causes oxidative stress in the host can alter a viral genome so that a normally benign or mildly pathogenic virus can become highly virulent in the deficient host under oxidative stress [
