<p id="p0045">Structures of many individual proteins of SARS, MERS, and related coronaviruses, as well as their biological interactions with other viral and host proteins, have been explored along with the experimental testing of anti-viral properties of small compounds [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, experimental data of the same scale for Sars-CoV-2 may take years to obtain by the research community. By leveraging the previously known information on genome sequences as well as protein structure and function, bioinformaticians have been successfully helping the virologists by structurally characterizing proteins of novel viruses, determining the evolutionary trajectories, identifying interactions with host proteins, and providing other important biological insights. In particular, a plethora of results have been achieved through comparative, or homology, modeling principles [
