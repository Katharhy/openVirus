<p id="p0065">Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is the host receptor by Sars-CoV-2 to infect human cells. Viruses bind to host receptors on the target cell surface to establish infection. Membrane proteins mediated membrane fusion allowed the entry of enveloped viruses [
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. As recently reported, both nCoV and SARS-CoV could use ACE2 protein to gain entry into the cells [
 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Since the outbreak, many data analysis have shown a wide distribution of ACE2 across human tissues, including lung [
 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], liver [
 <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], stomach [
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], ileum [
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], colon [
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] and kidney [
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], indicating that Sars-CoV-2 may infect multiple organs. However, these data showed that AT2 cells (the main target cell of Sars-CoV-2) in the lung expressed rather low levels of ACE2 [
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Hence, the nCoVs may depend on co-receptor or other auxiliary membrane proteins to facilitate its infection. It is reported that viruses tend to hijack co-expressed proteins as their host factors [
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. For example, Hoffmann et al. recently showed that Sars-CoV-2-S use ACE2 for entry and depends on the cellular protease TMPRSS2 for priming [
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], showing that 2019- nCoV infections also require multiple factors. Understanding the receptorsâ€™ usage by the viruses could facilitate the development of intervention strategies. Therefore, identifying the potential co-receptors or auxiliary membrane proteins for Sars-CoV-2 is of great significance.
