<p id="p0070">Although ACE2 is reported to be expressed in the lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney, and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung [

 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], explored the single-cell gene expression atlas including 119Â cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single-cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins. Consistent with other recent reports [
 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], confirmed that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules. Intriguingly [
 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], found that the candidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4, and ENPEP. Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known receptors for human CoVs, suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs.
