  <p>Schematic diagram of the SARS coronavirus structure. Like all coronaviruses, Sars-CoV-2 consist of a minimum of three viral proteins namely spike protein (S), a type of glycoprotein, a membrane protein (M) that spans the membrane and an envelope protein (E), a highly hydrophobic protein that covers the entire structure of the coronavirus. The spike (S) glycoprotein in the coronavirus recognizes the host cell receptors and causes an important role in viral infection.</p>
