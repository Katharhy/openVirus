<p>At present, no pharmaceutical products have been shown to be reliable, safe, and effective for treating COVID-19.
 <xref rid="b6-dic-2020-4-15" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In the midst of the current global pandemic, many research groups around the world are actively developing treatments against this disease to reduce morbidities and mortalities. In the long term, the goal is to develop a vaccine to prevent further infections and future outbreaks. However, an effective vaccine may take years to develop and to manufacture on a global scale. Furthermore, it is unknown if newborns and patients already recovered from Covid-19 will need to be vaccinated. It is also uncertain if such a vaccine can protect individuals from this novel coronavirus in the future. In this narrative review, we summarise the latest body of evidence and ongoing research on the development of pharmacological therapies for COVID-19. The aim is also to review the suggested pathophysiology, prophylactic treatments, and therapeutic modalities for COVID-19.
