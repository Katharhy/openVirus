<p>SARS-CoV, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 are all zoonotic Î²-coronaviruses that have crossed from animals to humans.
 <xref rid="b23-dic-2020-4-15" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The origin of SARS-CoV is still a mystery and remains a controversial topic. SARS-CoV is closely related to civet and bat CoVs, but it is phylogenetically divergent from other coronaviruses associated with human infections, including OC43, NL63, 229E, and HKU1.
 <xref rid="b9-dic-2020-4-15" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The full-length genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 shows that it is similar to SARS-CoV, sharing 79.6% sequence identity.
 <xref rid="b24-dic-2020-4-15" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV use the same cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor, to enter into host cells.
