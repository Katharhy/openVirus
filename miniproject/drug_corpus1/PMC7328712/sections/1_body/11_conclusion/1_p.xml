<p>All the coronaviruses are similar in nature and have defined clinical presentations. The lower prevalence of coronavirus diseases in children might be accounted for by the lower exposure and relatively mild clinical presentation in the paediatric population. Many of the mild and asymptomatic cases are often overlooked and therefore go undiagnosed. Comparing the immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection between children and adults could reveal the pathology of the disease and might lead to possible treatment strategies for ‘recurrent’ novel coronavirus infections. There is currently no approved antiviral treatment for patients suspected of or confirmed with COVID-19. Research on the SARS and MERS epidemics and data from 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies show that antiviral therapy may be beneficial. Antiviral therapies and adjunctive treatments should, therefore, be considered in COVID-19 patients with the unstable clinical condition or clinical deterioration or in patients with comorbidities. As the COVID-19 situation develops, we will learn more about the safety and efficacy of specific treatments, and treatment recommendations are likely to change to reflect the latest evidence.
