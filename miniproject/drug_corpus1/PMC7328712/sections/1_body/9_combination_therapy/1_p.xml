<p>Several case series reported that combination therapy could be effective in treating patients with COVID-19 patients.
 <xref rid="b101-dic-2020-4-15" ref-type="bibr">101</xref> A single-centre case series of 89 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 (54 non-ICU and 35 ICU patients) treated with a combination therapy of moxifloxacin, lopinavir, interferon, and methylprednisolone (given to only ICU patients) showed good treatment effects and the mortality rate was less than 1%.

 <xref rid="b102-dic-2020-4-15" ref-type="bibr">102</xref> In another study of 51 COVID-19 patients, 10 (19.6%) patients treated with a combination of traditional Chinese medicine, interferon-a-1b, lopinavir, ritonavir, and short-term (3â€“5 days) corticosteroids had good treatment results and only one patient died.
 <xref rid="b103-dic-2020-4-15" ref-type="bibr">103</xref> In a case report of a 45-year-old woman with COVID-19 treated with thalidomide (100 mg orally once a day) and methylprednisolone (40 mg intravenously bid for 3 days then reduced to once a day for 5 days), she had overall improved status, increased oxygen index, decreased symptoms of nausea and vomiting, and lower cytokine levels.
