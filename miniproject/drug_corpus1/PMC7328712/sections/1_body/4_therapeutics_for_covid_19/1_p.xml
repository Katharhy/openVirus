<p>The majority of COVID-19 patients, especially children, are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, and will likely recover by managing their own symptoms without the need for hospitalisation.
 <xref rid="b36-dic-2020-4-15" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> According to the Report by the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), out of 55,924 patients in China with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, only 13.8% had severe symptoms including dyspnoea, respiratory frequency ≥30/minute, blood oxygen saturation ≤93%, PaO2/FiO
 <sub>2</sub> ratio &lt;300, and/or infiltrates &gt;50% of the lung field within 24–48 hours; whereas, 6.1% were critical including respiratory failure, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction/failure.
 <xref rid="b37-dic-2020-4-15" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> At present, there is no proven effective therapy against SARS-CoV-2. However, patients who are severely or critically ill might consider experimental therapies. At the time of writing, there are 1135 registered COVID-19 clinical trials, of which 657 are intervention studies using new therapies, but only about 260 trials are beyond phase I.
 <xref rid="b38-dic-2020-4-15" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> The WHO has also launched the ‘Solidarity’ international clinical trial, which is investigating effective treatments and is currently comparing four of the most promising treatment options: remdesivir, lopinavir–ritonavir, lopinavir–ritonavir plus interferon β-1a, and hydroxychloroquine.
 <xref rid="b39-dic-2020-4-15" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Over 90 countries have joined the ‘Solidarity’ international clinical trial.
