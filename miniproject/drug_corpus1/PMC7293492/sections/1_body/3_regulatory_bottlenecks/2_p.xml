<p id="p0045">There is ongoing debate about how long a novel COVID-19 vaccine will really take to advance through trials, achieve regulatory approval across multiple jurisdictions, and be manufactured and distributed at the required scale to impact global immunity and prevent further transmission. Vaccines often present commercial viability challenges due to long, complex development timelines and ‘capacity to pay’ issues in developing countries. While some that achieve global population health success, such as the human papillomavirus vaccine, can provide substantial return on investment
 <xref rid="p0135" ref-type="p">ix</xref>, these trends have meant that, compared with novel therapeutics, far fewer vaccines have made it through clinical testing. As a result, regulators and vaccine developers lack experience in vaccine development comparable with novel therapeutics [
 <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This could become increasingly problematic if all current COVID-19 clinical and preclinical vaccine candidates are simultaneously vying for regulators’ attention and resources to expeditiously review clinical protocols and evidence dossiers. Not to mention disruption to other clinical programs, as regulators are redirected to reviewing the clinical protocols of dozens of COVID-19 vaccine candidates and even more therapeutic candidates. Beyond these bottlenecks, the underlying support required within bioanalytical and pathology providers will also be critical to ensure rapid availability and interpretation of clinical data.
