<p id="p0060">With the data at hand from previous outbreaks, we can consider predictive epidemiological models that can guide globally coordinated responses ahead of the curve and take advantage of the availability of patients across what are typically northern and southern hemisphere seasonal outbreaks. Public–private partnerships, such as the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines partnership led by the National Institutes of Health, and programs for expedited responses from leading regulators such as the FDA’s Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program and the EMA’s Rapid Response team could be pre-emptively designed and developed for global health emergencies, rather than introduced during an outbreak, and when governments with advanced health systems such as Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore have already flattened their curves. This may point to an expanded leadership role for international organizations like WHO to coordinate regulatory jurisdictions in a more focused and targeted manner. In short, global coordination of regulatory efforts for COVID-19 are still lagging research and clinical development efforts.</p>
