<p id="p0065">We also need to be better prepared in the areas of preclinical science, including animal challenge models, clinical trial pathways from safety to efficacy, and for innovative and adaptive clinical trial designs such as umbrella studies (where multiple candidates are tested under a single protocol) to become the norm in times of epidemics. While some of these trial initiatives have started to emerge, such as the SOLIDARITY trial, they are still few and far between. This is especially problematic considering there are currently over 500 randomized controlled studies for COVID-19 preventatives and treatments, 31 of which have at least two arms and a target sample size of at least 1000 patients (some with recruitment targets of 40 000â€“55 000) [
