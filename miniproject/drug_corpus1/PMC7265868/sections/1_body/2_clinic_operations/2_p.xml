<p id="Par4">Clinic staff face several challenges associated with implementing COVID-19 guidelines. Many clinics do not have a sufficient number of N95 face-masks so healthcare workers often use cloth masks. Similarly, hand sanitizer use is recommended between client visits when it is not possible to visit portable hand washing stations (for example when conducting voluntary HIV testing). However, many clinics report shortages of hand sanitizer supply. Smaller capacity clinics do not have sufficiently-sized rooms to maintain 1.5 m of space between providers and clients. Due to nationwide curfew from 7 pm to 5am, clinics have reduced their hours to ensure healthcare workers have sufficient time to travel home before curfew. Further, medical students and volunteer healthcare workers are no longer permitted to support service provision with healthcare staff supervision, so this workload falls on clinic doctors and nurses. Healthcare workers have been increasingly diverted to support pandemic-related service provision, exacerbating the existing critical shortage of providers available for routine health services. These factors have increased patient waiting time and healthcare provider burnout. Finally, there is a lack of COVID-19 testing conducted at clinics, although capacity has significantly expanded since the start of the pandemic.</p>
