<p id="Par3">In response to COVID-19, Kenya has released technical guidance for health facilities to mitigate disease spread. Clinics have restructured operations to comply with these guidelines. Individuals seeking care are now stopped at the entrance to ensure they have a cloth face-mask prior to entering the clinic. Those without masks can purchase one from nearby vendors. Individuals are asked to wash their hands at a portable handwashing station before proceeding into the clinic. Once inside, a receptionist takes their temperature and asks about travel history and COVID-related symptoms. Individuals are then directed to a waiting bay and seated 1.5 m away from other clients. Clinic appointments are spaced out to prevent overcrowding. When meeting with providers, clients are seated 1.5 m away from providers when possible. Portable handwashing equipment, provided by the government and non-governmental organizations (NGO), are located throughout the clinic to ensure multiple handwashing stations.</p>
