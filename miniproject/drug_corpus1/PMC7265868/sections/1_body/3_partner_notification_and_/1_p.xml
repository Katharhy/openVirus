<p id="Par6">Prior to COVID-19, aPS procedures for tracing of HIV-exposed sexual partners began with a phone call to notify individuals of their potential exposure and encourage them to visit the clinic for HIV testing. Those who were reluctant to come to the clinic were offered HIV testing at home or a convenient location in the community. Persons without a valid number (or those unable to be reached via phone) were traced at home by an aPS provider, who made at least three attempts to locate the individual. In the aPS scale-up program, more than half of male partners reached have been tested outside of clinics. With the emergence of COVID-19, community-based HIV testing and home tracing have been halted so aPS providers can only administer HIV testing at clinics. Many partners contacted are hesitant to attend the clinic, citing barriers including lack of transport funds, fear of contracting COVID-19 at the clinics, and inability to afford a cloth mask. Some report a desire to postpone HIV testing until after the pandemic is over. Further, staff are unable to contact approximately 10% of partners who lack valid phone numbers and would have been reached through in-person tracing before the pandemic. Due to these barriers, testing of HIV-exposed partners has decreased, with more dramatic declines observed in Kisumu (41 partners tested in April vs. 81 in January 2020) (Fig.Â
