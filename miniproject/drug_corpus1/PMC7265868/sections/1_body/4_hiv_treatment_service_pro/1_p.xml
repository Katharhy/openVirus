<p id="Par7">An important objective of the aPS program is to encourage linkage to care and initiation of antiretroviral treatment (ART) for index clients and male partners testing HIV-positive. To date, over 90% of index clients and male partners report being on ART at 6 months after receiving aPS. However, as the number of COVID-19 cases increases, clinics will likely experience reductions in ART initiation and retention. The National AIDS and STIs Control Programme (NASCOP) has recommended providing all persons on ART with a 3–6 months supply of refills to increase patient convenience and reduce clinic volume during COVID-19. Clients attending the clinic for refills can proceed directly to the pharmacy for drug pick-up without seeing a provider. Some clinics have started ART distribution through community-based delivery. While these processes have streamlined ART distribution, it has reduced opportunities for clinical interactions, including adherence counseling and viral load testing. Additionally, turnaround time for receiving viral load results has increased from 1–2 weeks to several months due to diversions of laboratory resources for COVID-19 testing and prioritization of viral load testing for special populations (e.g. pregnant and breastfeeding women), which may result in delays in identifying persons at risk of ART dropout.</p>
