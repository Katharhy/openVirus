Current evidence does not support the presence of the West Nile virus, pandemic influenza, SARS, and SARS-CoV-2 in semen. The Zika virus appears to alter semen parameters in a way that diminishes fertility, but the effect is likely time limited. The West Nile virus and SARS have been associated with orchitis in a small number of case reports. Viruses that cause febrile illness, such as pandemic influenza, SARS, and SARS-CoV-2, are associated with decreased sperm count and motility and abnormal morphology. SARS and SARS-CoV-2 may interact with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors present in the testes, which could impact spermatogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have reported the presence in semen, sexual transmission potential, and fertility side effects of recent viral pandemics. Overall, semen studies and fertility effects are highly understudied in viral pandemics, and rigorous study on these topics should be undertaken as novel pandemics emerge.</p><p><bold>Payne K, Kenny P, Scovell JM, et&#x000a0;al.

The literature search was limited to English publications or publications translated into English, and databases were searched from dates of their inception to June 2020. Articles with only abstracts available were included. To review the immune status of the testes, searches were conducted using the following keywords: testes, immune privilege, and blood-testes barrier. To review the difference in immune response between men and women, searches were conducted with the following keywords: gender difference in immune response and sex difference in immune response. Searches were also conducted for each of the recent viral pandemics with the following key words separated by &#x0201c;OR&#x0201d;: genitalia, testis, orchitis, prostate, reproductive, semen, sperm, hormones, endocrine, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, gonadotropins, testosterone, fertility, fecundity, sexual transmission, erectile function, erectile dysfunction, sexual function, sexual dysfunction, and libido. Case studies, case series, reviews, and meta-analyses were included. Both human, animal, and basic science data were included. For each viral pandemic, articles were selected if they met any of the following inclusion criteria: discussion of semen parameters, identification of virus location within the genital tract, discussion of sexual transmission, or discussion of fertility related processes including spermatogenesis, libido, and sexual function. Article titles and abstracts were reviewed by K.P. and P.K. to identify 222 relevant studies. Full-text articles were then reviewed to determine if they met the stated selection criteria, yielding 105 total articles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).

The BTB provides protection from autoimmune cell destruction, making the testes an immune-privileged site.

Increasing evidence suggests that the intensity, severity, and mortality of viral disease differs between genders.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Literature examining this link has generally observed that women mount a stronger immune response to antigens, infections, and vaccines than do men.

</p><p id="p0050">The first randomized controlled trial to separate the effect of sex hormones and chromosomes was conducted by Palaszynski et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> in 2005, using mice in which the sex-determining region Y (SRY) gene was moved from the Y chromosome to an autosome. This allowed separation of sex chromosome complement (XX or XY) from gonadal type (ovaries or testes). The authors reported that among ovariectomized (-SRY) mice, those with XY had greater immune response than those with XX, suggesting that the male complement was immune stimulatory. This effect was not detected when comparing intact males (+SRY) with XX and XY complements, suggesting that testosterone tempers the effect of the XY complement. Supporting this, when testosterone was added to the ovariectomized female (-SRY) XY mice, their elevated immune response was suppressed.</p><p id="p0055">In 2011, Robinson et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> similarly found that the increased immune response of female mice to influenza A was eliminated by removal of the gonads. Although they did not find any immune response to testosterone or dehydroepiandrosterone in male mice, administration of high-dose estradiol attenuated the induction of tumor necrosis factor alpha and C-C motif chemokine ligand by 10 times and resulted in increased rates of survival compared with no or low-dose estradiol. Building on this, administration of 17&#x003b2;-estradiol to female mice resulted in less secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma as well as decreased neutrophil recruitment, improving disease tolerance.</p><p id="p0060">Taken as a whole, current evidence suggests women exhibit stronger immune response to viral infections than men. This response typically manifests as better long-term outcomes and to subsequent reexposure but also as more severe disease acutely.

The first suspected human case followed in 1954, but the virus did not demonstrate mosquito-borne transmission until 1962. In 2013, the ZIKV emerged in Brazil during preparation for its upcoming international sporting events, creating a large epidemic through the Americas. It entered the continental United States in 2016 with cases in Florida and Texas, peaking in 2017. No new cases have been reported since 2017. However, similarities to other <italic>Flaviviruses</italic> such as dengue fever have made the virus difficult to recognize clinically, with several epidemics first noted after rises in associated conditions such as congenital microcephaly and Guillain-Barre syndrome.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref>
</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3.2"><title>The ZIKV in Semen</title><p id="p0070">The ZIKV was first suspected to be in semen following case reports of travel-associated transmission to sexual partners in non-endemic areas.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Since then, multiple studies have confirmed the presence of ZIKV RNA in semen by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> A 2018 prospective study by Mead et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> found that semen was positive with ZIKV in 33% of men, including 61% of those tested within 30&#x000a0;days of symptom onset. Infectious ZIKV was detected in 15% of RNA-positive semen samples collected within 30&#x000a0;days of symptom onset, but 0% of samples obtained after 30&#x000a0;days of disease onset were infectious. Evidence from Joguet et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> and Matusali et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> suggests that the virus is particularly infectious to spermatocytes, but Matusali et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> also demonstrated in testis explants that the virus can infect Sertoli cells and release infectious particles on the adluminal side of the BTB.</p><p id="p0075">Although the reported persistence of the ZIKV varies widely from days to months after the onset of symptoms, it is widely agreed that viral RNA persists longer in semen than in other bodily fluids.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> This reflects a potential reservoir in the male genital tract, perhaps because of the immune privilege of the testes. Supporting this, a systemic analysis by Counotte et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> reported a median duration of ZIKV RNA in semen of 40&#x000a0;days with a maximum of 370&#x000a0;days, vs 7&#x000a0;days in saliva and 14&#x000a0;days in the female genital tract. The persistence of ZIKV RNA in men with vasectomies further indicates that the virus may also replicate in distal genital tract tissues, such as the bulbourethral glands, prostate, and seminal vesicles.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref>
</p><p id="p0080">Several factors are noted to influence persistence of the viral RNA in semen. In the analysis from Counotte et&#x000a0;al,<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> increased persistence was associated with increased age, absence of joint pain, conjunctivitis, and less frequent ejaculation. Conversely, men who ejaculated more than 4 times a week cleared viral RNA more than 21&#x000a0;days earlier, and for men who reported vasectomies, although the rate of viral RNA detection was similar, the viral load was decreased from 5.6 to 3.6 log10 RNA copies per milliliter.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3.3"><title>Evidence of Sexual Transmission</title><p id="p0085">The first suspected case of sexual transmission of the ZIKV occurred in 2008, when a male patient returned home to the United States from Senegal.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> He developed symptoms of arthralgia, rash, and hematospermia shortly after returning, followed by his wife 4&#x000a0;days later. Serologic results confirmed Zika infection, although only convalescent phase samples were positive in the wife, and semen samples were not collected. Although it is possible that this transmission occurred via other bodily fluids such as saliva, no other family members were affected.</p><p id="p0090">After the subsequent Zika outbreaks, in a systematic review Moreira et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> compiled demonstrated cases of sexual transmission from men to women, women to men, and men to men. Among the cases examined, sexual transmission was confirmed with positive serum antibodies, Zika RNA in semen, and semen cultures. In addition, they demonstrated that ZIKV RNA was detected in semen as late as 188&#x000a0;days and infectious virus in semen up to 69&#x000a0;days after symptom onset. Notably, 3 transmissions were from entirely asymptomatic patients, who represent the majority of Zika cases.</p><p id="p0095">Further complicating the control of Zika transmission, a prospective cohort study by Paz-Bailey et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> demonstrated that the virus exhibits intermittent shedding, making it difficult to determine when an individual has cleared the virus. The number of days between symptom onset and positive samples was up to 142 in serum, 204 in urine, and 36 in semen. Taken together, these data represent potential challenges in preventing sexual transmission of the virus, which is of particular concern in non-endemic areas such as the continental United States where mosquito-borne transmission is rare.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Although mathematical modeling suggests that sexual transmission alone is not likely to drive or sustain a ZIKV outbreak,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> serial semen screenings may be effective in preventing the Zika-associated congenital microcephaly and Guillain-Barre syndrome in patients who are or wish to become pregnant.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3.4"><title>The ZIKV and Fertility</title><p id="p0100">Several case reports have described genitourinary symptoms in male Zika cases, although their impact on the male reproductive system is as of yet unclear.

Building on these results, Joguet et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> monitored the reproductive hormones as well as sperm count, motility, viability, and morphology of patients with the ZIKV on days 7, 11, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 after symptom onset. They detected that total and motile sperm counts were about 50% lower on day 60 compared with day 7 but recovered by day 120. The long-term effect on sperm morphology is less clear. In the same study, morphology characteristics recovered to normal by day 120. Results also reflected an early increase of follicle-stimulating hormone and inhibin B, which recovered over time.

ACE2 is highly expressed in the renal tubular cells, the intestines, Leydig cells, and the seminiferous ducts in the testes, raising the possibility that the virus may have a deleterious testicular effect.<xref rid="bib104" ref-type="bibr"><sup>104</sup></xref> By contrast, Pan et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib97" ref-type="bibr"><sup>97</sup></xref> demonstrate with single-cell transcriptome data that ACE2 RNA is sparsely expressed in the testis and argue that this is an unlikely medium of viral entry into target host cells.

Larger studies will be imperative to understand currently conflicting evidence and to deduce what potential fertility SARS-CoV-2 may have.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0255">In this article, we have reviewed the presence in semen, possibility of sexual transmission, and fertility implications of each of the major recent viral pandemics: Zika, Ebola, West Nile, pandemic influenza, SARS, and SARS-CoV-2. The ZIKV has been reported in semen up to 370&#x000a0;days after disease onset but appears to be present for a median time of 40&#x000a0;days for most individuals. Sexual transmission of the ZIKV has been repeatedly documented, even among entirely asymptomatic individuals, and is of particular concern given its ability to microcephaly in a developing fetus. Short-term fertility may be negatively affected by the ZIKV based on several reports of reduced sperm count, altered morphology, and impaired mobility in semen samples. Fortunately, this effect appears time limited.</p><p id="p0260">The EBOV has also been detected in semen, with studies indicating its presence for an average of 115&#x000a0;days, with a maximum reported duration of 965&#x000a0;days. Reports of sexual transmission remain rare, with only 9 suspected cases documented in the history of the virus. Semen parameters do not appear altered, although a proportion of survivors decreased sexual function and diminished libido.</p><p id="p0265">The WNV has only been reported in semen or to be transmitted sexually in isolated case reports. Likewise, only a single autopsy report suggests the possibility of WNV-induced orchitis. Influenza, a respiratory pathogen, has not been found in semen or been shown to be sexually transmissible. Research demonstrating its impact on fertility has focused on the effects of febrile illness on semen parameters, showing that febrile episodes are linked to transiently decreased sperm count, motility, and morphology.</p><p id="p0270">The SARS virus has not been shown to be present in semen, but several small case series of autopsy reports have found testicular damage and atrophy in individuals deceased from SARS, which may be linked to secondary autoimmune orchitis. SARS-Cov-2, the most recent viral pandemic included in this review, is expected to behave similar to SARS virus, but further data are required to validate these assumptions. Current evidence from small case series shows that it is not present in semen and thus is unlikely to be sexually transmitted. For both SARS and SARS-CoV-2, there is speculation that the viruses&#x02019; interaction with ACE2, which is present in the Leydig cells and the seminiferous ducts of the testes, could have implications for spermatogenesis. Further studies are needed to explore this possibility.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0275">We have reported the presence in semen, sexual transmission potential, and fertility side effects of recent viral pandemics. Overall, semen studies and fertility effects are highly understudied in viral pandemics, and rigorous study on these topics should be undertaken as novel pandemics emerge. Specifically, further semen studies and fertility studies are needed to understand the transmission potential and fertility side effects of the novel SARS-CoV-2.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Statement of authorship</title><p id="p0280">Kelly Payne: Conceptualization, Methodology, Investigation, Resources, Writing - Review &#x00026; Editing, Funding Acquisition; Peter Kelly: Conceptualization, Methodology, Investigation, Resources, Writing - Review &#x00026; Editing, Funding Acquisition; Jason Scovell: Conceptualization, Methodology, Investigation, Resources, Writing - Review &#x00026; Editing, Funding Acquisition; Kajal Khodamoradi: Conceptualization, Methodology, Investigation, Resources, Writing - Review &#x00026; Editing, Funding Acquisition; Ranjith Ramasamy:Conceptualization, Methodology, Investigation, Resources, Writing - Review &#x00026; Editing, Funding Acquisition.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Madhav</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name><name><surname>Oppenheim</surname><given-names>B.</given-names></name><name><surname>Gallivan</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name></person-group><chapter-title>Pandemics: risks, impacts, and mitigation.
