<p id="p0065">The ZIKV was first recognized in 1947 in a sentinel monkey from Zika forest, Uganda. The first suspected human case followed in 1954, but the virus did not demonstrate mosquito-borne transmission until 1962. In 2013, the ZIKV emerged in Brazil during preparation for its upcoming international sporting events, creating a large epidemic through the Americas. It entered the continental United States in 2016 with cases in Florida and Texas, peaking in 2017. No new cases have been reported since 2017. However, similarities to other 
 <italic>Flaviviruses</italic> such as dengue fever have made the virus difficult to recognize clinically, with several epidemics first noted after rises in associated conditions such as congenital microcephaly and Guillain-Barre syndrome.
