The number of days between symptom onset and positive samples was up to 142 in serum, 204 in urine, and 36 in semen. Taken together, these data represent potential challenges in preventing sexual transmission of the virus, which is of particular concern in non-endemic areas such as the continental United States where mosquito-borne transmission is rare.
