 </xref> He developed symptoms of arthralgia, rash, and hematospermia shortly after returning, followed by his wife 4Â days later. Serologic results confirmed Zika infection, although only convalescent phase samples were positive in the wife, and semen samples were not collected. Although it is possible that this transmission occurred via other bodily fluids such as saliva, no other family members were affected.
