<p id="p0100">Several case reports have described genitourinary symptoms in male Zika cases, although their impact on the male reproductive system is as of yet unclear. In a cohort study, Paz-Bailey et al

 </xref> monitored the reproductive hormones as well as sperm count, motility, viability, and morphology of patients with the ZIKV on days 7, 11, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 after symptom onset. They detected that total and motile sperm counts were about 50% lower on day 60 compared with day 7 but recovered by day 120. The long-term effect on sperm morphology is less clear. In the same study, morphology characteristics recovered to normal by day 120. Results also reflected an early increase of follicle-stimulating hormone and inhibin B, which recovered over time. By contrast, in a cross-sectional study after the 2016 epidemic in Brazil, Avelino-Silva et al

 </xref> examined serum hormones and semen samples in 6 patients 1 year after symptoms. In all patients, serum hormones were normal, and semen RT-PCR RNA was negative, but impaired motility was seen in all 3 samples tested and low count was noted in 1 of 5 patients. Given the recency of the Zika outbreaks, the long-term effects of the virus on fertility characteristics should continue to be monitored.
