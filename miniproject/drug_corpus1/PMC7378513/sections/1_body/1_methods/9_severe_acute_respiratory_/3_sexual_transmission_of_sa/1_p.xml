<p id="p0245">Although SARS-CoV-2 is not known to be present in semen, precluding the ability for sexual transmission, the intimate nature of physical sexual contact still dictates caution to prevent viral spread. Given the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory droplets, saliva, mucus, and fecal matter, as well as current recommendations to maintain 6 feet of distance between individuals to prevent the spread of infection, physical sexual intimacy presents a high-risk scenario for viral transmission, particularly for non-monogamous partners who do not live with one another.
