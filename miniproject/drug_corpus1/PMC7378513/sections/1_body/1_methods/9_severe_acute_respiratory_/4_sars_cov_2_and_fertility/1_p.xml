 </xref> have proposed a theoretical link between COVID-19 and reduced fertility based on the virus’ strong interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Molecular modeling conducted by the authors showed the virus have a unique structure that allows it to penetrate deep into the hydrophobic pocket of ACE2. ACE2 is highly expressed in the renal tubular cells, the intestines, Leydig cells, and the seminiferous ducts in the testes, raising the possibility that the virus may have a deleterious testicular effect.

 </xref> demonstrate with single-cell transcriptome data that ACE2 RNA is sparsely expressed in the testis and argue that this is an unlikely medium of viral entry into target host cells. Even so, it is still unknown exactly what function ACE2 serves in the testis.

Larger studies will be imperative to understand currently conflicting evidence and to deduce what potential fertility SARS-CoV-2 may have.
