 </xref> in 2005, using mice in which the sex-determining region Y (SRY) gene was moved from the Y chromosome to an autosome. This allowed separation of sex chromosome complement (XX or XY) from gonadal type (ovaries or testes). The authors reported that among ovariectomized (-SRY) mice, those with XY had greater immune response than those with XX, suggesting that the male complement was immune stimulatory. This effect was not detected when comparing intact males (+SRY) with XX and XY complements, suggesting that testosterone tempers the effect of the XY complement. Supporting this, when testosterone was added to the ovariectomized female (-SRY) XY mice, their elevated immune response was suppressed.
