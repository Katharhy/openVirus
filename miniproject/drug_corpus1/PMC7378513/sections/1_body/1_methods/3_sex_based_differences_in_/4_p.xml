Although they did not find any immune response to testosterone or dehydroepiandrosterone in male mice, administration of high-dose estradiol attenuated the induction of tumor necrosis factor alpha and C-C motif chemokine ligand by 10 times and resulted in increased rates of survival compared with no or low-dose estradiol. Building on this, administration of 17β-estradiol to female mice resulted in less secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma as well as decreased neutrophil recruitment, improving disease tolerance.
