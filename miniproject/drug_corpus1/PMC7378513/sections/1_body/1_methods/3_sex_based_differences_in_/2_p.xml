<p id="p0045">The X chromosome contains many important genes for immune function, including TLR7, CD40 ligand (CD40L), and forkhead box P3 (FOXP3).

 </xref> Notably, it also contains the most microRNAs of all chromosomes, which regulate protein-coding genes and modulate cellular activities. The Y chromosome, by contrast, uniquely contains none.

 </xref> And, although X inactivation equalizes gene expression for most of the X chromosome, genes within non-recombining regions may be expressed more in women. In addition, other immune-regulatory genes present on both the X and Y chromosomes have unequal expression levels, and tissue distribution between the sexes is perhaps due to sex hormones.
