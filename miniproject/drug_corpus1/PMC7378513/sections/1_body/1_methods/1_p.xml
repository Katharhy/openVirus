The literature search was limited to English publications or publications translated into English, and databases were searched from dates of their inception to June 2020. Articles with only abstracts available were included. To review the immune status of the testes, searches were conducted using the following keywords: testes, immune privilege, and blood-testes barrier. To review the difference in immune response between men and women, searches were conducted with the following keywords: gender difference in immune response and sex difference in immune response. Searches were also conducted for each of the recent viral pandemics with the following key words separated by “OR”: genitalia, testis, orchitis, prostate, reproductive, semen, sperm, hormones, endocrine, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, gonadotropins, testosterone, fertility, fecundity, sexual transmission, erectile function, erectile dysfunction, sexual function, sexual dysfunction, and libido. Case studies, case series, reviews, and meta-analyses were included. Both human, animal, and basic science data were included. For each viral pandemic, articles were selected if they met any of the following inclusion criteria: discussion of semen parameters, identification of virus location within the genital tract, discussion of sexual transmission, or discussion of fertility related processes including spermatogenesis, libido, and sexual function. Article titles and abstracts were reviewed by K.P. and P.K. to identify 222 relevant studies. Full-text articles were then reviewed to determine if they met the stated selection criteria, yielding 105 total articles (
