<p id="p0210">SARS is respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that first appeared in the Guangdong province of southern China in 2002. The virus rapidly became an epidemic and spread globally to 26 countries and 8,000 people before being contained in 2003. Subsequent research uncovered a natural reservoir within horseshoe bats and civets acting as an intermediate host in local meat markets.
