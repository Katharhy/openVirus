 </xref> They analyzed the pathologic changes in testicular autopsy specimens from 6 patients with SARS compared with those of 4 controls. All 6 patients with SARS demonstrated testicular atrophy grossly. The SARS samples exhibited extensive germ cell destruction with increased apoptosis on TUNEL assay. Histologically, basement membrane thickening, peritubular fibrosis, leukocytes, and vascular congestion indicative of local inflammation were noted. ISH that produced positive readings in the lungs of the patients with SARS was negative in the testes. However, extensive deposits of IgG were detected within the seminiferous epithelium, interstitium, Sertoli cells, and some germ cells of patients with SARS compared with controls. This potentially represents an autoimmune orchitis secondary to the immune response to SARS.
