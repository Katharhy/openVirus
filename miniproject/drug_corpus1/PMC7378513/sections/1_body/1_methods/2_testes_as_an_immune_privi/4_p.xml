<p id="p0035">Despite its immune-privileged nature, the testicular environment is still capable of mounting an effective inflammatory response. In fact, the testes are of equal susceptibility to infection as any other tissue type.

 </xref> Given the suppression of adaptive immune mechanisms, it is simply more reliant on the innate immune mechanisms of macrophages, natural killer cells, and antimicrobial secretory products such as interferons and defensins.

 </xref> have found that in the testicles of men with HIV, HIV viral RNA has remained detectable in the testes even when levels were undetectable in the blood secondary to antiviral therapy (although this is not known to cause increased transmission risk). This becomes especially important in the study of viruses such as the Ebola and Zika, where asymptomatic individuals may still be capable of sexual transmission of the virus.
