<p id="p0180">The influenza virus is among the most common infectious illnesses worldwide. The virus came into prominence among humans and pigs in the 1918 pandemic, shortly after mutations of avian strains enabled transferal to humans and pigs.

 </xref> Amplified by the movement and proximity of World War I soldiers, the virus soon infected 500 million people and killed 50 million, more than the military and civilian deaths of World War I combined. Since then, type A influenza has produced pandemic outbreaks in 1957, 1968, and most recently in 2009. These events are triggered by reassortment in avian or swine reservoirs of genes for key hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) surface glycoproteins, by which the virus is subtyped. The H1N1 and H3N2 strains of type A influenza currently circulate among humans, which along with influenza B cause seasonal flu (WHO 2020). Notably, in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, young people were particularly at risk, whereas 1 of 3 older than the age of 60 years had antibodies, likely from a historical infection or vaccination with a similar strain.
