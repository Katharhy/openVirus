 </xref> first detailed the timeline of genital tract effects following febrile influenza. After 2 days of high fever due to the virus (39 –40 C), a 47-year-old man had decreased total sperm count at days 15, 37, and 58 before normalizing at day 79. Motility percentile was similarly decreased but recovered sooner at day 58. The authors measured the DNA fragmentation index and found it to increase from 9% before the fever to 24%, 35%, 15% and 8% at 15, 37, 58, and 79 days, respectively. Sperm DNA fragmentation by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay increased from 17% before fever to 23% at day 15, but this was not statistically significant (
