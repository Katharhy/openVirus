<p id="p0175">The only available report of a possible compromise in fertility from the WNV comes from a case report of an autopsy on a 43-year-old man deceased from the WNV.

 </xref> In this case, thickening of the tubular basement membrane was observed with frequent foci of tubular necrosis and absence of spermatogenesis. Immunohistochemical staining did not identify WNV antigen in testicular tissue; however, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of formalin-fixed testicular tissue did reveal enveloped particles fitting the size, structure, and location of

No studies could be identified reporting on semen parameters during or after acute WNV infection, and no studies could be identified detailing possible changes in sexual function. More evidence is required to substantiate a link between the WNV and reduced fertility.
