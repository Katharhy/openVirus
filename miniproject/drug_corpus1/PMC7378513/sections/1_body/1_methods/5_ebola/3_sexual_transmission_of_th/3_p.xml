 </xref> The acute blood sample and semen sample from the male survivor differed by 5 mutations from a female sexual partner with acute EVD and 4 subsequent cases from the disease cluster. In total, the sexual transmission resulted in a cluster of 13 cases with 4 deaths. Sexual transmission from the EBOV, while possible, remains a rare event. The World Health Organization in their guide to clinical care for survivors of EVD recommends abstinence or barrier protection during sexual activity for 12 months after the onset of EVD.
