<p id="p0125">Although the EBOV in the semen is clearly demonstrated, it remains far less certain what potential the virus has for sexual transmission. Since the first known outbreak of a filovirus (the 1967 Marburg virus), there have been 9 documented events of suspected human-to-human filovirus sexual transmission.

 </xref> The first case of suspected EBOV transmission occurred during the 1995 Kikwit outbreak, wherein in a 20-year-old woman was shown to have weakly positive IgM antibodies to IgM 52Â days after exposure from her convalescent partner. The individual was later negative for IgG antibodies on a serum sample, making it difficult to confirm whether she was in fact asymptomatically infected.
