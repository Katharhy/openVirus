<p id="p0130">In the West African outbreak, the first confirmed sexual transmission occurred in March 2015. A man transmitted the virus to his sexual partner 179 days after onset of EVD, which was confirmed by whole viral genome analysis of his semen compared with an acute blood sample of his female partner where the samples were found to differ by only 1 nucleotide.

 </xref> A man presenting with EVD was found to have an EBOV genome that did not match the country's current strain of transmission but instead differed by only 6 nucleotide submissions from a sample of his brother-in-law's blood collected during prior acute infection. The man's sister was positive for EBOV IgM at the time of his infection; however, the transmission could not be confirmed as her husband's semen was negative for the EBOV at the time a sample was collected. It was thought that the transmission from the male survivor occurred at 250 days after disease onset.
