<p id="p0120">Animal models have been used to further characterize the presence of filoviruses in the gonadal tissue and have shown viral infiltration of the testicular interstitium and the seminiferous tubules. In situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry performed on non-human primates (NHPs) infected with the Marburg virus localized the virus to the interstitium between the seminiferous tubules.

 </xref> Indeed, the virus was found to be most prominently localized to Sertoli cells, leading to breakdown of the BTB and inflammatory cell invasion into the testicular environment. Another study in NHPs found EBOV RNA to be localized to the tubular lumen of the epididymis of 1 of twelve rhesus monkey sampled but did not find any EBOV localized to the testis.

 </xref> Overall, it appears that viral persistence may be established in the interstitial tissues of the reproductive tract, where it is transmitted by tissue macrophages across the BTB and into the seminal fluid.
