<p id="p0110">Across multiple studies, it has been shown that the cross-sectional percentage of EBOV survivors of the 2014–2015 West African epidemic with a positive RT-PCR for EBOV RNA in the semen ranges from 8.1 to 9.8%.

 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> With more living EBOV survivors from this epidemic than ever before, this number represents a considerable pool of individuals. While disease modeling has shown that 50% of individuals will clear the virus from semen at 115 days and 90% will clear it at 294 days, viral EBOV RNA has been detected in the semen for as long as 965 days after initial infection.
