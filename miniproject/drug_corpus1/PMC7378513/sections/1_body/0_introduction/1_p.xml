 </xref> As one potential means of controlling viral spread, it is necessary to understand what viruses are present in semen, how long they remain detectable, and what their potential is for sexual transmission from male to female partners. In addition, with so many survivors of viral pandemics alive today, knowledge is needed about how these viruses affect the male genital tract and what implications they may have for future fertility.

 </xref> Despite the importance of these questions, to our knowledge, these topics have not yet been the subject of systematic review. Here, we detail several important foundational principles that affect viral infection in the testes and comment on the differences in immune response seen between men and women. Then, we present the state of current research regarding presence in semen, sexual transmission, and fertility effects for the Zika virus (ZIKV), Ebola virus (EBOV), West Nile virus (WNV), pandemic influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) (
