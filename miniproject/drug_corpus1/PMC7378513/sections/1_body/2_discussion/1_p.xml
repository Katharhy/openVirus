<p id="p0255">In this article, we have reviewed the presence in semen, possibility of sexual transmission, and fertility implications of each of the major recent viral pandemics: Zika, Ebola, West Nile, pandemic influenza, SARS, and SARS-CoV-2. The ZIKV has been reported in semen up to 370 days after disease onset but appears to be present for a median time of 40 days for most individuals. Sexual transmission of the ZIKV has been repeatedly documented, even among entirely asymptomatic individuals, and is of particular concern given its ability to microcephaly in a developing fetus. Short-term fertility may be negatively affected by the ZIKV based on several reports of reduced sperm count, altered morphology, and impaired mobility in semen samples. Fortunately, this effect appears time limited.</p>
