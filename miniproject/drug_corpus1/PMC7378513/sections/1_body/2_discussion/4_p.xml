<p id="p0270">The SARS virus has not been shown to be present in semen, but several small case series of autopsy reports have found testicular damage and atrophy in individuals deceased from SARS, which may be linked to secondary autoimmune orchitis. SARS-Cov-2, the most recent viral pandemic included in this review, is expected to behave similar to SARS virus, but further data are required to validate these assumptions. Current evidence from small case series shows that it is not present in semen and thus is unlikely to be sexually transmitted. For both SARS and SARS-CoV-2, there is speculation that the virusesâ€™ interaction with ACE2, which is present in the Leydig cells and the seminiferous ducts of the testes, could have implications for spermatogenesis. Further studies are needed to explore this possibility.</p>
