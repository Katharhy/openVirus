 <xref rid="bib0047" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. However, it is the first time to check the accuracy of these studies via taking their obtained analytical solutions, then evaluating the numerical solutions of the model, and calculating the absolute value of error between the analytical and numerical solutions. The future works will be based on the same idea of all previous obtained solutions of the investigated model to show the most accurate solution of this model and to use it in the models of medical applications
