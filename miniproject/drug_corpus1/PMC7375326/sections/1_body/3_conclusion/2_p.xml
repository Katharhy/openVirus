This numerical investigation has been based on three analytical applied schemes (the modified Khater method, the extended simplest equation method, and the sech-tanh expansion method) to evaluate the boundary and initial conditions. Also, the accuracy of the obtained numerical solutions has been illustrated and showed the power of the modified Khater method over the other two analytical used schemes. The obtained solutions show that the used technique can be applied to various forms of nonlinear partial differential equations. Performance of the suggested technique reveals that these methods are appropriate for applying to different formulas of nonlinear partial differential equations.
