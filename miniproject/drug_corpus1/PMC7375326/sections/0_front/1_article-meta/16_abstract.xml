These solutions calculate both the boundary and initial conditions that allow employing the septic-B-spline scheme which is one of the most recent schemes in the numerical field. We use the obtained computational solutions via the modified Khater, the extended simplest equation, and sechâ€“tanh methods through Atangana-Baleanu derivative operator. The comparison between the exact and numerical evaluated solutions is illustrated by some distinct sketches. The functioning of our numerical method is tested under three computational obtained solutions.
