<p id="p0090">The hindered LA therapy in patients with HoFH leads to a significant increase in LDL-C levels. Even in non-FH patients, high visit-to-visit variability in LDL-C levels is an independent predictor of adverse CV events.

 </xref> Therefore, keeping LDL-C levels on target is extremely important in the management of these patients with HoFH. The present study illuminated the importance of easily accessible LLT during a pandemic or any other disaster. Although LA is the most effective way of lowering LDL-C in patients with HoFH, it is a hospital-based chronic treatment procedure. Therefore, effective pharmacotherapies are needed to avoid the dependence of these patients on the hospitals.
