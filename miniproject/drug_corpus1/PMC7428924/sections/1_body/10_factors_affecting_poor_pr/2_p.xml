<p>What are the factors that correlate with a poor patient prognosis? It is evident that patients, younger than 50 years, die significantly less from COVID-19 than older patients. Mortality is especially higher in men older than 70 years (

This is explained by the fact that circulating ACE-2 is higher in men than in women. At the same time, the values of ACE-2 are higher in diabetics and people with cardiovascular disease. The presence of hypertension, diabetes and coronary heart disease contributes to the patientâ€™s poor prognosis. Furthermore, increased D-dimer values are a poor prognostic sign. According to one Chinese study, D-dimer values in survivors were low and were below 1 microgram/L. Among those who died, D-dimer values increased significantly to 42 micrograms/L (
