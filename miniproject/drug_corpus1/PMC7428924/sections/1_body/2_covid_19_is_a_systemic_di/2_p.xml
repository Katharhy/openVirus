<p>The afore-mentioned clinical manifestations suggest that COVID-19 is a systemic disease, that it is characterized by numerous tissues and organ damages. The presence of thrombi and microthrombi contributes to the manifestation of various clinical symptoms. At the same time, vascular endothelial dysfunction and coagulopathy occur (
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Inflammation of the endothelium severely impairs its function. The virus not only leads to pneumonia, which in turn causes further complications (
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), but also to systemic endothelial inflammation. Namely, the virus directly attacks the endothelial cells of blood vessels. Induce endothelial damage in the small and smallest blood vessels of the lungs and leads to an enhanced inflammatory response by T cells. This is similar to an organ rejection reaction in case of transplantation. During the autopsy, a significant increase in new blood vessels was found in the lungs of the patient with COVID-19, through intussusception angiogenesis. Therefore, there is a comprehensive inflammation of the endothelium of the heart, brain, lungs, kidneys and digestive tract. All of these ones have fatal consequences: severe microcirculation disorders occur that damage of the heart, lead to pulmonary embolism and clog blood vessels in the brain and digestive system. Multiple organ failure occurs, ultimately resulting in death. Systemic inflammation promotes thrombosis. Massive inflammation stimulates the production of cytokines which in the liver leads to the formation of coagulation factors. For example, the level of fibrinogen in a severe patient with COVID-19 is 10-14 g/L, while in a healthy person the value of fibrinogen is 2-4 g/L. Endothelial cells located on the inside of blood vessels have ACE-2 receptors on their surface, which serve as a gateway for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the wall of the blood vessel as well as the blood itself is affected at the same time. This explains why thromboembolic complications occur so frequently, including pulmonary embolism. Many patients have increased D-dimer values as well as cutaneous changes in the limbs, suggesting thrombotic microangiopathy. Diffuse intravascular coagulation and thrombosis of large blood vessels are associated with multisystem organ failure. Renal blood vessels are often involved and ACE-2 receptors are known to be found in the renal tubules. In severe forms of COVID-19 the kidneys are affected in 30%, while in milder forms it’s in 5%. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 not only attacks the lungs, but also affects the blood vessels of all organs. COVID-19 is a systemic inflammation of the blood vessels, so we could see the whole clinical picture as COVID-19 endothelism (
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). From the point of view of cardiologists, COVID-19 therapy is directed in two directions: it is necessary to stop the reproduction of the virus at the stage when it is most pronounced and at the same time to protect and stabilize the patient’s blood vessels. This is especially true for patients who already have cardiovascular disease and some of the risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, increased cholesterol, obesity, smoking) with reduced endothelial function. It is important to mention that the endothelium of younger patients can more easily resist the attack of the virus. COVID-19 is a primary respiratory disease, but many patients have cardiovascular disease, including the hypertension, acute heart damage and myocarditis. Acute lung damage leads to increased heart rate, which then presents an additional problem, especially for patients with pre-existing heart insuficiency. Cardiovascular disease can be primary if we take into account the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-2), which is also present in the heart itself.
