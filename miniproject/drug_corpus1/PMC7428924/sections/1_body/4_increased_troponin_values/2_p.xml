<p>Troponin will be released in 8-28% of patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, indicating that heart damage has occurred. Increased values of troponin and its dynamic increase during hospitalization, shows that the risk of artificial ventilation is increased by 5 times, and the risk of arrhythmias is increased, while mortality is increased by 5 times. All of the above explains the connection between cardiovascular diseases and the occurrence of death in patients suffering from COVID-19. Many patients infected with COVID-19 die from cardiac arrest due to severe hypoxia, multiorgan dysfunction, or systemic inflammation. The occurrence of arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, often occurs as part of COVID-19 cardiomyopathy, among other things, because inflammation is a substrate for the occurrence of arrhythmias (

QT prolongation may occur as part of myocarditis, as well as due to the application of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, especially if combined with azithromycin. This therapy is currently widely used in many clinics around the world, although the benefits of this therapy are highly debatable and the side effects can be very serious. The latest study, published in May 22nd, 2020 in the Lancet, did not prove the benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine used as monotherapy or in combination with second-generation macrolides, azithromycin or clarithromycin. At the same time, there were ventricular arrhythmias and mortality increased.
