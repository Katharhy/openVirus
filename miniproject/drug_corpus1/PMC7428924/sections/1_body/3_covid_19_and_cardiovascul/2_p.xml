<p>SARS-CoV-2, not only leads to damage of the respiratory system, but also to acute and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system (
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Cardiovascular diseases that were present before a patient was infected with COVID-19 significantly increased, both morbidity and mortality in these patients. This especially refers to the presence of hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease and kidney disease. Patients with acute coronary syndrome, who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus, have a poor prognosis. In such patients, the functional cardiac reserve is reduced due to myocardial ischemia or necrosis. At the same time, the possibility that these patients will develop heart failure is quite high. Respiratory failure and hypoxia can lead to myocardial damage as well as the reaction of the immune system itself. In Wuhan, according to reports of Chinese physicians, in patients infected with COVID-19 and with acute coronary syndrome, the complete clinical picture was very severe and associated with high mortality (

On the other hand, acute inflammatory responses can lead to ischemia in the presence of pre-existing cardiovascular disease. The inflammatory activity of atherosclerotic plaque in coronary blood vessels becomes even more pronounced during systemic inflammation, which makes atherosclerotic plaque more vulnerable and thus increases the possibility of its rupture. In such a situation, the vulnerable plaque should be stabilized with aspirin, statins, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin II antagonists (

Inflammation can lead to endothelial dysfunction and to increased levels of procoagulant factors, which contributes to the forming of an occlusive thrombus and possibly to its rupture. If all these facts are considered, then an intense inflammatory response, along with the already present cardiovascular disease, can contribute to heart damage. Vascular endothelial cell dysfunction in the presence of inflammation, and impaired myocardial function, can lead to cardiac decompensation or to its worsening, if it has been presented before. Myocarditis, pericarditis and arrhythmias can also occur. Rhythm disorders are manifested in the form of bradycardia, tachycardia and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The occurrence of myocarditis is the result of focal or global inflammation of the myocardium, necrosis and ventricular dysfunction. Inflammation, by itself, plays an important role in the onset, development and prognosis of cardiovascular disease. The virus can penetrate directly into the myocardium and multiply and lead to its damage, necrosis and apoptosis (programmed cell death). Focal myocarditis should be considered if precordial pain occurs during and after the acute phase of COVID-19, with clinical signs that would suggest that it is a coronary syndrome, but without coronary artery obstruction. C-reactive protein (CRP), as well as other inflammatory cytokines, have become new risk factors. Cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular risk factors represent an independent risk factor for cardiac death.
