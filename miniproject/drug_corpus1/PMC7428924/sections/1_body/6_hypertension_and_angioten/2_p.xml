<p>Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 is especially present in the lungs, heart and other tissues. It serves, among other things, as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 virus entry into cells. ACE inhibitors (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors) and angiotensin II antagonists (ARBs) are first-line drugs used in the treatment of hypertension, cardiac decompensation, after a myocardial infarction and in chronic kidney disease. Both ACE inhibitors and ARBs lead to increased ACE-2 activity and at the same time, they could lead to increased virus activity. It has been hypothesized that these drugs could lead to worsening of SARS-CoV-2 infection. For now, there is no consensus that the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs could reduce or increase the risk of developing COVID-19. However, it should be emphasized that so far there are no studies showing that drugs that block the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), such as ACE inhibitors: lisinopril, enalapril, trandolapril, or angiotensin II antagonists such as losartan, candesartan, valsartan, increase ACE -2 in human tissues (

In contrast, studies in animals that have been infected with the coronavirus show that ACE-2 plays an important role in protecting the lungs from more serious injuries caused by the virus.
