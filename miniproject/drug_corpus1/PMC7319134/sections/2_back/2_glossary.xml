    <bold>FD-based AFM</bold>
   </term>
   <def>
    <p>The force–distance curves obtained from measuring the vertical force that the tip applies to the surface. This technique can be used to extract mechanical, chemical, and physical properties of nanomaterials and is the basis of probing the ligand–receptor bonds in physiological conditions</p>
