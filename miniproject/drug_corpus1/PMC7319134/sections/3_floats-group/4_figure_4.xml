  <p>Contact tracing application: Using GPS contacts of individual A and all individuals using the app, infections are traced out. This is further supplemented by scanning QR-codes displayed on high-traffic public amenities where GPS is too coarse. Using this application individual A requests a test for COVID-19 infection, and their positive test result is shared as an instant notification to individuals who have been in close contact.
