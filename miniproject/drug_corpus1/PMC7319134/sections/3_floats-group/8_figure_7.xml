  <p>LSPR detection of nucleic acid sequences from SARS-CoV2 virus. The schematic shows the architecture of LSPR substrate consisting of gold nanoparticles where light is illuminated on the substrate for generation of local heat and detection of binding nucleic acid binding events. The graph also shows the LSPR response to the theroplasmonic effect and toward detection of nucleic acid sequences at low concentrations. Reprinted with permission from ref (
