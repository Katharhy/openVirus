<p>Recent evidence suggests that determination of SARS-CoV2 in wastewater is helpful to study the virus transmission in humans since SARS-CoV2 can be excreted in feces or urine. Several attempts have been made to detect SARS-CoV2 in wastewater including the Netherlands,

 </sup> and Sweden. The report of SARS- CoV2 detection in sewage was published by Gertjan Medema 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref218">218</xref>
 </sup> in the Netherlands. Specifically, the targets of gene N (N1–N3) and gene E were tested by RT-qPCR in the WWTP sewage samples to determine the presence of SARS-CoV2. Neither gene N nor gene E was detected on February 6, while gene N1 was detected in six sites, and genes N3 and E were detected in five and four sites on March 15 and 16, respectively. This is consistent with the first case in the Netherlands reported on February 27. In the United States, SARS-CoV2 at high titers was determined by RT-PCR in wastewater samples from a major urban treatment facility in Massachusetts.

 </sup> Their work demonstrated that longitudinal analysis of wastewater can provide an estimate of the population level of SARS-CoV2 burden without available on-site testing. The appearance of SARS-CoV2 RNA was verified in six WWTP wastewater samples from a low prevalence area Murcia in Spain.

 </sup> Compared to the COVID-19 cases announced by the municipality, the environmental surveillance results clarified that SARS-CoV2 had spread among the population before the initial cases were reported in many cities. Therefore, WBE could be used as an early warning tool for the presence and prevalence of COVID-19 infections and provide a more accurate estimate of the spread extent of COVID-19 infections than clinical testing.

 </sup> RT-PCR assays have been routinely employed for SARS-CoV2 detection in numerous research and disease control centers since the outbreak of COVID-19,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref223">223</xref>
 </sup> as also discussed in our aforementioned sections. However, RT-PCR has some disadvantages which may limit its applications globally. For example, complete facilities, expensive equipment, skilled technicians, and laborious procedures are essential for RT-PCR. With the rapid growth of COVID-19 confirmed cases worldwide, this method has been unable to meet the requirements of detecting numerous suspicious cases in a short time even though in some cases, PCR has demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity. Essentially, the requirements for complicated sample handling in the laboratory, skilled personnel, and a long period of data processing and analysis (4–6 h) are not conducive to real-time and effective monitoring of samples on location. Therefore, it is critical to develop efficient transportable and robust analytical tools to accurately and quickly trace low-level SARS-CoV2 sources through WBE to confirm these suspected cases and screen asymptomatic infected cases without centralized laboratories. Using a WBE strategy in creating an early warning and intervention system will require a rapid biosensing method for the on-site detection of viruses at the wastewater collection outlets.

 </sup> Due to the advantages of low cost, rapidness, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and simplicity, biosensors have been applied in detecting different analytes for clinical diagnosis, food safety, and environmental monitoring. Recently, biosensors have been employed for electrochemical, optical, electrical, thermal, acoustic, and piezoelectric determination of infectious diseases such as AIDS, dengue, Ebola, influenza, and malaria. The biomarkers of these infectious diseases are usually identified in blood, feces, plasma, serum, sputum, saliva, urine and nasal mucosa. When detecting wastewater samples, the matrix effects of the wastewater can also be minimized using an ultrahigh-affinity probe for specific targets.
 <sup>

 </sup> Moreover, biosensors can be extended for the multiplex detection of infectious diseases. For instance, Men 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref227">227</xref>
 </sup> presented a multifunctional fluorescent protein nanowire (FNw) for multiplex detection of hemagglutinin 1 protein from the influenza virus along with p24 and gp120 protein from HIV. The FNw integrated with numerous green fluorescent protein molecules could amplify signal and enhance sensitivity. In addition, biosensors can be developed into integrated medical devices for point-of-care detection of infectious diseases in resource-limited regions. For example, Choi 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref228">228</xref>
 </sup> presented an integrated paper-based sample-to-answer biosensor for nucleic acid testing. The fast technology analysis (FTA) card and glass fiber were integrated into a lateral flow strip for nucleic acid extraction, amplification, eye detection, and smartphone quantification. A hand-held battery-powered heating device was also used for LAMP amplification in POC settings. Hence, biosensors can be employed as early warning sensing systems to help the government take effective measures in advance to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.
