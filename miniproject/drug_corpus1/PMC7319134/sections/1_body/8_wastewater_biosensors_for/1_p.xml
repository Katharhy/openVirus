<p>Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been implemented for the determination of various biomarkers, including illicit and licit drugs, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products, markers of population size, industrial chemicals, and biologicals.

 </sup> Human viruses (

 <italic>g</italic>., astroviruses, enteroviruses, noroviruses, rotaviruses, salivirus) have also been detected in wastewater, indicating that WBE holds great potential in the early determination of viral outbreaks by routinely monitoring the concentration and diversity of viruses in wastewater.

 </sup> Generally, WBE can provide information about viruses on a population scale and assess the temporal and spatial trends of virus occurrence in the watershed within the catchment of sewage treatment plants. The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV2 has brought about a significant risk to human health. It has been suggested that SARS-CoV2 can be detected in fecal samples of confirmed COVID-19 cases from many countries including China,

 </sup> The research involving 10 pediatric COVID-19 confirmed cases provided the potential evidence for fecal viral shedding of SARS-CoV2.

 </sup> Even if the results of the nasopharyngeal testing became negative, the rectal testing of eight children was still positive, indicating that viral shedding of gastrointestinal tract and fecalâ€“oral transmission might occur. The presence of SARS-CoV2 in fecal samples may increase the virus load on the wastewater systems of infected cities.
