<p>Biosensors hold potentials for 
 <italic>in situ</italic> quantitative analysis of SARS-CoV2 in wastewater. Although wastewater is a complex matrix, we have recently proposed a paper-based device which has shown great potential to detect pathogens in wastewater. Essentially, we developed a fast “sample-to-answer” analysis method which can provide quantitative monitoring of nucleic acids and genetic information through the analysis of sewage waste.

 </sup> Our results were further cross validated with a robust electrophoresis and agarose gel image assay, showing promising reliability for wastewater analysis. The proposed biosensors will show advantages including affordability, rapid analysis time, excellent sensitivity, superior specificity, and low reagent/sample consumption. These benefits highlight the biosensors’ extraordinary capability of economical, portable, and user-friendly detection of SARS-CoV2 in wastewater compared to traditional detection methods. Biosensors will help identify COVID-19 infected patients on the spot to provide timely medical advice and monitor the spread of SARS-CoV2 at early stage. Therefore, sewage sensors for SARS-CoV2 detection at the population level have a clear potential for early warning of COVID-19 pandemic. For example, a recent study demonstrated that live SARS-CoV2 was isolated from the feces and urine of infected people, which would then enter the wastewater treatment system.

 </sup> Although SARS-COV-2 is usually present in sewage in the form of RNA particles, there currently is no evidence which shows live SARS-CoV-2 present in sewage. Within this viewpoint, further research on the environment for the analysis of disease biomarkers is required to effectively use WBE biosensors for an informed status of the disease within a community.
