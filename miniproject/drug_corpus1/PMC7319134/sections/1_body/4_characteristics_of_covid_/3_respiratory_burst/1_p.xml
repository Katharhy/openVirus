<p>Essentially, polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) circulating in our blood show elevated levels in the blood as a defense response of the host during an episode of infection. PMN inherit different pieces of information in the case of different etiological agents stimulating immunity.

 </sup> This causes activation of PMN, and there is an increase in the consumption of molecular oxygen which results in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), a process collectively called respiratory burst.

 </sup> Some biosensors in the past have been developed for the ROS detection from the virus, and on a similar basis identification of ROS from SARS-CoV2 infection may lead to an alternative route of COVID-19 detection.
