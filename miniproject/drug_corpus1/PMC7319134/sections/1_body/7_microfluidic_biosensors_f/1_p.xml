<p>Microfluidics is a technique for precise control and manipulation of microscale fluids.

 </sup> The basic operation units such as preparation, extraction, reaction, and detection in various analysis processes are integrated on a microchip. Through the micromachining process, the micro- to submillimeter-level fluid channels, pumps, valves, sensors, detectors, and other units can be fabricated on the substrate of silicon, metal, polymer, or other materials. So far, microfluidic platforms have been applied using various analytical techniques including electrochemical analysis, fluorescence analysis, MS, and chemiluminescence.

 </sup> Microfluidic platforms can be classified into capillary, pressure-driven, centrifugal, electrokinetic, and acoustic systems on the basis of their liquid propulsion principles.

 </sup> In the past decades, microfluidic biosensors have been developed for the detection of infectious diseases in the medical field. Infectious diseases are usually identified by bacteria (

 <italic>g</italic>., 
 <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Haemophilus influenza</italic>), food borne pathogens (

 <italic>g</italic>., hepatitis C, influenza, dengue virus).

 </sup> For example, shear horizontal surface acoustic wave biosensors were established for multiplex detection of anti-p24 and anti-gp41 antibodies of HIV.

 </sup> The designed dual-channel biochip consists of a sensing area sensitive to biological binding events, along with 
 <italic>in situ</italic> reference control coating and miniaturization configuration. The microfluidic biosensor can detect HIV biomarkers within 5 min using only 6 μL of plasma sample, which raises the prospects of the next generation of economical, rapid, and point-of-care diagnosis to prevent HIV pandemics. A silicon nanowire-based microfluidic biosensor was also developed to detect the RT-PCR product of dengue serotype 2.

 </sup> A detection limit as low as 10 fM was reported within 30 min, which was 3 orders of magnitude lower than that obtained by using 
 <sup>32</sup>P-labeled probes and 4 orders of magnitude lower than that achieved by ethidium bromide staining. During the COVID-19 pandemic, rapid diagnosis is of great significance in early diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 for timely and appropriate treatment. Although culture-based methods and molecular techniques are commonly used in clinical diagnosis, recently introduced microfluidic biosensors have the advantages of cheapness, portability, rapid response, high precision, high reproducibility, low reagent/sample consumption, easy application, and high-throughput parallel processing.
 <sup>

 </sup> Therefore, microfluidic biosensors can meet the World Health Organization guidelines “ASSURED” (
 <italic>e</italic>.
 <italic>g</italic>., affordable, specific, sensitive, user-friendly, rapid and robust, equipment free, and deliverable to end user),
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref208">208</xref>
 </sup> which have tremendous potential to be implemented for SARS-CoV2 detection in point-of-care COVID-19 diagnosis. However, further efforts should be devoted to improving sensitivity and specificity, strengthening stability and efficiency, and shortening fabrication time and analysis time for monitoring pandemics. It is also necessary to reduce the matrix effects of actual samples. Moreover, it remains challenging to develop fully automated microfluidic biosensors for on-site monitoring of pandemics.
