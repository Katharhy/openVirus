<p>While many of the developed plasmonic techniques with advanced surface chemistry provide high sensitivity, selectivity, and quick response time for the detection of the viral strains, their use in point-of-care applications remains challenging. This is due to the large size and cost of the instrumentation which is involved in the development of plasmonic systems. Even though the use of these sensors remains elusive for the mass production and self-testing by community members, these sensors are now well-developed for widespread use in laboratory-based settings for accurate detection of viral strains during pandemics. Recently, Qiu 
 <italic>et al</italic>. have developed a biosensor for accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 disease where plasmonic photothermal (PPT) effect and LSPR are combined as transduction principles in the sensing scheme.

 </sup> Essentially, the DNA receptors are used to detect selected sequences from the SARS-CoV2 through nucleic acid hybridization. With the mandatory use of nanoparticles and light in LSPR sensing, there is a generation of well-known thermoplasmonic at the plasmonic resonance frequency. The authors claim to elevate the 
 <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization temperature using this thermoplasmonic heat which further assists in facilitating accurate discrimination of two similar gene sequences. This LSPR biosensor showed a good limit of detection, down to the concentration of 0.22 pM, exhibiting a high sensitivity toward the selected SARS-CoV-2 sequences in a multigene mixture; see more details in
