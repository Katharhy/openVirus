<p>In addition to the direct sensing of analytes which confirm viral infection, optical sensors can also play a significant role in high-resolution imaging of the viruses during pandemics. For example, Wei 
 <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated how optical sensors can be used for virus imaging based on the laser diode excitation.
