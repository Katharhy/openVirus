<p>Field-effect-transistors (FETs) and three-electrode potentiometric and amperometric systems are the key electronic biosensors widely applicable in the detection of biomolecules and pathogens. The main advantages of an electronic biosensor are miniaturization, low cost, and mass manufacturing. Besides, the concepts of a modular sensor for separating electrode and readout on a smartphone can be implemented effectively. FETs for instance are easily fabricated in CMOS foundaries,

 </sup> whereas a large number of electrochemical sensors are now commercially available in the market in portable formats.

 </sup> In the past a large number of electrochemical sensors have been developed for pandemic viral strains. For instance, Han 
 <italic>et al</italic>. developed a single microfluidic electrochemical sensor for the detection of H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9 combined with zinc oxide nanorods,

 </sup> and many other works which even used disposable screen printed electrodes and paper-based substrates for the detection of viral strains.

 </sup> Some of these works have definitely encouraged researchers to develop strategies for the early detection of COVID-19 disease. The work of Seo 
 <italic>et al</italic>. reported a FET biosensor for detecting SARS-CoV2 in clinical samples.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref153">153</xref>
 </sup> This sensor was produced by coating the gate of the transistor made up of graphene sheets, with an antibody that was specific against the SARS-CoV2 spike protein. Desired performance of the sensor was identified with tests conducted with antigen as protein, cultured virus, and nasal swab specimens from COVID-19 patients. The biosensor could detect the SARS-CoV2 spike protein at concentrations of 1 fg/mL in buffer solvents prepared in the laboratory and 100 fg/mL from the biological fluid of the clinical samples. This biosensor was further used for the successful detection of viral strains in culture medium with a limit of detection in clinical samples found around 2.42 × 10
 <sup>2</sup> copies/mL. This was indeed a neat example of how biosensors can detect the virus at low concentration without sample pretreatment or labeling, see more details in

 </xref>. In another recent work, Mahari 
 <italic>et al</italic>. developed a biosensor using three electrode-electrochemical systems by using disposable screen-printed carbon electrodes.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref154">154</xref>
 </sup> The limit of detection of this biosensor named, eCovSens, was found to be 120 fM in buffer solvents. Even though the detection was performed in nonclinical samples, the electrodes were found stable for up to 4 weeks, suggesting that such electrodes could potentially be mass-produced, shipped, and then distributed in the community within a reasonable time frame during the mid-pandemics.
