<p>Among the 11 key attributes discussed above, the most important focus of current biosensing innovations should be the sensitivity and specificity of the assays directed toward early detection of COVID-19 disease or future pandemic strains. This is necessary to overcome the uncertainty associated with a wide variety of advanced testing technology including lateral flow assays or direct detection of viral RNA with CRISPR biosensors.

 </sup> Repurposing some of the instrumentation such as the 96-well microtiter plate readers could also potentially provide multiple replicates of a bioassay in a short duration of time. Such absorbance readers are so common that nearly all laboratories which provide routine blood profile testing, including in the remote settings, may utilize this platform for quick testing. For instance, absorbance readers are used in recent work on the quick detection of COVID-19 disease,

 </sup> suggesting that the capital required for new schemes developed already exists within many test facilities. Another important aspect which could potentially lead to a quick solution required in mid-pandemics is the use of soft-biosensing. For instance, artificially intelligent software could be installed in hand-held thermometers which are currently being widely used in the screening of COVID-19 candidate patients. Software could perhaps be developed in such a way that the infrared signals analyzed by the detector provide information on some key skin biomarkers, in addition to the temperature measurement, similar to non-invasive biosensing.
