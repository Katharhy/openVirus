   <p>High selectivity: Selectivity of a biosensor is its ability to exclusively detect the analyte in the presence of other homologous analytes and contaminants. Viruses usually depict similarity in their structures in that they have a nucleic acid genome, a protein capsid which covers the genome, and in some cases lipid covering the genome and a protein coat.
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref76">76</xref>
    </sup> This protein coat in the virus distinguishes them from the bacteria.
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref77">77</xref>
    </sup> Perhaps specifically identifying and then targeting some proteins on the capsid with other proteins 
    <italic>via</italic> protein–protein interactions may lead to selective detection of the virus.
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref78">78</xref>−
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref80">80</xref>
    </sup> A good selectivity is usually achieved by ensuring that the monolayer of probes that target the chosen biomarkers on the analyte is optimally immobilized on the sensor surface.
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref81">81</xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref82">82</xref>
    </sup> Now this is most often a subject of research where it usually takes a dedicated team and a time frame of 6–12 months to develop probes specific to the target. This obviously is a bottleneck for quick development of a biosensor during pandemics such as the COVID-19. However, the advancements in nanotechnology and the pace with which discovery and invention of materials are developing present a good opportunity for researchers to develop chemical probes, specific only for the target under detection.
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref83">83</xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref84">84</xref>
    </sup> While developing specific probes is obviously a challenge, recent work has demonstrated an antifouling coating for the electrodes consisting of biomolecules mixed in a network of conductive nanomaterials.
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref85">85</xref>
    </sup> These layers were found to preserve 88% of the original detection signals for IL-6 even after 1 month of exposure to unprocessed human plasma.

  <list-item>
   <p>High sensitivity: The spacing, affinity, and specificity of the target probes in the monolayer, often called self-assembled monolayers (SAM) or biorecognition elements, determine the attachment of the analyte on the sensor surface.
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref86">86</xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref87">87</xref>
    </sup> In addition, properties of the transducer (most often electrical or optical) influence the overall sensitivity of the biosensor;
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref88">88</xref>
    </sup> for instance, how many molecules should be attached before a response from the sensor could easily be distinguished from its inherent noise.
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref89">89</xref>
    </sup> If specificity of the SAM layer is ensured, then it is possible to detect several small biomarkers (sizes &lt;150 kDa) even at the single molecular level.
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref90">90</xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref91">91</xref>
    </sup> For the detection of biomarkers associated with pandemic strains such as the COVID-19, it is of the utmost importance that the developed sensor can detect the disease-specific biomarkers at a low concentration, preferably at a single molecule level, and produce an output which is easily readable for the measured/required concentration. For instance, one major challenge, if addressed, to detect the viral DNA or RNA directly in whole blood without the need of amplification 
    <italic>via</italic> PCR technology would lead to technologies for rapid detection of the pandemic viral strains. Some complementary tools such as the nanoparticle-based detection tools
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref92">92</xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref93">93</xref>
    </sup> and microfluidics
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref94">94</xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref95">95</xref>
    </sup> might also be well-placed to address some of these fundamental issues involving biological fluid handling on the sensor surface to enhance sensitivity.

   <p>Rapid response time: For a diagnosis tool to be actively used in a pandemic, the response time of the sensor is of paramount importance.
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref97">97</xref>
    </sup> Theoretically, most transducers in the sensor respond instantaneously (&lt;1 s) to the applied stimulus, such as upon the interaction of biomolecule with the sensor surface.
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref98">98</xref>
    </sup> However, at times, many of these signals require post-processing with advanced electronics and computing systems for accurate analysis of the measured quantity. For instance, temperature correction
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref99">99</xref>
    </sup> and background noise identification and removal
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref100">100</xref>
    </sup> can often lead to an increase in the sensor response time. Therefore, the design and role of signal conditional circuits are of prime importance to ensure quick response time of the measurement.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Multiplexing: At early stages of the infection when there is less understanding of the characteristics of the viral strain, it is often the concentrations of common blood biomarkers (such as CRP and interlukien as described for COVID-19) which serve as the signature of the infection. As also described earlier that for COVID-19 detection, a combination of more than two biomarkers is currently used to confirm the disease; therefore, a multiplexed system which allows detection of multiple biomarkers is desirable for a quick, accurate, and early detection of the disease. Multiplexing can be achieved by physically isolating different areas of the sensor surface, where each isolated area acts as a standalone sensor.
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref101">101</xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref102">102</xref>
    </sup> Each of these individual areas could further be made specific to one type of biomarker.
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref103">103</xref>−
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref105">105</xref>
    </sup> Measurement can be acquired by either one transducer which will scan the isolated areas of the sensor surface or by incorporation of multiple transducers attached to the individual sensing area.
    <sup>

   <p>Multimode sensing for on-chip validation: For the detection of a pandemic strain, it is also necessary that the sensor, while providing a quick response, is also reliable. To increase the reliability in the measurement of the sensor, more than one mode of sensing could provide cross validation of the sensing result.
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref107">107</xref>
    </sup> The major trade-off of the multimode sensing is an increase in the size of physical dimensions and computation time of the sensor. This can also lead to a slow response time, increased power consumption, and cost ineffectiveness. However, the good news is that most of these barriers are rapidly being addressed. Electrochemical and optical techniques on single platforms
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref108">108</xref>
    </sup> which can easily be translated into multiplexed panels are increasingly getting attention in both academia and industry, which might be able to serve the purpose of increased reliability and robustness required in the healthcare sensors, by instant authentication of the measured data.

   <p>Disposable: The fact that the pandemic viral strains are highly infectious, for example, COVID-19 has a reproductive number higher than that established for SARS and H1N1, that is, between 1.5 and 2, the need for single-use sensors is crucial for avoiding contamination from the sensing systems. The most judicial pathway to develop a disposable sensor system is the modular approach.
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref109">109</xref>−
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref111">111</xref>
    </sup> In this approach, electrode and readout modules can be separately designed where electrodes can be made cost-effective and disposable in nature. Candidate materials for developing disposable electrodes could potentially include glass-,
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref112">112</xref>
    </sup> paper-,
    <sup>

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref117">117</xref>,

    </sup> or ceramic-based
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref119">119</xref>
    </sup> materials which can be used to immobilize bioprobes specific to the biomolecules of our interest. Among these materials, paper-based biosensing electrodes,
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref112">112</xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref113">113</xref>
    </sup> which have grabbed the attention of the community in recent times, provide the most optimal disposable features, as such electrodes could be classified into burnable trash after use. On the other hand, readout modules in the form of a mobile phone application-based
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref120">120</xref>
    </sup> readout will provide many advantages other than cost-effectiveness, such as periodic data collection and connectivity to the centralized healthcare systems.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Long shelf life and easy to use: The electrodes developed should be easy to use, and their lifetime should be at least 1 month. This will ensure that a large number of testing kits can be prepared and shipped not only to the healthcare facilities but also to the supermarket shelves.
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref121">121</xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref122">122</xref>
    </sup> The ease of use could allow people to self-test and take necessary and informed decisions to self-isolate, which will ensure that the transmission of the disease can be curtailed at its source.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Cost effective: The advantage of cost-effectiveness of a biosensor is effectively reflected in its affordability.
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref123">123</xref>
    </sup> Intuitively, the lower the price of a given biosensor, the more affordable is the device. To keep the price low, so that all members of the community can afford it during pandemics, a biosensing system can essentially be divided into two parts: The first part can be a disposable electrode such as the screen printed electrode or a paper-based electrode, which could potentially be available in the supermarket drug shelves.
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref124">124</xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref125">125</xref>
    </sup> The electrode could have direct contact with a body fluid such as saliva for the quick detection of viral strain. The second part of the sensor system can be an application on a mobile phone which can essentially serve the purpose of a direct readout of signals from the sensor.
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref126">126</xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref127">127</xref>
    </sup> Such applications could potentially be made available by the government or healthcare government body of the affected region or community. On the other hand, a standalone readout and data acquisition system with data loggers for disposable sensors can also be developed, which could be equipped in hospitals or at border control posts of a country.
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref128">128</xref>
    </sup> Certainly there are some biosensors that are now easily available in the supermarkets such as the pregnancy test strips and lateral flow strips for sexually transmitted disorders and for glucose meters.
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref125">125</xref>
    </sup> It is on similar lines that sensors which can rapidly detect viral infection, if developed, could turn out to very useful for self-testing of infectious diseases. In addition, this would decrease the load on the public health bodies to detect the disease in a large-sized population, which could also lead to timely control of the disease spread.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Mass manufacturing: During pandemics, there is an urgent and large demand for sensors that can detect the fast spreading disease accurately and quickly. Due to lack of availability and reachability of a number of sensors, low rates of testing compared to total population are reported in the case of COVID-19, even in the nations with world leading heath infrastructures.
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref129">129</xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref130">130</xref>
    </sup> In an ideal situation, the number of biosensors is equal to the population number of a given geographical area under test to ensure that all potential members of the community that can spread the disease are identified at an early stage. While there is a significant technological challenge to mass-produce sensors, the latest advancements in the manufacturing such as the 3D printing
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref131">131</xref>
    </sup> and machine molding
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref132">132</xref>
    </sup> can help in the development of a large number of sensors in a very short duration of time.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Autonomy and connectivity to central healthcare systems: Autonomy in the biosensing system would ensure a high compatibility between electrodes and the readout modules. Along with autonomy, measurement systems of a sensor in pandemics should be able to connect itself with the central database of a hospital which will collect real-time data from the measurements. For instance, a mobile phone application which collects the data from the sensor can be integrated with a two-way communication channel to (1) send data to the central database and (2) provide prompt therapeutic intervention or facilitate the situation with dispatched paramedical staff.
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref133">133</xref>−
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref135">135</xref>
    </sup> Networked healthcare service can also maintain and troubleshoot by additional information about the functionality of a sensor. Furthermore, location, positive disease cases, personal details such as age, gender, and contact information could easily be logged on to the central databases. This would provide the government and health care policy markers with real-time data to quickly and accurately determine necessary actions, such as locking down certain locations to contain and mitigate the fast spread of the disease.
