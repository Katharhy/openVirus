<p>Biochemical tests such as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) have also been used to detect the viral protein or the antibodies that are created by our body in response to a SARS-CoV2 infection for the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. The standard procedure to detect these antibodies involves the use of microtiter plates such as the 96-well, where antibodies are detected

These interactions are amplified using a fluorescence, luminescence, or colorimetric type of detection assisted by enzymes involved in the reaction. However, one main issue is that as the amount of viral load changes during the course of the infection, so detecting low concentrations of viral protein might be difficult. For instance, To

 </sup> showed salivary viral loads in the first week after the onset of symptoms, which gradually decreased with time. On the other hand, detecting antibodies generated in response to the viral infection is more specific for confirming presence of the COVID-19 disease. Nevertheless, there are still potential challenges with developing accurate serological tests such as those related with the cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV2 antibodies with other antibodies generated against coronaviruses.

 </sup> There are still some important advantages of the antibody testing, for instance, the presence of antibodies can verify if vaccines are functioning as intended.

 </sup> It can also be used in disease contact tracing applications, weeks after an individual is infected with the virus. Perhaps currently it is the most important test to help inform the intervention policymakers on how many asymptomatic cases exist in a given population.

 </sup> However, false negative results from the current antibody tests are often reported which are attributed to the combination of following technical reasons: (1) a low concentration of antibodies typically present in fluidic samples; (2) presence of homologous proteins; and (3) lack of sensitivity from the detection instrument. While, low concentration of antibodies and the presence of homologous proteins will remain challenging for the biosensing community, the sensitivity of the current tools could perhaps be enhanced by development of an engineered protein which will attach specifically to the antibody of interest. However, the ultimate solution is the development of ultrasensitive and selective biosensors, which we discuss more in the proceeding sections.
