<p>Computer tomography, which is more popular with the name of CT scan, is being used either in combination or as a standalone diagnostic tool to confirm the false hits from RT-PCR for the detection of SARS-CoV2 virus.

 </sup> In this method, usually a large number of X-ray measurements of the chest are taken from different angles to generate three-dimensional (3D) images with contrast, which are later analyzed by radiologists for abnormal features to authenticate the presence of SARS-CoV2 infection. Signatures of COVID-19 infection which appear in CT scan include areas of subpleural regions of ground glass opacification affecting the lower parts of either a single lobe or both lobes.

 </sup> In addition, data from COVID-19 patients have shown consolidation of fluids in the lungs. Moreover, the CT images have so far also assisted in serving as a prognostic tool for COVID-19. For example, in the early days (0–2 days) of the infection, the CT scan resembles more of a normal chest condition. As the disease progresses, the opacity of the scan increases, for instance, patients after 4 days of the infection have been reported with ground glass opacity which even appears as irregular patterns in the scan.

While CT scans are likely to remain as one of the most important tools in the early diagnosis of the COVID-19, the major challenge for the radiologists lies in the distinction of symptoms from other lung disorders or pneumonia-like symptoms which are not due to COVID-19 infections. In fact, the main caveat of using CT scans for COVID-19 is that the specificity of the detection is around 25%, as reported in the literature so far,

 </sup> as the imaging features overlap with other viral pneumonia. In addition, CT scans are expensive and require advanced technical skills for the operation and analysis, and it can only be adapted as a complementary technology with RT-PCR for SARS-CoV2 detection.
