<p>Reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a method used to detect the presence of nucleic acid-based genetic sequences from any organism, including viruses.

 </sup> To perform RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV2, first the biological fluid where the virus strains are present, upper and lower respiratory fluid, is collected. The collection of fluid is generally performed using nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs.

 </sup> Then the collected fluid undergoes a number of filtration and separation steps to isolate the viral RNA. Using the reverse transcriptase enzyme, complementary viral DNA (cDNA) is generated from the viral RNA. Specific regions of cDNA then undergo a polymerase chain reaction for amplification, where an additional DNA probe, designed to hybridize within a small part of the specific region of cDNA, is incorporated to enable real-time detection of the amplification process. Traditionally, radioactive isotopes were used as markers to target the specific nucleic acids, but more recently, fluorescence tags (fluorophore and a quencher) are used on the DNA probe for the real-time detection.

 </sup> Essentially when the DNA polymerase enzyme is adding nucleotides to the specific part of the viral cDNA, it encounters the double-stranded DNA in its path (due to DNA probe) where the exonuclease activity of the polymerase enzyme separates the fluorophore and the quencher molecules to produce real-time detection of the viral cDNA. If the number of cDNA copies (proportional to the concentration of the virus) produced after transcription is high, a large amount of fluorescence signal is generated after few rounds of polymerase reaction, and if the system is calibrated well, the fluorescence intensity is directly proportional to the concentration of virus in the infected patients. The typical sensitivity that can be achieved by RT-PCR is between 500 and 1000 copies/mL of viral RNA. Among the current tests, three regions of the cDNA have been identified for the detection of the SARS-CoV2 virus, which are the

 </sup> One challenge that remains is also that SARS-CoV2 damages the target RNA when opening its viral capsid. One reason might be due to the immune response of the host body. This leads to a release of small fragments of RNA into the bloodstream which is challenging for detection by RT-PCR. Perhaps, signal enrichment strategies for isolation of RNA fragments using advanced technologies such as CRISPR or in combination with nanomaterials such as gold nanoparticles and metalâ€“organic complexes may provide a solution to this problem. Another reason for poor sensitivity using RT-PCR is that the RNA easily gets degraded and typically requires an immediate frozen storage condition, and the completion of handling samples may also induce the poor detection. However, the point-of-use sensors, discussed later, may provide an immediate testing of RNA and will overcome this issue from the samples.
