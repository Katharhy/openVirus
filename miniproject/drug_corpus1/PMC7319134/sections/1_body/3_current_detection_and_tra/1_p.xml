 </sup> These biomarker tests include identification of elevated levels of the C-reactive protein, low procalcitonin, low lymphocyte counts, and high concentration of interleukin 6 and interleukin 10. Details of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), CT scans, biochemical assays, and the development of mobile phone-based digital contact tracing applications are discussed in the proceeding subsections.
