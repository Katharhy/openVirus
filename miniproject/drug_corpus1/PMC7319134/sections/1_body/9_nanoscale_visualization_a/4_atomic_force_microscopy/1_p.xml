 </sup> Typically, in AFM measurement, the deflection of microcantilever is used to probe the interaction between the surface of the sample and the nanometric tip located at the end of microcantilever. Based on the time scales, type, and range of interaction, an extensive range of information including atomistic details of the surface, mechanical, physical, chemical, thermal, and viscoelastic properties of nano/bio materials can be obtained.

 </sup> The earliest invented mode of AFM was the contact mode, where the tip is raster scanned through the sample surface while maintaining a constant force applied to the sample through deflection detection by adjusting the height of the tip. The main challenges in using contact mode to image soft materials such as viruses and other biological specimens is the applied force to avoid the reversible or irreversible deformation, unwanted friction, and damage to the sample.

 </sup> To improve the image resolution and minimize the applied force and friction, the dynamic AFM was invented.

 </sup> Generally, in dynamic AFM, the microcantilever is oscillated usually close to its resonance frequency while scanning the sample surface.
