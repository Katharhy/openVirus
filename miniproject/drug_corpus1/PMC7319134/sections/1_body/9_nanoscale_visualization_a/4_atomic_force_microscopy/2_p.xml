<p>Two major dynamic AFM modes are amplitude modulation atomic force microscopy (AM- AFM) (also known as tapping mode) and frequency modulation atomic force microscopy (FM-AFM).

 </sup> In the dynamic mode, due to the decrease of the contact time between tip and sample to the small fraction of oscillation period, the friction is minimized and the risk of damage to the sample is significantly reduced. In addition, of these two common modes of dynamic AFM, recently, several advanced techniques are developed to increase the resolution and explore more information from the materials during imaging. Due to the dynamic nature of these advanced techniques, they can be classified as multifrequency methods,

 </sup> where the cantilever is excited at different frequencies and different signals are used as feedback parameters.

 </sup> In addition to the ability to visualize and image virus particles, AFM has the capability to measure and quantify the mechanical and structural properties of virus particles.
