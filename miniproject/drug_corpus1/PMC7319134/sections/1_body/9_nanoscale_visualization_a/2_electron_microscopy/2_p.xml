<p>Recently cryo-EM was used to describe multiple monoclonal antibodies targeting SARS-CoV2, specific to the S protein identified from memory B cells, from an individual who was infected with SARS-CoV in 2003.

 </sup> One antibody, named S309, potently neutralizes SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV. Using cryo-EM and binding assays, it was also revealed that S309 recognizes a glycan-containing epitope which is conserved within the sarbecovirus subgenus, without competing with the receptor attachment.

 </sup> In ref (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref253">253</xref>), the 3D structure of the causative agent in SARS infection and the comprehensive information about the morphological surface of SARS-CoV was obtained. This included enhanced visualization of the trimeric structure in the 10–20 nm spikes of the virus surface. These results support the characterization of the SARS agent and development of antiviral strategies,
