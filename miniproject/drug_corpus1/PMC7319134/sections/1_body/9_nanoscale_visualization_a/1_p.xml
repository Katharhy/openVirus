<p>There are three principal techniques commonly used individually or in combination for the direct visualization, diagnosis, and characterization of virus structure: XRD analysis, EM, and AFM. The exceptional capabilities of these instruments allow not only in-depth analysis of virus structure and function but also investigation of viral impact on host cells and extracellular environment, useful in drug discovery applications.
