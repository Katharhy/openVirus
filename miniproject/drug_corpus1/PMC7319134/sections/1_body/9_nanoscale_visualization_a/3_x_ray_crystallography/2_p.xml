 </sup> During the preparation steps, to maintain the icosahedral symmetry of the virus, the handling procedures should be performed as gentle as possible. Following the purification stage, crystallization is required to bring the aqueous protein solution to supersaturation. There are two phases in crystallization: nucleation and growth. In nucleation, the crystal nucleus is formed at the critical size of molecular aggregation, then a subsequent process of growth is initiated. For growing the crystals of virus samples, there are four methods, batch crystallization, dialysis, liquidâ€“liquid diffusion, and vapor diffusion.
