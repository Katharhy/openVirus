<p>Serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) is another type of X-ray crystallography that uses X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs). Due to the pulse duration in femtosecond and unparalleled brilliance of XFEL beams, this technique is useful to study the viruses as both a crystal and single particle. Using time-resolved SFX, the changes during life cycles of viruses such as their response to the variation of pH and viral protein interaction with the receptors can be detected.

 </sup> Therefore, the combination of high-resolution static structure of viruses obtained by cryo-EM and dynamic results of conformational changes at room temperature using SFX can be a breakthrough toward producing time-resolved virus structures.

 </sup> Recently, in ref (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref270">270</xref>), the 3D crystal structure of the SARS-CoV2 unliganded Mpro at 1.75 Å resolution is determined (see 
 <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>
 </xref> for more details), and it was used to guide the optimization of a series of α-ketoamide inhibitors. Such structural analysis forms a strong basis for further development of these compounds to antiviral drugs. However, both common EM and XRD methods are based on the averaging of the numerous particles present in the electron micrographs or crystal. Therefore, there is a limitation in the information obtained from these structural differences that can exist between the individual particles in a large population. Besides, these methods require environments which are far away from the physiological conditions in which the virus normally operates and precludes the characterization of their dynamic properties in real time. This complicates structural studies of viruses that lack a well-defined symmetry such as the SARS-CoV2 as an enveloped virus. A third, direct imaging technology that provides significant impact on virus study is AFM. AFM provides possibilities for studying the COVID-19 virus particles, complementing classical EM and XRD studies.
