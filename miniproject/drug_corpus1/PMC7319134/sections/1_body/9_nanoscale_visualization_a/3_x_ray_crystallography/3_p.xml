<p>To improve the resolution and prevent the secondary radiation damage to the virus sample in the collection process of X-ray data, the crystallographic data are collected at cryogenic temperature, typically around 100 K. Growing high-quality virus crystal is one of the challenges in X-ray crystallography of the virus particles. Methods currently in use are time-consuming and based on trial and error procedures. Nevertheless, cryo-EM/ET can be a powerful complementary method for virus protein crystallography.

 </sup> Information provided by 3D cryo-EM can be integrated with the collected X-ray data to improve the built model of virus particles.
