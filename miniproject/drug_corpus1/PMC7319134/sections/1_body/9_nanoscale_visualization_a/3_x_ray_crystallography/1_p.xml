<p>The XRD from single crystals is a promising method to obtain the highest resolution of the virus structure and visualize the macromolecular assemblies at an atomic level. Generally, there are five steps to identify the virus structure using X-ray crystallography techniques which include: preparation and purification of virus particles, crystallization and mounting the particle crystal, measurement of diffracted data, calculation of phase through molecular replacement (MR) or isomorphous replacement,
