<p>COVID-19 disease is highly contiguous as its transmission is encouraged by airborne droplets and touch-based human to human contact.

 </sup> Common symptoms of this disease are similar to influenza, and therefore, it is not trivial to rapidly detect the disease accurately. Comparative analysis of the SARS-CoV2 with other epidemic viral strains serves as background information on which researchers can build upon to create potential technologies to quickly address the demands of disease control in an emergency.

 </sup> While there are several similarities and differences between these viruses, here we focus only on those features which will help researchers working in the field of biosensors and surface visualization/characterization to develop strategies for accurate detection and morphological analysis of SARS-CoV2. One striking similarity between SARS-CoV2 virus and influenza, H1NI, SARS-CoV, and MERS viruses is that all contain RNA as their genetic material, therefore also known as RNA viruses. Compared to DNA viruses, RNA viruses are technically more virulent as they infect cells by injecting RNA which quickly transcribes and replicates viral proteins in the host cell.

 </sup> This also makes it extremely challenging to detect a RNA virus at an early stage of the infection. Cell culture and nucleic acid-based tests have been the gold standard since their inception as compared to all other techniques.
