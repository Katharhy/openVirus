<p>However, unlike the DNA viruses which have polymerase machinery, the nucleic acid tests for RNA viruses include additional steps of reverse translation of RNA to DNA before it is amplified.

 </sup> Structurally, as viruses responsible for COVID-19, SARS, and MERS outbreaks belong to the same category of beta coronavirus family, these viruses are mostly spherical, but sometimes pleomorphic in shape.

 </sup> The average diameter of these viruses is 125 nm, where their capsid covering the genetic material is around 85 nm and glycoprotein spikes on the surface of the capsid are roughly 20 nm;

 </xref>. Comparing genetic characteristics of the SARS-CoV2 virus with other viruses may also provide useful insights to develop sensing strategies for the early detection of COVID-19. For example, untranslated regions (UTR) of the RNA, both at 5 prime and 3 prime ends are involved in the binding of the cellular proteins.

 </xref>. In addition, the mechanism of how coronaviruses infect cells can also be useful for developing sensors for analyzing the disease mechanism and drug discovery. In brief, the SARS-CoV2 virus enters a given cell 
 <italic>via</italic> proteinâ€“protein interactions where the glycoprotein spikes bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell surface.

 </sup> This attachment of the virus on the cell and further entry into the cell is assisted by protease enzyme called TMPRSS2. After the entry of the SARS-CoV2 virus into the cells, the RNA quickly translates into proteins, including the RNA synthesis in the cytoplasm by viral replication.
