<p>While the innovative sensing technologies have immense potential to revolutionize the healthcare system during a crisis such as the COVID-19, there are important ethical issues revolving around such technologies. Arguments concerning data confidentiality, ownership, and privacy are extremely challenging to address in a short duration of time, leading to a decrease in the adoption of the technology by community members.

 </sup> Especially, the sensors which aim to provide immediate, detailed, and objective feedback of the measurement remotely to the information management systems must abide to the data protection legislatures of the given region. Even though passing the quality controls related to the data protection has nowadays become fast, the acceptability of these technologies in terms of their reliability remains low. Many medical staff still have concerns whether the developed technology has enough understanding of the biology to be properly informed from the measurement. Moreover, with traditional medicine, before a doctor provides a treatment, they must seek a patientâ€™s consent to reasonably inform them about the risks and benefits associated with the intended treatment. In this context, the risks and benefits of the mobile heath applications and self-use biosensors are not explicit as most often users are less willing to read the terms and conditions which usually pop up while using an application. However, toward the laboratory-based testing, biosensors and surface characterization tools eliminate ethical issues such as those associated with animal and human testing.

 </sup> For example, if a drug is required to be developed in a short duration during a pandemic, large-scale testing can potentially be performed on high-throughput sensing platforms before it is considered viable to test on animals and humans. Large-scale testing could include a variety of characterizations to reveal molecular affinity, specificity, and cross reactivity with potential compounds inside the organism. Therefore, with the increased use of modern characterization tools and bio/chemical sensors, large uncertainties associated with quick drug development and testing can potentially be eliminated.
