<p>In addition, modular sensing systems also provide a flexibility in usage for different analytical biomarkers. For instance, in a single measuring module, electrodes could potentially be used for the detection of multiple biomarkers of a pandemic strain by simply changing the biorecognition layer or the surface chemistry on the electrode. On the other hand, translation of nanoscale analytical technologies to clinical settings depends on the ability to simplify complex analytical devices for non-experts to use and control. Automation and remote control of devices, which is fast increasing with the advent of the internet of healthcare technology, might provide solutions whereby quick troubleshooting or assistance in calibration can be provided to the medical staff (user) remotely and easily.</p>
