<p>However, one significant challenge in the technology transfer of most of the biosensors and advanced instrumentation is the capacity building of human resources. The main reason is that practical hands on skills from subjects which are fundamentally far from each other such as biology and electronics are often required with the operator of the sensing instrumentation. This limitation is also being addressed by many educational institutions where courses and projects are encouraged to be interdisciplinary in nature. Other technical challenges for fast technology transfer during pandemics which remain elusive are quick adoption of the biosensor manufacturing protocols and reliability of the sensors. As most of the quickly developed technologies are customized for the pandemic strains, reproducibility, stability, and reliability tests can take more than a few months of time to generate statistical data for making informed decisions. It is here that fundamental science and engineering need to further discover materials which are inherently physically and chemically stable and invent technologies to provide more reliability in the measurements.</p>
