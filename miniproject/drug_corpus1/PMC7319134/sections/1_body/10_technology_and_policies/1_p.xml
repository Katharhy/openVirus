<p>While academia has made tremendous progress in the field of biosensors, a major challenge remains in overcoming the difficulties associated with translating the laboratory research quickly into commercially viable prototypes by industry and addressing the complex regulatory issues required for clinical settings, especially during pandemics. The good news is that slowly the technology transfer investments from government and industry is on the rise. In addition, regulatory policies from the government in many countries are becoming increasingly business friendly with the academics. This is evident from the fact that a lot of organizations are now identifying and bridging gaps between the academic research and industrial needs

Moreover, specialized urgent funds without limits are set up by many governments during an infectious disease outbreak such as for the COVID-19. On the other hand, instrumentation such as SPR, AFM, XRD, and EM, while well-established and developed from the infrastructure viewpoint, has a high cost which limits its use mostly to laboratory testing.

 </sup> Still, large-scale industries, especially the ones involved in the vaccine development and testing, can potentially reveal morphological features.
