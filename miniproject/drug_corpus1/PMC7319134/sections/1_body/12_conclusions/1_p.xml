<p>Biosensors and nanoscale visualization/characterization tools can be considered as innovative and promising tools that can lead to life saving decisions on treatment and a deep understanding of pandemic strains. As we have witnessed extreme challenges associated with the testing and validation of viruses in COVID-19, we need to be prepared in terms of diagnostics to prevent a spread of any new emerging infectious diseases. Recently, Narvaez 
 <italic>et al</italic>. suggested seven main recommendations for biosensing community, including the funding agencies: (1) investment; (2) collaboration; (3) mass manufacturing; (4) devices should comply with regulation bodies such as FDA; (5) rigorously satisfy features such as disposability and low sample volume tests; (6) integrate with Internet Of Things (IOT), and (7) ease of use for members of the community.

 </sup> With the rapid advancement of nanotechnology, we believe that the sensing mechanism will emerge with a multidisciplinary approach, to enable rapid and on-site detection of viruses for point-of-care diagnosis and prevent epidemics at an early stage.
