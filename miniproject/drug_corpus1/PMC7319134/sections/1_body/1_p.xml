<p>These sensing strategies are further complemented by the aforementioned surface visualization/characterization tools (AFM, EM, XRD) presenting a complete package of technologies that can potentially be used for diagnosis, prognosis, drug discovery, drug analysis, and disease spread surveillance, all of which are vital for ensuring good community health.

It is also obvious that for quick technology development, such as for the development of biosensors for COVID-19, it is essential to build on the existing scientific evidence for the use of technology in similar applications. Therefore, we begin by highlighting similarities and differences between other RNA viral infections from the perspective of understanding the COVID-19 disease and subsequent technology development to serve the required demand for sensing and characterization of the SARS-CoV2 virus.
