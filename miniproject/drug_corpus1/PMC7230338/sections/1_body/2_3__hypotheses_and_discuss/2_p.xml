<p>Firstly, the presence of an evolutionary adaptation related to malaria (in the endemic areas or in those where it has been eradicated) might play a role in limiting the spread of COVID-19. Accordingly, some variants of the ACE2 receptor, which is used by the coronavirus to infect cells, may protect these populations [

 <xref rid="B12-jcm-09-01138" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This phenomenon potentially explains the heterogeneous diffusion of COVID-19 among countries (e.g., Nigeria in comparison with South Africa) or within them (e.g., South Sardinia in comparison with Lombardy). Clearly, the available data in this sense are still scarce and additional genetic studies are necessary to confirm this hypothesis.
