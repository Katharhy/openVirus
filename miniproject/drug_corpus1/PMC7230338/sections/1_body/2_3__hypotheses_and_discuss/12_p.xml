<p>Starting from the analysis of epidemiological data on malaria and on the effectiveness of antimalarials in the treatment of Beta-CoVs diseases, it is possible to state that scientific research is expected to verify the potential of antimalarials in reducing the spread of COVID-19 even in non-African countries. For instance, the effect of the administration of chloroquine derivatives in areas where malaria is endemic seems to preserve these geographic areas (i.e., the least developed countries) from COVID-19 outbreak, despite some rare side effects (e.g., retinal toxicity). </p>
