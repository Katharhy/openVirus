<p>It is observed that males and females are equally sensitive to get infected by coronavirus [
 <xref rid="B40-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Men are slightly more prone to get infected. But when it comes to the number of deaths, there is a significant difference between the genders. Although, the reason for such significant difference in the death rate of different gender is not known. The rate of infection in different countries per 100,000 is similar on the basis of age and sex. Germany does not have much variation based on sex and age in the number of cases. But for the age group greater than 60, the number of deaths per 100,000 population is very high. On the other hand, in Italy, for the age group greater than 50, the number of infection and death per 100,000 population is very high. In China, the ratio of male and female death in confirmed cases is 17:10. In India, the working population is more affected with those aged 21 years to 60 years contributing to 75% of the total number of infected cases [
