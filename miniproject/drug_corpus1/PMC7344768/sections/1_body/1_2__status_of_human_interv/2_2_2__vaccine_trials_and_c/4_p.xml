<p>Development of a vaccine against coronaviruses may face challenges like antibody-dependent enhancement. In antibody-dependent enhancement, the antibody itself facilitates the viral entry into the cells via Ig Fc receptors [

 <xref rid="B54-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The same has been observed in the case of veterinary vaccines against animal coronaviruses, including feline infectious peritonitis virus [

Further, studies of animal coronaviruses have established pathogenicity, cell-tropism genotype diversity and evolution for animal coronaviruses in the last two decades. Evolutionary forces of mutation and recombination on generating new strains and diversity of strain types in the same geographical location and availability of same strains at faraway distances increase the opportunity of a SARS-CoV-2 like outbreak [
