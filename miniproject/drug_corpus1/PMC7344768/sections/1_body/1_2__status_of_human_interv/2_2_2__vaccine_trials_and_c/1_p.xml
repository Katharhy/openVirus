<p>In the absence of any effective antiviral treatment for SARS-CoV-2, development of an effective vaccine seems imperative to tackle the pandemic situation. Presently, there are no vaccines available for COVID-19 in the world. Spike protein plays a major role in receptor recognition, viral invasion into the cell and is also exposed to immune reactions. Therefore, it seems to be a suitable target for vaccine development. Similarity in the spike proteins of SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2 will help scientists to repurpose or utilize the experience from the previous two viruses to develop a vaccine for COVID-19 [
