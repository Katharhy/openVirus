<p>Dr. Chang, in his review published in the New England Journal of Medicine, discussed the reinfections of viruses at length [
 <xref rid="B56-biology-09-00141" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. As he discussed, the reason for reinfection lies in partial/incomplete immunity generated after primary infection. Respiratory track viral infections invade primarily superficial respiratory epithelial cells. Probably, cells containing acquired resistance are replaced by new sensitive cells. Also, serum antibodies with capacity to neutralize virus particles canâ€™t easily access the superficial respiratory epithelial cells. Still locally induced and secreted IgA can directly interact with invading viruses. The status of reinfection in the case of COVID-19 is still debatable. No published data yet satisfy our enquiry with confidence. Though, it is noteworthy to cite the recent non-peer-reviewed preprint (
 <uri xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.13.990226" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.13.990226</uri>). This suggests reinfection failed when equal doses of SARS-CoV-2 titer were administered in the rhesus macaques study model and they remain asymptotic. Any appearance of a positive test report of discharge patients may be due to false-negative detection of residual RNA fragments of dead virus fragments or patients may not be fully recovered. But, a complete picture is still awaited.
