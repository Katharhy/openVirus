<p id="Par35">One of the major disadvantages of bypassing animal models is that it has been observed in case of viral infections that sometimes the administration of vaccines enhances the susceptibility of the subject to the disease. This phenomenon is known as antibody-dependent enhancement or antigen sin and is common for vaccine candidates of HIV/AIDS virus and Dengue virus. Once the subject is immunized with the antigen, it mounts an immune response against the antigen. But, when the vaccinated individual is infected again with the virus having a different serotype, the pre-existing antibodies are not able to neutralize the virus. The formation of antibody–virus complex helps in attachment to Fcγ receptor on circulating monocytes, resulting in the efficient infection of monocytes by the virus (Halstead

Therefore, the biotech companies that have bypassed animal models should note that antibody-dependent enhancement is also observed with feline coronavirus (FCov). The immunization of mice with spike (S) protein of this virus mounts an overall high antibody response but neutralizing antibody levels are low. However, challenge of these cats results in enhanced susceptibility to infection along with death of cats (Huisman

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2009</xref>). This phenomenon is especially relevant to proteins that are prone to antigenic drift such as the S protein and SARS and MERS, known to be capable of this phenomena (Liu

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2019</xref>; Houser 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2017</xref>). As S protein is the major vaccine target of SARS-CoV-2, studies in animal model are really required before establishing it as a vaccine candidate.
