<p id="Par23">As the key 12 amino acid residues present in ACE2 of humans are conserved in ACE2 of macaques as well (Melin

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2020</xref>), macaques are a closer model system to humans, and hence the choice for animal studies for vaccine testing of COVID-19. The studies with macaques have shown that they do get infected with pulmonary infiltrates as observed in radiographs, with high viral loads in swabs of nose and throat and shedding in the upper and lower respiratory tract (Munster

 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2020</xref>). Taken together, the disease symptoms in rhesus macaques matches with the milder symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. Further, serum analysis demonstrate an increase in chemokine levels of IL1ra, IL10, IL15, MCP-1, IL6 and decrease in TGFÎ± levels on days 1 and 3 post-infection but with no statistical significance (Munster 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2020</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 is known to affect older people as compared to young ones; similarly, it is also observed in macaques that older ones show higher viral loads in nose and throat along with prolonged viral shedding in the upper respiratory tract of old animals (Rockx 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2020</xref>). Thus, rhesus macaques can be a promising animal model for challenge studies and studying the efficacy of vaccines, as immune responses in monkeys are similar to humans. This will further allow us to understand how monkeys challenge coronavirus and protect themselves.
