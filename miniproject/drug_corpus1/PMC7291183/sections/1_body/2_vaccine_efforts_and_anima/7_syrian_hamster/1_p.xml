<p id="Par26">These animals support SARS infection and show maximum similarity to human ACE2, where only 4 amino acids out of 29 are different in the critical binding region of ACE2, making them a testable model for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Upon infection of SARS-CoV-2, Syrian hamsters demonstrate weight loss by ~11% along with high viral load in nasal turbinate, lungs, and trachea. Further, the lethality rate in hamsters is 5% and exudative inflammation with hemorrhage and necrosis of alveolae damage is visible during the initial infection period. The inflammation of intestinal mucosal epithelium that is the causative agent of diarrohea along with myocardial degeneration is consistent with the pathogenesis observed in humans. Importantly, Syrian hamsters show similar immune responses as that of humans where IFN-γ and pro-inflammatory cytokines are induced at day 2 post-infection followed by the decrease of type II interferon and IL6 and increase of TGF-β at day 7 post-infection. For an animal to be successful as a model system and perform challenge studies, is also dependent on its ability to transmit the pathogen. Consistent with this, Syrian hamsters are able to transmit the disease to naïve hamsters upon challenge with SARS-CoV-2 (Chan
