<p id="Par20">The development of a vaccine against a disease is a combined effort from academicians and industries. Under normal circumstances, the final product of the vaccine for use in humans takes at least 15–20 years passing through six phases of assessment (Bregu 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2011</xref>). In the first phase, the academician identifies a target that has the potential to be a vaccine candidate. Thereafter, this candidate is challenged for its vaccine potential by testing it in animal models for the disease where the safety as well as immune responses to the antigen is analyzed. This identification and development of the vaccine candidate is a bottleneck and takes majority of the time (~9–10 years) required for vaccine development. Once these steps are successful, only then is it taken to clinical trials in three phases where it is tested in humans for its safety in Phase I and efficacy to protect against the disease in Phases II and III, which take another 5–10 years (figure
