The genomes of SARS-CoV-2 is a single positive-strand RNA and codes for similar structural protein as of SARS, giving rise to a debate about whether it is a laboratory engineered SARS virus or a naturally evolved new virus. The sequence analysis of its RNA made available by China in the public database showed that it is a novel virus that originated possibly from bats through natural evolution (Andersen 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2020</xref>). However, how it got transmitted from bats to humans with such high transmission rates from humans to humans is still ambiguous.
