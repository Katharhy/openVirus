<p id="Par28">In the history of mankind, it has been clear that viral pandemics have been common in affecting millions of people. The problem is due to its ability to multiply inside the host and produce high numbers by infecting a single cell accompanied by its stability in non-living surfaces which allows them to spread very fast. That is why virus pandemics are global with high transmission rates. Thus, to control viruses, extreme steps are often needed. Therefore, in the absence of disease model, backed by their antibody responses in mice, NIAID and CanSino Biologics moved ahead with Phase I clinical trials. After bypassing animal model studies for vaccines, different biotechnological companies are looking forward to come up with a vaccine in around a year to a year and a half.</p>
