<p id="Par56">Suspected cases of COVID-19 and TB show similar fever and/or respiratory symptoms (difficult respiration, coughing, chest pain, etc.). COVID-19 RT-PCR should be done in real-time for differential diagnosis of cases with unknown respiratory syndromes such as PTB [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Due to poor outcomes among COVID-19/HIV/TB or COVID-19/TB co-infections, we recommend COVID-19 real-time RT-PCR should be coupled with Xpert MTB/RIF assay. In suspected HIV/TB co-infected patients, Xpert MTB/RIF should be used first rather than traditional microscopy, culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Instead of collecting upper respiratory tract specimens, lower respiratory tract specimens, such as sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, and tracheal aspirates should be collected in suspected COVID-19/HIV/TB or COVID-19/TB co-infected patients. COVID-19 real-time RT-PCR may last at least 24 h. At the same time, the Xpert MTB / RIF assay detects

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. The Xpert MTB/RIF assay’s sensitivity to detect TB is superior to that of microscopy and comparable to that of solid culture, along with high specificity [
