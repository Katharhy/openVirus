<p id="Par52">The poor outcome in mortality rate among COVID-19/HIV/TB co-infection compared to COVID-19/TB infection is illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. Both those with COVID-19/HIV/TB and COVID-19/TB co-infection had increased mortality risk compared to COVID-19 participants. Given recent developments that have shown the vulnerability of those ages 18–49 to COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], younger people living with HIV (PLWH) may also be at heightened risk for mortality due to COVID-19 complications. Such risk is predicated on the fact that PLWH under the age of 50 years are both less likely to be diagnosed (and in effect more likely to be immunocompromised) and also less likely to access and be retained in care, yielding viral suppression of a mere 37% for those age 25–34 years [
