<p id="Par43">Cases were stratified by PTB diagnosis. 41.36% (12/29) of cases of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV or COVID-19 had previous history of PTB diagnosis. 74% of SARS-CoV or COVID-19 Cases had PTB co-infection, and 6.89% (2/29) of PTB had a history of SARS-CoV. The test of two proportions between ‘severe/critical SARS, MERS and COVID-19 cases with HIV/TB or TB co-infection 53% (20/38)’ versus ‘mild/moderate SARS, MERS and COVID-19 cases with HIV/TB or TB co-infection 47% (18/38)’ was not statistically significant (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0. 6009). The onset of COVID-19 severe/critical stages was mean of 3.4 days [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] for two observational studies and 10 days for a case series [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Three studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] reported the recovery and mortality rate among SARS, MERS and COVID-19 cases with HIV/TB or TB co-infection which were respectively 90.26% (102/113) and 9.74% (11/113). The mortality rate of 9.74% among COVID-19/TB or COVID/HIV/TB co-infected patients should be considered with caution because of poor study design and small sample size. However, the mortality rates for COVID-19/TB or COVID/HIV/TB co-infection seem to be higher than the mortality rate of 3.81% for COVID-19 worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Three studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] reported COVID-19 recovery time from 9 to 54 days. This is important to highlight that qualitative analysis included three cases related to SARS-CoV/HIV/TB co-infection (one case) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and COVID-19/HIV/TB co-infection (two cases) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Among them, SARS-CoV/HIV/TB co-infected case developed mild disease course, one COVID-19/HIV/TB developed severe COVID-19 and the last case died.
