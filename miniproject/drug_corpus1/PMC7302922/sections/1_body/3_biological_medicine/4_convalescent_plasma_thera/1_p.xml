There have been a large number of people who have recovered from coronavirus infection, donating valuable serum containing immunoglobulin which seems better than trying to produce large amounts of monoclonal antibodies in the laboratory. However, using antibodies to treat COVID-19 has some obvious problems such as limited sources of therapeutic plasma, different concentrations and activities of antibodies in human plasma of various sources, and non-neutralizing antibodies in plasma that may contribute to cytokine storms and other safety risks. Therefore, the convalescent plasma therapy is only used on a small scale, while large-scale use still needs to wait until we understand the clinical application effect and adverse reactions. The safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma transfusion in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients should be studied within the context of a well-designed clinical trial. In the absence of vaccines and specific therapeutic drugs, the recovery plasma therapy is still an exploratory treatment. The current diagnosis and treatment scheme is recommended to try in severe patients and closely monitor the possible risks [
