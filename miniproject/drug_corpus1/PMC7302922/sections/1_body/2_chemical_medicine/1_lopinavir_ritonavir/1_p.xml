<p id="Par8">Lopinavir/ritonavir tablets (trade name: Cleeve) are broad-spectrum antiviral drugs developed by AbbVie Inc., which was first approved by the European Union in 2001 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. It is a type of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor that can block the cleavage of Gag-Pol precursor protein into mature protein, which eventually leads to the production of immature and non-infectious virus particles [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. It has been confirmed that ritonavir is an active peptidomimetic inhibitor against HIV-1 and HIV-2 aspartyl proteases. The enzyme cannot cleave the Gag-Pol precursor protein by inhibiting HIV protease which could lead to the formation of immature forms of HIV particles and prevent a new round of infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Currently, in vitro studies have shown that lopinavir/ritonavir can inhibit the replication of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) to exert antiviral effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Based on that, lopinavir/ritonavir has been recommended for the clinical treatment of COVID-19 in China. According to the advantages of lopinavir/ritonavir in antiviral therapy, it is suggested that lopinavir/ritonavir should use in the early period of antiviral treatment to improve clinical symptoms and reduce viral load. The oral dosage is recommended once a day (800 mg/200 mg) that may increase treatment compliance, reduce adverse reactions, control the spread through urine and feces, and hinder the spread of the epidemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. However, the latest research has reported that lopinavir/ritonavir treatment did not significantly accelerate clinical improvement, reduce mortality, or diminish throat viral RNA detectability in patients with COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Besides, it should be noted that lopinavir/ritonavir is an inhibitor of liver P450 isoenzyme CYP3A. When it is combined with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A, it may lead to increased blood concentration of the combining drugs, which increases the adverse reaction.
