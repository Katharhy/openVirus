cases have been reported throughout the country, corresponding to one-third of
all cases reported in the Americas. In addition to its high attack rates,
resulting in hundreds of thousands of cases, the disease has high chronicity
rates with persistent joint manifestations for more than 3 months, which can
spread to more than half of the patients affected in the acute phase. Pain
associated with musculoskeletal manifestations, often disabling, has an effect
on patients&#x02019; quality of life at different stages of the disease. Currently, the
challenge faced by specialists is identifying the best therapy to be instituted
for symptom relief despite the limited number of published intervention studies.
In 2016, a multidisciplinary group published pharmacological treatment protocols
for pain in patients with chikungunya, which was incorporated into the
guidelines for clinical management of the Brazilian Ministry of Health in 2017;
in that same year, a consensus was published by the Brazilian Society of
Rheumatology about diagnosis and treatment. After 5 years of experience with
chikungunya epidemics, in 2019, specialists involved in the protocols of the
Brazilian Society of Rheumatology and Brazilian Ministry of Health prepared an
update with the main objective of developing flowcharts for the therapeutic
approach of musculoskeletal manifestations in adult patients to enable
specialists at different levels of healthcare to spread and apply this guideline
in a systematic and simplified manner. </p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords:</title><kwd>Chikungunya fever</kwd><kwd>Musculoskeletal pain</kwd><kwd>Arbovirus</kwd><kwd>Management</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="29"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arbovirus of the family

reports of chikungunya outbreaks were described in Tanzania in 1952, and it did not
reach the Americas until December 2013. However, within a 5-year period of the
virus&#x02019;s arrival, 2,673,671 cases were reported, with 773,000 (29%) of them occurring

finding increases the probability that millions of inhabitants in the country will

of the disease are limited. There are no high-quality randomized clinical trials
evaluating the efficacy of different therapies. Moreover, few prospective
studies have evaluated drug efficacy, and these studies have several
limitations, including the use of different methodologies, the lack of adequate
randomization in some studies, different therapeutic doses, short follow-up
times, and sometimes, a small number of cases or heterogeneous comparison
groups, that make comparisons difficult. There are also other case-series
studies and reported experiences of pain management experienced in
epidemics<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. </p><p>The data currently available do not allow definitive conclusions, whether
favorable or not, about the efficacy of specific therapies or between different
drug therapies. Currently, recommendations are mainly based on previous
experience acquired with epidemics or by extrapolating specialists&#x02019; experiences
with these drugs in chronic rheumatological diseases. However, with the
emergence of new, high-quality scientific evidence, these recommendations can be
adjusted. </p><p>Chronologically, the clinical spectrum of the disease involves three phases:
acute (up to 14 days), post-acute (15-90 days), and chronic (after 3 months).
Musculoskeletal disease represents the most frequent clinical manifestation, and
its management is related to these different phases. In addition, in the
post-acute and chronic phases, the therapeutic approach depends on the
identification of the pattern of joint manifestation, which may be predominantly
non-inflammatory/musculoskeletal (mechanical) or inflammatory with arthritis and
periarticular manifestations (tenosynovitis), which may also present tendonitis,
enthesitis, fasciitis, capsulitis, and periostitis. </p></sec><sec><title>Acute phase</title><p>The acute phase of CHIKV is characterized by fever and intense polyarthralgia
and/or arthritis. The fever is high and continuous, with several episodes a day;
it is typically more intense in the first 3 days but can persist for up to 7
days. </p><p>Arthralgia has been described in more than 90% of adult patients in the acute
phase, with a polyarticular and symmetrical pattern, mainly affecting the joints
of the hands, wrists, shoulders, knees, ankles, and feet. The pain can be
incapacitating and makes it difficult for patients to perform daily activities
such as walking, brushing their teeth, and picking up objects. Edema
(periarticular and/or articular), as well as tenosynovitis and joint stiffness,
is frequently observed at this stage. </p><p>It is important for physicians to identify different clinical patterns and
identify whether there is joint pain (arthralgia) associated with edema
(arthritis) or not. At this stage, the treatment goal is the relief of acute
pain with the use of analgesics and opioids. However, non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should not be prescribed because of increased
risk of bleeding or kidney damage in these patients; in addition, other acute
febrile diseases may have chikungunya-like clinical manifestations in the
initial phase, and NSAIDs are also contraindicated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). </p><p>

</p><p>In the initial evaluation of cases with pain, it is necessary to apply the
analogue visual scale of pain, thereby transforming subjective data into
objective data that allow the evaluation of the therapeutic response and
adequate case management. </p><p>To avoid chronic pain, pain should be effectively treated, and the drugs used in
this phase should be prescribed in fixed doses and never on an &#x0201c;as needed&#x02019;
basis. The opioids prescribed for intense pain are potent analgesics that are
safe since they are monitored, and patients are warned about any adverse events.
Their main side effects are drowsiness in older people, nausea, and
constipation. </p></sec><sec><title>Post-acute phase</title><p>Following the acute phase, 45-75% of adult patients have symptoms that persist
after 14 days and can last up to 3 months. At this stage, fever usually
disappears but musculoskeletal complaints are persistent, with polyarthralgia
and/or polyarthritis of variable intensity that can range from strong to
mild.</p><p>The exacerbation of pain may reach previously affected joints and may be
accompanied by multiple post-acute tenosynovitis, with predominant involvement
in the wrists and ankles associated with morning stiffness. Neuropathic pain and
carpal tunnel syndrome are often reported. In addition, generalized symptoms
such as asthenia, depression, and even alopecia may accompany this phase. </p><p>A clinical evaluation and eventually imaging methods are performed to define the
predominant clinical pattern: a) localized or diffuse non-inflammatory
musculoskeletal pain; b) arthritis/tenosynovitis (articular or periarticular
disease associated with edema); and c) neuropathic pain. It is important to
reinforce the possibility of a patient presenting associated pattern such as
arthritis or non-inflammatory musculoskeletal pain associated with neuropathic
pain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). </p><p>
<fig id="f3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 3:</label><caption><title>Therapeutic approach to musculoskeletal manifestations of chronic
phase of chikungunya.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="1678-9849-rsbmt-53-e20190517-gf3"/></fig>
</p><p>Some authors suggest including other indices to evaluate the therapeutic response
of the patient, such as a global evaluation by the patient and by the physician
and a count of the joints with pain and edema, to calculate the index of
activity and other scales commonly applied by rheumatologists. The BMH suggests
a broader approach when a high number of cases are identified following an
epidemic and where patients are not likely to have access to a specialist. In
addition, there is no evidence that these approaches are more effective in
managing cases; hence, the general practitioner must be able to manage these
cases to control symptoms in the initial treatment stages. </p><p>In the case of localized or diffuse non-inflammatory musculoskeletal pain,
patients should be administered NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, celecoxib,
meloxicam) and reassessed after 10 days. If the response is good, this treatment
can be maintained for up to 4 weeks, with subsequent gradual reduction to
withdrawal. For patients with contraindications or risks for NSAID use,
analgesics isolated or associated with opioids should be prescribed for 4 weeks,
with the consideration of cyclobenzaprine (a muscle relaxant). </p><p>In disease cases with an inflammatory component (arthritis/tenosynovitis),
corticosteroid use after 14 days is effective. Prednisone 0.5 milligram per
kilogram per day (maximum dose being 40 milligrams) alone or in combination with
a common analgesic or weak opioid should be prescribed. After 4 weeks, in
patients who present a good response, the dose should be withdrawn slowly
(weaning), reducing a quarter of the dose every 7 days (total time of use being
8 weeks). Abrupt suspension or rapid withdrawal may lead to a rebound of the
manifestations. Contraindications to corticoid use should be considered. </p><p>In the presence of a neuropathic component, specific therapy needs to be
instituted. The Douleur Neuropathique 4, a questionnaire for neuropathic pain
should be applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>); this
comprises two questions asked per interview and two questions based on physical
examination for a total of 10 answers. If four or more answers are positive, the
patient probably presents with neuropathic pain. In these cases, tricyclic
antidepressants (amitriptyline, nortriptyline) or anticonvulsants (gabapentin,
pregabalin, carbamazepine) should be used. The onset of action is slower,
occurring after 2 weeks of use. In older patients, amitriptyline may lead to
sedation, therefore, gabapentin is often preferred starting at low doses.
Patients with a history of arrhythmia should also be administered gabapentin
instead of amitriptyline. Approximately 30% of CHIKV patients may present with a
neuropathic pain component associated with joint pain that fails to respond to
the usual analgesics, making it necessary to associate this therapeutic class
with the treatment after clinical confirmation of the condition. </p><p>Laboratory tests should be performed before initiating drug therapy and during
the use of NSAID and corticosteroid, including blood counts, fasting blood
glucose, urea, creatinine, and transaminases. </p><p>Rehabilitation with physiotherapy and alternative therapies such as acupuncture,
physical activity, and patient education is important in parallel with
pharmacological treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Chronic phase</title><p>Patients whose musculoskeletal complaints persist for periods longer than 3
months are considered chronic. At this stage, complaints are characterized by
pain in a persistent or recurrent pattern that can maintain its intensity from
previous phases, may be intense and disabling, or mild and even decreasing in
intensity. In a study by Schilte et al<italic>.</italic> in French Polynesia,
60% of patients experienced chronification, of whom 72 were followed up for 3
years, with 45% having persistent arthralgia, 24% having initial recovery
followed by recurrence, and 31% experiencing complete recovery from the acute
phase<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The joints most commonly affected are those of the hands, wrists, knees, and
ankles, with associated morning stiffness and edema. Patients may also report
the involvement of the cervical region and shoulders with determinate pain and
movement limitations. </p><p>Neuropathic pain affects approximately 20% of patients and is often neglected,
which in many cases constitutes therapeutic failure because they are not
responsive to analgesics and opioids, instead requiring specific therapy<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The study by Schilte et al<italic>.</italic> analyzed the effect of the disease
on the quality of life of these patients after 36 weeks and associated
limitations in regard to performing their usual activities. Concerning such
limitations, 62.9% of patients reported difficulty in lifting themselves up from
a sitting position; 54.8% had trouble walking; 54.8% experienced difficulty
picking up objects; 53.2% had trouble opening bottles and other containers; and
37.1% reported having difficulty bathing. Suffering related to CHIKV infection
is not limited to pain; a significant segment of patients presented with mental,
mood, and sleep disorders. The disease also had an effect on emotional status,
often leading to sleep disorders (56.4%), depression (50%), memory disorders
(43.5%), and concentration disorders (38.7%)<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Some patients&#x02019; conditions may advance to progressive erosive arthritis with a
pattern of rheumatoid or psoriatic arthritis. The authors&#x02019; experience shows that
only a minor percentage of patients develop an inflammatory pattern of the
chronic disease. The patients in this phase of chikungunya usually show a
clinical condition of non-inflammatory pain and stiffness. However, in the
evaluation of 159 patients referred to a rheumatologist, Javelle et
al<italic>.</italic> classified 112 (70%) of them as having chronic
inflammatory rheumatic disease, with 40 cases fulfilling the clinical and
radiological criteria for rheumatoid arthritis, 33 for spondyloarthritis, and 21
for undifferentiated polyarthritis; none of these patients had a previous
history of rheumatic disease<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>28</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>In different studies, several factors have been associated with the risk of
chronification of musculoskeletal complaints. Factors to highlight include the
following: being a female; being older than 45 years; severe pain, presence of
edema, rigidity, or polyarthritis during the acute phase; previous joint
disease; diabetes; high viral load; elevated levels of protein C in the acute
phase; and persistently elevated immunoglobulin (Ig) M. </p><p>At this phase, analgesics, opioids, NSAIDs, and corticosteroids may be instituted
for refractory or recurrent cases or as a bridge, pending the initiation of
chronic-phase drugs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>). Furthermore, at this stage,
examinations such as simple radiography to assess joint damage may be requested.
In addition, musculoskeletal ultrasonography may be useful for differentiating
between joint and periarticular alterations and edema of vascular origin (useful
also in the acute and post-acute phases), helping to identify other ligament or
tendon injuries or erosions, and evaluating the intensity of inflammation. </p><p>

</p><p>The BSR suggests that patients at this chronic stage should be tested for
chikungunya IgG serology and should also have specific tests for differential
diagnoses with other rheumatological diseases, including rheumatoid factor,
citrullinated anti-peptide antibody, and in suspected cases of spondyloarthritis
should be serchead the human leucocyte antigen B27. </p><p>In primary care approach, or when evaluation is made by a non-rheumatology
specialist, the initial evaluation may not include the performance of specific
tests, leaving these to specialists following the therapeutic failure of the
drugs proposed for chronic phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure
1</xref>).</p><p>The drugs of choice at this stage are antimalarials, preferably
hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). In this guideline, methotrexate (MTX) is an option for
inflammatory joint disease (moderate or severe disease affecting more than 5
joints, moderate to severe edema and pain) and HCQ for less-severe forms. </p><p>Patients should be evaluated after 8 weeks, and in cases of favorable clinical
response, they should maintain the drug for another 6 months. In the event of
failure to respond to HCQ, MTX should be prescribed. For cases of MTX failure,
the physician should refer the patient to a rheumatologist. </p><p>Most patients&#x02019; symptoms tend to decrease with the suggested therapies, leaving a
small percentage of patients who require rheumatological evaluations, which will
broaden the clinical investigation, consider a differential diagnosis, perform
laboratory and specific imaging tests, and decide on therapeutic options to be
adjusted or instituted. Some patients with chronic inflammatory joint disease
who experience therapeutic failure may even require immunobiological evaluation
(following recommendations used for treating rheumatoid arthritis or
spondyloarthritis). </p><p>Physicians should be aware of the adverse effects, typical of each treatment
class prescribed at this stage of treatment and the need for specific clinical
and laboratory monitoring before and during use. For immunosuppressive drugs,
specific tests are required, such as screening for hepatitis B (hepatitis B
surface antigen, antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen, antibodies to
hepatitis B core antigen), hepatitis C (antibody to hepatitis C virus) and human
immunodeficiency virus, the Mantoux test, and chest x-ray. </p><p>Physiotherapeutic treatment is recommended in all three phases of the disease, as
well as other alternative therapies (acupuncture, physical activity, and patient
education).</p><p>One factor that is important to acknowledge is that, in groups that have had
epidemics of chikungunya, only a small percentage of patients will need drugs
such as MTX. Most patients can achieve pain control with the use of NSAIDs,
analgesics, and physiotherapy once the most common pattern of chronic disease
seen on the authors&#x02019; clinical practice is the non-inflammatory. </p><p>It is important to remember that this chronological division of therapy in phases
is ideal, but some patients may not visit a doctor until they have reached the
chronic phase (after 3 months of onset of symptoms) and thus, may never have
been offered post-acute phase therapy. In this case, despite when symptoms were
experienced, the previous phase therapy can be offered. </p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors thank the<italic>Minist&#x000e9;rio da Sa&#x000fa;de</italic> for their valuable
