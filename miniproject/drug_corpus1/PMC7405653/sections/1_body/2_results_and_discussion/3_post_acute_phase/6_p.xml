<p>In the case of localized or diffuse non-inflammatory musculoskeletal pain, patients should be administered NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, celecoxib, meloxicam) and reassessed after 10 days. If the response is good, this treatment can be maintained for up to 4 weeks, with subsequent gradual reduction to withdrawal. For patients with contraindications or risks for NSAID use, analgesics isolated or associated with opioids should be prescribed for 4 weeks, with the consideration of cyclobenzaprine (a muscle relaxant). </p>
