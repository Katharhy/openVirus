<p>In disease cases with an inflammatory component (arthritis/tenosynovitis), corticosteroid use after 14 days is effective. Prednisone 0.5 milligram per kilogram per day (maximum dose being 40 milligrams) alone or in combination with a common analgesic or weak opioid should be prescribed. After 4 weeks, in patients who present a good response, the dose should be withdrawn slowly (weaning), reducing a quarter of the dose every 7 days (total time of use being 8 weeks). Abrupt suspension or rapid withdrawal may lead to a rebound of the manifestations. Contraindications to corticoid use should be considered. </p>
