<p>It is important for physicians to identify different clinical patterns and identify whether there is joint pain (arthralgia) associated with edema (arthritis) or not. At this stage, the treatment goal is the relief of acute pain with the use of analgesics and opioids. However, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should not be prescribed because of increased risk of bleeding or kidney damage in these patients; in addition, other acute febrile diseases may have chikungunya-like clinical manifestations in the initial phase, and NSAIDs are also contraindicated (
