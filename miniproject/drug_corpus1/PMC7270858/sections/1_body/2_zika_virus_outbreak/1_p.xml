<p id="par0025">Zika virus infection has emerged as a major public health issue in the Americas. Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging arbovirus of the Flaviviridae family and is related to dengue, Chikungunya, West Nile, yellow fever, and Japanese encephalitis viruses. Hajj is among the global travel gatherings, drawing between 2 and 3.5 million Muslims from 183 nations annually to perform pilgrimage in Mecca, Saudi Arabia

This calls for constant epidemiological surveillance and a strategic response plan. Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emergent arthropod-borne flavivirus associated with neurologic complications

 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. On February 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Zika virus infection a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) due to the increasing number of cases and its associated complications. Currently, ZIKV is responsible for the ongoing outbreaks in the Caribbean and South America following the initial outbreak in Brazil 
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The primary route of human ZIKV transmission is through the bite of mosquitoes

 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. ZIKV is also transmitted via transfusion of blood products, organ transplantation and congenitally, laboratory exposure, sexual and, vertical maternal–fetal transmission

After an incubation period of 2–14days, patients develop an acute febrile syndrome associated with unspecific symptoms such as headaches, arthralgia, pruritic rash, no purulent conjunctivitis, myalgia, anorexia, asthenia, dysesthesia and retro-orbital pain

 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Despite the low frequency of fatalities and hospitalization due to severe disease, ZIKV infection is associated with a high frequency of neurologic complications such as congenital microcephaly and Guillain–Barre syndrome.
