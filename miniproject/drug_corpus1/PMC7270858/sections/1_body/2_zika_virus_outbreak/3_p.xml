<p id="par0035">Recognizing that the risk of vertical transmission and congenital ZIKV syndrome exists for both symptomatic and asymptomatic mothers or ZIKV exposure risk three times during pregnancy even if they are asymptomatic, ZIKV infection of pregnant women can also cause pregnancy losses and congenital malformations such as cardiac defects and craniosynostosis

 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Moreover, the frequency of birth defects resulting from vertical transmission of ZIKV is not well established as the risk of developing the congenital ZIKV syndrome is higher during the first and second trimester, even though severe fetal or newborn sequelae can also occur within the third-trimester infection
