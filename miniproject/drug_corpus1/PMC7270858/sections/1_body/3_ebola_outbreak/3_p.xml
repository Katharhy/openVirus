<p id="par0050">Major weaknesses and challenges of emerging and re-emerging Ebola virus outbreaks in most affected countries mainly in sub Saharan Africa include shortage of skilled health workforce and gross unpreparedness to prevent, detect and contain outbreaks of highly pathogenic nature at source. Frontline health workers were few, lacked skills and logistic support to handle infected cases, making them 21–30 times at higher risk of being infected than the general adult population6. Poor infrastructure impeded transport of cases and samples, while porous borders made cross-border contact tracing difficult

Therefore, routine information and alert warning signals do not exist and not share, delaying effective response coupled with limited or lack of financing of routine surveillance and preventive actions, also weak existing capacities to reactive response
