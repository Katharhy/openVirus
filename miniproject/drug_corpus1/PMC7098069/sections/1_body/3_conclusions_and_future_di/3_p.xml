<p>It is reported that some existing drugs or drug candidates such as remdesivir, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor, and lopinavir/ritonavir (protease inhibitors) against Ebola or HIV may be repurposed through fast-track human clinical trials as effective therapies to combat deadly COVID-19 and save hundreds of patient lives.

 </sup> Very recently, through screening the existing antiviral drugs, three broad antiviral agents (nitazoxanide, remdesivir, and chloroquine) were found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar concentrations in Vero E6 cells with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 2.12, 0.77, and 1.13 μM, respectively.

 </sup> Nitazoxanide is a prodrug of tizoxanide, which shares considerable structural similarity with niclosamide as a salicylamide derivative.

 </sup> Notably, niclosamide displays promising inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV replication with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of less than 0.1 μM in Vero E6 cells and inhibits MERS-CoV replication by up to 1000-fold at 48 h p.i. at a concentration of 10 μM in Vero B4 cells.

 </sup> SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>, the same as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, sharing 79.5% sequence identify to that of SARS-CoV.

 </sup> These findings, together with its broad antiviral properties, indicate that niclosamide, an inexpensive and well-tolerated old drug, may be repurposed with therapeutic potential applications to combat COVID-19. We envision that once its anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity is validated in animal models or human clinical trials, niclosamide and its optimized analogues may be developed as effective antiviral therapeutics with the potential to benefit numerous infected patients in this outbreak of COVID-19.
