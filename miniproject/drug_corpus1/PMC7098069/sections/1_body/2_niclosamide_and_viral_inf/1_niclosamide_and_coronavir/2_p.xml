<p>Gassen et al. revealed that E3 ligase S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) executes lysine-48-linked polyubiquitination of Benclin 1 (BECN1), resulting in its proteasomal degradation. SKP2 inhibition increases the BENC1 level, enhances autophagy, and efficiently reduces MERS-CoV replication.

 </sup> Niclosamide was reported to inhibit MERS-CoV replication by up to 1000-fold at 48 h p.i. at a concentration of 10 Î¼M, while it enhanced the BENC1 level and ATG14 oligomerization, increased the number of autolysosomes by &gt;2-fold, and affected the autophagic flux in the MERS-CoV-infected cells.

 </sup> Since niclosamide is a multifunctional drug, we cannot exclude the possibility that it exerts its anti-MERS activity by regulating other targets besides SKP2 inhibition.
