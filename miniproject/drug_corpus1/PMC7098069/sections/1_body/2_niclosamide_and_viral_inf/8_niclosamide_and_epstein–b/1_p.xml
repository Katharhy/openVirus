<p>Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), also known as human herpesvirus 4, has a toroid-shaped protein core containing a linear double-stranded DNA genome of 184 kb in size which is a member of the gamma subfamily of herpes viruses. EBV is widely spread in humans and infects over 95% of humans in the first decades of their life, resulting in a lymphoproliferative disorder known as infectious mononucleosis. EBV infection was also found to be associated with the development of several types of cancer such as Burkitt’s lymphoma, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

 </sup> Huang et al. demonstrated that niclosamide inhibits EBV lytic replication in lymphoma cells and epithelial cells and causes irreversible cell cycle arrest in lytic EBV-infected cells via disrupting mTOR activation, offering the potential to treat acute EBV-associated infectious diseases.
