 <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Clinical presentations in most of the patients were a simple common cold. However, in patients with an impaired immune system, it caused respiratory distress, pneumonia, and even death. [
 <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In some of these patients, neurological complications were reported. (

 <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In these cases, hypo-perfusion as result of septic shock, utilization of intravenous immunoglobulin as a part of the treatment regimen, hypercoagulability state, cardiogenic shock, and vasculitis might represent the potential underlying mechanisms for the cerebrovascular events.
