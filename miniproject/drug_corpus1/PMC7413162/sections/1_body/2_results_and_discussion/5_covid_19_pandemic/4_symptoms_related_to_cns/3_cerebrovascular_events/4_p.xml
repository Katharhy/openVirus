As mentioned earlier, SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to use the ACE 2 receptor for cell entry. ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 binding site, is a critical component of the counter-regulatory pathway of the RAS, which is one of the most important regulators of blood pressure. SARS-CoV-2â€“induced ACE2 downregulation may lead to vasoconstriction and dysfunction of cerebral autoregulation and subsequently blood pressure spikes which eventually can causes arterial wall rupture and hemorrhage.
