 <bold>Encephalitis</bold> following COVID-19 was reported in 22 patients out of 13 studies. (
 <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) Recently, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in brain tissues and capillary endothelial cells at autopsy and viral infection of CNS was confirmed. [
 <xref rid="bb0795" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>] Two different potential route of virus entry were suggested; First possible route is through the trigeminal and olfactory nerve endings. Infiltration through the olfactory system could explain the increased FLAIR signal in the medial temporal lobe. Moreover, signal changes which is seen in the brainstem and thalamus may represent a central infiltration through the trigeminal system. [
 <xref rid="bb0730" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>] The second possible mechanism of viral invasion may be increased permeability of the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) due to high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the CSF. [
