 <bold>Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis</bold> was reported in 13 patients out of 9 studies. (
 <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Overall it was shown that venous and arterial thromboembolic complications are seen in 5â€“15% of patients with severe COVID-19. [
 <xref rid="bb0595" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>] Combination of low-grade DIC and a localized pulmonary thrombotic micro-angiopathy might be the cause. The COVID-19 coagulopathy is characterized by a significant increase in D-dimers, high fibrinogen levels, mild prolonged prothrombin time, and a modest thrombocytopenia. [
