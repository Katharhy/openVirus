<p id="p0225">Seizure has been reported as a neurological manifestation in patients infected with SARS-CoV-1 [
 <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], MERS-CoV [
 <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and SARS-CoV-2. In COVID-19, 48 patients out of 20 studies were reported to have seizures. (
 <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). CNS viral infections and subsequent activation of neuro-inflammatory pathways are known to lower the threshold for seizures and potentially facilitate epileptogenesis in certain individuals. [
 <xref rid="bb0870" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>] As an example, in a COVID-19 patient with prior structural brain damage, focal seizures originating from the lesion site was reported. [
 <xref rid="bb0875" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>] Moreover, the accumulation of inflammatory markers associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, may cause a local cortical irritation that precipitates seizures [
 <xref rid="bb0885" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>]. In addition, viral encephalitis and direct invasion of the virus to the CNS may cause seizure in the affected patients. [
 <xref rid="bb0885" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0890" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>] In critically ill COVID-19 patients, metabolic and electrolyte imbalances, ongoing hypoxia and inflammatory/infectious processes may also contribute to seizure or abnormal EEG background. [
