 <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) with COVID-19 is a distinct entity defined as rapid onset of neurological symptoms often secondary to a viral infection such as herpes viruses and influenza. Despite the association with viral infection, ANE is usually not considered as an inflammatory encephalitis. The cytokine storm which has been described with SARS-CoV-2 and some other viral infections can cause ANE, particularly in critically ill patients. In the absence of CSF pleocytosis, an intense surge of pro-inflammatory cytokines causes focal damage to the blood-brain barrier and induces edema and subsequent necrosis. [
