<p id="p0075">Arbour N et al showed that human CNS cells including oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, microglia, and neurons are susceptible to acute infection with HCoV-OC43 during in vitro cultures, and other than microglia, the rest have a potential of persistent infection. [

 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] did not find any evidence of chronic 229E or OC43 infection in brain tissue of MS patients. In 1992, Fazzini E et al showed higher levels of HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-229E antibodies in CSF of Parkinson disease patients compared to controls. [
