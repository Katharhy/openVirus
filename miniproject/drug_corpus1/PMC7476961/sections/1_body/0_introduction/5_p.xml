<p id="p0020">Entry of the virus into the host’s cells is aided by the attachment of the Spike protein (S) onto the host’s Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor resulting in conformational changes that lead to the fusion of viral and cell membranes. Inside the endocytic vesicle, pH-dependent activation of cathepsin L leads to priming of the spike proteins that result in the release of the viral RNA genome into the cytoplasm (endocytic pathway). Alternatively, Transmembrane Protease Serine type 2 (TMPRSS2) is also involved in priming of the spike proteins at the cell surface, enabling entry of the viral genome (non-endocytic pathway). Once inside the cytoplasm, the ORF1ab fragment of the viral RNA genome is translated into the replicase polyprotein PP1ab, which is acted upon by viral enzymes like PLpro and 3CLpro (M
 <sup>pro</sup>) to produce nsps 1–16 including RdRp and helicase that play a crucial role in the replication of the virus. The nsps assemble to form the replication-transcription complex. The positive strand of RNA genome is transcribed to produce a negative-strand template for the synthesis of the new viral RNA genome. The transcribed mRNAs are translated to produce structural proteins S, M, E, and N. The viral RNA genome along with the N protein interacts with other structural proteins, and the assembled virions are delivered outside of the cell via exocytosis (
