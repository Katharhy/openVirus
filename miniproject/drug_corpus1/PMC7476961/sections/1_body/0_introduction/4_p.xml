<p id="p0015">SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus. The viral RNA genome contains 29,903 nucleotide bases and has ten open reading frames (ORF). The ORF1ab encodes for the large replicase polyprotein PP1ab, which is cleaved by Papain Like protease (PLpro) and 3-Chymotrypsin like Protease (3CLpro) to non-structural proteins (nsps) 1â€“16. The structural proteins S, N, E, M, and auxiliary proteins are encoded by ORF2-10
