<p id="p0025">In general, three approaches were followed for the discovery and treatment options for the pathogenic coronaviruses- SARS and MERS 
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Similar approaches were also being followed for the current pathogenic SARS-CoV-2. The first approach is the testing of broad-spectrum antiviral agents (mostly drugs) that have been used or previously tested for other viral infections by using standardized assays that measures the effects of these compounds on virus yields, infection rates, virus entry, and plaque formation. Some of the drugs identified via this approach during the previous two epidemics- SARS and MERS include ribavirin, Interferon-α, β, and γ

 <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. A similar approach for the current pandemic has also identified antiviral agents like remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, etc. A significant advantage of this approach is that the pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, toxicity, dosing, etc. of the drugs will be readily available, thus reducing significant time in the drug discovery process. The second approach to the anti-coronavirus drug discovery involves the 
 <italic>in-silico</italic> screening of chemical libraries that contains a large number of compounds. Rapid, high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS) of a large number of compounds is possible via this approach, which can be further validated by suitable antiviral assays. Drugs or investigational molecules belonging to different categories have been identified for the past epidemics- SARS and MERS as well for the current pandemic 
 <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The major con associated with this approach is that, although the identified compounds exhibit antiviral activity, they are associated with several side effects. The third approach is the 
 <italic>de-novo</italic> design and development of novel inhibitors based on the biophysical and genomic understanding of the individual coronaviruses. Examples include the development of antiviral peptides targeting the spike proteins, development of novel inhibitors targeting different viral enzymes, development of inhibitors targeting host cellular proteases., development of monoclonal antibody (MAbs). Theoretically, this approach will lead to potent compounds, but the development of these compounds usually takes years, as they undergo the entire drug discovery process.
