 <xref rid="b0685" ref-type="bibr">[137]</xref>. It has also been reported to possess antiviral activity against viruses such as HIV and dengue

 <xref rid="b0695" ref-type="bibr">[139]</xref>. A single treatment of ivermectin at the dose of 5 µM resulted in an about 5000-fold reduction in viral titers following 48 h of ivermectin treatment. The safety profile of ivermectin is well established, and hence ivermectin can be potentially repurposed against COVID-19.
