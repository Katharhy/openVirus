<p id="p0165">Chloroquine is claimed to act via two mechanisms. Chloroquine, in its unprotonated state, spontaneously moves across the cell membranes and gets accumulated in highly acidic vesicles like lysosomes and endosomes and organelles like Golgi, where it gets ionized and raises their pH thereby inactivating several proteolytic enzymes. Evidence suggests that viral entry, replication, and infection requires an acidic environment in the endosome-lysosomes and the catalyzing efficiency of endosomal-lysosomal enzymes. By raising the pH of the vesicles, chloroquine can effectively inhibit the entry and replication process
