<p id="p0120">Favipiravir is an antiviral drug approved for the treatment of the influenza virus. Favipiravir is a prodrug that is metabolically activated by the human hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) to its active metabolite-favipiravir-ribofuranosyl-5′-triphosphate (favipiravir-RTP) 
 <xref rid="b0515" ref-type="bibr">[103]</xref>. Favipiravir is an RdRp inhibitor that has shown promise as a therapeutic intervention for the Ebola virus

 <xref rid="b0310" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. An open-label non-randomized control study was undertaken to compare the clinical effectiveness of favipiravir and lopinavir/ritonavir as a treatment strategy for COVID-19. The study findings revealed that favipiravir had better treatment outcomes on COVID-19 in terms of viral clearance and disease progression 
 <xref rid="b0540" ref-type="bibr">[108]</xref>. A clear understanding of clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics profiles of favipiravir based on its previous clinical trials for influenza treatment 
 <xref rid="b0545" ref-type="bibr">[109]</xref> may be useful for determining the appropriate doses and course of treatment for COVID-19.
