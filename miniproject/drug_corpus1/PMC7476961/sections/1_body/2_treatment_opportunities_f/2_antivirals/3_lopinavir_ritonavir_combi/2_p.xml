<p id="p0115">Lopinavir and ritonavir are two structurally related protease inhibitors that were developed for the treatment of (HIV). Lopinavir exhibited higher selectivity, about 10-fold against both the wild and mutant strains of HIV-1 protease enzyme 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> than ritonavir. However, it lacked the same potency 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> due to metabolic inactivation by cytochrome 
 <italic>P</italic>-450 (CYP) enzymes 
 <xref rid="b0480" ref-type="bibr">[96]</xref>. Ritonavir inhibits cytochrome 
 <italic>P</italic>-450-3A4 (CYP3A4) at sub-therapeutic levels and hence is always co-administered with lopinavir to prevent its metabolic degradation 
 <xref rid="b0485" ref-type="bibr">[97]</xref>. Lopinavir was found to inhibit both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 17.1 and 8 µM against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively). The combination of lopinavir/ritonavir was found to be effective in the animal model as well 
 <xref rid="b0490" ref-type="bibr">[98]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0495" ref-type="bibr">[99]</xref>. It was proposed that the 3CLpro inhibition capacity of lopinavir/ritonavir partly contributes to their anti-CoV activity 
 <xref rid="b0500" ref-type="bibr">[100]</xref>. It was postulated that the combination could be effective against SARS-CoV-2. A study on analysis of molecular complexation between lopinavir and ritonavir with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro suggested interaction of these drugs with residues at the active site of the enzyme 
 <xref rid="b0505" ref-type="bibr">[101]</xref>. There are 39 ongoing studies registered in ClinicalTrial.gov on clinical evaluation of lopinavir/ritonavir for the treatment of COVID-19. The results posted on a recently conducted clinical trial, Lopinavir Trial for Suppression of SARS-Cov-2 in China (LOTUS China), revealed that the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir offered no benefits over the standard care in hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients 
 <xref rid="b0510" ref-type="bibr">[102]</xref>. Considering the dynamic situation and differential pathologies of COVID-19 in different areas, it is important to wait for reports and outcomes of other ongoing clinical trials before drawing any conclusion on the therapeutic utility of this combination for COVID-19.
