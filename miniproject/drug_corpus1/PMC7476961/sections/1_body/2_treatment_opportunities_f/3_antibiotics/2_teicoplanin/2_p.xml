<p id="p0135">Teicoplanin belonging to the class of glycopeptide antibiotic is used for the treatment of gram-positive bacterial infections. The previous report suggested that teicoplanin and its derivatives were capable of blocking the viral entry of the Ebola virus, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV into the cell by blocking cathepsin L
