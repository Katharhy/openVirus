<p id="p0100">Papain like protease is the other proteolytic enzyme that helps in processing of the replicase polyprotein. PLpro is known to cleave the replicase polyprotein at three sites releasing the nsp-1, nsp-2, and nsp-3, which are essential for viral replication 
 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Apart from its proteolytic function, PLpro is also reported to possess de-ubiquitinating property 
 <xref rid="b0385" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>. It also plays a central role in countering the strength of host immune response to viral infection by shutting down crucial pathways

 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have been performed against PLpro of SARS-CoV-2. However, computational studies have been performed which could provide a direction for further exploitation of PLpro. Wu et al. constructed a homology modeling of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and screened it virtually against the ZINC drug database and an in-house database of Chinese medicine and natural products. The virtual screening study identified ribavirin, valganciclovir, Î²-thymidine, and natural products Platycodin D, Chrysin, and Neohesperidin as potential leads with high binding affinity with SARS Cov-2 PLpro 
 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Arya et al. also constructed a homology model of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and screened it against a library of 2525 FDA approved drugs. Praziquantel (anti-parasitic), cinacalcet (anti-hyperparathyroidism), procainamide (anti-arrhythmic), terbinafine (antifungal) and pethidine (opioid analgesic) were identified with potent binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 PLpro 
 <xref rid="b0405" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref> (
 <xref rid="f0085" ref-type="fig">Fig. 17</xref> ). No major adverse effects have been reported for praziquantel and cinacalcet. However, procainamide, terbinafine, and pethidine have major adverse effects like cardiac abnormalities, hepatic failure, and respiratory depression, respectively
