<p id="p0055">As previously described, spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 bind to the ACE-2 receptor in order to enter into the host cell. However, other players are also associated with the entry of the virus into the host cell. Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is a host cellular protease encoded by the TMPRSS2 gene. TMPRSS2 is predominantly localized in the cell membrane of the lungâ€™s epithelial cells and aids in priming the spike proteins, a process that results in the fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Previous results have shown that the priming of spike proteins of SARS-CoV by TMPRSS2 is crucial for the entry of the virus into the host cells

 <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Hence, TMPRSS2 based therapeutics could prove to be useful armory in the war against COVID-19. Recently, Rensi et al. developed seven protein models of TMPRSS2 based on homology modeling and screened them against the clinically known serine protease inhibitors
