<p id="p0050">Coronaviruses make use of the host receptors as a doorway for entry into the host cell. Spike proteins of MERS-CoV use human dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) enzymes as its receptor for attachment 
 <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> while SARS-CoV uses human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) as a gateway for entry into the host cell 
 <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Recent studies have shown that spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 bind to the human ACE-2 for entry into the host cell, thus making ACE-2 a druggable target for COVID-19 
 <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. However, the simplicity ends there. ACE-2, apart from being used as a receptor for cellular entry by SARS coronaviruses, has several protective functions. Angiotensin I is synthesized from angiotensinogen, a process catalyzed by renin. Angiotensin I then serve as a substrate for the two enzymes Angiotensin converting enzyme-1 (ACE-1) and Angiotensin converting enzyme-1 (ACE-2). Angiotensin I is converted to an octapeptide angiotensin II by ACE-1 and a heptapeptide Angiotensin 1-7 by ACE-2. Angiotensin II and Angiotensin 1-7 have opposing effects on the vascular dynamics, the former being vasoconstrictive in nature and latter being vasodilative in nature, mediated by binding to their receptor Angiotensin-1 (AT-1) and Mas, respectively. Thus ACE-2/Ang 1-7/Mas receptor complex serves as the suppressive axis of the classical renin-angiotensin system (RAS) 
 <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Chronic administration of Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) leads to the up-regulation of ACE-2 
 <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE-2 as the receptor for binding, and hence it might sound absurd to suggest ARBs for SARS patients. Studies have shown downregulation in ACE-2 levels following viral attachment and fusion. This leads to the elevation of Angiotensin I levels due to the enhanced action of ACE-1 and repressed action of ACE-2, resulting in catastrophic changes in lung physiology mediated via AT-1 receptors 
 <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Therefore, treating COVID-19 patients with ARBs, although paradoxical, may do more good than harm to the lungs. However, it is too early to recommend such therapy for COVID-19 due to its complexity. Currently, no molecule in the clinical or preclinical trial is known to inhibit ACE-2. The drug discovery directed against it for treating COVID-19 may not be a fruitful approach considering its protective effects on the lungs. However, a rational approach would be to use a recombinant form of soluble ACE-2 that can act as a decoy receptor and bind to the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 to slow its entry into the host cell as well as to afford protection to the lungs 
 <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Ou et al. demonstrated that the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into 293/hACE2 cells was significantly suppressed by the pre-incubation of the pseudoviruses with a soluble form of hACE2 at 10 and 50 µg/ml
