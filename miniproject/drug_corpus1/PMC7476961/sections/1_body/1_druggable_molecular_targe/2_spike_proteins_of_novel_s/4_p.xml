<p id="p0040">Similarly, Zhang et al. designed and synthesized two peptides streptavidin-binding peptide-1 (SBP-1) and streptavidin-binding peptide-2 (SBP-2) based on the sequence of ACE-2 alpha-1 helix peptidase domain targeting RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in an attempt to disrupt the interaction between SARS-CoV-2- RBD and ACE-2 receptors (

 <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Although SBP-2 did not show any affinity towards SARS-CoV-2 RBD, SBP-1 was found to potently bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with a K
 <sub>D</sub> value of 47 nM, which was comparable to the binding of ACE-2 to SARS-CoV-2 RBD (K
 <sub>D</sub> = 14.7 nM).
