<p id="p0220">Infectious diseases resulting from novel pathogens will continue to be a global health concern, further epitomized by COVID-19. The world is still unprepared for such epidemics/pandemics despite former coronaviruses infections SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Although vaccines are the only way to prevent/eradicate SARS-CoV-2, at least a year is needed to develop vaccines with desired protection and address their safety issues before they can be deployed for large scale vaccination campaigns. Given the lengthy process associated with drug development, repurposing of approved drugs appears to be an appropriate solution to answer the short-term goals for the management of COVID-19. Only the efficacy of these drugs needs to be established against COVID-19 since their safety profiles are already well established. Many clinical studies are currently underway to repurpose existing drugs for COVID-19 management.</p>
