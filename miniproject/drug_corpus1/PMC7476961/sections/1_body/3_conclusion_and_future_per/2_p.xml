<p id="p0215">Extensive efforts are being made across the whole globe to find potential vaccines and therapeutic agents against COVID-19. However, until now, no vaccine or therapeutic agent has shown the results required for the approval for the treatment of COVID-19 or protection against SARS-CoV-2 infections. This review summarizes the potential druggable targets of SARS-CoV-2 for the discovery and development of novel therapeutics against COVID-19 based on the current understanding of molecular structures and functions of the targets as well as an understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease. The treatment approaches that are currently being explored have also been highlighted. The drugs that are currently being explored for the treatment of COVID-19 is summarized in
