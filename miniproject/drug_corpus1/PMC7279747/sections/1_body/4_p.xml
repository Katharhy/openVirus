<p id="para510">Separate cartridge-based SARS-CoV-2 assays are used on these systems. However, as Nazir Ismail (National Institute for Communicable Diseases, Johannesburg, South Africa) points out, “Some of the platforms overlap with testing [for SARS-CoV-2] eg, Xpert for tuberculosis, and similarly the Roche platforms used for HIV viral loads”. The overlap means that while tests are running on these systems for COVID-19, they are not running for the diseases they were previously testing for, which affect many of the poorest countries. Pai stresses that Xpert MTB/RIF is a critical test for tuberculosis that is widely used in many high-burden countries. He commented “We are worried that Cepheid will produce less of this tuberculosis cartridge, since they are dealing with a massive demand for their Xpress SARS-CoV-2 cartridge. We don't want to see only COVID-19 testing happening, because tuberculosis has not gone anywhere.”</p>
