The US Food and Drug Administration has to date issued 76 Emergency Use Authorizations for in-vitro diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2. These tests include some platforms commonly used for diagnosing other infectious diseases that have now been repurposed to test for SARS-CoV-2—eg, Roche's cobas 6800/8800 system used to diagnose HIV and hepatitis C, and Cepheid's GeneXpert Xpress used to detect tuberculosis and HIV.
