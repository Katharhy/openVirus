<p id="para520">Echoing Pai, WHO highlighted in their 2020 report that although treatment coverage for tuberculosis reached 69% globally in 2018, gaps in detection meant that nearly 3 million incident cases went undiagnosed or unreported. The worry now is that repurposing testing systems for COVID-19 could mean that even more cases of HIV, tuberculosis, and other diseases go undiagnosed. Norbert Ndjeka (Drug-Resistant TB, TB &amp; HIV, Pretoria, South Africa) has already noted a large decrease in case finding for drug-resistant tuberculosis in South Africa during the first quarter of 2020 compared with the first quarter of 2019. Ismail points out that the situation might be even worse outside of South Africa: “For many other African settings where tuberculosis testing capacity is limited, re-direction of the infrastructure for COVID-19 will likely have knock-on effects on tuberculosis testing and drug-resistant tuberculosis diagnosis. The same situation will likely be true for HIV”.</p>
