  <p>Schematic representation of the coronavirus structure and genomic comparison of coronaviruses. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Representation of coronavirus showing different components of the particle, which is 100â€“160 nm in diameter. The single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome, covered with the envelope and membrane proteins, gains access into the host cell and hijacks the replication machinery. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> The ssRNA of SARS-CoV-2 is about 30 kb and has similarities with the genomes of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Translation of this ssRNA results in the formation of two polyproteins, namely pp1a and pp1ab, that are further sliced to generate numerous non-structural proteins (NSPs). The remaining ORFs encode for various structural and accessory proteins that help in assembly of the viral particle and evading immune response.
