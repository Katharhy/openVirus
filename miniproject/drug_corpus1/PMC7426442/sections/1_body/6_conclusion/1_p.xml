<p>Considering the current situation of more than 8 million people being infected, with ~436,167 deaths as of June 15, 2020, there is an urgent need to control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 in lower than those of other coronaviruses that caused catastrophes in the past, but the higher infectivity rate makes it worse. Raising awareness of this contagious virus is one of the many ways by which its spread can be prevented. The governing authorities concerned in every country have approved guidelines and taken necessary action to quarantine infected people and break the chain of community spread. Antibodies, vaccines, and drugs developed for previously emerged coronaviruses could potentially be used for treating SARS-CoV-2. The combination of various neutralizing antibodies against S protein could enhance the effectiveness of viral clearance. Among various antivirals and other small molecules that are FDA approved, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine has shown better positive outcome in COVID-19 patients. In clinical trials, some of the combinational antiviral drugs like lopinavir + ritonavir and blockers like angiotensin receptor blocker that were thought to be effective, have failed in curing the disease (

Cytokine storm being one of the symptoms of infected individuals, anti-cytokine therapy for TNF and IL-6 should be attempted to determine the efficacy of these antibodies in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical trial ChiCTR2000029765 with tocilizumab, a monoclonal humanized antibody against IL-6 receptor, has shown some efficacy, but this still needs to be tested in a larger cohort. With the increasing number of deaths, there is an immense need to accelerate the development of rapid and sensitive diagnostic kits and to commence clinical trials of the readily available and safe drugs to reduce the rising infections and COVID-19-related deaths so as to bring life back on track.
