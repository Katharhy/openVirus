<p>The most potent antiviral machinery acquired by immune cells is the secretion of interferons that act as secondary messengers stimulating the neighboring cells. Most innate immune cells are efficient in producing IFNs that are involved in obstructing cell proliferation, apoptosis, and immunomodulation (

 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>). As an escape mechanism, SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV uses several ways to overcome the host immune response, one of which is by severe leukopenia and lymphopenia (
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>–
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>). After gaining entry to the cell, these viruses encode different proteins that interact with downstream signaling molecules of TLRs and the JAK-STAT pathway. MERS-CoV encoded matrix protein, accessory proteins from ORF 4a, 4b, and 5, which directly inhibits the IFN promoter and nuclear localization of IRF3 (
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>). PLpro, encoded by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, prevents the dissociation of NF-κB from IκBα, whereas nonstructural proteins of SARS-CoV, i.e., PLpro and ORF3b, inhibit IRF3 phosphorylation and hence its translocation to the nucleus (

 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>). These viral accessory proteins also inhibit the JAK-STAT pathway, resulting in inhibition of genes by ISRE promoters (

A new investigation revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to an overall decrease in the transcription of antiviral genes because of the lower production of Type I and III interferons with sufficient ISG expression, along with elevated chemokine secretion. Results obtained from 
 <italic>in-vivo and ex-vivo</italic> COVID-19 experiments were in tune with the 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> findings. Therefore, a decrease in the innate antiviral response, along with hyper-inflammation, could be one of the causes of COVID-19 severity (
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>). In addition to reduction in T cells, SARS-CoV-2 infection also enhances the exhaustion of effector T cells, decreasing the immune response against the virus (
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>). Exhaustion and loss in function of effector T cells is the result of increased expression of inhibitory receptors like PD-1, TIM-3, and TIGIT on its surface as a result of cytokines like IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α or by decreasing the regulatory T-cell population (
