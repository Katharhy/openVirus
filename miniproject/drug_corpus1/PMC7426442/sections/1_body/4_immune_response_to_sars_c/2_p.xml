<p>In addition to neutralizing antibodies, which are defensive and useful, there are numerous non-neutralizing antibodies in the system that aid the infection of immune cells and APCs. Previously existing SARS-CoV antibodies may promote the viral infection in FcR-expressing cells (

This ACE2-independent pathway of viral entry does not result in viral replication; rather, viral shedding by macrophages enhances inflammation and tissue injury by myeloid cell activation. This mechanism of viral entry through non-neutralizing antibody that results in aberrant activation of immune cells is called ADE (Antibody-Dependent Enhancement) (

 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). ADE has been observed in a number of viral infections, including SARS and MERS. In the case of SARS, anti-S antibodies were observed to be involved in ADE to gain entry into FcR-expressing cells (
