<p>We isolated RA-resistant viruses to identify the possible RA target site. Full viral genomic sequencing of six plaque-purified viruses showed a reproducible neutral amino acid asparagine to positively charged lysine mutation at residue 104 (N104K) of VP1 (5 of 6 clones), indicating that the VP1 protein is a target of RA (
 <xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Identical mutations were not detected in the P2 and P3 regions among these six resistant clones. Particularly, one plaque-purified virus harbouring a glutamate to glycine substitution at residue 98 (E98G) of VP1 was also isolated through selection. Both VP1 N104 and E98 are within the BC loop of VP1, a region exposed on the viral surface that may participate in virulence determination. We determined whether VP1 N104K and E98G were resistance-conferring mutations. To this end, we assessed the drug susceptibility of recombinant viruses bearing single amino acid mutations (N104K variant and E98G variant) derived from the cDNA clone. The inhibitory effect of RA on the N104K variants was undetectable; however, the E98G variant remained sensitive to RA treatment, indicating that N104K, not the E98G mutation, was responsible for the inhibitory effect of RA (

A comparison of growth curves for the wild-type and the mutant viruses revealed that the N104K mutation in VP1 (in the absence of RA) negligibly affected the replication kinetics, indicating that the N104K mutation affected the fitness of the virus (

 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). Taken together, these results indicate that the N104K mutation is an important determinant of RA resistance.
