<p>As the VP1 N104 residue may be the target of RA, we docked RA onto the constraint area, which encompasses this residue. The results revealed a potential binding site surrounding the cluster of E98, K242, and K244 in the PB model (Figure S1): RA interacted with N104, K242, S243, and P96 of the wild-type VP1 protein. RA also bound to K104 via hydrogen bonds in the docking model of N104K VP1 protein. The docking position of RA, however, is distant from the five-fold axis. We further analysed the VP1 sequence of different EV-A71 viruses, which have been classified into genotypes A, B, and C based on the VP1 sequence. The results showed that N104 is highly conserved (Table S1), suggesting that RA has broad targeting potential against EV-A71 infection, which was confirmed in an inhibition spectrum assay (

 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). We observed that the vehicle-treated mice exhibited a flattened weight curve following viral infection, whereas the body weight of RA-treated mice significantly increased by approximately 3-fold after 12 days of administration (
 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B). The vehicle-treated mice showed paralysis at day 7 post-infection, and most died within 12 d p.i. RA treatment ameliorated the severe neurological symptoms (
 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C). Furthermore, treatment of the mice with RA clearly reduced mortality following infection; the survival rate was 70% after 11 days of observation (
