<p>As the results of time-of-addition and virus attachment assays indicated that RA targets the virus or the cellular receptor(s), we performed a centrifugal filtration assay to further examine the antiviral effect of RA. Compared to the DMSO-treated control, RA-treated virus showed an approximately 90% reduction in the virus titre (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A), indicating that RA directly targets the virus. We next evaluated whether RA interferes with the interaction between the virus and host receptor during virus infection. We used receptor pull-down assays to detect interactions between the virus and known EV-A71 receptors, such as hSCARB2, hPSGL1, or heparan sulfate, in the presence of RA. We observed that RA treatment inhibited the binding of EV-A71 to PSGL1, but not SCARB2, as detected by western blotting with anti-EV-A71 antibodies (lane 2 versus lane 3 of 
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). The results of an attachment assay in Jurkat T cells constitutively expressing PSGL1 and mouse L929 cells ectopically expressing human PSGL1 (L-PSGL1) [
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] confirmed that RA inhibited the interaction of EV-A71 and PSGL1 (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C). Accordingly, both PSGL1 and heparan sulfate may interact directly with the positively charged residues near the five-fold axis of the EV-A71 pentamer; thus, we investigated the effect of RA on virus-heparan sulfate binding. In a heparan bead pull-down assay, RA dose-dependently inhibited virus binding, as indicated by the decreased detection of viral proteins (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D). We performed a drug combination experiment to determine whether the combination of RA and DBPR103, a WIN compound that inhibits viral uncoating [
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], synergized the inhibitory effect against EV-A71 (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E). The combination drug dosing was performed using fixed ratios of the EC
 <sub>50</sub> values (20,000:1). Cell viability was examined after 24 h of treatment using the MTT assay. As shown in 
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E, enhancement (synergy) of the protective effect was observed when the combination index was ≤ 1 [
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], indicating that the mode of action of RA may differ from that of DBPR103 as expected. Together, these results suggest that RA directly targets EV-A71, and thus interferes with the virus-PSGL1 or virus-heparan sulfate interaction.
