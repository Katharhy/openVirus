<p>We assessed the efficiency of RA against various EV-A71 strains and other DNA and RNA viruses. As shown in 
 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, RA selectively inhibited all tested EV-A71 of both genotypes B and C, whereas no inhibitory activity against enteroviruses D68 was observed. Additionally, no antiviral activity was detected against adenovirus with DNA as the genomic material (
 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). As target discovery is critical for drug development and application, we characterized the mode of action of RA by performing a time-of-addition assay. RD cells were treated with RA for the times indicated in 
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B. Viruses under each condition were collected at 8 h p.i., and the viral titres were determined in a plaque assay (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C). The results indicated that the virus titre was most prominently reduced when RA was added at the time of virus infection (–1–0 h p.i.) (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C). Further, the inhibitory effect of 280 µM RA was not cytotoxic (data not shown). To further confirm the results in different strains of EV-A71, time-of-addition studies were performed using immunoblot analysis to monitor the expression level of viral nonstructural protein 3A. The presence of RA was required at the time of virus infection to observe an antiviral effect (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D). In addition, an attachment assay was conducted to evaluate the binding of EV-A71 to RD cells in the presence of RA. Consistently, the amount of bound virus was significantly suppressed by RA treatment (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>E). Together, these results indicate that RA acts at the early stage of EV-A71 infection.
