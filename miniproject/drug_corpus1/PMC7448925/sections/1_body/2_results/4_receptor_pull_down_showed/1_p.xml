<p>Next, we identified the mutation responsible for the reduced sensitivity to virus-heparan sulfate interaction in the presence of RA (
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C). Interestingly, the N104K mutation generated a positively charged lysine residue, which did not alter virus binding to the heparan sulfate receptor in the absence of RA (lane 5, 
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C). The results of the heparan sulfate bead pull-down assay showed that RA did not inhibit the interaction between the N104K variant and heparan sulfate, although the amount of wild-type virus was low in the heparan sulfate bead precipitates after RA treatment (lane 3 versus lane 6, 
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C). However, inhibition of the virus-PSGL1 interaction was not alleviated by the N104K mutation in the receptor pull-down assay (
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D). Thus, the N104K mutation may account for the resistance to virus-heparan sulfate but not the virus-PSGL1 interaction. As previously reported [
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], non-heparan sulfate binding viruses, harbouring VP1-K242A and VP1-K244A, displayed reduced binding with heparan sulfate beads in DMSO-treated controls compared to the wild-type virus, 5865/sin/000009 (left panel; 
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>E). Binding of wild-type virus to heparan sulfate beads was susceptible to inhibition by RA, but the K242A and K244A variants were not significantly inhibited at up to 280 Î¼M of RA (right panel, 
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>E). Similarly, these mutant viruses showed little binding to RD cells, as reflected by their low RNA synthesis (left panel, 
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>F). These viruses were also resistant to inhibition by RA by binding to the cell surface, indicating specific inhibition of RA (
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>F).
