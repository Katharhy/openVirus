<p>Previously, during screening of the anti-EV-A71 activity of herbal extracts in a cell-based anti-cytopathic effect (CPE) assay, we observed that 
 <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic> (Danshen) inhibits EV-A71 at viral entry (adsorption) [
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Rosmarinic acid (RA), an ester of caffeic acid and 3,4-dihydroxyphenyllactic acid (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A) found in Danshen, exhibits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, and antiviral properties [
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23â€“26</xref>]. RA has also been previously shown to possess anti-EV-A71 activity, as it inhibits virus entry [
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains uncharacterized. In this study, we examined the mechanism by which RA blocks virus entry into the host.
