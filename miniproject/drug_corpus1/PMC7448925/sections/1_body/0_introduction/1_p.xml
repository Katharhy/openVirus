<p>Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71 or EV71) is a nonenveloped single-stranded RNA virus with a positive-sense genome approximately 7400 bases in length. EV-A71 is human enterovirus of the family Picornaviridae. Its viral RNA is enclosed within a pentameric icosahedral capsid, which encodes a polyprotein that is processed into structural proteins (VP1∼VP4) and nonstructural proteins (2A∼2C and 3A∼3D) by viral proteases (2A
 <sup>pro</sup>, 3C
 <sup>pro</sup>, and 3CD
 <sup>pro</sup>) [
