<p>Recently, virus strains with intra- or inter-typic recombination have been reported [
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Recombination events may alter virulence and result in epidemics. The results of multiple sequence alignments indicated that the highly conserved VP1 N104 residue is present among various EV-A71 strains (Table S1). Therefore, RA may be useful for treating EV-A71 infection, even for emergent virus variants. Our findings indicate that RA is a multiple-target drug against EV-A71-PSGL1 and -heparan sulfate. Although RA inhibited EV-A71 infection with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values in the micromolar range, our observations regarding the mechanism of action of RA require further investigation to develop more potent derivatives or combinational therapies.
