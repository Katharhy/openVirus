<p>The cell surface heparan sulfate functions as a receptor for numerous viruses because of the presence of positively charged amino acid residues in the five-fold axis [
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, RA did not inhibit adenovirus infection (
 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), a representative DNA virus, which also uses cell surface heparan sulfate as the entry receptor [
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], indicating that RA specifically targets EV-A71. RA displayed the distinct ability to affect the growth of the genetically similar EV-A71 and EV-D68, which have similar molecular mechanisms of viral replication. The virion of EV-D68 also possesses typical five-fold axis structures and uses heparan sulfate as a receptor [
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], but was not inhibited by 100 µM RA (
 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This indicated that RA does not target cellular proteins, common to EV-A71 and EV-D68 replication. This was supported by the observation that RA did not target host cells, as viral replication was not inhibited when RA was preincubated with RD cells before virus adsorption in the time-of-addition assay (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). We thus proposed a hypothetical model showing the effect of RA on EV-A71 entry into host cells (
 <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>).
