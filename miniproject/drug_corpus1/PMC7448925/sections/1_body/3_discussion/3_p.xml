<p>PSGL1 is expressed on immune cells and thus may be associated with virus-induced severe complications in patients with hand, foot, and mouth disease [
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Our data showed that RA inhibited EV-A71 binding to PSGL1 in the receptor pull-down assay, although the amino acid responsible for this binding was not identified in the resistant virus selection assay (
 <xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). RD cells are non-immune cells derived from muscle rhabdomyosarcoma and expresses negligible levels of PSGL1 as shown by RTâ€“PCR analysis [
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and thus no resistant virus against PSGL1 was selected. We postulated that the VP1-145 was responsible for the resistance, as a variant virus of EV-A71/Taiwan/2231/98 harbouring 145E (non-PB) instead 145Q [
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] in VP1 became resistant to RA in a virus-induced CPE assay (data not shown). In addition, VP1-145 has been shown to control virus binding to PSGL1 [
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The effects of RA on events associated with PSGL1 binding using immune cells warrant further investigation in the future.
