<p>Here, we tested the known compounds of Danshen to evaluate their bioactivity against EV-A71. Danshen extract targets the viral entry stage and exhibits high inhibitory specificity, as it exclusively inhibits strains of EV-A71 not those of other enteroviruses or DNA viruses [
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Using a chemical genetic approach, we identified RA as the potential active ingredient in Danshen, as it specifically targeted the viral entry step similar to that of Danshen (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). RA may exert its antiviral activity by directly targeting the viral particles, as the result of the centrifugal filtration assay showed that virus pretreated with RA inhibited viral infection (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). This was also supported by the identification of RA-resistant viruses harbouring the N104K mutation in VP1 (
 <xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Residue 104 is positioned in the five-fold symmetric vertex containing positively charged amino acid residues K244, K242, and R166, which have been reported to be involved in the virus-heparan sulfate interaction via electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged sulfate receptor [
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Mutations of these individual positively charged amino acids severely affected heparan sulfate binding [
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In addition, Tan et al. identified the N104S variant in a non-heparan sulfate-binding population through next-generation sequencing [
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Substitution of VP1-N104 with a lysine residue enhanced the EV-A71-heparan sulfate interactions as VP1-104 is close to VP1-K242 and K244 (residues responsible for heparan sulfate binding). This may impact the RA-EV-A71 interaction, as observed in the resistant virus selection experiment. Interestingly, the N104K mutation generated a positively charged lysine residue, which did not alter virus binding to the heparan sulfate receptor in the absence of RA (lane 5, 
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C). Our results from the pull-down assay showed that RA negatively affected virus binding to PSGL1 and heparan sulfate (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Using the same pull-down approach, we also ruled out the possibility that RA affects the virus-hSCARB2 interaction (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). hSCARB2 binds to the canyon region composed of the VP1 GH and VP2 EF loops, which is distinct from the five-fold apex of the VP1 where the N104 is in the BC loop [
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].
