<p>The cytotoxicity of RA was determined by incubating RD cells with RA for three days, and the surviving cells were then stained with MTT (3-[4.5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) [
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated as the RA concentration that reduced cell viability by 50%. For EC
 <sub>50</sub> determination, RD cells were infected with 9TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of each virus in the presence of the indicated concentrations of RA. After incubation at 37Â°C for 3 days, the cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet as described previously [
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. EC
 <sub>50</sub> was defined as the concentration of RA that reduces the virus-induced CPE by 50%.
