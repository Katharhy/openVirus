<p>RD cells (5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/ well) were seeded in six-well plates for 24 h. The cells were then infected with various viruses at an multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 and incubated for 1 h at 4°C. The cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to remove the unbound virus and were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS. RA (280 μM) was added at the indicated time points. Virus from the culture supernatant and cells in each condition were collected and pooled. The virus titre was assessed using the plaque assay and viral protein expression levels were monitored using western blotting.
