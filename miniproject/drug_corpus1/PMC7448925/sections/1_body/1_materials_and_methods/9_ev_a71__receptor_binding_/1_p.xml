<p>RA or DMSO was incubated with EV-A71 (20 µg) in 1 mL of 5% FBS-DMEM at 4°C for 1 h. The mixture was further incubated with Protein G Mag Sepharose® Xtra (GE Healthcare) conjugated with the extracellular fragment of SCARB2-hFc (1 μg, R &amp; D Systems) or PSGL1-hFc (1 μg, R &amp; D Systems) at 4°C for 2 h. The beads were washed twice with DMEM and then mixed with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer. The precipitated SCARB2-hFc, PSGL1-hFc, and viruses were analysed using western blotting with the indicated antibodies. For the heparan sulfate pull-down assay, RA or DMSO was incubated with EV-A71 in 1 mL PBS at 4°C for 1 h. Then, the mixture was incubated with heparan sulfate-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) at 4°C for another 2 h. After washing twice with PBS, the beads were suspended in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with EV-A71 antibody. For pulldown of the wild-type 5865/sin/000009 strain and its variant VP1-K242A and VP1-K244A viruses, equal RNA copy numbers in 50 µL of sequence-verified, passage P1 viruses from cDNA clones were used in a heparan sulfate pulldown assay [
