<p>RD cells were seeded in six-well plates for 24 h. The virus (5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU) was preincubated with DMSO or RA (280 μM) at 4°C for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with the virus for 1 h at 4°C to allow virus binding but not internalization. The cells were washed with PBS to remove unbound virus and then dissolved in the TRIzol reagent. Total RNA was extracted and 1 µg total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the M-MLV reverse transcriptase system (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using the StepOnePlus real-time (RT) PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with the following specific primer pairs: VP2 forward primer 5′- CTGATGGCTTCGAATTGCAA-3′ and reverse primer 5′- GCGTTTATGTACGGCACTATTATTGT-3′; GAPDH forward primer 5′-TGCACCACCAACTGCTTAGC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GGCATGGACTGTGGTCATGAG-3′. The target genes were then amplified under the following conditions: 50°C for 2 min, 95°C for 10 min, 50 cycles at 95°C for 15 s, and 60°C for 1 min. To quantify the changes in viral RNA expression, the 2
 <sup>−ΔΔCT</sup> method was used to calculate relative fold changes normalized to the GAPDH control.
