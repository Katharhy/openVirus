<p>Monolayers of RD cells seeded in 10-cm culture dish were infected with the EV-A71 strain 2231 at an MOI of 0.1 in the presence of RA (280 μM) or the DMSO control. When 90% of cell CPE was observed in the DMSO-treated group, the viruses (designated P1-RAr and P1-RAs, respectively) were collected and stored at −80°C. For each round of passaging, equal volume of P1-RAr or P1- RAs (500 μL) were used to infect fresh RD cells. The selections were terminated at passage 15, when no further decreased susceptibility to RA compared to passage 10 was obtained. Six plaques of P10-RAr and three plaques of P10-RAs were then isolated via plaque purification to further confirm the results of the resistance assay. After propagation in RD cells, the viral RNAs were extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). One microgram RNA was reverse-transcribed using the SuperScript® II reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen) with random hexamers to generate first-strand cDNA. The cDNAs were used as templates to amplify the P1, P2, and P3 regions of the EV-A71 genome with the following primers: P1F: 5′-GCATGGCTAGCATGGGCTCCACGGTGTCCA-3′, P1R: 5′-CGAATGAATTCGTGAGAGTGGTAATTGCTGTG-3′, P2F: 5′-GAAGGCACAACCAACCCGAAAGGGTACG-3′, P2R: 5′-ATCGATGAATTCGTTTGAAAACCGGCGAACAAC-3′, P3F: 5′-GCATGGCTAGCATGGGACCCCCTAAATTTAG-3′, and P3R: 5′-CGACTGAATTCGTAAACAATTCGAGCCAATTTC-3′. The amplified RT–PCR products were ligated into the TA cloning vector (T &amp; A cloning kit, Yeastern Biotech, Taiwan) and sequenced to determine the mutation sites.</p>
