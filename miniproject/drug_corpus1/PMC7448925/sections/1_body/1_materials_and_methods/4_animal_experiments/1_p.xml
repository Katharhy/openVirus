<p>The EV-A71 mouse model was established as described previously [
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Chang Gung University (CGU10-001). Briefly, 5-day-old specific pathogen-free ICR mice were purchased from Lasco (Taipei, Taiwan). RA was administered orally twice a day with the indicated dose (100 mg/kg/day) starting from day six of age. The pups were set apart from the mother for 8 h (starvation condition) to reduce the fullness of the stomach and prepare them for the intraperitoneal virus challenge on day seven of age (virus strain: MP4; 2 × median lethal dose: 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU in 100 µL). RA was prepared in a final volume of 100 μL in 5% DMSO aqueous solution; equal volume of 5% DMSO was used as the negative control. The infected mice were monitored daily for body weight, survival, and disease score. The disease scores were set as follows to represent the progression of virus infection: score 1, slow movement; score 2, one hind-limb paralysis; score 3, both hind-limb paralysis; score 4, death [
