<p id="p0160">Surveillance testing and diagnostic testing are critical tools for timely detection, control, and mitigation of any disease epidemic. Testing during epidemics provides rare opportunities to capitalize on natural experiments for expanding what is known about exposure, transmission, disease progression, and therapeutic treatment. Presented here is a concept for a potential natural experiment that could reveal existing drugs (or multi-drug combinations) that may have higher probabilities of success in their re-purposing (re-positioning) for disease prevention or clinical therapy - or conversely those drugs whose use should be avoided during infection. This concept (Natural Experiment for 
 <italic>Re</italic>-purposing of Drugs - NERD) would require considerable additional discussion and examination before reaching any decision to develop pilot studies to assess its potential viability or usefulness. If successful, however, the concept could prove invaluable in fighting future epidemics involving novel pathogens or mutated strains of prior pathogens for which past immunity or previously effective therapies are no longer effective.
