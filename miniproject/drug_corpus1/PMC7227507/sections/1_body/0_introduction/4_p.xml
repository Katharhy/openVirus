<p id="p0015">Proposed here is a simple, straightforward approach to possibly accelerate the identification of existing drugs for potential repurposing and to quickly identify candidates more likely to succeed in phase 3â€“4 clinical trials. These candidates should also have better safety profiles than by trialing candidates selected by other means, especially by avoiding the selection of drugs that adversely interact with other drugs. At the same time, it could also potentially reveal drug combinations that provide enhanced clinical outcomes.</p>
