 <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. It is often guided by virtual screening methods such as computational approaches and bioinformatics to reveal possible druggable pathways (e.g., see: [
 <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]) or even by traditional literature-mining and synthesis (e.g., [
 <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]). But even these approaches often end up selecting potential drug candidates that eventually prove ineffective in subsequent clinical trials. And these approaches are seldom used for predicting drugs that would be contraindicated - in this case, those that could adversely interact with Covid-19 or with co-administered drugs. Computational approaches are also unable to easily identify multiple drugs that might be effective as combination therapies.
