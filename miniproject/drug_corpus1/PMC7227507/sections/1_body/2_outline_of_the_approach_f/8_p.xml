<p id="p0105">While there are two overarching test groups with respect to all suspected cases (positive and negative), there are three major types of tests: molecular nucleic acid (e.g., RT-PCR), antigen, and serologic antibody (isotypes IgM and/or especially IgG) (see: [

 <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]). RT-PCR is the current gold standard for revealing whether an active infection is underway, as it reveals viable, replicating virus; less costly nucleic acid tests with higher throughput are emerging [

 <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Antigen tests (e.g., based on viral proteins released from the envelope or capsid) can also indicate current infection. Antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 have only begun commercialization, marked by the US FDA's emergency use authorization for the first antigen test [
