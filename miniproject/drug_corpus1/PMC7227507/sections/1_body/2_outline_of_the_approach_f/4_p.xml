<p id="p0070">The collected data would be entered into a computer app that transmits to a central, national relational database pre-populated with generic and trade drug names cross-referenced to their respective unique molecular entities. This would speed data entry, ensure consistent spelling, and account for multiple drug names that correspond to the same molecular entity. Note that it can be very challenging to compile a comprehensive list of unique molecular entities just for small- molecule drugs [

   <p id="p0075">For each of the three test groups, the collective percent-usage rate of each drug (D
    <sub>x</sub>UR) would be continually updated in real-time. Percentages could also be calculated for sub-groups, determined by the spectrum of severity of clinical status or outcomes - ranging, for example, from asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe, critical, and death. Note that the population-wide incidence of “asymptomatic” Covid-19 cases (where no symptoms are noted over the entire course of the disease) has yet to be determined (e.g., see: [
    <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]); also note that “asymptomatic” is used in this presentation to encompass those who have never been infected as well as those with undetectable subclinical infections.
