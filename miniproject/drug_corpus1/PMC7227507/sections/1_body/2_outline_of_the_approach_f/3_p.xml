<p id="p0065">Drug metadata to collect would include the route of administration, especially inhalation via the nose or mouth, as these might have a greater chance for adversely affecting the pulmonary system. It might seem that drugs of obvious interest during data collection might be immunosuppressants or antivirals, especially those to be effective against enveloped viruses. But many other drug classes might also be important. A major advantage of NERD would be that the screening process is not guided by known or postulated pathways of exposure, infection, or disease progression, as NERD would essentially test all drugs for which usage data is collected. The importance of avoiding cognitive bias is shown by the evolving knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 infection, where a major route of infection is believed to be pulmonary (via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 - ACE2 - receptors), leading to severe respiratory inflammation. But ACE2 receptors not only populate alveolar epithelial cells, but also endothelial cells, which means that various organs and blood vessels are vulnerable to inflammatory damage and clotting [
