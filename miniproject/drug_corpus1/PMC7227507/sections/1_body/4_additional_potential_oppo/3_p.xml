<p id="p0155">Finally, another unique possibility may exist for verifying the findings of NERD. The relatively new monitoring approach called wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been in use for identifying drugs that are collectively consumed across entire communities. One of the primary applications of WBE has been the monitoring of sewage for drugs (or their metabolites) and back-calculating per capita consumption [

 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] or for gauging community-wide status and trends of infection [
 <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. WBE could therefore possibly be used to complement and verify the findings of NERD. For example, drugs found by NERD to be predominantly associated with asymptomatic or mild cases of Covid-19 could be targeted for WBE monitoring in communities suspected as having low infection rates; note that the overall rates of community infection could also be gauged by WBE (e.g., see: [
 <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]). Conversely, drugs found to be predominantly associated with severe or critical cases of Covid-19 could be targeted for WBE monitoring in communities suspected as having high infection rates. Likewise, WBE could be used to quickly assess which communities may have high infection rates, and then target these communities for testing of asymptomatic individuals.
