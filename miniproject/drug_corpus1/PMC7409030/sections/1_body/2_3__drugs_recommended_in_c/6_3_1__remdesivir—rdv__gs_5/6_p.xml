<p>Following the same research direction, to evaluate the mechanism of action of RDV, a study published the 3D cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp in the apo form at 2.8 Å resolution and in complex with a template-primer RNA (50-base long) and RDV at 2.5 Å resolution [

According to this study, the characterized complex structure revealed that the partial double-stranded RNA template was inserted into the central channel of the RdRp, where RDV is covalently incorporated into the primer strand at the first replicated base pair, inhibiting the RdRp via non-obligated RNA chain termination. The complex structure is depicted in

 <xref rid="B69-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. According to the authors, the structure comparison and sequence alignment analysis carried out on the obtained complex suggest that RNA recognition and RDV inhibition of RdRp is highly preserved in various RNA viruses, providing a basis for broad spectrum nucleotide analog antiviral-based drug design [
