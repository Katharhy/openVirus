<p>In addition to the side effects mentioned in the summary on compassionate use of RDV, a cohort study conducted by Grein and collaborators on severe hospitalized COVID-19 patients treated with RDV for 10 days (the dosage recommended for compassionate use: 200 mg on day 1 and 100 mg/day on day 2 to day 10) and supportive care reported other adverse effects, such as increased hepatic enzymes (most common), diarrhea, rash, renal disturbance, hypotension, acute kidney injury, atrial fibrillation, multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome, hypernatremia, deep-vein thrombosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumothorax, hematuria, delirium, septic shock, and pyrexia (most of these effects were noticed in patients on invasive ventilation).
