<p>Structurally, RDV is a nucleoside analogue, which closely resembles AMP (adenosine monophosphate); important structural differences occur both in the nucleobase region, where the purine ring is replaced by a pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazine, and the ribose region, where a cyanide group is present in the fifth position. Moreover, the phosphate group is attached to a phenoxi group and an α-Alanine-2-ethyl-butyl ester, thus increasing the molecule’s lipophilicity as well as its degree of structural flexibility (
