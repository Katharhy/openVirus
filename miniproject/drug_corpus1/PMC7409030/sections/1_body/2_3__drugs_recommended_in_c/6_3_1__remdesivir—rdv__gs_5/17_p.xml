<p>RDV is conditioned as a prodrug of the nucleoside analog GS-441524 and displays the following pharmacokinetic profile: 100% absorption after iv. administration (after oral administration RDV suffers an almost complete first-pass hepatic clearance), distribution as a free fraction in a proportion of 12.1% (moderate affinity for plasmatic proteins binding), and t1/2 (plasmatic half-life) of approximatively 1 h. Given its nucleotide analog structural features and high lipophilicity compared with that of the active form (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jcm-09-02084-f005">Figure 5</xref>), RDV undergoes intense hepatic metabolization by cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2C8, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4) and is predominantly excreted in the urine as more hydrosoluble metabolites. The potential for interactions with other drugs is considered to be low for RDV (inhibitor of CYP3A4 and OATPs hepatic uptake transporter, according to several in vitro studies; no in vivo studies were performed) but is currently unknown for its metabolites.
