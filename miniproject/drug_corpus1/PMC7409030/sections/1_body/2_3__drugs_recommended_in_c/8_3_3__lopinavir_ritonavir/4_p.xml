<p>The pharmacokinetic profile of LPV/r consists of the following parameters: (1) a good absorption rate after oral administration, (2) lopinavir presents a high affinity for serum proteins (98–99% bound to serum proteins, mainly of alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG)), (3) hepatic biotransformation of lopinavir is almost exclusively by isozyme CYP3A (ritonavir is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A, increasing the levels of lopinavir), and (4) elimination in urine and feces both untransformed and metabolized. Taking into consideration that LPV/r (Kaletra) was approved as anti-HIV therapy for almost 20 years ago (2001), a long list of adverse effects was ascribed to this product, classified as follows: (i) very common: upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, nausea; (ii) common: lower respiratory tract infection, skin infections (including cellulitis, folliculitis, and furuncle), anemia, leucopenia, neutropenia, lymphadenopathy, urticaria, angioedema, blood glucose disorders including diabetes mellitus, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, weight decrease, decreased appetite, anxiety, headache (migraine), insomnia, dizziness, hypertension, pancreatitis, abdominal pain, hepatitis (with increased AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT, and GGT (Gamma-glutamyl transferase) values), skin disorders, myalgia, and erectile dysfunction, among others; (iii) uncommon: immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, hypogonadism, weight increase, abnormal dreams, cerebrovascular accident, convulsion, dysgeusia, ageusia, tremor, visual impairment, tinnitus, deep vein thrombosis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, gastrointestinal ulcer, jaundice, hepatic steatosis, alopecia, rhabdomyolysis, osteonecrosis, and nephritis, among others; and (iv) rare: Stevens–Johnson syndrome and erythema multiforme [
