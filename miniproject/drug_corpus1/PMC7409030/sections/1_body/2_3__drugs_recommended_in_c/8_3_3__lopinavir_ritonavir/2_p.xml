<p>CoVs encode specific proteases such as papain—like protease (PLpro) and main protease (Mpro or 3CLpro) [

 <xref rid="B110-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Mpro, a highly conserved homodimer among Coronaviridae members such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, has emerged as a potential target for lopinavir/ritonavir owing to its role in self and polyprotein maturation [
 <xref rid="B108-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. A previous study assessed the ability of several antivirals to act as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV specific viral protease Mpro, by means of molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulations. The conclusion was that the molecules with the best scores for potential viral protease inhibition were lopinavir and ritonavir [
 <xref rid="B111-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. In accordance with previous studies, to investigate a possible mechanism for the antiviral activity of LPV/r, Muralidharan et al. performed molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to explore the affinity of these antiretroviral drugs to the SARS-CoV-2 protease, and their results showed a stronger binding energy of the two drugs combined compared with that exerted by each drug separately [
 <xref rid="B108-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Their study also revealed that Lopinavir was able to interact with the viral protease predominantly through hydrophobic interactions, while in the Ritonavir–protease complexes, both hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions were deemed as key features for enzyme inhibition [
