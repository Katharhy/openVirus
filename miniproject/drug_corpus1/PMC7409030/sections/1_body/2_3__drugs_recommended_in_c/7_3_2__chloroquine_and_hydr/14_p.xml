<p>Coadministration of CQ and HCQ with the other investigational anti-COVID-19 agents (LPV/r, atazanavir) should be performed under strict monitoring, as LPV/r increases their concentrations and, subsequently, the risk for adverse effects. Moreover, when the coadministration is decided, ECG (electrocardiogram) monitoring is required, and the treatment period should be as short as possible. No interactions were reported so far between RDV and CQ or HCQ; therefore, their coadministration can be considered safe, at least until further notice [
