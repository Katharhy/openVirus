<p>Depending on their activity against SARS-CoV-2, the possible mechanisms of action can be divided into two main categories: (1) inhibition of viral enzymes/processes (viral DNA and/or RNA polymerase), glycosylation of viral proteins, assemblage of virus, new virus particle transport, and virus release; and (2) ACE2 cellular receptor inhibition, acidification at the surface of the cell membrane thus inhibiting virus fusion, and immunomodulation of cytokine release [
