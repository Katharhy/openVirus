<p>Previous studies have explored the mechanism of the antiviral action of CQ against SARS-CoV. The authors concluded that a possible mode of action of the drug, in post-infection treatment, would be the increase of the endosomal pH value, owing to the presence of the three nitrogen atoms within the CQ molecule, which give its basic properties, leading to abrogation of virus-endosome fusion [

In line with these reports, a recent study also showed that CQ/HCQ induced pH elevation, within acidic intracellular organelles, such as early endosomes (EEs) and endolysosomes (ELs), and also caused the disruption of SARS-CoV-2 transport between EE and EL [
