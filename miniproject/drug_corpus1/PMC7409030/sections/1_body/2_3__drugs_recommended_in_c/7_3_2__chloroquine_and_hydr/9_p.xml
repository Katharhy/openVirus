<p>The promising in vitro results of CQ and HCQ against CoVs led to an early clinical interest in the use of these two compounds as therapy for COVID-19 and multiple clinical trials (over 50, most of them evaluating the HCQ effects [
 <xref rid="B51-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], were set in motion [
 <xref rid="B91-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]). The data obtained from the clinical studies (final results or pre-print texts) present methodological flaws [
 <xref rid="B91-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>] and are inconclusive: (i) an improved clinical outcome was observed in HCQ-treated group, but was not statistically relevant [
 <xref rid="B92-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]; (ii) coadministration of HCQ with azithromycin determined the decrease of viral load in COVID-19 patients [
 <xref rid="B93-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]; (iii) CQ inhibited pneumonia exacerbation and shortened the infection course (improved lung imaging and increased viral clearance) [
 <xref rid="B94-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]; (iv) HCQ proved to be better in terms of efficacy compared with CQ [
 <xref rid="B95-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>,
 <xref rid="B96-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]; and (v) HCQ apparently offered no protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection (results of a large healthcare Israelian database analysis) [
 <xref rid="B97-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. The association of HCQ and azithromycin for the treatment COVID-19 patients was based on several premises: azithromycin proved in vitro activity against Ebola and Zika viruses, as well as a preventive effect against severe respiratory tract infections to patients presenting viral infection [
 <xref rid="B93-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], but further studies confirmed the efficacy of HCQ and azithromycin combination [
