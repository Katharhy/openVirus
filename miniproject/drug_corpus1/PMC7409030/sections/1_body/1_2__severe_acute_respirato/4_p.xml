<p>Four main viral structural proteins were described that were also detected in the SARS-CoV-2 structure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jcm-09-02084-f002">Figure 2</xref>): nucleocapsid protein (N), a helical capsid that contains the viral genome; matrix/membrane protein (M) and small envelope protein (E), both participatory in the virus assembly; and, finally, the spike surface glycoprotein (S), which intervenes in the virus entry within host cells [

 <xref rid="B13-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The S, M, and E proteins are all embedded in the viral envelope, while the N protein is located in the core of the viral particle, forming the nucleocapsid [
 <xref rid="B15-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The M proteins are among the most important and abundant proteins in the virion structure, being responsible for the virus shape. Their presence is critical as they play a key role, along with the E proteins, in orchestrating the assembly of the virus and in forming mature viral envelopes. The E proteins are found in small quantities within the viral particles, facilitating the release of the virions from the host cells. The N protein is required for RNA packaging into the viral particle during viral assembly [
 <xref rid="B15-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]; some authors consider that the N proteins are also responsible for countering the host immune response and its defense mechanisms against infections [
