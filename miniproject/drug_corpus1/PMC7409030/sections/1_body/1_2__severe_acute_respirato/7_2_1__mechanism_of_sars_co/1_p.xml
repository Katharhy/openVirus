<p>A major event in the viral infection is represented by the binding of viral particles to cellular receptors located on host cells’ surface, a function that is executed by spike S glycoprotein [

 <xref rid="B22-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The S glycoprotein is a highly exposed protein [
 <xref rid="B22-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], projecting from the virion surface and giving its royal crown aspect under electronic microscopy [
 <xref rid="B15-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Thanks to their position, the S proteins are the main targets for design of therapeutics and vaccines [

In light of the major roles played by spike S glycoprotein in viral infection and the impact of CoVs on human health, previous studies focused on elucidating the structure of this glycoprotein as a potential target for antiviral therapies. S glycoprotein resembles a clove-shape trimer with three structural parts: (1) a large ectodomain organized in two subunits—S1 and S2—responsible for viral and host membrane fusion and transfer of the genome into the host cell; (2) a single-pass transmembrane anchor; and (3) a short tail located intracellularly [

 <xref rid="B22-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The S1 subunit is involved in the recognition of the cellular receptor and presents two domains: (i) NTD (N-terminal domain) and (ii) CTD (C-terminal domain), which act as receptor-binding ligands ensuring viral attachment [

 <xref rid="B22-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Besides the key role of spike surface glycoprotein in the viral penetration into the host cells, it is also responsible for inducing immune responses from the host and establishing viral host domain and tissue tropism [

 <xref rid="B23-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], but the tissue affinity of CoVs generally depends on the ability of S protein to interact with the receptors expressed by the host cells [
