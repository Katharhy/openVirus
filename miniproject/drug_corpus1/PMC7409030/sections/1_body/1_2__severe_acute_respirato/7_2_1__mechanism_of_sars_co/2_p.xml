<p>Previous studies elucidated the CoVs’ pattern to recognize host cellular receptors: SARS-CoV identifies the zinc peptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via S1 C-terminal domain (also known as receptor binding domain—RBD), whereas MERS-CoV identifies serine peptidase and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), also using the S1 C-terminal domain [

All structures were deposited in the RCSB (Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics) Protein Data Bank (PDB) under the following PDB IDs: 6VW1, 6M0J, 6LZG, and 6M17, and show useful insight in the binding interactions formed between the two proteins [

 <xref rid="B27-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. According to some researchers, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is not only the cellular entry locus for CoVs, but it also regulates both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of the virus [

ACE2 is physiologically expressed on the I and II type alveolar epithelial cells of the human lung, but also by other cells; therefore, SARS-CoV-2 binding to the receptor might cause cellular damage, a series of systemic reactions, and even death [
