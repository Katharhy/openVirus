<p>The virus–cell interactions and the viral rapid replications trigger the release of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [
 <xref rid="B23-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The inflammatory markers observed in COVID-19 patients include interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-7 (IL-7), interleukin-10 (IL-10), interleukin-12 (IL-12), interleukin-13 (IL-13), interleukin-17 (IL-17), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), interferon-γ-inducible protein (IP10), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP1A), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [

Interestingly, some studies suggest that the S viral protein–ACE2 complex is directly involved in the inflammatory responses induced by the SARS-CoVs. S protein can downregulate ACE2 receptors, leading to the loss of their pulmonary functions, which are, unfortunately, still unknown. ACE2 dysregulations might cause dysfunction of the renin-angiotensin system as well, enhancing inflammation and vascular permeability. Moreover, the ACE2 shedding has been associated with TNF-α production [
