<p>At present, remdesivir is considered the most promising therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection being already included in the interim guidelines for COVID-19 treatment, based on the following considerations: proved to be an effective drug in severely and critically ill forms of COVID-19; shows a high human tolerance; the only side effect directly correlated to RDV is the hepatic injury (elevation of hepatic enzymes values); has a very low potential to induce drugâ€“drug interactions; and the duration of treatment can be reduced at 5 days according to the latest clinical results. Although the mechanism of action of RDV is well defined, its toxicological profile needs further investigations in order to be fully established, so the administration of this compound should be performed under surveillance.</p>
