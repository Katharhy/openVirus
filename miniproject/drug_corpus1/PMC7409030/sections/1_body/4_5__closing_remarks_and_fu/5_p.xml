<p>The use of lopinavir/ritonavir against SARS-CoV-2 infection determined controversial results; that is, according to some clinical studies, this combination had no significant antiviral effect, whereas in terms of adverse events and drug–drug interactions, the significance was reached (both lopinavir and ritonavir are CYP3A inhibitors and are subjected to multiple drug–drug interactions and adverse effects implicitly). Therefore, lopinavir/ritonavir is recommended as a second choice in the interim guidelines for remdesivir and its administration should be performed only under strict surveillance. Administration of anti-inflammatory agents (baricitinib, fedratinib, sunitinib, ruloxitinib, and so on) should be recommended as therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection only when the laboratory results indicate a potential “cytokine storm” occurrence. The initiation of anticoagulant treatment should be performed based on laboratory results that indicate a potential risk for thrombotic events and coagulopathy disfunction; the administration of LMWHs is recommended in mild and moderate coagulation impairment, whereas in severe conditions, unfractionated heparin should be the first choice.</p>
