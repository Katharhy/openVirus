<p>Cava et al. [
 <xref rid="B140-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>] conducted an in silico investigation on the mechanism played by ACE2 in inflammatory lung disease to furnish some evidence for an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2; the importance of this study lies in the fact that it is focused on the genes in the network that are already associated with known drugs such as nimesulide, didanosine, thiabendazole, fluticasone propionate, and Photofrin, and their role as a key treatment of COVID-19 is evaluated using a protein–protein interaction network containing the genes co-expressed with ACE2. Public data were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas Lung Adenocarcinoma and correlation analyses between ACE2 and 526 genes were performed; Pearson’s correlation with ACE2 expression level was also obtained. Their results indicate that nine genes (LRRK2, MCCC2, GSTA4, ACSL5, HSD1B4, EPHX1, ACACA, ROS1, and HGD) are positively correlated with ACE2 and Didanosine, a dideoxynucleoside analogue used in HIV treatment, has the highest antiviral activity [

The IL-1 receptor antagonist is a key treatment for hyperinflammatory conditions and was shown to be highly effective in the treatment of cytokine storm syndromes, such as macrophage activation syndrome and cytokine release syndrome [
