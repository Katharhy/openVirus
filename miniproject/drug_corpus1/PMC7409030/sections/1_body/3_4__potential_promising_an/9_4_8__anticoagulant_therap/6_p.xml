<p>The reluctance in recommending LMWHs as a treatment for thromboembolic disease in severely ill COVID-19s patient is based on the pharmacokinetic profile of these drugs; that is, a long half-life, which makes it difficult to monitor their dosage, as well as an elevated risk to produce heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (a severe adverse event). It is thus recommended that LMWhs be administered in mild and moderate coagulation impairment, whereas in severe conditions, the unfractionated heparin should be the first choice for intravenous administration (short half-life, can be easily monitored, and can be inactivated by protamine). An alternative in the case of adverse effects (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) after heparin treatment is represented by argatroban, a direct thrombin inhibitor, or bivaluridin, a direct and specific inhibitor of thrombin activity [
