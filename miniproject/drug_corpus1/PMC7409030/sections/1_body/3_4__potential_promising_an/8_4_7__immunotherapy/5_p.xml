<p>Regarding monoclonal antibodies (MAs), they form a versatile class of pharmaceuticals able to provide an efficient and highly specific treatment against diseases, including viral infections. The monoclonal antibodies could effectively block the virus entry within the host cell, binding either the spike (S) protein or the ACE2 receptor. Even though there are several reported MAs targeting the RBD region of S protein, a receptor-binding domain located in the S1 subunit that mediates the virus attachment to the host cells, the large-scale production of monoclonal antibodies is labor-intensive, expensive, and time-consuming, which outweighs their clinical application especially during emerging situations like the novel SARS-CoV-2 outbreak [
