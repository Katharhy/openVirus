<p>Favipiravir, (6-fluoro-3-hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxamide), is a prodrug antiviral agent approved in Japan for the treatment of influenza. The compound is a nucleic acid purine base analog that acts primarily by inhibiting viral RdRp. Other mechanisms of action reported involve RNA induced lethal mutagenesis. Like other representatives of this class, favipiravir is metabolized to its active form, favipiravir-ribofuranosyl-5′-triphosphate, responsible for the pharmacological effect [

Favipiravir is metabolized by hepatic aldehyde oxidase in the cytosol (it is not metabolized by microsomal enzymes) and does not produce significant drug–drug interactions. Moreover, it does not affect the human DNA polymerases α, β, and γ subunits (at up to 100 µg/mL), thus being non-toxic [
