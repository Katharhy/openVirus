<p>As an anti-HIV-1 agent, it inhibits the replication and maturation of the virus by preventing the cleavage of the capsid–spacer peptide of the Gag protein [
 <xref rid="B134-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>], which is crucial to the structural alterations necessary for the formation of mature HIV-1 particles [
 <xref rid="B135-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. Through this mechanism of action, BA causes the host cell to release virions with no infective ability [
 <xref rid="B134-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. One of the hurdles for betulinic acid to release its antiviral potency is its poor water solubility, which persuaded scientists to synthesize more water-soluble BA derivatives and examine their biological activities [
 <xref rid="B135-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. Derivatives such as dihydrobetulinic acid, 3-alkylamido-3-deoxi-betulinic acid, or 3-O-(3-3-dimethylsuccinyl betulinic acid) were reported as potent antivirals. The last compound is involved in the assembly and/or budding of virions by blocking a late step of virus replication [
 <xref rid="B135-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. The pharmacological effect of a compound is strictly linked to its chemical structure; thus, according to recent findings, the most potent antiviral compounds were those with an ortho halogen substitution in the benzoic moiety of the dehydrobetulinic and betulin derivatives, and the simple benzoic or phthalic acids of dehydrobetulin [
 <xref rid="B134-jcm-09-02084" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. Other derivatives such as Ω-undecanoic amides and ionic derivatives of betulinic acid conjugated with glycine intervene during the fusion of the virus to the cell membrane and cause the inhibition of HIV-1 protease activity, respectively.
