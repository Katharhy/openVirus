<p>The BA inhibition mechanism of 3CLpro was associated with its molecular structure, as the hydroxyl group in the C3 position of BA is able to form a hydrogen bond with the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group of Thr24 located at the N-terminus of the protease [

This study demonstrated the antiviral activity of BA against SARS-CoVs in in vitro experiments, suggesting that it might be efficient against the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2, but further studies need to be conducted in this area. However, BA can be considered a potential adjuvant compound in treating COVID-19 infectious disease.
