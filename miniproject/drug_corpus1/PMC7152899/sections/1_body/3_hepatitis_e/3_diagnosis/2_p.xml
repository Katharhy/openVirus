<p id="p0175">In immunocompromised hosts, levels of anti-HEV immunoglobulin are lower and frequently undetectable, so diagnosis often requires testing for HEV RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for confirmation. The World Health Organization has developed an international standard for nucleic acid amplification techniques to improve HEV RNA detection and quantification.

 </xref> To increase diagnostic rates of HEV, use of at least 2 of the 3 markers mentioned earlier is suggested to increase yield, particularly because accuracy and reliability of anti-HEV immunoglobulin assays differ widely in laboratories and among the particular individuals being tested.
