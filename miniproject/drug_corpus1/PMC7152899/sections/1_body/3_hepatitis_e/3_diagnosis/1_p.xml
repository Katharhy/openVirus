<p id="p0170">After initial exposure and an incubation period of 2 to 8 weeks, HEV RNA may be detectable in the stool and serum for 1 to 2 weeks after onset of symptoms. The diagnostic window is narrow because patients typically present after the peak viremic period has concluded. Anti-HEV IgM is produced early after infection, coinciding with peak alanine transaminase levels, and may last 4 to 6 months. Anti-HEV IgG is first present at low titers and increases incrementally over time. Thus, patients who present early may only have detectable HEV RNA, whereas many patients do not present until the early viremic period has already subsided.
