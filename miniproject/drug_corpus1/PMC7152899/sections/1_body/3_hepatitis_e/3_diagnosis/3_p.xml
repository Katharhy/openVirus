<p id="p0180">Liver biopsy in acute HEV infection may show a wide range of features, including mixed inflammatory infiltrate, interface hepatitis, cholestasis, and apoptotic bodies, which may have similar overlapping features with other viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, or drug-induced liver injury.

 </xref> Because most cases of acute HEV are self-limited in immunocompetent hosts, liver biopsy is often not necessary. By contrast, liver biopsy is often obtained before chronic HEV infection is suspected in immunosuppressed hosts because unexplained increase in transaminase levels is the typical presentation with no other clinical symptoms. In patients with known infection, liver biopsy may be beneficial for staging of fibrosis given the potential risk for accelerated progression to cirrhosis. HEV RNA may be detected in the liver biopsy specimen and histopathology ranges from minimal inflammation to clinical features suggestive of mild acute cellular rejection.

 </xref> Given the nonspecific findings on histologic examination, HEV RNA should be tested in transplant recipients if a liver biopsy shows chronic hepatitis of uncertain cause or a nondiagnostic biopsy in the setting of persistently abnormal liver chemistries.
