<p id="p0165">Chronic HEV, defined by chronic hepatitis with increased aminotransferase levels and persistent detection of HEV RNA for 6 months after exposure, is rare in immunocompetent individuals but has been increasingly recognized with genotype 3 HEV infections in immunocompromised hosts, particularly in those with solid organ transplants (SOTs), stem cell transplants (SCTs), or HIV. This condition is likely caused by the impaired and/or insufficient immune T-cell response with an inability to control the virus in the immunocompromised state.

 </xref> An estimated 60% of SOT recipients infected with HEV do not clear the virus and develop chronic infection with increased risk of rapid progression to cirrhosis.

 </xref> Unlike immunocompetent individuals, HEV infection in immunocompromised patients typically presents with lower transaminase and bilirubin levels and minimal symptoms. Both acute and chronic HEV have been associated with numerous extrahepatic manifestations (
