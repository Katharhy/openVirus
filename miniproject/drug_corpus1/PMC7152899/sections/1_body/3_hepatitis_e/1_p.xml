<p id="p0155">Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the most common cause of acute viral hepatitis worldwide. The original hepatitis E outbreak likely occurred in New Delhi in 1955, involving 29,000 individuals based on analysis of stored serum. The virus was initially isolated from the stool of Soviet soldiers experiencing hepatitis outbreaks during the military conflict in Afghanistan during the 1980s. HEV was subsequently named in 1990 to distinguish it from hepatitis A virus, an additional source of waterborne hepatitis epidemics at the time.

 </xref> There are 4 known HEV genotypes. Infections with genotypes 1 and 2 are limited to humans and cause disease via consumption of contaminated water. HEV genotypes 3 and 4 cause zoonotic infections, with human disease attributed to consumption of raw or undercooked meat, particularly pork and wild game.

 </xref> Thus, HEV endemic outbreaks are related to genotypes 1 and 2 typically in Asia, Africa, and Mexico, and sporadic cases caused by genotype 3 and 4 have been observed in nations worldwide.
