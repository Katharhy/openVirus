<p id="p0185">The initial step in management of chronic HEV is reduction of immunosuppression, if possible, particularly using medications with an effect on T cells (ie, calcineurin inhibitors and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors), which has been shown to be a sufficient strategy to allow clearance of the virus in one-third of patients.

 </xref> The optimal immunosuppressive regimen still requires further studies, with current recommendations to minimize immunosuppression as much as possible and favoring use of mycophenolate rather than calcineurin or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors.

 </xref> Interferon has been used for treatment of hepatitis B and C, so it has similarly been investigated in use for treatment of chronic HEV.

 </xref> However, its long list of potential side effects, including the potential for graft rejection, makes it a poor treatment option. Ribavirin is used and tolerated well for treatment of chronic HEV in SOT recipients at a median dose of 600 mg daily (8 mg/kg) for 3 months and longer treatment courses for 6 to 12 months in those with partial response or relapse after treatment.

 </xref> There is currently 1 licensed vaccine for hepatitis E (HEV 239, Hecolin) available in China, which is derived from a 26-KDa protein coded by ORF2 of HEV1.
