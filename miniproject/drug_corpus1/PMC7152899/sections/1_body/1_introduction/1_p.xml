<p id="p0035">The term viral hepatitis refers to liver inflammation that occurs because of a viral infection. There are 5 hepatotropic viruses (hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E) that selectively infect the liver. Acute hepatitis caused by these viruses may resolve without intervention or may develop into chronic infection in some instances. Nonhepatotropic viruses target different organs in the body but are also known to cause hepatitis, although these infections are typically mild in immunocompetent hosts. The significance of nonhepatotropic viruses is most notable in immunocompromised hosts, particularly in transplant recipients.</p>
