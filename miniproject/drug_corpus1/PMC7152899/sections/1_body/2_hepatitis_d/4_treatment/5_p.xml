<p id="p0150">Given the paucity of treatment options, high relapse rates, and poor side effect profile, there remains a need and ongoing investigation for a treatment option that may be more efficacious. Novel treatments with promising early data under investigation include myrcludex, an entry inhibitor that blocks both HDV and HBV hepatocyte entry; the prenylation inhibitor lonafarnib, which inhibits farnesyltransferase, a key enzyme required for HDV replication; and pegylated interferon lambda, a type 3 interferon.
