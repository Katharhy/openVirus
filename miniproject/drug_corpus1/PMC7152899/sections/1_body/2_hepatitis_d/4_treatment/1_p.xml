<p id="p0130">Interferon alfa (IFN-α) is currently the only available treatment for chronic HDV infection. The goal of HDV therapy is to achieve viral suppression with sustained clearance of HDV after treatment completion. Thus far, no study has been able to achieve this in the majority of patients treated.

 </xref> The Hep-Net International Delta Hepatitis Intervention Trial (HIDIT), a large multicenter initiative, treated patients with peginterferon α-2a and/or adefovir for 48 weeks of therapy. Six months after treatment completion, 28% of patients treated with interferon alone had continued undetectable HDV RNA with no additional benefit derived in those who also received adefovir and no response in individuals treated with adefovir alone.

 </xref> In the follow-up study, HIDIT-II, treating with peginterferon α-2a with or without tenofovir, only 23% of patients had undetectable HDV RNA 24 weeks after completing a 96-week course of therapy with interferon and no additional benefit from concomitant tenofovir therapy.
