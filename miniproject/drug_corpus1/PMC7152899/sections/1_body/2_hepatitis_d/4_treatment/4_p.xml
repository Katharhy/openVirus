<p id="p0145">In patients with chronic HDV infection who are decompensated and unable to tolerate IFN because of its side effects, liver transplant may be considered. As with all patients with cirrhosis, ongoing screening is needed for esophageal varices and hepatocellular carcinoma. For patients who undergo liver transplant, hepatitis B immune globulin is administered similar to patients with HBV monoinfection, which results in clearance of HBsAg and HDV RNA.
