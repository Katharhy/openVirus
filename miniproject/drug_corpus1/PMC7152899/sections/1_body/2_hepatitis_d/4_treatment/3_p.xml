<p id="p0140">The ability to achieve sustained virologic response (SVR) in the treatment of HDV remains uncertain given the high rates of late relapse. Follow-up of the HIDIT-I study participants at a median time of 4.5 years found detectable HDV RNA levels in half of the patients who had met the initial SVR definition with undetectable HDV RNA 24 weeks after treatment.

 </xref> Likelihood of response may be predicted by HDV RNA and HBsAg kinetics during treatment.

 </xref> Earlier decline of HDV RNA levels by more than 2 log copies per milliliter and HBsAg level less than 1000 IU/mL by week 24 of therapy indicate a higher likelihood of virologic response after treatment completion.

 </xref> Because of the high rates of relapse, ongoing surveillance for HDV RNA is needed, particularly in the setting of increased transaminase levels after completion of prior therapy. However, loss of HBsAg after treatment of HDV with IFN is considered a marker of cure for both HBV and HDV.
