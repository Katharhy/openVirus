<p id="p0120">HDV infection is diagnosed with serum-based tests (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ). HDV antigen is typically only detected in the blood during the early acute phase of infection and is not a reliable test for diagnosis.

 </xref> Acute HDV infection leads to both innate and adaptive immune responses with production of HDV immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG), respectively. HDV IgM is detectable 1 to 3 weeks after exposure and remains positive in chronic active infection with levels reflective of disease activity.

 </xref> HDV IgG is a marker of either current active or prior resolved infection. Thus, HDV IgG is checked first for chronic HDV screening, and HDV RNA is used to confirm active infection and to follow response to therapy. Because there remains ongoing work to standardize and improve HDV RNA assays, HDV IgM can be tested in patients with high clinical suspicion of HDV infection but an undetected RNA level.
