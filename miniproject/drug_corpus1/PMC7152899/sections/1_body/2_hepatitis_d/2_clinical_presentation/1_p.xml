<p id="p0045">Infection with hepatitis D can occur under 2 circumstances (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.Â 1</xref> ). Coinfection occurs when an individual is exposed to both hepatitis B and D viruses simultaneously with a similar presentation to acute HBV infection and potential risk of acute liver failure (ALF). Superinfection occurs when an individual with established chronic hepatitis B infection (defined by the presence of HBsAg) is exposed to an acute hepatitis D infection. Although superinfection with HDV is more likely to develop into chronic infection, 95% of individuals with HBV-HDV coinfection ultimately have viral clearance.

 </xref> Chronic HDV infection is the most aggressive form of viral hepatitis with greater rates of hepatocellular carcinoma and more rapid progression to cirrhosis compared with HBV monoinfection.
