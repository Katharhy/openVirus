<p id="p0040">Hepatitis D virus (HDV), also called delta virus, was first described in 1977 in a group of patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) who were found to have more severe hepatitis than their counterparts.

 </xref> Thus, HDV requires HBV in addition to cellular RNA polymerases for replication and cannot infect individuals without the presence of HBsAg, which is required for cell entry, virion assembly and export. Since the widespread availability of the hepatitis B vaccine with worldwide implementation of vaccination programs, a concomitant decrease in HDV alongside HBV would be expected. However, the prevalence of HDV seems to be increasing and may be attributed to the higher prevalence of HDV infection in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfected individuals and intravenous drug users.
