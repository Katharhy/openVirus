<p id="p0290">Both HDV and HEV are causes of disease worldwide and diagnosis requires high clinical suspicion to test for disease presence. HDV remains difficult to treat with the current available therapies and typically leads to chronic disease after superinfection with an accelerated course to cirrhosis or related complications. HEV leading to chronic hepatitis is more common in immunocompromised hosts. Although the hepatotropic viruses (HAV, HBV, HCV, HDV, HEV) may cause disease in all exposed individuals, the nonhepatotropic viruses (ie, HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, EBV, CMV) typically have self-limited courses that may include a mild hepatitis caused by the immune systemâ€™s response to the virus at the time of primary infection. For immunocompromised hosts, the risk of clinical disease from the nonhepatotropic viruses is typically at the time of reactivation, with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality.</p>
