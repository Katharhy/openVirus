<p id="p0215">Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection may be asymptomatic or lead to a mononucleosislike syndrome, with an estimated 64% of adults having evidence of prior CMV infection by 50Â years of age.

 </xref> In solid organ transplant recipients, CMV infection is associated with increased death and graft loss, particularly within the first year of transplant.

 </xref> In these cases, CMV hepatitis may be difficult to differentiate from graft rejection. CMV may also lead to a multisystemic disease with end-organ involvement including cytopenias, pneumonitis, colitis, retinitis, myocarditis, and encephalitis. Although CMV IgM may be checked as a marker of acute infection in immunocompetent individuals, serologies are not reliable in immunocompromised hosts. CMV PCR or immunostaining of liver tissue is needed for diagnosis. Preemptive antiviral therapy with valganciclovir has been recommended for SOT recipients at risk, particularly those with no evidence of prior CMV exposure (ie, CMV IgG is negative) who receive allografts from CMV IgG-positive donors.

 </xref> Oral valganciclovir or intravenous ganciclovir may be used to treat CMV hepatitis depending on the severity of illness.
