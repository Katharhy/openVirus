<p id="p0210">EBV infection after liver transplant has been associated with posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), particularly in cases that occur in the first 18 months after transplant.

 </xref> Risk factors for PTLD within the first year of transplant include primary EBV infection, use of antilymphocyte antibodies, younger age at transplant, and transplant of the intestine, lung, or heart. Risk factors for PTLD after the first year of transplant include longer duration of immunosuppression and older age at transplant.

 </xref> Symptoms of PTLD are similar to other lymphoproliferative disorders, including malaise, fevers, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy. Diagnosis requires biopsy of the affected organ, which is typically an excisional biopsy of an enlarged lymph node. Treatment of PTLD first requires the reduction of immunosuppression, but use of anti-CD20 (anti–cluster of differentiation 20) monoclonal antibodies (ie, rituximab) or other therapies may be needed in more refractory cases.
