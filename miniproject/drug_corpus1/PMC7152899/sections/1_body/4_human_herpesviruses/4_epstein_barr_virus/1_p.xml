<p id="p0205">Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a common infection that causes infectious mononucleosis with fevers, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy. More than 90% of the population has evidence of prior exposure by 20 years of age.

 </xref> Unlike the other herpesviruses, mild hepatitis with hepatomegaly and increased transaminase level typically occurs with EBV infection. However, ALF caused by EBV is less common, accounting for 1 in 500 cases of the Acute Liver Failure Study Group and may occur in young and immunocompetent individuals, unlike the other herpesviruses that typically only lead to ALF in the immunocompromised host.

 </xref> EBV PCR and in situ hybridization of liver tissue can be used to identify the presence of virus, although confirmation of EBV-related hepatitis also requires the appropriate clinical features, including increased transaminase levels with serologies (viral capsid IgG/IgM and Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen antibody and EBV DNA).

 </xref> Virtually all cases of EBV hepatitis are self-limited, but rare cases of severe hepatitis or ALF may require liver transplant.
