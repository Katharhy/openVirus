<p id="p0195">Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) are common infections that cause both oral and genital vesicular lesions. Although immunocompetent individuals can develop disseminated HSV with hepatic involvement, it is more common in immunocompromised states, including pregnancy, HIV infection, and use of immunosuppressant medications. HSV hepatitis, more commonly caused by HSV-2, is less likely to manifest with characteristic mucocutaneous vesicular lesions and typically presents with fever and ALF leading to death or liver transplant in most cases.

 </xref> Diagnosis should be made with HSV DNA by PCR rather than serologies (HSV IgG or IgM) because of the latterâ€™s inaccuracies in acute hepatitis.

 </xref> Liver biopsy may be needed for definitive diagnosis and shows hepatocellular necrosis with intranuclear inclusions and immunostaining for HSV. However, immediate initiation of empiric treatment with intravenous acyclovir is recommended given the severity and potentially rapid progression of disease, including death if treatment is delayed.
