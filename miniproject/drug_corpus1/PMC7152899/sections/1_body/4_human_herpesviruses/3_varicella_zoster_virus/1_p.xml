<p id="p0200">Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is commonly known for causing chickenpox in children at the time of initial infection, and later becoming latent in the dorsal root ganglia with reactivation causing shingles in adults. Transmission occurs via aerosolized nasopharyngeal secretions or direct contact with fluid from vesicular lesions. VZV-associated hepatitis has been rarely reported in the literature but can present similarly to HSV hepatitis.

 </xref> Liver biopsy typically looks similar to HSV hepatitis, although diagnosis is made by checking serum VZV PCR. Similar to HSV, treatment with acyclovir is recommended. In immunocompromised hosts, varicella zoster immune globulin may be considered if known exposure occurs.
