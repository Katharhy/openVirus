 <p>Viral hepatitis can cause a wide spectrum of clinical presentations from a benign form with minimal or no symptoms to acute liver failure or death. Hepatitis D coinfection and superinfection have distinct clinical courses, with the latter more likely leading to chronic infection. Management of chronic hepatitis D virus is individualized because of the paucity of treatment options and significant side effect profile of currently available treatments. Sporadic cases of hepatitis E caused by contaminated meats are becoming increasingly prevalent in immunocompromised hosts. Human herpesviruses are an important cause of disease also in immunocompromised individuals.</p>
