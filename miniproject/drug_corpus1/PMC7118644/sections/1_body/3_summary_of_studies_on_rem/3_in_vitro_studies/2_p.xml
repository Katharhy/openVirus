<p id="p0045">The majority of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> efficacy studies conducted to date have reported positive results on the anti-CoV activity of remdesivir and GS-441524 (
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Commonly used metrics in these studies are the half maximal effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>), which is the drug concentration at which half of the maximum response is attained after exposure, or the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>), which is the drug concentration at which half of the peak inhibiting effect of the drug against a specific viral function is achieved. Lower EC
 <sub>50</sub> and IC
 <sub>50</sub> values indicate higher potency. Typical outcomes measured in such studies include the amount of viral RNA (
 <italic>e.g.</italic>, copies of certain open reading frames) in the culture, the number of virus-infected cells in the culture, or changes in viral replication rates.
