<p id="p0085">In a field trial of treatment with GS-441524 for naturally occurring FIP, Pedersen et al. treated 31 cats with an initial dose of 2 mg/kg daily [
 <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Within the first week of treatment, 4 cats (13%) with severe disease died or were euthanized, a fifth cat died after 26 days, and another was euthanized about 2-weeks post relapse due to the development of neurological signs and a lack of response to treatment. The remaining cats completed at least 12 weeks of treatment, but 8 experienced relapses requiring re-treatment with GS-441524. Dose escalation from 2 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg daily was required for 5 cats. A total of 25 treated cats (81%) survived FIP for at least 44 weeks of follow up, indicating that GS-441524 (and presumably, its prodrug remdesivir) is also a promising therapeutic candidate for treatment of alphacoronavirus-related disease in cats. Most cats in this study had “wet” or effusive FIP, the hallmark of which is the accumulation of fluids in the abdominal or thoracic cavities. There were only 3 cats in the study with abdominal non-effusive (“dry”) FIP, which is a more chronic condition, and another 4 cats initially had dry FIP that progressed into wet FIP. One cat in the dry FIP group and one in the dry-to-wet group did not survive. Because of the small number of cats with dry FIP, conclusions cannot be drawn about whether remdesivir has greater efficacy in the treatment of some clinical manifestations of FIP than others. A strength of this study is that it was conducted among animals with naturally-occurring CoV infection as a field trial, better representing real-world circumstances.
