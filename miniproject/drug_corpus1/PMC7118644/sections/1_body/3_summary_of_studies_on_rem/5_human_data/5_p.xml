<p id="p0105">Some safety data were formally collected during a clinical trial conducted in the Democratic Republic of Congo that randomized 175 patients to be treated with remdesivir for Ebola [
 <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Incidentally, randomization to remdesivir treatment was discontinued in this trial after an interim analysis showed superior survival for two other trial drugs, despite preclinical and compassionate use data having been favorable for remdesivir against the Ebola virus prior to the trial [
 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Interestingly, patients who received remdesivir had slower rates of viral clearance compared to patients who received single-dose antivirals (specifically, MAb114 and REGN-EB3), which the authors hypothesized may be related to the fact that the treatment plan for remdesivir involved multiple intravenous infusions. However, for now, information on the potential efficacy of remdesivir specifically against CoVs is largely limited to
