<p id="p0095">Human data on remdesivir use for COVID-19 will likely continue to become available from compassionate use cases before the clinical trial is completed. In fact, there are many anecdotal reports already circulating about treatment of COVID-19 patients with remdesivir. According to a recent newspaper article, 17 passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship were treated with intravenous remdesivir for 10Â days and were alive at the time of article release. One of the physicians involved in their treatment, who is affiliated with the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), felt that the patients were less dependent on ventilators after receiving the drug. Nevertheless, no conclusions can be drawn based on such reports.</p>
