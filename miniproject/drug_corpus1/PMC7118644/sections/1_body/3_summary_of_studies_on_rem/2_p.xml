<p id="p0040">The existing studies on the potential antiviral effects of remdesivir that are of highest relevance to the virus underlying the current pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, are those that have been conducted on genetically similar coronaviruses. As discussed above, within the 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family of viruses, there is a substantial amount of genetic heterogeneity, even among human strains [
 <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This genetic diversity is posited to be attributable to the large viral genome and the molecular nuances of the viral RNA replication processes (
 <italic>e.g.</italic>, RdRp infidelity) [
 <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Although remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral, its efficacy against other families of viruses may not be generalizable to its effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2, and attempts to predict the level of potential generalizability are hampered by the possibility that the drug may have secondary mechanisms of action that are yet to be elucidated. As a result, this review focuses on studies of the effects of remdesivir on CoVs specifically; however, some information about research on other lesser related viruses (
 <italic>e.g.</italic>, Ebola) is briefly mentioned for additional context on the drug.
