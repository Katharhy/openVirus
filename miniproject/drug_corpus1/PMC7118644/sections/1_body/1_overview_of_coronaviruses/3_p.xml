Among patients with URIs severe enough to warrant hospitalization, one study found that approximately 5% of cases were attributable to rhinoviruses or HCoVs, but a substantial proportion of these hospitalized patients had underlying pulmonary or cardiac comorbidities that may have exacerbated their conditions [
