<p id="p0015">Although the use of corticosteroids has been reported as a routine treatment of COVID-19 to curtail the inflammation associated with injury [
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], their use is controversial, and validation through clinical trials is highly warranted. Concerning this, a total of 14 clinical trials were initiated till date to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the dexamethasone (a corticosteroid) for the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection (

Recently, dexamethasone was declared as the world's first treatment proven effective in reducing the risks of death among severely ill COVID-19 patients based on the positive results confirmed by the RECOVERY trial (NCT04381936) conducted by Oxford University. The world's largest clinical trial viz. RECOVERY trial, a randomized, controlled, and open-label trial has begun in March 2020 and aimed to investigate several potential COVID-19 treatments on hospitalized patients [

Moreover, dexamethasone has been proven to significantly reduce the mortality risk in COVID-19 patients on ventilation and oxygen by as much as 35% and 20%, respectively. After that, the dexamethasone has been authorized by the UK government for the treatment of critically ill COVID-19 patients. However, no clinical benefits were seen in patients with mild, moderate, and hospitalized COVID-19 patients, not on oxygen or ventilation [
