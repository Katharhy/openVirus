Moreover, dexamethasone is approved by the FDA as a broad-spectrum immunosuppressant and reported to be about 30 times more active than cortisone with an added advantage of longer duration of action. Furthermore, dexamethasone is suggested to limit the production of inflammatory cytokines and their damaging effect. However, inhibition of T cells functions and blockage of B cells from making immunoglobulins may potentially lead to an increase in plasma viral load, which is a primary concern and needs further investigation [
