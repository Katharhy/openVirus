<p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital (KMUHIRB-EXEMPT(I) 20200011). Because participation was voluntary and survey responses were anonymous, the IRB ruled that this study did not require informed consent. Our study respondents were given no incentive for participation. We provided links to COVID-19 information from the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC), Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, and Medical College of National Cheng Kung University for respondents to learn more about COVID-19.</p>
