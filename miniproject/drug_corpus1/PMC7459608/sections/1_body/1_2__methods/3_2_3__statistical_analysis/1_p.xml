<p>Data analysis was performed using the statistical software SPSS (version 22.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). We noted the percentages of participants reporting no change, an increase, and a decrease for changes in each aspect of their sex life. The associations of changes in each aspect of sex life with sexual orientation, gender, age, risk perception of COVID-19, and general anxiety were examined using multivariate logistic regression. The 
 <italic>p</italic> value, odds ratio (OR), and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to indicate significance. A two-tailed 
 <italic>p</italic> value of &lt;0.05 indicated statistical significance. Moreover, the moderators of the associations between sexual orientation and changes in sex life were examined based on the criteria proposed by Baron and Kenny [
