<p>General anxiety in the past 1 week was measured using a previously validated state anxiety scale from the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory wherein respondents rate their feelings in response to 10 general statements; these statements inquire into feelings of being rested, contented, comfortable, relaxed, pleasant, anxious, nervous, jittery, highly strung, and over-excited and “rattled” [

 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-17-05822" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Each question was rated as 1 (not at all), 2 (sometimes), 3 (moderately so), and 4 (very much so). Statements reflecting positive feelings were reversely coded. A higher total score of the 10 items represented greater general anxiety. The Cronbach’s α was 0.921 for this measure.
