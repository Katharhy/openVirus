<p>To measure risk perception of COVID-19, we used the 5-item questionnaire that was developed by Liao and colleagues to measure worry toward H1N1 influenza [
 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-17-05822" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The first question was “If you were to develop flu-like symptoms tomorrow, you would be ___,” where respondents filled in the blank with a number from 1 (not at all worried) to 5 (extremely worried). The second question was “In the past 1 week, have you ever worried about getting COVID-19?” This question was scored from 1 (no, I have never thought about it) to 5 (I worry about it all the time). The third question was “Please rate the current level of your worry toward COVID-19.” This question was rated from 1 (very mild) to 10 (very severe). The fourth question was “How likely do you think it is that you will contract COVID-19?” This question was scored from 1 (never) to 7 (certain). The fifth question was “What do you think are your chances of getting COVID-19 over the next 1 month compared with others outside your family?” This question was rated from 1 (not at all) to 7 (certain). The scores for the first two, the third, and the last two questions were divided by 5, 10, and 7, respectively. These five quotients were then summed to obtain a score representing the level of risk perception of COVID-19, with higher scores indicating greater risk perception. Cronbach’s α was 0.759 for this measure.
