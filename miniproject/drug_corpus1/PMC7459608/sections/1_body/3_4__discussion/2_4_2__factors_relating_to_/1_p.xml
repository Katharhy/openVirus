<p>The present study found that risk perception, general anxiety, gender, age, and sexual orientation related to various aspects of changes in sex life during the COVID-19 pandemic. Firstly, a higher risk perception of COVID-19 was significantly associated with decreased frequencies of sexual activity and sex-seeking activities. Because in-person sexual contact carries the risk of COVID-19 transmission [

However, Leung et al. noted that the self-perceived likelihood of contracting or surviving SARS did not predict personal protective behavior [

In addition to sexual inactivity as a personal protective behavior, other reasons may also account for the association between risk perception of COVID-19 and the decreased frequencies of sexual activity and sex-seeking activities. People who perceive a high risk of COVID-19 tend to invest greater time and effort to learning more about pandemic prevention and using facemasks and disinfectant alcohol. Moreover, as with governments in many other countries, the Taiwanese government has suspended the sex industry to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This policy may have led people with a high risk perception of COVID-19 to perceive having sex in general as being unsafe during the pandemic. These personal and environmental factors may have contributed to the decreased frequencies of sexual activity and sex-seeking activities during the pandemic.
