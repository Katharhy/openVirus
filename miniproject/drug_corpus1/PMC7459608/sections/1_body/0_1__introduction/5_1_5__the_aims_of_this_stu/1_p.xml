<p>The online survey study on COVID-19 in Taiwan was conducted to assess the life experiences of people in Taiwan during the COVID-19 outbreak. The survey examined changes in sex life, including satisfaction with the individualâ€™s sex life, frequency of sexual activity, frequency of sex-seeking activity, and frequency of using protection for sex. The present study used data from this survey to examine three issues. First, we compared changes in sex life prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, we examined the associations of gender, age, sexual orientation, risk perception of COVID-19, and general anxiety with changes in sex life. Third, we determined what the moderators are in the associations between the aforementioned factors and changes in sex life.</p>
