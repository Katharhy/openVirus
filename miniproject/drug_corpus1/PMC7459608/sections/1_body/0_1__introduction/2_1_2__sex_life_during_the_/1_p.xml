 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-17-05822" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. According to the World Health Organization, sexual health is a state of physical, mental, and social well-being in relation to sexuality [
 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-17-05822" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; sexuality is influenced by the interaction of biological, psychological, social, economic, political, cultural, legal, historical, religious, and spiritual factors [
 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-17-05822" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Accordingly, it is reasonable to hypothesize that sex life would be deeply influenced by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on personal and environmental levels. Regarding the personal level, all forms of in-person sexual contact carry the risk of viral transmission [
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-17-05822" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. People may abstain from sexual intercourse because they fear contracting COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely influence individuals’ mental and physical health [

Regarding the environmental level, the pandemic prevention measures of social distancing may jeopardize an individual’s sex life. Governments of many countries ordered to close down gathering spaces and promote social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Not being able to physically meet with others may change people’s sexual habits [
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-17-05822" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A social atmosphere of collective anxiety about the COVID-19 pandemic may also result in detriment of the mood to enjoy sex. Conversely, Yuksel and Ozgor proposed people may spend more time at home during the COVID-19 pandemic and therefore increase the frequency of sexual behaviors with their partners [
