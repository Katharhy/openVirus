<p>In addition to gender and age, sexual orientation should also be analyzed as an influence on changes in sex life during epidemics. A study hypothesized that in times of a pandemic when people are particularly susceptible to mental health difficulties, messaging that frames sex as being dangerous has adverse psychological effects [

Considering the historical trauma of the AIDS epidemic, sexual minority individuals may voluntarily or involuntarily restrict their sex life. In addition to sexual stigma, sexual minority individuals may experience more severe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on their daily lives. A study on 1051 men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States found that most of the participants had no change in condom access or use, many participants had adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic to general wellbeing, social interactions, money, food, drug use, and alcohol consumption; especially many reported fewer sex partners and COVID-19-related barriers to HIV and sexually transmitted diseases testing, pre-exposure prophylaxis access, and HIV treatment [
