 <xref rid="ijerph-17-05822-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> presents the multivariate logistic regression results for the associations of changes in each aspect of sex life (dependent variables) with sexual orientation, gender, age, risk perception of COVID-19, and general anxiety (independent variables). The results indicated that decreased satisfaction with sex life was significantly associated with being male, being a sexual minority, and having a higher level of general anxiety; no factor was significantly associated with increased satisfaction with sex life. Regarding frequency of sexual activity, decreased frequency was significantly associated with being male, being a sexual minority, having a higher risk perception of COVID-19, and having greater general anxiety; increased frequency was significantly associated with being male, being younger, and having a lower risk perception of COVID-19.
