<p id="p0075">Many of the nsps subsequently form replicase-transcriptase complex (RTC) in double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), which are mainly an assembly by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)- and helicase-containing subunits, the canonical RdRp domain residing of CoV nsp 12 and AV nsp9. Furthermore, the complex transcribes an endogenous genome template of viral entry to negative-sense genes of both the progeny genome and subgenomic RNA as intermediate products and followed by transcription to positive-sense mRNAs that are mainly mediated by RdRp [
