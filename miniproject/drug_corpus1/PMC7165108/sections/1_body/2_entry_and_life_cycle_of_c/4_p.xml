<p id="p0070">The genomic material released by this virus is mRNA that is ready to be translated into protein. In its genome range, this virus is complemented by about 14 open reading frames (ORF), each of which encodes a variety of proteins, both structural and non-structural that play a role in its survival as well as virulence power. In its phase of transformation, the gene segments that encode nonstructural polyproteins are the ones this process first translates into ORF1a and ORF1
 <italic>b</italic> to produce two large overlapping polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab by contributing a ribosomal frame shifting event [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The polyproteins are supplemented by protease enzymes namely papain-like proteases (PLpro) and a serine type Mpro (chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro)) protease that are encoded in nsp3 and nsp 5. Subsequently, cleavage occurs between pp1a and pp1ab into nonstructural proteins (nsps) 1–11 and 1–16, respectively. The nsps play an important role in many processes in viruses and host cells (
