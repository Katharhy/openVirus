<p id="p0080">Next, the subgenomic proteins become translated into structural and accessories proteins such as M, S, and E proteins that subsequently are insulated in the endoplasmic reticulum and then moved to the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). Meanwhile, the previously replicated genome program can directly join the N protein to the nucleocapsid form and move into the ERGIC. In this compartment, nucleocapsids will meet with several other structural proteins and form small wallet vesicles to be exported out of the cell through exocytosis [
