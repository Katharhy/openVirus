<p id="p0065">After fusion occurs, the type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) that is present on the surface of the host cell will clear the ACE2 and activate the receptor-attached spike-like, S proteins [
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Activation of the S proteins leads to conformational changes and allows the virus to enter the cells [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Both of these proteins (TMPRSS2 and ACE2) are the main determinants of the entry of this virus. Based on the research of Sungnak et al. nasal epithelial cells, specifically goblet/secretory cells and ciliated cells, display the highest ACE2 expression throughout the respiratory tract [
