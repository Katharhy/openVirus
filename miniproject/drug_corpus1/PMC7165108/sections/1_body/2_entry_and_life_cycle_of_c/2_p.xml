<p id="p0060">As a member of the Nidovirus family, coronavirus infection (SARS-CoV2) can be contracted from animals such as bats, and fellow humans. This virus can enter the human body through its receptors, ACE2 which are found in various organs such as heart, lungs, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract, thus facilitating viral entry into target cells. The process of CoV entering into the host cell begins through the attachment of the S glycoprotein to the receptor, the ACE2 in the host cells (such as in type II pneumocytes in the lungs) [
