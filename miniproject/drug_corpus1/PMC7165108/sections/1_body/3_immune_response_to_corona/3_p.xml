<p id="p0090">The entry of the virus into the host cell triggers stimulation of the hostâ€™s immune response, which will first be encountered by innate immune system cells via antigen presenting cells (APC), e.g. dendritic cells and macrophages as frontline of the immune system [

APC have Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRR) including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and other small free molecules that are located in various places in host cells such as plasma membranes, endosomal membrane, lysosomes, endocytolysosomes, and cytosol. They recognize PAMP comprised nucleic acids, carbohydrate moieties, glycoproteins, lipoproteins and other small molecules that are found in the structural components of viruses or intermediate products such as dsRNA and induce cascade signaling to produce immune system cell effectors. Each of the PRRs could induce a different biological response to subsequent protein activation [
