<p id="p0095">For example, Toll like receptor 4 (TLR-4) might recognize the outer component of CoV, the protein spike. Furthermore, through mediation of MyD88, this introduction will trigger the activation of NF-κB transcription factors and the pathogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathway to induce proinflammatory proteins. Meanwhile, activation of endosomal receptors such as TLR-3 and TLR that could recognize the RNA or dsRNA genome of coronavirus leads to recruitment of TRIF adapter protein directly. TRIF subsequently activates the IRF3 and NF-κB transcription factors to induce proinflammatory cytokines such as interferon-α and TNF-β. Although the introduction of PAMP through TLR-4 can also recruit TRIF adapter proteins, the recruitment must be mediated by TRAM and TIRAM [

Furthermore, type I INF in turn will form complexes with its receptors, IFNAR and subsequently activate the JAK-STAT pathways. JAK1 and TYK2 kinases further phosphorylate STAT1 and 2 followed by its complexation with IRF9, and together they migrate into the nucleus to initiate the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and lead to suppression of viral replication and prevent the severity of the disease [

However, excess releasing of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, IL-33, TNF-α, TGFβ, and chemokines CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10 from immune effector cells causes hyperinflammation which will eventually lead to ARDS [
