<p id="p0100">As the presenter of foreign antigens, the APC will present the antigen of CoV to the CD4 + T-helper cells by MHC class 1, and this leads to releasing of IL-12 as a co-stimulatory molecule to further stimulate the Th1 cell activation. In addition to Th1 stimulation, releasing of interleukin-12 and IFN-α, an increase in MHC Class I expression and NK cell activation is also needed for resistance of viral replication for the eradication of virus-infected cells. It also initiates production of proinflammatory cytokines via the NF-κB signaling pathway. IL-17 is a proinflammatory cytokine that also is increased when SARS-CoV2 infection occurs. These cytokines further recruit neutrophils and monocytes to the site of infection and activate several other pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-21, TNF-β, and MCP-1 [
