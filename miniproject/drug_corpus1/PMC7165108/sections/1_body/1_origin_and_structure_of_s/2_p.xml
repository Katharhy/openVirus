<p id="p0040">A sample isolation from pneumonia patients who were some of the workers in the Wuhan seafood market found that strains of SARS-CoV-2 had a length of 29.9 kb [
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Structurally, SARS-CoV-2 has four main structural proteins including spike (S) glycoprotein, small envelope (E) glycoprotein, membrane (M) glycoprotein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein, and also several accessory proteins [
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The spike or S glycoprotein is a transmembrane protein with a molecular weight of about 150 kDa found in the outer portion of the virus. S protein forms homotrimers protruding in the viral surface and facilitates binding of envelope viruses to host cells by attraction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressed in lower respiratory tract cells. This glycoprotein is cleaved by the host cell furin-like protease into 2 sub units namely S1 and S2. Part S1 is responsible for the determination of the host virus range and cellular tropism with the receptor binding domain make-up while S2 functions to mediate virus fusion in transmitting host cells [
