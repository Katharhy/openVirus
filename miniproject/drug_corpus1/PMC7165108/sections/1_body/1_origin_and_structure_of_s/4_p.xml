<p id="p0050">Another important part of this virus is the membrane or M protein, which is the most structurally structured protein and plays a role in determining the shape of the virus envelope. This protein can bind to all other structural proteins. Binding with M protein helps to stabilize nucleocapsids or N proteins and promotes completion of viral assembly by stabilizing N protein-RNA complex, inside the internal virion. The last component is the envelope or E protein which is the smallest protein in the SARS-CoV structure that plays a role in the production and maturation of this virus [
