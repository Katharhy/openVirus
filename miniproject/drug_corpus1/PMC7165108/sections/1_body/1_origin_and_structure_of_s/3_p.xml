<p id="p0045">The nucleocapsid known as N protein is the structural component of CoV localizing in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi region that structurally is bound to the nucleic acid material of the virus. Because the protein is bound to RNA, the protein is involved in processes related to the viral genome, the viral replication cycle, and the cellular response of host cells to viral infections [
