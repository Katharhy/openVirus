<p id="p0035">SAR-CoV2 is an enveloped, non-segmented, positive sense RNA virus that is included in the sarbecovirus, ortho corona virinae subfamily which is broadly distributed in humans and other mammals [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Its diameter is about 65–125 nm, containing single strands of RNA and provided with crown-like spikes on the outer surface. SARS-CoV2 is a novel β-coronavirus after the previously identified SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV which led to pulmonary failure and potentially fatal respiratory tract infection and caused outbreaks mainly in Guandong, China and Saudi Arabia. In COVID-19 research, many studies have demonstrated that bats are suspected as the key reservoir of the viruses by finding as much as 96.2% identical genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 with bat CoV RaTG13 [

In this review, we hypothesize that since the COVID-19 virus has several complex immune-evasion components that contribute to its virulence, we suggest this more complete understanding can be used to develop an effective approach in the treatment of diseases caused by this virus.
