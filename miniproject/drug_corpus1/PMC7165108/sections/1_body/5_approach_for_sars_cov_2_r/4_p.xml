<p id="p0140">Spike or S protein-based vaccine is one approach to developing vaccines that has attracted the attention of many researchers in the discovery of the coronavirus vaccine. S protein has an RBD located in the S1 subunit of the virus that facilitates entry of the virus into the host cell by binding to its receptors on the host cell, ACE2. Furthermore, the existence of mapping and genomic characterization of these proteins has increasingly answered the puzzle in the development of this vaccine [

Research by Yang et al. that used combined DNA demonstrated protein S could activate the immune response through T cell production that subsequently form antibodies which can neutralize the virus in mice. Another study shown that this strategy was effective to elicit protective immunity producing neutralizing antibodies in mice [

Further studies with closely similar results conducted by Gao et al. and He et al. that used reconstructed vaccine which originated from S1 fragment of SARS-CoV revealed that it could stimulate immune response and induce highly potent neutralizing antibodies to blocking S protein binding and prevent SARS-CoV entry [
