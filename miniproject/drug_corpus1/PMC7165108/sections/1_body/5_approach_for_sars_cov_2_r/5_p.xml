<p id="p0145">In addition, through recent developments in vaccine-based therapy for cancers and other diseases, therapeutic development efforts also focus on drug discovery that can stop the spread and replication of the virus in the host cell that is intended for patients who have already contracted an infection. These include camostat mesylate which is a serine protease inhibitor that can inhibit the performance of TMPRSS2 enzyme activity in the coronavirus entry process. This drug has been used clinically in the treatment of chronic pancreatitis so that it is considered to be a potential therapy for COVID-19 treatment [
