 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The strategy can be applied to various processes, both at the time of introduction (before entering the cell) and when it has entered the host cell. During the recognition process, this virus can use avoidance strategies through the formation of double vesicles on the outside of the cell. The formation of these vesicles causes shield recognition of cytosolic PRRs to dsRNA as an intermediate product of replication virus [
