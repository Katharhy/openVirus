<p id="p0120">In addition to the formation of a double vesicle, this virus has 8 proteins capable of avoiding the immune system through the blocking of INF. Nsp1 is a non-structural group of proteins from SARS-CoV that can suppress the work of INF–I through host translational machinery inactivation, RNA-Host degradation and inhibition of phosphorylation of STAT1. The mechanism could cause INF–I failure to induce replication and dissemination of viruses at an early stage and leads to increased severity of disease [

The composition of the viral RNA genome including SARS-CoV which has a 5 ′cap less than the host cell RNA makes it easy for immune system cells to recognize its presence and induce an immune response. To get around this, the virus developed a strategy of mimicking the host capping machinery. This strategy employs two non-structural proteins namely nsp 14 which initiates cap formation, and subsequently follows modifying the cap of viral RNAs by nsp 16 so that RNA viral seems similar to host cell RNA and avoids any PRRs recognition [
