<p>In the acute phase of SARS-CoV infection, rapid reduction of lymphocytes in peripheral blood [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], mainly T lymphocytes, was observed, and both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes were decreased. The loss of lymphocytes precedes even the abnormal changes on the chest X-ray [
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. After a one-year follow-up of SARS patients, CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells recovered rapidly during the disease recovery period. CD8+ T lymphocytes, which returned to normal within 2–3 months after onset. The memory CD4+ T cells returned to normal a year after onset, whereas other cell counts including total T lymphocytes, CD3+ cells, CD4+ cells, and naive CD4+ T cells were still lower than healthy controls [

The increase in lymphocytes during recovery is not new cells produced by the thymus, but lymphocyte recirculation between peripheral blood and tissues or organs [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. SARS-specific IgG antibodies are produced in the late acute stage about 2 weeks and gradually increase with the course of the disease [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The sustainable existence of IgG makes the patients acquire the immune function after infection. Recovering patients have high and sustained levels of S protein-specific neutralizing antibody responses, which may play an important role in determining disease outcome [
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The IgG level of mild patients was significantly higher than that of severe patients. In the course of disease progression, patients may be accompanied by increased IL-8 and TNF-α levels, which peak in the early stage of recovery, while MCP-1 shows a rapid increase in the early acute stage and gradually decreases with the progress of the disease. Based on the above findings, it is proposed to treat the disease with a low-dose of glucocorticoid for less than 2 weeks in the early stage of the disease, so that the symptoms of most severe patients are well controlled [
