<p>Based on the above assumptions, the clinical phase is divided into three: the viremia phase, the acute phase (pneumonia phase) and the recovery phase. If the immune function of patients in the acute phase (pneumonia phase) is effective, and no more basic diseases, the virus can be effectively suppressed, then enter the recovery phase. If the patient is older, or in an immune impaired state, combined with other basic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, the immune system cannot effectively control the virus in the acute phase (pneumonia phase), the patient will become severe or critical type. As we mentioned in our hypothesis, T cells, B cells were further reduced, while inflammatory cytokines and D-Dimer continued to increase in severe type patients (
