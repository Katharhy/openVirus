<p>COVID-19 does not have specific antiviral drug treatment currently, so the treatment of the disease is mainly focused on symptomatic treatment and oxygen therapy. Inflammatory factors and lymphocyte subsets are recommended to be monitored during the disease. We suggest that IVIg and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) anticoagulant therapy could be given as early as possible when T cells, B cells, inflammatory cytokines, and D-Dimer show the following trends: T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes in peripheral blood are significantly lower than before; inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 are increased significantly; coagulation parameters such as D-Dimer increased abnormally; Chest CT indicates the expansion of lung lesions. In our recommendation, high-dose IVIg at 0.3–0.5 g per kg weight per day could be given for 5 days, which can interrupt the storm of inflammatory factors at an early stage, enhance immune function. A randomized controlled clinical trial of IVIg in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection has been initiated (NCT 04261426). Although IVIG has shown efficacy in the treatment of patients with influenza [
