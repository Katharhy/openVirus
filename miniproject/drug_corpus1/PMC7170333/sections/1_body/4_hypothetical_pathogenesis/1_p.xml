<p>Based on the published literature and clinical observations of COVID-19 patients, we propose reasonable hypotheses about the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. The virus might pass through the mucous membranes, especially nasal and larynx mucosa, then enters the lungs through the respiratory tract. The early most common symptoms of infection are fever and cough [
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The virus may enter the peripheral blood from the lungs, causing viremia. Then the virus would attack the targeting organs that express ACE2, such as the lungs, heart, renal, gastrointestinal tract [
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The SARS-CoV-2 detected in the fecal samples [
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] is more likely because the virus enters the blood from the lungs and then travels from the blood to the intestines, which supports our hypothesis. Dawei Wang et al found that the median time from symptom onset to ARDS was about 8 days [
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We speculate that in this way, the virus begins a second attack, causing the patient's condition to aggravate around 7–14 days after onset. During the infection process, the white blood cell count in peripheral blood in the early stage of the disease is normal or slightly low [
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and lymphopenia is observed in patients [
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We speculate that B lymphocyte reduction may occur early in the disease, which may affect antibody production in the patient. In severe type patients, lymphocytes were significantly reduced [
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We speculate that lymphocytes in patients with COVID-19 might gradually decrease as the disease progress. But the mechanism of significant lymphocyte reduction in severe type patients remains unclear. Besides, the inflammatory factors associated with diseases mainly containing IL-6 [
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] were significantly increased, which also contributed to the aggravation of the disease around 7–14 days after onset. Non-survivors had higher levels of neutrophils, D-Dimer, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine than the survivors [
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].
