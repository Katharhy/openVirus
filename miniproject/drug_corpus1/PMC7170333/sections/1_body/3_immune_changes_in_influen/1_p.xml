<p>Different from the disappearance of MERS and SARS, the influenza pandemic (H1N1) in 2009 been incorporated into seasonal strains. However, the influenza pandemic (H1N1) has a relatively high mortality rate [

 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The influenza genome contains 8 segments and is capable of both antigenic drift and shift, making small nucleotide mutations and the exchange of genome segments respectively. Due to these characteristics, novel antigens never existed in the human population to make seasonal epidemics possible.
