<p>A previously unknown coronavirus (MERS-CoV) which isolated from a patient in 2012 [
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and caused high mortality rates in family-based and hospital-based outbreaks [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], was similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The genomic structures of the two viruses are very similar, both single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses, but when they enter host cells, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV attach to different receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4(DDP4) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) respectively [
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Besides, the clinical manifestations of MERS-CoV infection, like SARS-CoV, range from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and multi-organ failure resulting in death [
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Though the clinical pathogenesis have not been explained clearly, a retrospective study [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] comparing 45 patients in South Korea has suggested that a decreasing number of peripheral lymphocyte (lymphopenia as an absolute lymphocyte count lower than 1,000 cells/mm3), thrombocytopenia (platelet count lower than 150000 cells/mm3) and high CRP level could predict pneumonia development and progression to respiratory failure at the early course of the disease. This result is supported by evidence of the report by Min et al. [
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Whereas it should be noteworthy that lymphopenia in MERS infection is not significant as SARS patients [
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and research found that except immunosuppression state and concomitant infection, age was the only predictor [
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].
