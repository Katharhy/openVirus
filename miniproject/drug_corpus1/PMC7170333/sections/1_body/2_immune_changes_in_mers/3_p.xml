<p>Zhao, J et al. [
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] found that during the convalescent phase, neutralizing (PRNT50) antibody titers measured in vitro predicted serum protective ability in infected mice and correlated with CD4 but not CD8+ T cell responses. And in their experiment, the CD4+ T cells were phenotypically effector memory (CD45RA−CCR7−) cells, while the virus-specific CD8+ T cell populations were half effector (CD45RA-CCR7−) cells and half CD45RA+CCR7− cells. Persistent and gradual increases of lymphocyte responses after symptom onset in MERS patients may be required for effective immune responses against MERS-CoV, but whether the CTL turnover and what the effect these cells provide still need further research.
