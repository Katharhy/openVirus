<p>Concerning MERS-CoV T cell responses, within two weeks after the onset of symptoms (acute phase), besides pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine secretion, such as interleukin (IL)-6 and C-X-C motif chemokine (CXCL)-8 [
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], high frequencies of MERS-CoV-reactive CD8+ T cells were observed in patients with severe/moderate illness, which before the detection of humoral and CD4+ T cell responses. During the convalescent phase, the magnitude of the CD8+ T cell response was not greatly augmented [

This result indicates that the inefficient control of invading MERS-CoV brings about robust inflammatory and CTL responses, which play a vital role in clearing the virus. Further, PBMCs obtained on day 24 after illness onset shows a strong specific T-cell response against the MERS-CoV S protein [
