<p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) have been on the top news again after the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome(MERS-CoV) outbreak in Saudi Arabia and south korea [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], since a new Coronavirus occurred in Wuhan, Hubei province and quickly spread across over whole China and other 30 countries. Up to date (25 February 2020), there are approximately 80000 infectious patients confirmed and caused above 2500 death [
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], which need urgent viral infection identification and intervention as early as possible. Although nucleic acid testing played an utmost part in the detection of the viral genome sequence [
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], over-hypersensitivity and dependence on sampling may lead to some degree of false-positive or false-negative in the clinic. Despite several types of research have been conducted to practical treatments or any possible medicines, the consensus has not recommended any antiviral medicine [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It has been confirmed that the immune system played a vital role in defense against SARS-CoV and MERS infection. Immune changes in patients with SARS [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], MERS [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and influenza [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], especially changes in peripheral blood T lymphocyte subsets, contribute to understanding the characteristics, diagnosis, monitoring, prevention and treatment of the disease.
