  <p>A proposed pathway for inducing cytokine storm following SARS-Cov-2 infection. SARS CoV-2 virus uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor for entering the cells. After entering to type II alveolar epithelial cells of the lungs, SARS CoV-2 triggers life-threatening cytokine release in the host, which can result in excessive levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines production including IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β. Type II AEC, type II alveolar epithelial cells; RBC, red blood cells; IL, interleukin; TNF α, tumor necrosis factor α; IFN-γ, interferon-gamma; GCSF, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor; IP-10, interferon γ-induced protein; MCP1, monocyte chemo-attractant protein 1; MIP, macrophage inflammatory proteins; Th, T helper.</p>
