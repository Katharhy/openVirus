<p id="p0065">TNFα is another main cytokine in many inflammatory diseases. The elevated level of TNFα in blood and tissues of patients with COVID-19 has been indicated in previous reports (

 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). The potential role of anti-TNF therapy has been considered recently for reducing inflammation in COVID-19. Some anti-TNF antibodies such as infliximab or adalimumab have been suggested for modulating hyper-inflammatory responses in patients with COVID-19. Based on clinical recent studies, TNF blockade, as an amplifier of inflammation, causes a rapid reduction in IL-6 and IL-1 concentrations (
