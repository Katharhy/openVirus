<p id="p0060">Anakinra (recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist: IL-1Ra) is another therapeutic option with IL-1 blockade properties. A group of American researchers suggested that continuous intravenous Anakinra infusions might have significant survival benefits owing to possibly reversing the cytokine storm in patients with COVID-19 (

 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) claimed that the administration of Anakinra intravenously at a dose of 2.0 mg/kg/h for 72 h could significantly reduce the 28 d mortality in 484 patients with severe sepsis. Though the exact role of IL-1 in the pathogenesis of CSS is unclear, it seems that IL-1 receptor blockade may aid in better control of the inflammatory process. According to the previous reports, Anakinra is a biopharmaceutical drug with a wide therapeutic range, and high safety (
