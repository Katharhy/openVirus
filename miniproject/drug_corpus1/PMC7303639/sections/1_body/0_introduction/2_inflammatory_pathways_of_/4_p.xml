<p id="p0040">In another study, Huang C, et al. (
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) reported that the plasmatic concentration of IL-2, IL-7, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (GCSF), interferon γ-induced protein 10 kDa (IP-10), monocyte chemo-attractant protein 1 (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory proteins (MIP), and TNF-α were higher in 41 admitted severe patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan. Interestingly, they found that SARS-CoV-2 infection also initiated an increased secretion of Th2-related cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-10 for suppressing hyper-inflammation. The same researchers in another multicenter cohort study reported an increased concentration of IL-6 in non-survival group of patients with COVID-19 (
