<p id="p0030">According to recent studies, SARS-CoV-2 stimulates innate and adaptive immune systems after binding to type II alveolar epithelial cells of the lung; the over-stimulated response of the immune system may cause more damage to the host cells than the SARS-CoV-2 as a foreign invader (
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Toll-like receptors (TLRs), a subfamily of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), can recognize “danger signals” such as SARS-CoV-2 viruses in the extracellular milieu and endosomes and mediate the inflammatory signaling cascade that leads to the activation and production of inflammatory cytokines (
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Inflammasomes are multi-protein cytosolic molecular platforms comprised of caspase-1, Nod-like receptors (NLRs; i.e., NLRP1, NLRP3, and NLRC4) and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (Caspase activating and recruitment domain or ASC) adaptor protein (
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The cleavage and secretion of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into bioactive cytokines, caused by the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, is a powerful determinant in the inflammatory status (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). On the other hand, TLR activation following a viral infection can induce the production of IL-6 by monocytes and macrophages. TLRs, TNFα, and IL-1β are known as the main stimulators for the synthesis of IL-6 (

 <sup>+</sup> T helper cells), which may serve as pro-inflammatory self-reactive T cells (
