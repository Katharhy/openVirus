   <bold>a</bold> Semi-thin transverse section of the sural nerve. Early Wallerian degeneration; no rarefaction of myelinated fibers, but presence of numerous axonal lesions (ovoids) which are composed of disintegrated myelin segments and disrupted axons (arrows). 
   <bold>b</bold> Electron microscopy transverse section of the sural nerve. Several ovoids (0); in unmyelinated Schwann cell cytoplasms, many axons have disappeared leaving empty bands of Schwann cells (arrow)
