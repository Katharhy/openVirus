However, the same patients also usually had at least one additional presenting symptom such as fever, lower limb swelling, vomiting, abdominal pain, or difficulty in breathing. All these findings suggested the presence of PN related to nutrition against a backdrop of other possible environmental factors such as infections, metabolic disorders, or exposure to unknown toxin [
