<p id="Par30">There are many examples of outbreaks of PN due to hexacarbon solvents (such as n-hexane and methyl-n-butyl-kenone), first observed in Japan in the 1960’s then in Europe and the US. Hexacarbon exposure leads to subacute-chronic dying-back PN, sometimes with giant axons and demyelinating signs on nerve biopsy (Fig.
