In the Middle East and Egypt, lead was used 6000 years ago, and lead toxicity was recognized since at least 2000 BC with endemic “
 <italic>chronic plumbism</italic>” (the main reported manifestations being colic, anemia and gout, although neurological manifestations are usual). This was also observed by the ancient Greeks and Romans, the latter being the first mass distributors of lead (using it for cooking utensils and pots, wine urns, plumbing and aqueducts, etc.) [

 <italic>colic</italic>” during the Middle Ages, and lead poisoning was considered as a “
 <italic>plague</italic>” in Europe and America between the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries [
