<p id="Par27">Nicander of Colophonius (second century BC) was probably the first to report lead paralysis, and Paracelsus (1493–1541) wrote about “
 <italic>morbis metallicis</italic>”, but the first detailed clinical descriptions of lead paralysis were made by Louis Tanquerel des Planches (1810–1862) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] then Augusta Dejerine-Klumpke (1859–1927) in the second half of the nineteenth century [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Lead paralysis may be focal or generalized: for the focal forms, the most common one affects the upper limbs, usually first beginning by involving common extensors of the fingers, giving the classical aspect of a patient “
 <italic>making the horns</italic>”, as described by Duchenne de Boulogne [
