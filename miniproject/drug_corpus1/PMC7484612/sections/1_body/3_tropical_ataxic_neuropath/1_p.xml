<p id="Par23">Between 1883 and 1897, Henry Strachan (Senior Medical Officer in Jamaica) observed 510 cases of “
 <italic>a form of multiple neuritis prevalent in the West Indies</italic>” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. characterized by “
 <italic>numbness</italic> and 
 <italic>burning heat in the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet</italic>”, often “
 <italic>accompanied by cramps</italic>”; hyperpigmentation of the skin was also sometimes observed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. “
 <italic>Impaired vision and hearing</italic>”, “
 <italic>extreme wasting of the muscular system</italic>” (involvement of lower then upper extremities, claw hand deformity, depressed deep tendon reflexes) and sensory deficits were observed in the more advanced stage of the disease (sometimes with respiratory impairment) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The enigmatic “
 <italic>Strachan’s syndrome</italic>” (or “
 <italic>Strachan</italic>-
 <italic>Scott syndrome</italic>”) was characterized pathologically by variable combinations of damage to the anterior horns and posterior columns of the spinal cord, peripheral nerves (predominantly the sensory nerves; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), optic nerves and cochlear nerves [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Called “
 <italic>tropical ataxic neuropathy</italic>” (TAN) in 19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] it is characterized by predominantly sensory ataxic polyneuropathy, the cases with predominant spastic paraplegia nowadays being ascribed to “
 <italic>Konzo</italic>” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. A longstanding condition in the Caribbean, but other cases have been reported in Africa, Asia and Latin America (including European prisoners of war) during the twentieth century [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Its nutritional origin was suggested since 1911, and thiamine/riboflavin deficiency was proposed in 1959 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. But a role of the consumption of roots of cassava (
 <italic>Manihot esculenta</italic>), one of the largest source of carbohydrates in the tropics, was also suspected since 1930: so the chronic, monotonous consumption of cassava meals associated with minimal protein supplementation was proposed to explain TAN [
