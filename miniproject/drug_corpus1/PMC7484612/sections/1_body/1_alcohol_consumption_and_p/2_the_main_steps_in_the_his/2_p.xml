<p id="Par16">Etienne Lancereaux (1829–1910) was the first to thoroughly study “
 <italic>alcoholic paralysis</italic>”, giving more details on the pathological lesions of the nervous system and being the first to suggest a link between it and his observed alterations of peripheral nerves [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Emile Théodore Leudet (1825–1887) also studied many cases of “
 <italic>alcoholic paralysis</italic>” associated with “
 <italic>motor incoordination</italic>” (probably in part from cerebellar origin), he thought to be of spinal origin (“
 <italic>spinal paralysis</italic>”); however, he added that “
 <italic>in at least some cases of chronic alcoholism, the peripheral nervous accidents were due to an anatomically demonstrable lesions of these nerve branches</italic>”, as well as in muscles [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The same observation of “
 <italic>drunkard’s”</italic> or “
 <italic>alcoholic paraplegia</italic>” was made in England since 1867 by Samuel Wilks (1824–1911). In 1868, Reginald Edward Thompson (1834–1912) described five patients: autopsy was performed in one case showing “
 <italic>limited swelling of the posterior columns</italic>” of the spinal cord and observing that the peroneal nerve was “
 <italic>diminished in size</italic>” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In 1883, Thomas Robinson Glynn (1841–1931) noted the abolition of the patellar reflexes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In 1884, Carl Franz Moeli (1849–1919) observed pathological lesions of the femoral nerves [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], Walter Baugh Hadden (1856–1893) reported lesions in sciatic nerves (with absent deep tendón reflexes) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and Julius Dreschfeld (1845–1907) observed such lesions in both femoral and sciatic nerves [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The same year, Jean-Martin Charcot (1825–1893) highlighted that such patients also frequently presented vasomotor disturbance of the lower limbs and also sometimes cognitive disorders such as loss of memory [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For the latter, it is probable that Charcot, like Wilks in 18 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>] described some cases of what will be later called Wernicke-Korsakoff’s syndrome, a pathology that was fully detailed as “
 <italic>diffuse encephalitis</italic>” (ophthalmoplegia and drowsiness but no sign of PN) by Charles Gayet (1833–1904) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], “
 <italic>polioencephalitis haemorrhagica superioris</italic>” by Carl Wernicke (1848–1905) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], then “
 <italic>psychosis polyneuritica seu cerebropathia psychica toxoemica</italic>” by Serguei Korsakoff (1864–1900) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] Nowadays, we know that this complex brainstem syndrome (frequently associated with alcohol-induced PN) is caused by thiamine deficiency (Gayet-Wernicke’s encephalopathy) or the combined effects of thiamine deficiency and excessive alcohol consumption (Korsakoff syndrome) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In 1885, William Marc Oettinger (1856–?) clearly considered “
 <italic>alcoholic paralysis</italic>” as “
 <italic>multiple neuritis</italic>” (polyneuropathy) with pathological lesions strictly affecting the peripheral nerves (sparing the spinal cord) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Alfred Gombault (1844–1904) was one of the first to fully study the pathological stages in the peripheral nerves of patients with “
 <italic>alcoholic paralysis</italic>”, showing Wallerian degeneration and rapid destruction of both myelin and axons (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [
