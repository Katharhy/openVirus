<p id="Par17">Alcohol-related PN usually presents as chronic polyneuropathies involving sensory, autonomic, and motor nerves [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Usually classified as a progressive, predominantly sensory axonal length-dependent polyneuropathy (with motor weakness in the more severe forms), acute/subacute PN [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] or small fiber neuropathy were also described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Another special neurological complication of alcohol consumption (even if not the only cause) was described in 1957, sometimes referred as “
 <italic>acrodystrophy of Bureau and Barrière</italic>” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The most important risk factor for alcohol-related PN is the total lifetime dose of ethanol (although other risk factors have been identified: genetic, male gender, and type of alcohol consumed); [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] nutritional deficiency (thiamin, niacin, cobalamine) can also exacerbate alcoholic PN [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The overall prevalence of polyneuropathy (whatever the cause) in the general population is around 1%, rising to 7% in the elderly: [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] the prevalence of alcohol-induced PN is high in chronic alcohol abusers (44.2–46.3%) and represents 10% amongst all patients with PN [
