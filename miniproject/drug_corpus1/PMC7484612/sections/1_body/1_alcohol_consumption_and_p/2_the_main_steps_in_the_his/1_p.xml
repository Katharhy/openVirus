<p id="Par15">It had long been observed that drinking alcoholic beverages may result in mental or physical health problems, including neurological disorders such as sensory deficits, tremors, seizure, delirium tremens or dementia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In 1822, the American physician James Jackson (1777–1867) described, under the term “
 <italic>arthrodynia a potu</italic>”, what could be considered as the first reports of alcohol-induced PN after consumption of ardent spirits, the patients usually presenting symptoms as follows: “
 <italic>It commences with pains in the lower limbs, but especially in the feet, and afterwards extend to the hands and arms</italic>”; “
 <italic>the pain is more severe in the feet and hands, than in the upper parts of the limbs</italic>”; “
 <italic>at length the hands and feet become nearly useless, the flexor muscles manifesting, as in other disease, greater power than the extensors</italic>”. He added that the effect of “
 <italic>abstinence from spirituous liquors of every kind, either in the form of medicine, or in any other form</italic>” is “
 <italic>gradual</italic>” and “
 <italic>great</italic>”, and used also “
 <italic>opium in sufficient quantities to relieve the pain at night and procure sleep</italic>” [

 <italic>the paralysis is to be referred to some affection of the muscles, and not to the nerves, as in common paralytic cases</italic>” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A few years later, having not observed any abnormality by macroscopically studying the peripheral nerves of five patients with chronic alcoholism and neuropathic pain, Huss suggested that the origin of what he described as “
 <italic>hyperesthesic alcoholism</italic>” could be in the spinal cord [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Although Huss mentioned the symmetric pattern of these painful symptoms (described as “
 <italic>tinglings</italic>” and “
 <italic>burning</italic>”), he did not note motor weakness that was mild in his cases [
