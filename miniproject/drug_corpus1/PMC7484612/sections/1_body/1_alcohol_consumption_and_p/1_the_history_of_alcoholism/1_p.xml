<p id="Par14">Since ancient times, alcoholic beverages play an important social role across the globe. The first archaeologic evidence of production and consumption of fermented beverage may go back 13,000 years (Neolithic), cereal-based beer having been developed by the Natufians in the Near East (Israel) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Fermented beverages such as beer and wine were an essential part of the gracious way of life in many ancient civilizations (Egypt, Greece, India, China, Roma, etc.) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and even today. Primitive forms of distillation were developed in ancient Mesopotamia (first millenium BC), and some forms of distilled alcohol were probably known to the ancient Indians and Chinese, as well as ancient Greeks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. There was also evidence of true alcohol distillation (and the discovery of the flammable properties of alcohol vapors) in the Arabian alchemical treatises of the Middle Ages [

 <italic>alcohol</italic>” comes from the Arab “
 <italic>al</italic>-
 <italic>kuḥl</italic>” that means “
 <italic>anti</italic>-
 <italic>monite</italic>” (“
 <italic>stibnite</italic>”): “
 <italic>alcohol</italic>” was then generalized to any powder obtained by triturating a material or any liquid obtained by boiling down (especially “
 <italic>spirit</italic>-
 <italic>of</italic>-
 <italic>wine</italic>”). First regarded as a poison, spirit-of-wine (corresponding to ethanol) was finally considered as a remedy or a global panacea (known as “
 <italic>aqua vitae</italic>” or “
 <italic>ardent spirit</italic>”), given in Europe as an invigorator for workers or soldiers since the Middle Ages (especially since the eleventh century) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The consumption of ardent spirits (more than wine and beer) has led to excess mortality in Europe since the seventeenth century; it then spread throughout the United States after the American Revolutionary War (ARW) where spirits were distributed to the US troops (to combat fatigue): spirits were then adopted by US soldiers who contributed to generalize consumption in the USA after ARW. This excessive consumption became a serious public health problem in both Europe and the USA and, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, American temperance societies were established in which members took a pledge to abstain from drinking distilled beverages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Although the term “
 <italic>alcoholism</italic>” was proposed by the Swedish physician Magnus Huss (1807–1890) in 18 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], the abuse of alcoholic beverages is very old. Since the earliest times, the immoderate use of these beverages has attracted the attention of lawmakers, as observed in ancient Greece when Draco (650–600 BC) punished drunkenness with death, one of the many punishments of the ‘Draconian constitution’ that were finally repealed by Solon (640–558 BC) some years later [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. At the present time, alcohol consumption is still a public health problem in most countries, as mentioned by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2018: “
 <italic>The harmful use of alcohol is one of the leading risk factors for population health worldwide and has a direct impact on many health</italic>-
 <italic>related targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including those for maternal and child health, infectious diseases (HIV, viral hepatitis, tuberculosis), non</italic>-
 <italic>communicable diseases and mental health, injuries and poisonings</italic>”. Worldwide alcohol annual consumption in 2016 was equal to 6.4 L of pure alcohol consumed per person aged &gt; 15 [
