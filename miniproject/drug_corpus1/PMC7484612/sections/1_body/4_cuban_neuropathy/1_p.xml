<p id="Par24">From 1991 to 1993, 50,000 patients were after by the so-called “
 <italic>Cuban neuropathy</italic>” (spreading from West to East of Cuba), characterized by the subacute occurrence of symptoms including retrobulbar optic neuropathy, predominantly sensory PN and dorsolateral myeloneuropathy [

Two types of neuropathy were observed: the optic form (prevalent in men; subacute onset) and a peripheral form, (prevalent in women; predominantly sensory PN, with posterior spinal cord involvement in some cases, with or without concurrent optic neuropathy). Cuban and international scientist proposed a toxic and nutritional hypothesis to explain it (injuries to the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathway, nutritional deficiencies, excitotoxicity, and dysfunction of the blood–brain barrier) [
