<p id="Par19">Despite the fact that beriberi was endemic in many areas over many centuries (especially in Asia, but also in Africa then America; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), its origin was unknown before the turn of the twentieth century. In the seventh century, Son-Shi-Baku thought it was produced by a gaseous poison coming from the ground (under the influence of cold, heat, wind and humidity), penetrating through the feet, up to the legs and then to the rest of the body [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Many cases were also reported as “
 <italic>sailing polyneuritis</italic>” (“
 <italic>nautical beriberi</italic>”) in the European sailboats coming from endemic areas and making long non-stop crossings without replenishing supplies of fresh food [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In 1872, Baron Kanehiro Takaki (1849–1920) entered the Japanese Navy where he observed many fatal cases of beriberi, a subject he became more interested in after 1880, when he came back from a 5-year stay in England where he was a student of William Willis (1837–1894). Although Albrecht Wernich (1843–1896) was probably the first to clearly suggest a causal connection between beriberi and an exclusive diet of rice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], Takaki discovered that 
 <italic>“the nitrogenous substances contained in the food were not sufficient to maintain nitrogen metabolism, but that the food contained too much carbohydrate</italic>” and that “
 <italic>finally, the greater the difference in these proportions</italic> (between nitrogen and carbon) 
 <italic>the more beriberi occurred, and the lesser the difference the less beriberi occurred</italic>” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. From 1884, Takaki eliminated white rice from the Navy’s diet, tested a better balanced nitrogen–carbon diet and observed a dramatic reduction in the number of cases of beriberi (which he mistakenly attributed, 1 year later, to the nitrogen-rich diet) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. When barley (mixed with rice) was introduced into their rations, the toll that beriberi took on Japanese soldiers declined dramatically [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. However, in 1883, while beriberi was still considered by many physicians as an infectious disease, João Batista de Lacerda (1846–1915) thought he found the “
 <italic>Bacillus beribericus</italic>” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], as did Masanori Ogata who claimed he discovered “
 <italic>Micrococcus beribericus</italic>”: this was quickly refuted by Robert Koch (1843–1910) and Shibasaburo Kitasato (1853–1931) who failed to repeat the experiment and concluded that such organisms did not cause beriberi [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The Dutch physician Christiaan Eijkman (1856–1930), was initially convinced that beriberi might be of bacterial origin, and decided to study it in chickens. He accidentally discovered that chickens that were fed polished rice (purchased for the army) developed “
 <italic>polineuritis galliniarium</italic>”, a disease whose symptoms resembled beriberi [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Eijkman and Adolphe Vordermann (1944–1902) thought there was an “
 <italic>anti</italic>-
 <italic>beriberi factor</italic>”, but failed to isolate it [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In 1911, Casimir Funk (1884–1967) finally isolated the substance (from rice husk) he called “
 <italic>amine</italic>” (corresponding to thiamine) and thought there were many other similar substances (essential to life) he called “
 <italic>vitae aminae</italic>” (later shortened in “
 <italic>vitamine</italic>”) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. But only Eijkman was honoured with the Nobel Prize (1929) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] for his work on beriberi [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Nowadays, we know that thiamine deficiency may be observed in other conditions such as chronic alcoholism, persistent vomiting, anorexia, or after bariatric surgery [
