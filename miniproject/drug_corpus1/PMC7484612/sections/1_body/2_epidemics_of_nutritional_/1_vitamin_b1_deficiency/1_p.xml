<p id="Par18">During the first third of the seventeenth century, the Dutch physician Jacobus Bontius (1592–1631) reported on mysterious epidemics of paralysis that natives of India called “
 <italic>beriberi</italic>” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], although John MacGowan (1835–1922) thought it was mentioned under the term “
 <italic>Kioh</italic>-
 <italic>Ki</italic>” in a fundamental treatise on Chinese medicine (“
 <italic>Huángdì Nèijīng)</italic> dating from 2600 BC: a more detailed description of beriberi as “
 <italic>Kak</italic>-
 <italic>ke</italic>” (from the Chinese word “
 <italic>Kiaku</italic>” for “
 <italic>leg</italic>” and “
 <italic>ki</italic>” for “
 <italic>disease</italic>”), appeared in another book (“
 <italic>Sen</italic>-
 <italic>Kin</italic>-
 <italic>ho</italic>”) written by the Chinese physician Son-Shi-Baku (640 AD) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The most commonly accepted hypothesis about the word “
 <italic>beriberi</italic>” is that it would mean “
 <italic>weak, weak</italic>” in Singhalese (from “
 <italic>bhayree</italic>” meaning “
 <italic>weak</italic>”), although alternative explanations were also suggested [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This disease was called “
 <italic>bharbari</italic>” in India and “
 <italic>buhr bari</italic>” (meaning “
 <italic>marine asthma</italic>”) in Arabia and Madras (India), later translated into “
 <italic>barbers</italic>” in English then “
 <italic>barbiers</italic>” in French [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], this later word being also used at least during two centuries in the European medical literature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. These various terms had unfortunate consequences that contributed to maintaining (if not increasing) the initial misunderstanding about beriberi. Actually, Bontius used “
 <italic>beriberi</italic>” only for patients with paralysis, but never used it for those with generalized edema (due to cardiac involvement), the other main symptom of the disease that Bontius, however, mentioned as “
 <italic>frequent in India</italic>” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In fact, beriberi has long time been confused with other diseases, so various other terms were proposed to describe it, such the “
 <italic>hydrope asthmatico</italic>” of the Scottish Surgeon Colin Rogers (referring to the generalized edema then dyspnea observed in beriberi): [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] it was not until the beginning of the nineteenth century that “
 <italic>beriberi</italic>” was linked to generalized edema [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. At that time, many authors called the severe paralytic forms “
 <italic>barbiers</italic>” (in Europe) or “
 <italic>kak</italic>-
 <italic>ke</italic>” (in Japan), whereas the less severe motor forms with edema were considered as “
 <italic>beriberi</italic>” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Nowadays, beriberi is divided into three forms: ‘dry beriberi’ (characterized by a sensorimotor, distal, axonal PN often associated with calf cramps, muscle tenderness, and burning feet), ‘wet beriberi’ (association of PN and high output congestive heart failure), and’ infantile beriberi’ (observed between 2 and 6 months of age, it may present with the cardiac, aphonic, or pseudomeningitic forms) [
