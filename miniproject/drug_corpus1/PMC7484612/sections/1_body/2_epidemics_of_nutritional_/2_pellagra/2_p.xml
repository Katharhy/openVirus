<p id="Par21">Pellagra, as a disease of poverty and social inequality, was initially associated with scorbut and leprosy because of the skin lesions, and such patients (as with leprosy) were victims of social exclusion. Many theories were put forward to explain it (maize diet with little or no milk, meat or fresh vegetable supplements; spoiled or rotten grain; disease spread by insects; bad heredity; overall consequence of poverty) before the true etiology of pellagra was found in 1914–1915 by the American physician Joseph Goldberger (1874–1929), although his conclusions were only accepted nearly 20 years later, in the 1940′s (when pellagra was completely eliminated from the US): pellagra is caused by long-term insufficient niacin (also called vitamin-PP, for “

Moreover, because excessive alcohol consumption is also a known risk factor of pellagra, it may be difficult to diagnose pellagra in alcohol-dependent patients where it frequently coexists with PN (32%), Wernicke’s encephalopathy (29%) and seizure (16%) [
