<p id="Par20">At the beginning of the eighteenth century, the first cases of a new disease called “
 <italic>mal de la rosa</italic>” (“
 <italic>rose sickness</italic>”) were reported in Asturias (Spain), first by François Thiéry (1719–?) in 17 [

 <italic>pellagra</italic>” (“
 <italic>pel”</italic> meaning “
 <italic>skin</italic>” and “
 <italic>agra</italic>” meaning “
 <italic>rough</italic>” in the Italian dialect from Bergamo) by Francesco Frapolli (?-1773) [

 <italic>four D’s</italic>”: dermatitis (reddish-brown hyperkeratotic rash), diarrhea, dementia and death. Also called “
 <italic>plague of corn</italic>”, pellagra has been quickly linked to high maize and low protein diets, and was rampant in some parts of Europe, especially in Southern Europe, where maize became more common as a staple food during the eighteenth century, as in Northern Italy where the poor diet of the Italian peasantry was almost exclusively based on maize flour such as “
 <italic>polenta</italic>”. In the early 1900s, pellagra was also rampant in the southern USA [
