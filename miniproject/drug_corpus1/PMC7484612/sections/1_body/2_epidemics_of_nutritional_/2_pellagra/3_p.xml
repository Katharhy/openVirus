<p id="Par22">Peripheral nerve changes have been associated with pellagra, although PN seems to be more characteristic of beriberi than pellagra. Sensory disturbances (usually mild) consist of paraesthesiae and numbness. Occasionally with muscular wasting and loss of deep tendon reflexes [

In 1940, Samuel Alexander Kinnier Wilson (1878–1937) studied 13 patients with pellagra, reporting practically constant peripheral nerve changes: swelling or thinning of myelin sheaths, fragmentation of axons, oedema of nerve fibers and bundles, and thickening of the epi- and peri-neurium [
