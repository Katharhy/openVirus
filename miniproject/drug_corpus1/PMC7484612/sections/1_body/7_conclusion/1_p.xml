<p id="Par38">The causes of PN are numerous, both sporadic and epidemic. Through the writings of our forefathers, including those from ancient times, we know that many epidemics of PN have affected mankind, from various origins (infectious or not) and to a greater or lesser extent. In view of the current COVID-19 pandemic affecting the entire world, it is, therefore, highly likely that other epidemics (of whatever the cause) may re-occur, and it is to be hoped that the lessons of the past will enable us to better understand the future.</p>
