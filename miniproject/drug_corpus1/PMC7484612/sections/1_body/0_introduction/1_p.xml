<p id="Par13">Although many epidemics of peripheral neuropathy (PN) were due to infectious or post-infectious diseases, non-infectious disorders may also be incriminated. For example, two of the main current causes of PN worldwide are diabetes mellitus and alcohol consumption, both being considered as real epidemics (or even endemics/pandemics) from an epidemiological point of view. Other frequent forms of PN are drug-induced PN (chemotherapy,.etc.). However, this paper will not deal with drug-induced and diabetic PN, but only focus on alcohol-induced PN and other lesser known causes of toxic and nutritional PN giving rise to epidemics in the past.</p>
