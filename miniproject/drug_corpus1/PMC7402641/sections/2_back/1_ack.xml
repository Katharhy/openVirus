  <title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title>
  <p id="Par31">K.X. and H.L. conceived the project and designed the experiments. R.X., M.D., Y.W., and Y.Z. performed animal infection experiments and data analysis. S.L. and H.L. designed the compounds. J.S. and Z.Z synthesized the compounds. Y.T. and L.L.Z. solved the X-ray complex crystal structure, ITC, and SPR assays. L.X. and R.W. investigated the 
   <italic>in vivo</italic> toxicity. R.X. conducted the antiviral potency in infected cells except for SARS-CoV-2. M.D. and Y.W. repeated the key experiments in infected cells. K.X., H.L., K.L., and G.X. coordinated the SARS-CoV-2 study. K.X., H.L., and L.K.Z. designed the SARS-CoV-2 test, L.K.Z., Y.S., Y.W., W.S. and X.J. performed the antiviral potency for SARS-CoV-2. Y.C. and Y.L. reviewed the SARS-CoV-2 data. D.L. and G.Z. provided the materials and technical supports to Zika/Ebola test and CRISPR-Cas9 system. R.X. carried out knock-out cells and related analysis. M.D. generated the mutant virus and performed the related test. Z.S. helped in data analysis of cytokines/chemokines. K.X., H.L., S.L., R.X., Y.W., Y.Z., and L.L.Z. wrote the manuscript with input from the remaining authors.
