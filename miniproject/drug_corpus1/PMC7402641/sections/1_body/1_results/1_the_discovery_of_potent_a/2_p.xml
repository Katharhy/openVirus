<p id="Par6">Considering the species selectivity, the lead compound, from which S312 and S416 were generated by the same scaffold of (
 <italic>E</italic>)-2-(2-benzylidenehydrazinyl)-4-phenylthiazole, is highly selective to 
 <italic>human</italic> DHODH (IC

 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> DHODH (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 10 μmol/L) (Diao et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2012</xref>) indicating that S312 and S416 have the same highly selective to 
 <italic>human</italic> DHODH. Moreover, S312 and 416 displayed almost no kinase inhibitory activities at the concentration of 1 μmol/L (Fig. S1B and S1C) when profiled against a panel of &gt;180 kinases, suggesting that S312 and S416 particular inhibited DHODH rather than other enzymes.
