<p id="Par7">We further studied the pharmacokinetic profile of S312 and S416 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (Table S3). The two inhibitors displayed a relatively wide distribution (Vd
 <sub>ss</sub>) of 0.35 L/kg (S312) and 0.14 L/kg (S416), which is closer to the body water volume (0.67 L/kg) than the blood volume (0.05 L/kg) (Davies and Morris, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1993</xref>), suggesting that they tend to distribute moderately to the tissue components. Besides, both S312 and S416 have a proper oral bioavailability (
 <italic>F</italic> = 22.75% and 76.28%, respectively).
