<p id="Par19">To elucidate the essential role of DHODH in the viral replication cycle, we generated a DHODH
 <sup>−/−</sup> A549 cell line by CRISPR-Cas9 gene knock-out (KO) technology (Figs. S5A and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). Unexpectedly, the cell proliferation rate was barely affected in DHODH
 <sup>−/−</sup> cells indicating DHODH is not indispensable for cell growth at least for three days (72 h) (Fig. S5B). By contrast, as compared to wild-type (WT) A549 cells, virus growth was largely inhibited in DHODH
 <sup>−/−</sup> cells with a 132-fold reduction of infectious particles at 72 h post-infection (h.p.i.) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B, black solid line vs. red solid line). When S312 (5EC
 <sub>50</sub>) was added into the culture medium, dramatic reduction of virus growth only occurred in WT cells but not in DHODH
 <sup>−/−</sup> cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B, differs between black lines vs. differs between red lines). Moreover, in the presence of S312, there were no differences in virus titers between WT and DHODH
 <sup>−/−</sup> cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B, blank dotted line vs. red dotted line) indicating that S312 did not act in the absence of DHODH. The statistical analysis of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B was also shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C in detail. These results together prove that virus growth but not the coincident cell growth requires DHODH activity, and antiviral action of S312 is implemented by particularly targeting DHODH.
