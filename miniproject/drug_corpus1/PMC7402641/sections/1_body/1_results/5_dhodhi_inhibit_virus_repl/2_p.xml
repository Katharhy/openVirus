<p id="Par20">The general virus growth cycle includes virus entry, viral genome replication, and virus release. To further validate whether virus genome replication is the major target of DHODHi, we used the influenza A virus mini-replicon system to quantify viral genome replication. Brequinar, another potent inhibitor of DHODH was included as a positive control (Chen et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1992</xref>), whereas Osel targeting the influenza NA protein served as a negative control. The results in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D showed no inhibition on viral genome replication in the Osel-treated group, but there were obvious inhibitions on viral genome replication in both S312- and S416-treated groups as well as Brequinar-treated group in dose-dependent manners. Almost 90% of viral genome replication was suppressed by 10EC
 <sub>50</sub> of S312 (24 μmol/L) and S416 (0.6 μmol/L). As DHODH catalyzes the oxidation of dihydroorotate (DHO) to produce orotic acid (ORO) and finally forms UTP and CTP, we added four nucleosides (Adenosine (A), Guanosine (G), Uridine (U), and Cytidine (C)), DHO, ORO respectively to the mini-replicon system to identify the target of S312 and S416. The results in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>E showed that the addition of 50 μmol/L of either U or C could effectively rescue viral genome replication in S312- and S416-treated cells (as well as in Brequinar-treated cells), whereas addition of neither A nor G changed the inhibitory effects. Moreover, there were no differences in viral genome replication when U or C was complemented into S312- or S416-treated cells as compared to untreated cells (DMSO), indicating that these compounds only interrupted the pyrimidine 
 <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis but not off-targeted to enzymes in the salvage pathways wherein extracellular pyrimidine nucleosides must serve as templates (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>E). A supplement of DHODH substrate DHO could not rescue viral genome replication (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>F), but a supplement of DHODH product ORO could gradually reverse the inhibition effects of S312 and S416 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>G). Further statistical analysis showed no differences in viral genome replication when 1,000 μmol/L ORO was complemented into S312- and S416-treated cells as compared to untreated cells (DMSO), indicating that these compounds did not off-target to enzymes located downstream of ORO (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>G). The results in all further confirmed that compounds S312 and S416 inhibit viral genome replication via targeting DHODH and interrupting the fourth step in 
 <italic>de novo</italic> pyrimidine synthesis.
