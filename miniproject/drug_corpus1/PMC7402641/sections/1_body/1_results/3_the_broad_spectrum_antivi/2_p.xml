<p id="Par13">During the preparation of this manuscript, a severe outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 had occurred in December 2019, and we responded quickly to examine the antiviral activities of DHODHi against this new coronavirus. The data in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A showed that Teriflunomide had a solid antiviral potency of EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 26.06 μmol/L (at MOI = 0.05), ~2.6-fold stronger than Favipiravir (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 66.85 μmol/L), whereas its pro-drug Leflunomide showed less inhibition of EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 41.49 μmol/L. Additionally, Brequinar, S312, S416 and exhibited ideal antiviral potencies of EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.123 μmol/L (SI = 1 880.49), EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.56 μmol/L (SI = 101.41), and EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.017 μmol/L (extensively high SI = 10 505.88) at MOI = 0.05, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). Compared with our previous publication of Remdesivir (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.77 μmol/L, SI &gt; 129.87) and Chloroquine (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.13 μmol/L, SI &gt; 88.50) (Wang et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2020</xref>), which are currently used in clinical trials against SARS-CoV-2, S416 had much greater EC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values (66.5-fold stronger than Chloroquine in EC
 <sub>50</sub>) against SARS-CoV-2. To determine more carefully the infection-dose dependent antiviral activities of DHODHi, a bit low MOI of 0.03 (Fig. S3C) was applied. Teriflunomide, which can be transferred to clinical treatment of SARS-CoV-2 immediately as an approved drug, showed lower EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 6.00 μmol/L and SI = 141.75 at MOI of 0.03, indicating that Teriflunomide with effective EC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values have all the potentials to treat SARS-CoV-2-induced COVID-19 disease as an “old drug in new use” option. The antiviral activities of Brequinar, S312, and S416 were similar at the two MOIs indicating that they are enough potent to take effects at low concentrations.
