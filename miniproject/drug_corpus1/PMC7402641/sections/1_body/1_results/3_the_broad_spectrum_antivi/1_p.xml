<p id="Par12">As all infectious viruses rely on actuating cellular pyrimidine synthesis process to replicate, it is reasonable to speculate that DHODHi have broad-spectrum antiviral efficacies. We, therefore, tested several highly impacted acute infectious RNA viruses. All compounds of Teriflunomide, Brequinar, S312, and S416 showed inhibitory effects against the Ebola virus (EBOV) mini-replicon, with EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 3.41, 0.102, 11.39 and 0.018 μmol/L, respectively (Fig. S3A). To our surprise, S416 showing relatively high cytotoxicity in MDCK cells (CC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.63 μmol/L in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D) was less toxic to EBOV-mini-replicon supporting BSR-T7/5 cells (CC
 <sub>50</sub> = 85.43 μmol/L). Thus, a significantly high SI = 4 746.11 was achieved by S416. We subsequently tested the inhibitory effects of DHODHi against the Zika virus (Fig. S3B). EC
 <sub>50</sub> values were 17.72, 0.304, 1.24 and 0.019 μmol/L for Teriflunomide, Brequinar, S312 and S416, respectively. Again, the selective index of S416 was the highest of SI = 2 880.53.
