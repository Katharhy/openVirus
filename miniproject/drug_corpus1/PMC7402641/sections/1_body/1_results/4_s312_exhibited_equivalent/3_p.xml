<p id="Par17">Except for broad activity to different viruses, HTA drug such as DHODHi has another advantage over DAA drug to overcome drug-resistant (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). To prove this, we generated a current-circulating Oseltamivir-resistant NA
 <sup>H275Y</sup> mutant virus (in WSN backbone) by reverse genetics (Fig. S4A and S4B). We found that the NA
 <sup>H275Y</sup> virus did not respond to Osel (20 mg/kg/day)-treatment at all, but 2.5 mg/kg/day of S312 can rescue 50% of mice from lethal infection of NA
 <sup>H275Y</sup> virus (Fig. S4C).
