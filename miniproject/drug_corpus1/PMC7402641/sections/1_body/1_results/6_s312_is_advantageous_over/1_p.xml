<p id="Par21">It is documented elsewhere that DAA drugs such as Osel are only completely effective in the early phase of infection, optimally within 48 h of the onset of the symptom (McNicholl and McNicholl, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2001</xref>). Till now, there is no approved drug to treat advanced influenza disease at the late phase specifically. We supposed that S312 could be effective in the middle or late phase of disease because it targets a host pro-viral factor of DHODH not affected by the viral replication cycle. To test this, we compared the therapeutic windows of S312 and Osel in early (D3-D7), middle &amp; late (D5-D9), and severe late (D7-D11 or D6-D13) phases (workflow is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). When drugs were given in the early phase, both Osel-treatment and “Osel + S312”-combination-treatment conferred 100% protection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B). When drugs were given at the middle &amp; late phase (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C), single Osel-treatment wholly lost its antiviral effect with no surviving. However, S312-treatment could provide 50% protection, and drug combination reached to 100% protection. When drugs were given at severe late phase of the disease that mice were starting dying (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>D), neither single treatment of Osel nor S312 could rescue the mice from death, but combined treatment still conferred to 25% survival. To define the advantage of S312 in treating severe disease, we additionally treated the mice a bit early before dying at around 20% body weight loss (D6-D13) with a more optimal dose of S312 (5 mg/kg). The data in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>E showed that S312 rescued 50% of mice from severe body-weight losses, and combined treatment conferred an additional 16.7% survival. These results once again highlight that S312 has remarkable advantages over Osel to treat severe diseases at the late phase, and its therapeutic effectiveness could even be improved when S312 was combined with DAA drug.
