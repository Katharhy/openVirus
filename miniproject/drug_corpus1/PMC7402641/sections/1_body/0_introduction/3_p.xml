<p id="Par4">To identify potent and low-toxicity DHODH inhibitors (DHODHi), we previously conducted a hierarchal structure-based virtual screening (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A) against ~280,000 compounds library towards the ubiquinone-binding site of DHODH (Diao et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2012</xref>). We finally obtained two highly potent DHODHi S312 and S416 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 29.2 nmol/L and 7.5 nmol/L through structural optimization (Li et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2015</xref>; Zhu et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2015a</xref>), which are &gt;10-folds potent than the FDA approved DHODHi Teriflunomide (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 307.1 nmol/L). By using these two potent inhibitors, we could fully evaluate DHODH as a valuable host target both in infected cells and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> in infected animals. We identified that targeting DHODH offers broad-spectrum antiviral efficacies against various RNA viruses, including the DAA-resistant influenza virus and the newly-emerged coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Especially, our potent DHODHi can protect 100% mice from lethal influenza challenge, which is as good as the DAA drugs, and is even effective in the late phase of infection when DAA drug is no longer responding.
