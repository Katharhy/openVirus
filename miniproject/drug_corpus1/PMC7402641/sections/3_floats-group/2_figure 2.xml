   </bold>. (A) Anti-SARS-CoV-2 virus potency. Aliquots of Vero E6 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and then infected with Beta CoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019 at MOI of 0.05. At the same time, different concentrations of the compounds were added for co-culture. Cell supernatants were harvested 48 h.p.i. and RNA was extracted and quantified by qRT-PCR to determine the numbers of viral RNA copies. Inhibition potencies (EC
   <sub>50</sub>) of the compounds were determined by percentage viral RNA reductions as compared to control treatment (DMSO), and their cytoxicities (CC
   <sub>50</sub>) were determined using cell viability assay. The results are presented as a mean of at least three replicates ± SD. (B) Immuno-fluorescence assay of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 under the same procedure of (A). Cells were fixed and permeabilized for staining with an anti-viral NP antibody, followed by staining with Alexa 488-labeled secondary antibody. Green represents infected cells. Nuclei were stained by DAPI, and the merge of NP and nuclei were shown. Scale bar, 400 μm
