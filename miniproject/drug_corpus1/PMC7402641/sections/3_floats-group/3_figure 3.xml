   <bold>antiviral activity of S312 in influenza A virus-infected mice</bold>. (A) Diagram of the experimental procedure. (B) BALB/c mice were intranasal infected with 4,000 PFU of WSN virus and intraperitoneal injected (i.p.) with PBS, S312 (2.5, 5, 10 mg/kg), Oseltamivir (20 mg/kg) and S312 + Oseltamivir (10 mg/kg + 20 mg/kg) around 3 h before infection. The compounds were continuous given once per day from D0-D13 respectively. The body weight and survival were monitored for 14 days or until body weights lost more than 25% (non-treatment group 
   <italic>n</italic> = 5, the other groups 
   <italic>n</italic> = 4). (C) Same procedure as (A). BALB/c Mice were inoculated intranasally with 300 PFU of A/SC/09 (H1N1) and i.p. with PBS, S312 (10 mg/kg), Oseltamivir (20 mg/kg) and S312 + Oseltamivir (10 mg/kg + 20 mg/kg) once per day from D0 to D13. The body weight and survival were monitored until 14 days post-infection or when the body weights lost more than 25% (PBS group 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3, non-treatment group 
   <italic>n</italic> = 4, the other groups 
   <italic>n</italic> = 5). The dotted lines indicated initial weight and endpoint for mortality (25% weight loss) separately. The body weights are present as the mean percentage of weight change ±SEM and survival curves are shown. Asterisks (*) indicate significance when the indicated group compared with the non-treatment group, and pound signs (#) indicate significance between single treatment and combined treatment. *#
