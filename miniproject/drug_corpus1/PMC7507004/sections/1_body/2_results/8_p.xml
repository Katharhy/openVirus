<p>Finally, after consideration of multiple comparisons, there were only three significant instances of effect modification on any of the three endpoints by covariates (Figures

Viral suppression and the combined endpoint varied significantly by facility level, with EAAA having the strongest effect on these endpoints in hospitals, and the weakest in clinics with no maternity facilities. We did not assess effect modification by clinic for the viral suppression endpoint because some clinics had no participants available for assessment.
