<p>Furthermore, in sensitivity analysis for the combined endpoint, as we varied the unsuppression rate among those with missing VL from 5% to 20%, the benefit of the combined endpoint as HRs increased from 1.84 (95% CI: 1.23 to 2.77) to 2.20 (95% CI: 1.42 to 3.41), demonstrating that even with very high suppression rates among those with missing VLs, there was still an increased rate of retention and/or viral suppression associated with EAAA.</p>
