 <xref rid="jia225610-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref> provides the steptime‐adjusted incidence rates and hazard ratios for the three endpoints. In SoC and EAAA, respectively, the 12‐month retention rates were 80% (95% confidence interval (CI): 77 to 83) and 86% (95% CI: 83 to 88) (Figure 
 <xref rid="jia225610-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Under EAAA compared to SoC, a 60% significant improvement in retention was observed (HR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.15 to 2.21,

Although VL coverage was low in both the SoC and EAAA arms with 80% and 66% of participants not receiving a VL between 180 days post‐ART initiation and end of follow‐up, significant improvements of increased viral suppression were also observed with EAAA compared to SoC (HR: 14.51, 95% CI: 7.31 to 28.79,

At one year, the cumulative incidence of retention and viral suppression was 44% (95% CI: 40 to 48) under SoC compared to 80% (95% CI: 77 to 83) under EAAA, and at two years, it was 5% (95% CI: 3 to 9) under SoC compared to 60% (95% CI: 56 to 65) under EAAA (Figure 
 <xref rid="jia225610-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>). EAAA led to a large significant increase in the combined endpoint (HR: 4.88, 95% CI: 2.96 to 8.05,
