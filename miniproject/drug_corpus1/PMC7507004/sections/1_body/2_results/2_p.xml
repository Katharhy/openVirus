<p>The trial was conducted between September 2014 and August 2017, during which 3485 participants were enrolled. Following 
 <italic>a priori</italic> exclusion criteria, 80 (2%) participants were excluded, leaving 3405 eligible participants, of whom 2034 (60%) enrolled during the SoC phase of their clinic and 1371 (40%) under EAAA (Figure 
 <xref rid="jia225610-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). From the distribution of enrolment by clinic and step, we observed a larger sample size in the earlier steps because existing pre‐ART participants were enrolled into the trial, whereas at later steps of the trial, only participants who were newly diagnosed or who had previously disengaged from pre‐ART care remained available for enrolment (Figure 
 <xref rid="jia225610-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Consequently, there were more participants in SoC than EAAA.
