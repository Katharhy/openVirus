<p>Our findings provide strong causal evidence for the benefits of EAAA on retention and viral suppression, both for those who were already eligible for ART under the previous eligibility thresholds and for those who became newly eligible under EAAA. Thus, Eswatini and other countries with similar HIV epidemics and health systems should continue their rollout of EAAA. EAAA policies will likely not only improve access to ART but also the clinical performance of ART programmes with respect to patient outcomes.</p>
