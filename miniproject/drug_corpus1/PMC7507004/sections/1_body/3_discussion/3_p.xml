<p>Lessons learned from this trial are as follows: EAAA can be successfully implemented in a public sector health system, supporting Eswatini and other countries' decisions to roll out this policy as the SoC. EAAA adoption did not lead to a deterioration of clinical performance of the public sector ART provision, as some had feared. Self‐reported adherence and disclosure levels remained high after the introduction of EAAA, and we also observed an improvement in the health care interactions, possibly due to training at participating facilities, which will be an important element for a successful rollout of immediate ART [

Thus, EAAA not only benefited those who are either newly diagnosed or enrolled in pre‐ART but also those who were eligible for ART prior to EAAA. EAAA may be a particularly useful policy for providing ART coverage to all people living with HIV while supporting the attainment of the UNAIDS 90‐90‐90 target. Even in this resource‐limited, public sector clinical setting, EAAA participants were initiated on ART 3.6 fold faster than SoC participants (

As countries implement ART scale‐up programmes, there is also a need for policies and interventions to sustain long‐term retention and viral suppression rates, such as increased access to viral monitoring for all participants, mobile phone text messages for appointment reminders and VL result delivery, and others [
