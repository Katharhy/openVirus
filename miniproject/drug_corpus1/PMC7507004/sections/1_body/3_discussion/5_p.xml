<p>Another limitation of this trial resulted from a relatively high proportion of missing VL measurements. In the primary analysis, we treated all missing VLs as detectable. If VLs are not measured as per national guidelines, it is difficult to properly treat participants, correct treatment failure and monitor and address non‚Äêadherence. Insufficient VL monitoring is equivalent to being unsuppressed from health systems, patient safety and disease transmission standpoints. Under the national guidelines, VLs are not measured until ART initiation and every six months thereafter. Thus, even if SoC and EAAA were compared contemporaneously, there would be more VLs in the EAAA group since EAAA participants are immediately initiated regardless of clinical status. However, the sensitivity analyses demonstrated that regardless of whether we included only those with at least one VL measurement after baseline, considered all EAAA participants without VLs as unsuppressed and SoC participants without VLs as suppressed, or considered all participants with missing VLs suppressed, results gave similarly attenuated but nevertheless significant improvements in suppression rates.</p>
