<p>This trial had several limitations. The Eswatini national ART guidelines evolved during the trial from recommending ART initiation at CD4 ≤ 350 to CD4 ≤ 500 and finally to EAAA. These changes over time reduced the statistical power to demonstrate significant impact of EAAA compared with the SoC. However, because the effect sizes were of a greater magnitude than anticipated, we were nevertheless able to observe highly significant EAAA effects.</p>
