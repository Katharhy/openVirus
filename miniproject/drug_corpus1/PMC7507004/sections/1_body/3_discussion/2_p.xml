<p>This is the first randomized controlled trial to establish the impact of EAAA on the critical endpoints of ART retention and viral suppression in a “real‐world” public sector health system setting in sub‐Saharan Africa. Increased retention and viral suppression at six months or more after ART initiation was observed with EAAA compared to SoC, similar to previous observational data showing that those immediately eligible for ART had higher retention rates under existing national guidelines, than participants above the eligibility criteria [

 <xref rid="jia225610-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref>]. EAAA led to both a 60% increase in retention rates and – when considering documented viral load – a fivefold increase in retention and viral suppression combined. VL suppression can be considered a proxy measurement of health system efficiency, simultaneously assessing retention, the ability of the healthcare system to provide a VL result, and when available, to maintain suppression. When only those with at least one VL measurement post‐ART are included, the 6‐ and 12‐month suppression rates were 0.94 and 0.91 in the EAAA participants, and 0.82 and 0.72 among SoC participants (Figure

 <xref rid="jia225610-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>, the six‐ and twelve‐month suppression rates were 0.90 and 0.79 in the EAAA participants, and 0.22 and 0.04 among SoC participants. Most studies are likely estimating suppression rates with these anti‐conservative assumptions, while the estimates we provided in our primary analysis may be much closer to the reality and could explain, at least in part, why transmission is still so high in, for example, Kwa Zulu Natal, South Africa, bordering Eswatini [
