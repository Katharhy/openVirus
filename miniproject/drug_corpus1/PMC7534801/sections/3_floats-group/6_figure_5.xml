  <p>Summary and characteristics of various vaccine delivery devices. (a) Drug delivery devices developed for vaccine administration: I. Traditional vaccine-containing solutions for bolus injection. II. Minimally invasive microneedle devices (including fast-dissolving, sustained-released, and liquid-eluting hollow microneedles). III. Injectable drug delivery devices (such as microparticles, solid scaffolds, and hydrogel-based). IV. Other devices for enhancing vaccine efficacy (such as electroporation and iontophoresis). (b) Schematic for representative PKs of vaccine and administration features for different vaccine delivery devices: I. Traditional bolus injection is invasive and may require multiple doses. II. Fast dissolving or liquid eluting MNs can be self-administrable and minimally invasive but still require multiple doses.

   </sup> III. Sustained released MNs can be both minimally invasive, with only one dose necessary,

   </sup> while scaffold and gel vaccines could be injectable to avoid implantation and also only require one dose. IV. Pulse-released microparticles can mimic a multiple-dose regimen with only one injection.

   </sup> II. Gel vaccines: Hydrogel microenvironment can be engineered to support encapsulated cell vaccines (such as DC vaccines) by incorporating cell adhesive peptides and supplementary factors.
