   </sup> (b) Virus-based vaccines require the seeding and culture of specific viruses derived from patients. By manipulating the genetic sequences of the virus or inactivating the virus directly with chemicals, weakened and inactivated virus vaccines can be produced.

   </sup> (c) Viral vector-based and nucleic acid-based vaccines are independent of virus culture and rely on the genetic sequence of the virus and/or the selection of immunogenic sequences of the virus. By selecting commonly developed vectors, virus-specific sequences can be inserted.

   </sup> Nucleic acid vaccines require further formulations for optimal efficacy. (d) Structure-based understanding of native viral proteins can validate the expressed recombinant proteins and predict the peptide sequences desirable as vaccines. Protein/peptide vaccines require further formulations for optimal efficacy.
