  <p>Materials-based vaccine formulations for important immunological functions. (a) Vaccine formulations that protect the active “cargo” and enhance cellular uptake may be based on lipids, polymeric materials, and/or inorganic particles. (b) Vaccine formulations that allow LN targeting by forming extra small-sized albumin-based vaccine complexes, tuning the net charge to be negative and incorporating targeting ligands. (c) Vaccine formulations that promote immunostimulatory effects by using microbial wall-derived polysaccharides as nanocarriers, co-delivering adjuvants with peptide antigens, and exploring innate immunostimulatory lipids.</p>
