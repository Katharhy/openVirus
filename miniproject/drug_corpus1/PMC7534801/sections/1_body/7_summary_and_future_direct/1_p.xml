 </sup> Apart from the high diversity of the vaccine candidates, many candidates are based on different technological platforms, such as nanotechnology delivered mRNA vaccine, electroporation device-enabled DNA vaccine, and MN-delivered vaccine. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the deployment of different vaccine formulations and delivery devices. It is reasonable to expect that more efforts will be dedicated to further optimize the vaccine designs to help fight future outbreaks.
