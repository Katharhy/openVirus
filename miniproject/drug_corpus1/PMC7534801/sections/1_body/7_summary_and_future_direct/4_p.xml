<p>Additional challenges for vaccine development also exist during a pandemic. Multiple vaccine candidates flush into different stages of clinical trials that could burden the regulatory process by the FDA for selecting promising candidates and deciding final ones.

 </sup> Furthermore, human trials are starting even before the most suitable animal models for safety and efficacy are defined.

 </sup> Based on previous successful preclinical and early stage clinical data for a similar platform, animal studies are even skipped directly for human administrations.

 </sup> may serve as a promising tool in future clinical trials for efficacy and toxicity determination. Ethically controversial human challenge trials by deliberately infecting humans with a virus have been proposed and pursued to accelerate the process of vaccine development.

 </sup> Therefore, potentially we should have vaccine clinical trials specifically designed for different scenarios by incorporating engineering advances and regulatory guidelines readily outlined for unusual trials. In conclusion, human health and societal stability are constantly challenged by sudden virus outbreaks, and the rapid development of effective vaccines is believed to be an ultimate solution. We expect to observe faster and more efficient vaccine development paradigms in the future by combining the advances in different engineering fields.
