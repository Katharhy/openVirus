<p>However, several challenges remain before these goals can be fully achieved. First, a differently identified virus is unknown in terms of its interactions with our immune system and which type of immune responses are most desirable to trigger prolonged immunity. An improved understanding of our immune system and its interactions with viruses are the basis for designing an effective vaccine, which also guides the steps for designing corresponding vaccine administration regimens. Second, innovative formulations or delivery devices for vaccines are mostly in the preclinical stage, which have not been approved by the FDA yet. For example, MN-based vaccines showed encouraging results from a phase I trial of dissolvable MN-based influenza vaccine and indicated a promise of using it as an alternative strategy for vaccination.

 </sup> However, patient compliance with this approach and its efficacy needs to be tested in a larger population, considering only 100 human subjects are currently involved. Also, the efficacy of vaccines by self-administration should be further validated in comparison to those performed by medical experts. In addition, the proposed formulations and delivery devices should be easy to manufacture with minimal batch-to-batch variability to simplify the quality control process. The raw materials used could prioritize the FDA-approved ones to simplify the regulatory process, and the required chemistry is preferred to be simple and robust. Even though advanced manufacturing technologies excel in reducing batch-to-batch variability, a high cost may be associated. The improved efficacy of a vaccine from these formulations and delivery devices should not be complicated by the fabrication process so that it can facilitate the clinical translation and regulatory approvals.
