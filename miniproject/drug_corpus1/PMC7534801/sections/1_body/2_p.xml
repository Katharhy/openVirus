<p>To tackle a pandemic, a different vaccine development process is needed to rapidly produce safe and effective vaccines against novel viruses. This process is characterized by overlapping phases, multiple potential vaccine candidates, and early ramp-up of manufacturing capacities (

 </sup> After the initial release of the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, researchers worldwide started to develop vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19. The first dose was administered into humans by Moderna Inc. on March 16, 2020.

 </sup> This method utilized lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) with a formulated mRNA vaccine.

 </sup> This work was fast-tracked at an unprecedented pace, even though mRNA-based vaccines have never been licensed before.

 </sup> A snapshot of the landscape of COVID-19 vaccines (

 </sup> A high diversity of vaccine candidates is seen in these forerunners, which includes six mRNA-based, five inactivated virus-based, five nonreplicating viral vector-based, one replicating viral vector-based, four DNA-based, and one cell culture-based vaccines as well as nine protein-based vaccines (

  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>b,c). The incomplete understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 interactions with the human immune system became one of the major obstacles in vaccine development. A recent report on a second COVID-19 infection in the same patient further raises the question of protective immunity and immune memory. For instance, it is still unknown how durable the immune memory response induced by SARS-CoV-2 could be or what is the threshold of antibodies titers that can protect the patients against reinfection.

 </sup> In addition, protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 should also be comprehensively studied, where the balance of cellular and humoral immunity, the ratio of effector to memory T cells, the maintenance of memory B cells, and functional features of activated T cells should be characterized.

 </sup> These aspects could ultimately facilitate vaccine designs and evaluations.
