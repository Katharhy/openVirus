<p>Based on the current understanding of eliciting optimal immune responses, materials-based nanoengineering approaches could improve the efficacy of vaccines. In this regard, different methodologies could be applied based on different types of vaccines, with either distinct or shared requirements. Virus and viral vector-based vaccines generally do not require further formulations, and their efficacy and safety profiles are largely dependent on the purification and inactivation strategies, the optimization of culturing of viral particles, and the choice of vectors.

 </sup> They have efficient innate advantages in delivery due to their small sizes, and they are easily recognized by the immune system. Although inactivated or weakened virus-based vaccines still make up most of the effective vaccines today, they are not effective for all pathogens.
