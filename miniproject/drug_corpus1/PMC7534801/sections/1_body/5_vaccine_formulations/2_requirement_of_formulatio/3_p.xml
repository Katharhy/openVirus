<p>We refer vaccine formulations to engineering approaches that could facilitate the

 </sup> We categorize the vaccine formulations in terms of commonly used materials: lipids, polymeric materials, and inorganic particles (

  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>). Commonly pursued feature goals include protection of cargo, improving loading capacity, and enhancing cellular uptake (

 </sup> In addition, the ideal microenvironment for initiating and amplifying immune responses is secondary lymphoid organs where APCs, T cells, and B cells are in close proximity for cell-to-cell interactions. Therefore, targeting DC or LN can be one type of approach to pursue (

 </sup> To further boost immune responses, immunostimulatory components or adjuvants are usually required, and coformulation approaches have been widely explored for developing immunostimulatory vaccine formulations (
