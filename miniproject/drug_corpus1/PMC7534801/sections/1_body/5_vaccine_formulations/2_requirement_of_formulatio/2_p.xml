<p>In contrast, synthetic vaccines (nucleic acid-based and protein/peptide-based ones) generally require additional formulation designs for optimal efficacy.

 </sup> These synthetic molecules all have essential secondary or higher-order structures that could be disrupted in physiological conditions.

 </sup> Various endogenous enzymes (such as nuclease or protease) can digest these synthetic molecules before reaching immunocompetent cells, such as APCs, or immunocompetent sites, such as secondary lymphoid organs.

 </sup> Furthermore, physiochemical features of these synthetic molecules may pose challenges for cells to efficiently uptake and process them. For instance, DNA and mRNA are too large to directly diffuse across the cellular membrane and their dense negative charge repels them from cell membranes, which further prevents efficient cellular uptake.

 </sup> Even after penetrating the membrane, the vaccine formulations need to reach the endosomal compartments either to be processed into peptides (protein/peptide-based vaccines), released for further transcription (DNA-based vaccines), or translation (mRNA-based vaccines). The resulting peptide fragments can be further loaded onto MHC molecules and exported to the membrane surface for antigen presentation to T cells (
