<p>Vaccines are commonly administered intramuscularly, making it less efficient in interacting with the abundant immune cells present within the skin. Alternative strategies, including oral or intranasal deliveries, are also widely studied because of their ease of use.

 </sup> The effectiveness of alternative strategies is based on mucosal immunity.

 </sup> Nonetheless, different strategies rely on the activation of the adaptive immune system, which involves the interactions between T cells and APCs (DCs and B cells).

 </xref>a, APCs can internalize exogenous antigens and process them into antigenic peptide fragments. The peptide fragments can subsequently be loaded onto the MHC II molecules and displayed on the surface of the APCs.

 </sup> CD4
 <sup>+</sup> helper T cells could recognize peptides presented by MHC class II through T cell receptors (TCRs), which could induce the production of cytokines, such as IL-2, that are essential to the normal function of immune cells.

 </sup> B cells can directly capture antigens through B-cell receptors (BCRs). The antigens can be internalized and subsequently processed into antigenic peptides for presentation by MHC class II to CD4
 <sup>+</sup> helper T cells. This process is required for the clonal expansion and differentiation of B cells into IgG antibody-secreting plasma cells and memory B cells, which is classified as humoral immunity.

 </sup> Generally, only endogenous antigens could be degraded into peptides and loaded onto MHC class I molecules for presentation to CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells.

 </sup> Cross-presentation is the ability of certain APCs to uptake, process, and present extracellular antigens in an MHC class I-dependent manner to CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells. Cross-presentation can be achieved by several cell types, including DCs (the primary cell type), neutrophils, macrophages, and endothelial cells.

 </sup> The MHC class I presented peptide fragments can activate CD8
 <sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells through TCR recognition. Antigen-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells can then recognize these peptide fragments presented by target cells and kill them, which refers to cellular immunity.

 </sup> Lastly, DCs are also capable of detecting “danger signals” 
 <italic>via</italic> an array of receptors called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PRRs are capable of recognizing pathogenic molecules as part of the innate immunity for a response to virus infection by identifying pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from viruses or microbes. The understanding of innate immunity could benefit the development of adjuvants to enhance the immune response further. Together, the understanding of the action mechanisms facilitates the design of vaccine formulations to boost their efficacy.
