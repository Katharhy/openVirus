<p>In addition, LNPs formulations can be optimized for LN targeting, thereby enhancing the immune response

 <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that a designed mRNA-lipoplexes (RNA-LPX) could target DCs 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> simply by using lipid molecules.

 </sup> They established a library of RNA lipoplexes by tuning the lipid to RNA ratios. Cationic lipids DOTMA or DOTAP and the helper lipid DOPE or cholesterol were used. The charge ratio, size, ζ potential, colloidal properties, and RNA stability also varied with the shifting of lipid to RNA ratios. Interestingly and unexpectedly, all negatively charged particles displayed selective targeting to the spleen. The negatively charged formulation (1.3:2 lipid:RNA) displayed effective targeting of DCs and formed monodisperse NPs (∼300 nm) that protected encapsulated mRNA. The authors demonstrated the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy using RNA-LPX encoding for the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), where DCs, NK, B, and T cells were activated by a single intravenous injection of HA-LPX. They also observed an enhanced IFN-α production by vaccination, which is a typical hallmark of APCs sensing for antiviral environment development induced by RNA virus infections through TLR3 and TLR7.
