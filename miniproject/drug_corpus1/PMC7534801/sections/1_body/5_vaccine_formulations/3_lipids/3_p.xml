<p>To enhance immunostimulatory effects, a common strategy is to co-deliver adjuvants to stimulate immune responses. Kuai 
 <italic>et al</italic>. designed an antigen and adjuvant co-delivery nanodisc platform based on synthetic high-density lipoprotein (sHDL).

 </sup> One of the striking features of the nanodisc is its extra-small size: âˆ¼10 nm in diameter, which contributed to the enhanced trafficking to LNs.

 </sup> Exploiting the endogenous role of HDL as a cholesterol carrier, adjuvant CpG was modified with cholesterol to efficiently insert into preformed nanodiscs. This strategy also allowed the co-loading of more than one adjuvant, which promoted a synergistic immune activation.

 </sup> Together, these features contributed to the sustained antigen presentation by DCs. Recently, there is a growing interest in exploring innate immunostimulatory functions of lipid molecules. To expand the diversity of lipid molecules, Miao 
 <italic>et al</italic>. developed a library of lipids through a one-step three-component reaction that included amines, isocyanides, and alkyl ketones.

 </sup> This strategy significantly increased the diversity of synthesized lipids compared to traditional two-component reactions.

 </sup> They showed that the immunostimulatory effect of lipids was dependent on the head groups. The identified lipids with cyclic amino head groups displayed immune cell activation efficacy through the intracellular stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. The lipids could be further formulated with mRNA to form LNPs as mRNA vaccine formulations to efficiently deliver the oligonucleotide products. Another advantage is that the formulation could activate the mRNA-independent intracellular STING pathway rather than TLRs, which could reduce systemic toxicity. In addition, inhibition of the antigen expression related to the TLRs binding by exogenous mRNA was prevented to favor an optimal immune response.
