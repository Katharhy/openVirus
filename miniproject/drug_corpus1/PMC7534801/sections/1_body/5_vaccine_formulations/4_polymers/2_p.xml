<p>In terms of targeted delivery to immune cells, versatility in polymer chemistry shows great potential in developing tissue-selective formulations. For instance, a large library of PBAE-based polymers could be easily synthesized and screened for desirable target polymers.

 </sup> Kowalski 
 <italic>et al</italic>. designed an ionizable amino polyester (APE) for mRNA delivery through the ring opening of lactones with amino alcohols.

 </sup> Tissue-selective delivery was achieved by different APE candidates, including APCs within the spleen.

 </sup> Oligopeptides have been used to modify PBAE to allow the tuning of the charge status of NPs.

 </sup> Initially, this was done to optimize cargo loading and mitigate cytotoxicity. Later, Fornaguera 
 <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that specific oligopeptide modifications lead to APCs targeting within the spleen and exhibited an efficient transfection of mRNA.

 </sup> Inspirations also come from using native LN trafficking molecules. Clinically, visualization of sentinel LNs is achieved by injecting dyes that bind to albumin because of the LN trafficking capability of albumin particles.

 </sup> Inspired by the endogenous role of albumin, Liu 
 <italic>et al</italic>. designed a vaccine by conjugating the adjuvants or antigens to the albumin-binding lipid tail.

 </sup> The vaccines displayed a notable increased accumulation in the LNs, which decreased the systemic distribution of the vaccines and prolonged the vaccine bioavailability. These features limited the systemic toxicity while increasing the potency of vaccination for OVA antigen, HIV antigen, and human papillomavirus (HPV) antigen.
