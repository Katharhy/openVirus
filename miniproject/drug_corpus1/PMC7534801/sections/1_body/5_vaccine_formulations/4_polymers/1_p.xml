<p>Aside from the lipids system, polymers have been widely explored for the delivery of different vaccine candidates. Specifically, cationic and ionizable polymers are promising in nucleic acid-based vaccine formulations. Positively charged polymers can condense nucleic acids as nanocomplexes for efficient cellular uptake and endosomal release. In addition, early studies showed that cationic materials tend to induce an inflammatory response.

 </sup> However, their high molecular weight (MW) and branched polymer structure (needed to allow a massive loading of vaccine therapeutics) also lead to severe cytotoxicity, which limits wider applications.

 </sup> Cyclodextrin modification provided mucosal permeation and mitigated cytotoxicity by lowering the charge density. Other commonly used polymers include polyester-based, such as poly(lactic-
 <italic>co</italic>-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly(lactic acid) (PLA), because of their biocompatibility and biodegradability.

 </sup> Several studies have demonstrated the delivery of protein antigens in PLGA NPs with enhanced immune responses as compared to soluble formulations.

 </sup> However, nonmodified PLGA is generally negatively charged, and as a result, it has a limited cellular uptake efficiency and loading of anionic antigens.
