<p>Some polymeric delivery carriers have been demonstrated to have immunostimulatory effects, such as polymers with cationic charge and hydrophobic domains.

 </sup> In addition, inspired by microbes’ immunostimulatory effect, Son 
 <italic>et al</italic>. designed sugar capsules that were derived from microbial cell walls for vaccine NPs coating.

 </sup> The coating process was achieved by using silicate NPs (Si NPs) as a template, followed by its removal after the mRNA was loaded and the sugar capsules were entirely coated. Notably, the removal of Si NPs renders relatively flexible nanostructures that are beneficial for lymphatic drainage and accumulation.

 </sup> The mRNA cargos can be efficiently loaded by PEI coating due to electrostatic interactions. The PEI coating was also expected to facilitate the endosomal release for mRNA translation and antigen presentation. The sugar capsule itself functioned as a strong DC activator by eliciting the production of a variety of pro-inflammatory factors, including IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-12 p40, without the use of exogenous adjuvants.
