 <italic>In vivo</italic> self-assembled scaffolds provide a good alternative to bypass surgically implantation; however, the self-assembling process is commonly undefined in terms of how long it could take for self-assembling.

 </sup> Materials engineering facilitates the fabrication of scaffolds maintaining injectability. Bencherif 
 <italic>et al</italic>. described a strategy for fabricating injectable scaffolds with shape memory based on cryotropic gelation.

 </sup> The cryogels were based on alginate methacrylate, and they were capable of being reversibly deformed, over 90% strain, after being chemically cross-linked in a frozen condition (−20 °C).

 </sup> The ice crystals hindered the cross-linking in frozen spots and therefore formed the macroporous pores that not only enabled the shape memory for the gel but also allowed the DCs infiltration.
