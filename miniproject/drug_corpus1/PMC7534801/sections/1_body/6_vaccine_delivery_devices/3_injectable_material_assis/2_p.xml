<p>PLGA has also been developed for a single-shot vaccine based on the tunability of its biodegradation profile.

 </sup> In the case of polio vaccines, two to three administrations over several months are required. Tzeng 
 <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that IPV could be encapsulated within PLGA microspheres stably and released through two bursts that were one-month apart.

 </sup> They examined the effect of adding cationic excipients (Eudragit E, PLL, and branched PEI) to stabilize IPV antigens, protecting them from denaturation by acidic byproducts, and modulate degradation profiles of PLGA microspheres.

 </sup> Notably, a single shot of PLGA microsphere-based vaccines could elicit the production of NAb as potent as two bolus injections.

 </sup> Combined with the advances in microfabrication and additive manufacturing, McHugh 
 <italic>et al</italic>. fabricated microscale (∼400 μm) hollow PLGA-based microparticles that were injectable.

 </sup> The microparticles can be filled with vaccine formulations, and the degradation rate of the microparticle shell (a lactic/glycolic copolymer) can be tuned to achieve controlled release spanning from a few days to a few months.

 </sup> Such a design can accomplish the goals of general transdermal vaccine injection and achieve temporally controlled pulsed delivery of antigens in a single injection.

 </sup> Recently, a similar PLGA-based microparticles platform was applied to release a STING agonist (cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP)) in a pulsatile manner over a long period (∼16 days).

 </sup> One single injection of the pulsatile drug-releasing microparticles induced potent immunity as effective as three separate injections. These engineered platforms are versatile in terms of encapsulating different cargos required by vaccine formulations and tuning release kinetics correspondingly. However, even though the use of FDA-approved PLGA could facilitate the clinical translation to a certain degree, several design limitations need to be overcome for translating PLGA-based drug delivery devices into clinical applications. For instance, the pulsatile release was achieved with hollow microparticles that have thick PLGA shells to encapsulate the drugs in the hollow core for controlled release. This design significantly sacrificed their loading efficiency due to the limited volume of the core. Clinically, patients need a high drug dosage, and this formulation needs further optimization to meet the dosage requirement. In addition, PLGA can create an acidic microenvironment during biodegradation, damaging the encapsulated drugs.

 </sup> Furthermore, the encapsulated vaccines need to survive the fabrication process; brief heating requires thermally stable vaccines.

 </sup> All these aspects could compromise their applications for a broader collection of drugs or vaccines.
