<p>Hydrogels have been extensively explored in the field of immunotherapy.

 </sup> They have advantages in terms of controllable delivery of multiple cargos, 
 <italic>in situ</italic> immunomodulation, and mild fabrication process for various vaccine formulations (

 </sup> Activated DCs have a short lifespan, and continuous immune responses may be suppressed if no sufficient host DCs and T cells could be recruited and primed

 </sup> Therefore, cell-based vaccines delivered by gels are expected to improve cell survival and prolong the presence of DCs.

 </sup> Both host DCs and cytotoxic T cells can be recruited to the injection site by cytokines and chemokines secreted from the injected DCs. In addition, the enhanced efficacy of transplanted cells can be enhanced by supplementing the gels with other immunomodulatory molecules, such as cytokines (IL-2) or adjuvants (CpG).

 </sup> The increased persistence of transplanted cells could be achieved by designing gels mimicking ECM by the incorporation of cell-adhesive peptides, such as RGD.
