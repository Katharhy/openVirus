<p>Apart from cell-based vaccines, other types of vaccines could also be incorporated into gel systems, where the release profiles can be tuned. Roy 
 <italic>et al</italic>. utilized the 
 <italic>in situ</italic> cross-linking mechanism of tetrafunctional poly(ethylene oxide) amine and poly(ethylene oxide) succinimidyl glutarate to encapsulate plasmid DNA.

 </sup> The gelation did not interfere with the supercoiled structure of plasmid DNA, and the gelling ability can be tuned by adjusting the concentrations of these two components. Notably, gene expression levels were comparable to bare DNA, but the duration of expression was significantly longer. Other 
 <italic>in situ</italic> gel systems explored for vaccination include temperature-responsive gels

 </sup> Umeki 
 <italic>et al</italic>. designed an immunostimulatory CpG DNA-based hydrogel for antigen delivery.

 </sup> To achieve a sustained release of antigens, they proposed to cationize the antigens by ethylenediamine conjugation where antigens could form complexes with a negatively charged DNA hydrogel matrix. The innate immunostimulatory function of gel and prolonged antigen presence leads to an enhanced antigen-specific immune response with less toxicity.

 <italic>In situ</italic> gelling strategies or physically cross-linked gels from these studies generally take minutes to hours, which renders limited control on cargos release and material properties during the gelling period.

 </sup> Therefore, the development of gel systems that are both injectable and display defined cargo release/biodegradation profiles could be desirable for vaccine administration.
