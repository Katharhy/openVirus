<p>Traditionally, 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> modification of antigen-specific DC vaccines is a multistep process associated with high costs and high levels of complexity.

 </sup> It was proposed that 
 <italic>in situ</italic> DC recruitment, activation, and further trafficking to LNs would be more desirable compared to the 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> modification strategy (

 </sup> The early study by Ali 
 <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated the use of macroporous scaffold vaccines based on PLGA, which presented cytokines (GM-CSF), danger signals (CpG), and antigens in a spatiotemporally defined manner. GM-CSF can be sustainably released from the scaffolds over 20 days for effective DC recruitment.

 </sup> By co-loading the CpG through PEI-mediated electrostatic interactions, CpG was immobilized on the scaffolds for local internalization by the recruited DCs. This process mimicked an infection and was able to continuously recruit and activate DCs.

 </sup> This specific scaffold vaccine was surgically implanted; nevertheless, it encouraged further development of injectable vaccines that work similarly. Kim 
 <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated the use of mesoporous silica rods (MSRs) with a high-aspect-ratio that could be injected with a syringe needle.

 </sup> They could self-assemble 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> as macroporous scaffolds to initiate potent immune responses.

 </sup> The DCs could be recruited into the scaffolds where the inflammatory signals (GM-CSF), adjuvants (CpG), and antigens (OVA) were sustainably released from the scaffolds for 
 <italic>in situ</italic> DC activation and maturation. It was also demonstrated that locally injected scaffold vaccines based on MSRs could elicit strong systemic immune responses with the increase in levels of antigen-specific B cells, helper T cells, and cytotoxic T cells.

 </sup> A PEI coating was later added to the design to enable antigen loading through adsorption for enhanced immunogenicity.

 </sup> This specific system was recently utilized for synthetic peptide vaccines and small antigens.

 </sup> This strategy was able to bypass multiple immunization requirements but sustained a more robust antibody response, compared to traditional bolus or alum vaccine formulations.
