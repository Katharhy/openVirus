<p>In terms of reducing the demands for medical resources, vaccines that could be intranasally or orally administered are desired if their efficacy is comparable to transdermal delivery.

 </sup> The main strategy for intranasal or oral vaccine development is currently limited to weakened viral vaccines mimicking natural infections. Nonliving vaccines are safer but less immunogenic and thus may benefit greatly from drug delivery formulations and devices.

 </sup> A variety of drug delivery devices have been proposed for oral vaccination delivery. For instance, the micromotor-driven microparticles for oral delivery of antigens.

 </sup> The micromotor vaccine can efficiently enter the intestine to enhance the antigen uptake. Aran 
 <italic>et al</italic>. designed a needle-free oral microjet where the high-pressure liquid jet of the vaccine was produced by a self-contained gas-producing reaction.

 </sup> It was shown that a buccal immunity response was enhanced, and this method was able to elicit a potent humoral immune response both locally and systemically.

 </sup> Abramson 
 <italic>et al</italic>. engineered a self-orienting system for oral delivery that could attach to the gastric wall by autonomously positioning to maximize the delivery efficiency.

 </sup> Innovations in drug delivery devices will significantly transform traditional vaccination regimes.
