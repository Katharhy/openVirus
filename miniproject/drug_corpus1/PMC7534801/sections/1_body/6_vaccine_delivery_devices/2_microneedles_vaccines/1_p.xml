<p>Transdermal microneedles (MNs) patches have been proposed as a promising drug delivery device for immunotherapies

 </sup> based on the minimally invasive nature of MNs and the highly active immune environment of the skin. Additionally, since MNs patch-based vaccines can be easily administered without the need for significant medical training, these vaccines can be easily deployed both in areas with limited medical resources, such as developing countries and during times of significant medical crisis, as seen during an outbreak or pandemic. Early studies include the use of vaccine-coated metal MNs

 </sup> and fast-dissolving polymer-based MNs.

 </sup> Recently, the dissolving MNs (carboxymethyl cellulose-based) were used for adjuvants and Ad5-based vaccine co-delivery in an attempt to address COVID-19.

 </sup> A 1 month storage of MNs vaccine at 4 °C maintained the immunogenicity of Ad, where no significant loss in antibody responses was shown in mice studies.

 </sup> Similar dissolving MNs are also being investigated to deliver the SARS-CoV-2 subunit spike protein (S1).

 </sup> Potent virus-specific antibody responses were elicited in mice as early as 2 weeks after the immunization with MNs. The dissolvable MNs for influenza vaccine have been previously evaluated in a phase I clinical trial compared to the traditional intramuscular hypodermic injection of a single-dose vaccine.

 </sup> The MN patch was well-tolerated and immunogenic after a single-dose vaccination. In addition, self-administration exhibited efficacies comparable to the administration by medical workers. The dissolving feature leaves no sharp wastes, and self-administration could significantly relieve the pressure on medical resources, which could be especially critical in coping with a pandemic. Beyond these milestones, advances in microfabrication, materials engineering, and vaccine formulation optimization have provided additional opportunities to enhance vaccine efficacies.
