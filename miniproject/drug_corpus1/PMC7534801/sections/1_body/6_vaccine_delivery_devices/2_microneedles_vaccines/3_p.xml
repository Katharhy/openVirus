<p>MNs also provide advantages in tuning optimal release profiles of vaccines. As mentioned earlier, the sustained availability of vaccines is a desirable feature for immunization. Vaccines targeting different infectious diseases may vary in terms of optimal release profiles based on the unique features of each virus. Initially, MNs for vaccination were mainly an upgrade to traditional bolus delivery by using a fast-dissolving MNs matrix,

 </sup> which requires multiple doses for sufficient immunity. With the exploration of the desired PK of vaccines, MNs can play a much more important role. For example, a silk matrix with crystallized structures could be used as an MNs matrix to sustainably release loaded vaccines over 2 weeks and to elicit potent immune responses with one single administration.

 </sup> In addition, biodegradable polymers with known degradation kinetics can be used to encapsulate the vaccines and tune antigen release profiles. These polymers include biodegradable cationic PBAE
