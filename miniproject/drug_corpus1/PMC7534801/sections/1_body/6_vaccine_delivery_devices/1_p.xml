<p>If the vaccine formulations are considered as utilizing nanoscale engineering, then vaccine delivery devices utilize micro/macroscale engineering to improve vaccine efficiency and efficacy. Beyond the optimization of the vaccine itself and designing appropriate delivery carriers, the efficacy of a vaccine also depends on pharmacokinetics (PK) of the antigens after administration.

 </sup> When the body is exposed to an exogenous antigen, both humoral and cellular immune responses are initiated to neutralize it, which also leads to immunological memory.

 </sup> During a virus infection, the replication process typically takes one to several weeks to sustainably stimulate the immune system with a continuous supplement of antigens.

 </sup> In contrast, typical vaccines show a rapid clearance and can only be detected in LNs within days.

 </sup> Although still poorly understood, the PK of a vaccine, which refers to the dynamics of the antigens presence during immunization, has a profound impact on immune response.

 </sup> One study indicated that increasing the dosage of vaccines over 2 weeks at both priming and boost stages induced a durable immune response and increased antibody production compared to traditional bolus immunization.

 </sup> Also, computational models suggested that antigens can be better captured in germinal centers (GCs) if antigen availability is extended.

 </sup> In addition to the advantages of extended antigen availability, traditional vaccination strategies often fail to yield the desired optimized immune responses in a single dose. Furthermore, vaccine regimes are often designed to be multiple shots, thus achieving an even longer immune protection by rechallenging the immune system with the same antigens in secondary “boosting” shots administered after the primary shots.

 </sup> Therefore, vaccine delivery devices have been widely investigated, to develop single-dose vaccines, minimal invasively administered vaccines, and self-administrable vaccines (
