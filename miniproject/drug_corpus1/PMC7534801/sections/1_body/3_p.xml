<p>In this review, we aim to provide engineering insights on vaccine development by covering vaccine discovery, vaccine formulations in terms of different materials (lipid, polymer, and inorganic particles), and vaccine delivery devices. We will present how some of the existing challenges could potentially be addressed by nano/micro/macroscale engineering approaches. We will also discuss some emerging technologies that may contribute to future vaccine development pipelines.</p>
