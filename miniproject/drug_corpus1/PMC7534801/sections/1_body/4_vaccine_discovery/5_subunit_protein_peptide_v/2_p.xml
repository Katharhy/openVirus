<p>Given that only specific amino acid sequences of the full-length protein antigens are responsible for effective immune responses, minimally immunogenic peptides, mimicking B and T cell epitopes, have been proposed for vaccines.

 </sup> Early approaches used short peptide sequences (8â€“10 amino acids) that could potentially be presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I molecules. Importantly, the memory immune response of cytotoxic T cells could not be efficiently induced with such T cell epitope-mimicking peptides.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>
 </sup> One proposed rationale is that 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> direct loading of short peptides occurs for all cells expressing MHC molecules, including T and B cells. Unlike DCs, they are incapable of generating an effective immune response.

 </sup> These early findings benefitted the design of synthetic long peptide (SLP) vaccines where both helper T cells (T
 <sub>H</sub>) peptides and toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand or peptides could be hybridized to enhance the immune response. For example, Jackson 
 <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated one single SLP vaccine that can target TLR 2 can serve as self-adjuvant and contain both MHC I- and II-specific peptides (T cell epitopes).

 </sup> SLPs cannot directly bind with MHC I and have to be internalized by DCs for further presentation. Furthermore, 
 <italic>in silico</italic> computer-based approaches can be used to benefit the discovery of peptide vaccines by enabling quicker screening and more accurate predictions of peptide sequences with high immunogenicity and binding affinities to MHC I and II molecules.

 </sup> These approaches have been used to accelerate the development pipeline of vaccines, and particularly for emerging viral diseases such as COVID-19. These computational approaches can predict the binding affinity of specific peptides sequences to either MHC I and II molecules or B cell receptors/antibodies. In this regard, theoretical B and T cell epitopes specific to SARS-CoV-2 were synthesized to generate a multiepitope protein.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>
 </sup> The antigenicity, allergenicity, physiochemical parameter, and secondary and tertiary structures of these multiepitope proteins were determined 
 <italic>in silico</italic>. However, the processing in the endosomal/lysosomal compartments of the designed multiepitope SARS-CoV-2 antigens remains to be addressed.
