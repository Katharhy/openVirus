<p>Unlike nucleic acid-based vaccines, which produce viral protein after administration, the direct application of viral protein antigens may be a more straightforward method to trigger immunity. This approach currently represents the largest category of COVID-19 vaccines under preclinical investigation.

 </sup> Full-length proteins are advantageous because they can induce the development of antibodies against multiple epitopes. Importantly, there is a higher probability that the developed antibodies could bind to the native conformation of the viral protein. However, this also increases the chance of inducing nonspecific cross-reactive antibodies.

 </sup> In addition to the high cost of recombinant protein technologies, the recombinant protein products may not fully match all the molecular features of the corresponding viral proteins, which may lead to ineffective induction of broad neutralizing antibodies (bNAb).

 </sup> Optimizing peptide sequences in the discovery phase can improve the stabilization of epitopes associated with bNAb while reducing the antigenicity of non-NAb epitopes.
