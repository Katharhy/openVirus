<p>On the contrary, inactivated virus vaccines generally do not have virulence reversion issues. They also do not rely on extensive genetic manipulations, but the inactivation process may cause the loss of antigenicity of viral immunogens. This vaccine type has been quickly adapted to cope with COVID-19, where patient-derived viruses were inactivated with Î²-propiolactone, followed with purification by chromatography, and formulated with Al(OH)
 <sub>3</sub> as the adjuvant.

 </sup> Advantages of these virus-based methods include well-developed methodologies, well-established regulation policies, and existing manufacturing facilities from previous practices. Nevertheless, the requirement of virus seeding and culture along with unknown safety issues necessitates alternative practices for the development of other vaccines.
