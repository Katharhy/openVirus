<p>Virus-based vaccines, including the weakened and inactivated types, are still the most widely used to date. The effective prevention of the polio epidemic by vaccination in the 20th century represented a landmark success in medical history.

 </sup> This vaccination regimen included the use of the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) and oral polio vaccine (OPV).

 </sup> The IPV was made by inactivating lab-cultured poliovirus by formalin. The OPV was weakened live poliovirus.

 </sup> Weakened viruses are highly immunogenic and are commonly developed by the deletion of viral genes. Nevertheless, mutations could cause virulence reversion as observed for vaccine-derived polioviruses that have been responsible for recent polio outbreaks.

 </sup> This represents an obstacle for polio eradication and, more importantly, a concern for the weakened virus-based vaccines in general. Further genetic manipulation strategies are therefore required to prevent this issue. For instance, modifying the 5â€² untranslated region (UTR), 2C coding region, and 3D polymerase region resulted in a genetically stabilized OPV strain that was less likely to regain virulence and exhibited limited viral adaptability.
