<p>Due to their high potency, rapid development, and low cost for manufacturing, mRNA vaccines have emerged as a promising alternative vaccination development strategy for various infectious diseases and cancers.

 </sup> No mRNA-based vaccine is currently FDA-approved. Several strategies have been proposed to solve the common drawbacks of mRNA-based vaccines, which include mRNA instability and high innate immunogenicity.

 </sup> The 5′ and 3′ UTR of mRNA has significant regulatory influences on both stability and translatability.

 </sup> Half-life and expression can be enhanced when these sequences come from viral genes: A 5′ cap is essential for efficient protein expression, and a poly(A) tail affects mRNA translation and stability.

 </sup> Furthermore, the replacement of rare codons with frequently used synonymous codons also enhances protein expression.

 </sup> Additional optimization strategies include increasing G:C content and introducing modified nucleosides.

 </sup> In spite of the innate immunostimulatory effect of exogenous or unpurified mRNA, further investigations are required to assess the advantages of their use for vaccines specifically.
 <sup>

 </sup> Innate immune sensing mechanisms of mRNA have resulted in the inhibition of antigen expression and a decreased immune response.

 </sup> Therefore, further formulations for vaccine delivery could potentially reduce innate mRNA-associated immunogenicity and favor immune activation.
