<p>DNA- and mRNA-based vaccines have the greatest potential for rapid development because of their synthetic nature that circumvents the need for cell culture or fermentation of viruses. The synthetic nature of this method also results in a high safety profile and rapid manufacturing ability.

 </sup> However, this method generally requires further delivery formulations or better delivery devices to boost vaccine efficacy.

 </sup> In contrast to RNA, the increased stability of DNA decreases the need for frozen storage and low-temperature transportation.

 </sup> One of the forerunners among COVID-19 vaccines is DNA-based (Inovio).

 </sup> Similar DNA-based vaccines have had promising results for the prevention of MERS.

 </sup> In the discovery phase of DNA-based vaccines, strategies such as codon/RNA optimization and the addition of highly efficient immunoglobulin leader sequences are needed to enhance the magnitude and breadth of the immune response.

 </sup> For instance, Muthumani 
 <italic>et al</italic>. designed a consensus DNA sequence for the S protein by analyzing S protein sequences, where sequences from clades A and B can be both involved.

 </sup> To enhance the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> expression, the immunoglobulin E (IgE) leader sequence was added to the immunogen sequence. The insert was further incorporated into the pVax1 vector, which allowed a high-level transient expression of proteins of interest in mammalian cells.

 </sup> The strategies of adding the IgE leader sequence and the use of the pVax1 vector could be quickly adapted to the different virus sequences as well.
