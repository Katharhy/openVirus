<p>Viral vector-based vaccines work by inserting viral antigen-encoding DNA sequences into host cells, which leads to the expression of viral antigens by the host cells.

 </sup> The rationale is based on the capability of viruses to infect cells efficiently through viral genome integration mechanisms.

 </sup> This method could also be problematic since the genome of the host could be altered and cause other diseases. The selection of viruses is therefore crucial in balancing the efficacy (efficient infectivity) and safety (limited pathogenicity). Another common obstacle is the hostâ€™s pre-existing immunity to certain vectors that would mitigate the efficacy of a vaccine. The selected viral vectors could be further genetically modified to be nonreplicable by disrupting genes responsible for replication. Adenoviruses (Ad) are the most extensively used vectors for vaccines because of several advantages: infectious to various cell types, efficient transgene expression, high

 </sup> For instance, Johnson &amp; Johnson (J &amp; J) deployed the Ad26 vector to deliver gene encoding surface proteins of the SARS-CoV-2, and CanSino Biological used the Ad5 vector.

 </sup> The spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was cloned with the tissue plasminogen activator signal peptide gene in the early region 1 (E1) and early region 3 (E3) deleted Ad5 vector. The E1 and E3 deletions render the Ad5 vector nonreplicating. Even though rapid humoral and T cell responses were induced by the vaccine, pre-existing anti-Ad5 immunity partially diminished the immune responses among healthy adults.

 </sup> To address the pre-existing immunity to Ad, chimpanzee Ad (ChAdOX1) represents an alternative solution that provided broad protective immunity against the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

 </sup> An investigational vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 from the University of Oxford is based on this vector.

 </sup> Their preclinical study showed the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in rhesus macaques with no evidence of subsequent immune-enhanced diseases.

 </sup> However, viral loads were more significantly reduced in the lower respiratory tract but not in the nasal swabs. In general, because of previous vaccine programs, the manufacturing capacity and protocols for this method are already well-established; therefore, less effort may be needed to shift toward the large-scale production of vector-based vaccines. However, both the pre-existing immunity toward certain vectors and previously demonstrated safety concerns over the increased risk of human immunodeficient virus type 1 (HIV-1) acquisition should be carefully evaluated.
