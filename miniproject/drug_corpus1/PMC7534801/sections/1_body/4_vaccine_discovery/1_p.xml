<p>After a virus is identified, different categories of vaccines can be developed, which includes virus-, viral vector-, nucleic acid-, protein/peptide-, and/or cell-based vaccines (

 </sup> Virus-based vaccines commonly require patient-derived viruses, while other types can utilize the viral genomic sequences to accelerate vaccine development. Previously approved vaccines mostly fall into the virus-based and the recombinant protein-based categories, but not into the nucleic acid-based one (
