<p>DCs are the most potent antigen-presenting cells (APCs) at the interface of innate and adaptive immunity to sense the “danger signals”, process the antigens, and present the nonself-antigens.

 </sup> Unlike other types of vaccines, DC vaccines are manipulated 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> to be antigen-specific, and thus they are ready to initiate immune responses after being reinfused 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. The DC vaccine is quality controllable and natively able to traffic efficiently 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Different methodologies have been developed to produce modified DC vaccines 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic>, including loading DCs with immunogenic peptides or proteins (subunit DCs), viral transduction to express immunogenic peptides,

 </sup> Different strategies may produce DC vaccines with different potency, for instance, genetically modified DCs may be more efficacious in immune activation than subunit DC vaccines.

 </sup> In addition, supplementary immunomodulatory genes could be incorporated to enhance the potency. However, the process of producing cell-based vaccines is labor-intensive and expensive.

 </sup> Thus, this method could be the most challenging to be scaled up as a universal vaccine for a global pandemic.
