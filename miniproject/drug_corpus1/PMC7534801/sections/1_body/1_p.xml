<p>The pathway from identifying a virus to having a vaccine is lengthy and expensive. After billions of dollars spent and multiple years of trials, researchers generally face high rates of failure in the traditional vaccine development paradigms (

 </sup> Despite rapid responses from the scientific community and the pharmaceutical industry, vaccines have historically not been ready even after an epidemic becomes manageable, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Zika, and Ebola.

 </sup> Considering economic factors, funding for vaccine development may be reallocated after a substantial drop in infection cases is observed, as in the 2015–2016 Zika and SARS epidemics. The 2014–2016 Ebola outbreak in Africa resulted in over 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths.

 </sup> After continuous research funding support, in December 2019, the FDA granted the first approval to Ervebo (a single-dose, live attenuated virus vaccine from Merck) for Ebola virus prevention.

 </sup> Benefiting from egg- and cell-based platforms, vaccine approval for the most recent 2009 H1N1 pandemic was relatively fast following the peak of the outbreak, and the vaccine was ultimately incorporated in the seasonal influenza vaccine.

 </sup> Since the initiation and ending of epidemics are highly unpredictable, the rapid deployment of vaccine development may still be too slow for a sudden outbreak.
