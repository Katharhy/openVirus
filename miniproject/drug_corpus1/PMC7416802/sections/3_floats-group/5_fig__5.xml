  <p>The effect of LIF on responses against the pathogenesis of infection (adapted from Quinton et al. [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">170</xref>]). Earlier studies highlighted the importance of LIF in the activation of STAT3 and the role of LIF in treatment [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">173</xref>] or its over-regulation [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">174</xref>], which can lead to the inhibition of pulmonary inflammation. This experiment demonstrates the protective role of LIF in the case of lung trauma. Lungs were acquired from experimental mice one day after the introduction of 
   <italic>E. coli</italic> in the presence of anti-LIF or control IgG. (A) Images of newly isolated lungs with stained lung parts. Red circles indicate infection in the lobes of lungs. (B) Ratios of wet:dry lungs demonstrating the effect of anti-LIF treatment (shown as the mean ± SEM. *, 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). In the presence of anti-LIF treatment, LIF was not detected, whereas the levels of the remaining cytokines were not significantly changed by this treatment. LIFNanoRx contains nanoparticles of LIF with one-thousand-fold the strength of soluble LIF, and the LIF released slowly over a period of days. LIFNano® is a second-generation LIF for the protection of lungs
