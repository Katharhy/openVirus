<p id="Par58">Ribavirin was approved in the 1980s for viral hemorrhagic fever, respiratory syncytial virus infection, and hepatitis C, together with interferon. It is a guanosine analogue known for interfering with transcription by inhibiting the synthesis of RNA. The combination of ribavirin with corticosteroids and/or interferon against SARS-CoV-1 did not show promising results [

The innate antiviral response is triggered by interferon (α, β) and was investigated in SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV infections. When interferon was used in combination with ribavirin, the mortality rate was not improved. Furthermore, the following side effects were observed: neuropsychiatric events, fatal ischemia, hepatotoxicity and cytopenia [

Despite these observations, the Chinese guidelines recommend ribavirin 500 mg IV 2–3 times daily in combination with LPV/r or inhaled interferon-α (5 million units nebulized twice daily) as one of the “standard treatment” options for COVID-19. Due to limited data and a lack of experimental trials, it is not safe to use ribavirin at the moment for the treatment of COVID-19.
