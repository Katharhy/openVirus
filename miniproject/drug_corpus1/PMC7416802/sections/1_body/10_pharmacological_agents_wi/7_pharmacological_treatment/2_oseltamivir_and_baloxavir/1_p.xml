<p id="Par59">Oseltamivir and baloxavir are both used as anti-influenza agents. Currently, oseltamivir is under investigation for COVID-19 treatment. In Wuhan, it was administered to COVID-19 patients in combination with antibiotics. At that time, the causative agent of the disease was not known, and an attempt was made to treat it as though it were influenza. As stated previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>], oseltamivir was ineffective against SARS-CoV because coronaviruses do not have neuraminidase and are therefore not affected by neuraminidase inhibitors. The same is true for other neuraminidase inhibitors such as zanamivir and peramivir. Currently, the available data also do not support the use of baloxavir against COVID-19. These drugs can be effective against influenza, but once the patient has recovered from influenza, their administration should be stopped.
