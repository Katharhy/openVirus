<p id="Par55">This drug has been investigated for its potency against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, with acceptable EC
 <sub>50</sub> values [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. These values are consistent with the values for the drug and its metabolite, known as tizoxanide, obtained in a study with MERS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>]. Nitazoxanide is a broad-spectrum drug that is reported to be active against various commonly known viruses as well as CoVs due to its antiviral activity, which is assumed to be due to the disruption of the host-mediated pathways that the virus uses for its replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>]. It is under evaluation for its potency against respiratory viruses. In one study, oral administration (&lt; 500 mg) of this drug led to an improvement in clinical features in approximately 24 h in patients with influenza [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>]. This outcome led to investigation in three more phase III clinical trials, which have now been completed, but the study findings are not yet available at this time. However, nitazoxanide treatment did not lead to a decrease in the duration of patients’ stay in the hospital or their symptoms in phase II clinical trials [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>]. While the use of nitazoxanide against COVID-19 might prove to be efficacious, data from clinical trials are still needed.
