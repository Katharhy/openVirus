<p id="Par45">Vaccines against numerous CoV-associated diseases have already been developed for use in animals, including those caused by canine coronavirus, feline coronavirus, and contagious bronchitis virus in birds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Previously, attempts were made to develop a vaccine for the management of MERS and SARS caused by viruses of the family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> that infect humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The vaccines mentioned above have been tested clinically on research-centered or laboratory-use animal models, and as of 2020, no vaccine or remedy has been demonstrated to be completely safe and efficacious in humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Globally, the management of SARS using novel therapeutic medications or vaccines is a goal of governmental and public health sector organizations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. No approved vaccine against MERS is available [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and the current SARS research was considered a suitable template for the development of medications or vaccines against MERS-CoV illness during the time that it was prevalent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. By March 2020, one DNA-based MERS vaccine has been tested in human-based clinical trials (phase I), and three other vaccines were in the development stage. All of these vaccines were viral-vectored, including one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S) vaccine and two adenoviral-vectored vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS and BVRS-GamVac) [
