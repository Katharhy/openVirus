<p id="Par25">Coronaviruses (CoVs) were originally found in chickens, after which they were visualized microscopically for the first time by scientists in the twentieth century [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. They are round, enveloped RNA viruses with spiked projections on their surface, which gives them the appearance of a crown, hence the name [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Usually, these viruses have a zoonotic origin and can cause potentially lethal disease in humans. Bats are the natural reservoir for a wide variety of viruses, with numerous species of bats being hosts to approximately four thousand viruses, including CoVs and deadlier viruses such as Ebola virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The CoVs transmitted by bats are genetically related to other CoVs such as those causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which cause pneumonia and related diseases in humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The novel CoV, officially termed SARS-CoV-2, and other betacoronaviruses (β-CoVs) have been were found to be closely related (more than 90% sequence identity) to a CoV strain found in bats [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It has therefore been suggested that bats were the original reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 and that the virus was transmitted to humans through an intermediate host after accumulating a number of mutations.
