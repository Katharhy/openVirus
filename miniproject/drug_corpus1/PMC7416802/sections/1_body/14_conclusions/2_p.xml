<p id="Par73">COVID-19 has a low fatality rate, and deaths can be prevented by applying prophylactic measures in the absence of typical treatment. Strict implementation of control regimes is essential to prevent the spread of infection. Medical staff and healthcare personnel should check the travel history of infected patients, along with potential sources of exposure and evident symptoms. Paramedics fighting on the front line against COVID-19 should implement effective and thorough protection initiatives for people vulnerable to viral infection.</p>
