<p id="Par37">SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs through the mucosal membrane of the upper respiratory tract [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Recent research has suggested two possible modes of transmission. The virus can spread by through direct transmission via respiratory droplets or by indirect transmission via surfaces and materials contaminated with the virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in fecal samples from infected patients, suggesting that it can spread via the fecal-nasal route [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The transmission of the virus also occurs in the form of aerosol through the air. However, this mode of transmission only occurs under certain conditions where there is a risk of contamination through samples from infected patients in small and compact spaces.
