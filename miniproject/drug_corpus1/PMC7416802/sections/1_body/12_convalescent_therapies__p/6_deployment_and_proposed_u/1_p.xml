<p id="Par68">For administering convalescent serum to COVID-19 patients, standard protocols should be followed. The convalescent serum can be administered if the following conditions are fulfilled: (i) the presence of a proper virology lab to deal with the virus, (ii) approval of the planned research proposal and its details by an institutional review committee, (iii) availability of serum from individuals who recently recovered from COVID-19 disease, (iv) proper serum donation facilities, (v) availability of serological and virological assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in serum and quantification of neutralization activity, (vi) and standard protocols for assessment of any changes in immune response. Administering purified antibodies is preferable to using convalescent serum because of their efficiency and activity. This project is being worked on by a pharmaceutical company, Takeda [

The “standard operating procedures” (SOPs) should be defined and followed strictly. It is assumed that the patients who have recuperated successfully from SARS-CoV-2 infection can be safely requested to donate their blood to obtain antibodies. However, these patients must be declared negative for the virus, which can be tested through appropriate screening measures, and the donated blood should also be critically screened for any infectious agents and blood type. It is also imperative to screen every serum sample to determine its antibody titer. Currently, the neutralization titer and required dosage of antibodies are unknown, and this should be a fundamental part of clinical studies focusing on the evaluation of this therapy for treatment of COVID-19. Previous studies have reported the amount of convalescent sera used against measles to be in the range of 0–50 cc. In contrast, in the case of severe influenza, several hundred milliliters of sera have been used and found to be effective [

However, there was no previous backing data on the effective concentration of neutralizing antibodies, indicating that even minute concentrations can aid in the prevention or subsequent treatment of infection. Therefore, prophylaxis against of infection by providing small doses might be efficacious, whereas larger doses may be needed to treat disease, as the viral load at the onset of the disease is much lower than during the peak of the disease. The serum of recuperated patients of COVID-19 can be employed in the treatment of patients displaying onset of disease [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">165</xref>]. Many healthcare staff and paramedics who have been exposed to the virus by treating infected patients have been advised to quarantine or self-isolate, which greatly increases the disease burden on the remaining health care officials. This burden might be lessened by the passive administration of antibodies, which might reduce the length of quarantine and allow medical staff to continue to perform their duties. This can also be extended to the members of the family tending to an infected patient, which can prevent cross-infection and the spread of disease. However, the distribution of convalescent sera, even at a regional level, requires close cooperation between officials at the administrative and medical level, who can safely orchestrate the production and use of this therapy against the COVID-19 pandemic.
