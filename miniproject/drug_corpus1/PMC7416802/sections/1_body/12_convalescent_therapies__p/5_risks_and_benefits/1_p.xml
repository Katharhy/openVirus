<p id="Par66">Serum antibodies from recovered patients can be effective for treatment of COVID-19 patients, primarily because they offer protection to both already infected patients and those who are at risk of infection. In medical practice, this type of treatment is frequently employed as a precautionary measure. For treatment of HBV and rabies, immunoglobulins (HBIG and HRIG, respectively) are administered to infected individuals, and they are used for treatment of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease in susceptible children. Previously, for both prevention and treatment, a polyclonal immunoglobulin was used that was obtained from donors, but this practice has been replaced by the use of palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody.</p>
