<p id="Par61">Nitric oxide gas is a human-friendly gas due to the following features: (i) it improves the oxygen supply to bloodstream and thus blood flow in the lungs, (ii) it prevents clot formation, (iii) it destroys toxins, and (iv) it causes the relaxation of the right side of the heart, which is under direct pressure during cardiac arrest.
