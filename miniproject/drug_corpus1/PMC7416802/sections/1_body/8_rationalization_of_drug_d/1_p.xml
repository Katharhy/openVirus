A program of augmented therapeutics for COVID-19 management was initiated in March, encouraging researchers and health care professionals to recognize, evaluate, and scale-up potential medications or regimens quickly. In March 2020, CEPI invested US $100 million to finance different research projects in various countries and also invested US $2 billion to quickly develop a vaccine. The COVID-19 Clinical Research Coalition (CRC) was designed to organize, explore, and compile results from globally operated clinical trials investigating the most efficacious post-infection treatment regimen [
