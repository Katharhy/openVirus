  <title>Findings</title>
  <p>In this 3-group randomized clinical trial involving 440 participants, the combined intervention and brief intervention, which both incorporated motivational enhancement therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy, significantly increased the percentage of days abstinent from alcohol at 12 months compared with the standard of care. Viral suppression at 12 months was significantly higher after the brief intervention than standard of care but not significantly higher after the combined intervention than standard of care.</p>
