<p>The study was designed to have 80% power to detect the following: (1) greater than 50% effect size in percentage of abstinent days at 12-month follow-up minus baseline, comparing the combined intervention vs SOC (or the brief intervention vs SOC); (2) greater than 35% effect size in percentage abstinent days at 12-month follow-up minus baseline, comparing the combined intervention vs the brief intervention; and (3) greater than 6% change in viral suppression at 12-month follow-up minus baseline, comparing the combined intervention vs SOC (or the brief intervention vs SOC). For each outcome, we evaluated the extent to which the mean values differed across groups after baseline by intention-to-treat. To do this, first we estimated the proportion of patients in each of the 3 groups for whom the outcome was measured and compared among groups using the deviance χ
 <sup>2</sup> test. We also estimated the mean outcome level in each group and compared among groups using a Wald χ
 <sup>2</sup> test. We also assessed the possibility of selectively differential attrition across arms at each postbaseline visit. To do this, we estimated and compared the mean baseline outcome among groups for the patients who provided outcome data at that postbaseline visit. If an imbalance was found, we also produced postbaseline regression-adjusted outcome estimates by recalibrating the baseline distribution of that group to the baseline distribution across all groups combined.

 </sup> In short, the overall group distribution of the baseline outcome can be estimated at each value 
 <italic>x</italic> as 1 / total sample size 
 <italic>n</italic>. Therefore, if the regression of the mean postbaseline outcome 
 <italic>y</italic> given baseline value 
 <italic>x</italic> within arm 
 <italic>a</italic> is estimated as ȳ
