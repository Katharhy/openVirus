<p>Participants were randomly assigned to the combined intervention, the brief intervention, or the SOC group at a ratio of 1:1:1. To achieve this, a randomization schedule was generated in SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute) using permuted-block randomization with a block size of 3, such that each block contained a random assignment to each of the 3 groups. Participants randomly assigned within 1 triplet block all belonged to the same ART clinic. Masking in the field was not feasible due to the nature of the intervention; however, analysts and principal investigators were masked to study assignment until the analyses for this paper were complete.</p>
