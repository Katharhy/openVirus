 </sup> the combined intervention is more resource-intensive than the brief intervention ($30 additional cost per participant); however, the brief intervention was at least as, if not more, effective than the combined intervention on biologically validated alcohol measures and viral suppression. Part of the explanation for our findings may be that, given the lack of alcohol reduction programs in Vietnam, even 2 in-person sessions and 2 telephone sessions of alcohol reduction counseling can increase awareness of the harms of alcohol and teach coping skills to manage high risk moods and/or situations for alcohol use. Importantly, these results underscore that a brief intervention provided by paraprofessional counselors effectively reduced alcohol consumption and increased viral suppression among people with hazardous or heavy drinking being treated in ART clinics. Practical implications include integrating the brief intervention into ART clinics and screening for ART clients with hazardous drinking. Our findings highlight the need for a rigorously evaluated implementation study in multiple settings to evaluate whether the same results could be achieved in real-world settings in a wide variety of low- to middle-income countries.
