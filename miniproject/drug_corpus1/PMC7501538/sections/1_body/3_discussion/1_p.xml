<p>In this randomized clinical trial, we observed that alcohol reduction can be achieved through a brief intervention, leading to substantial improvement in viral suppression. Both integrated alcohol reduction interventions, the combined intervention and brief intervention, led to increased percentage of days abstinent from alcohol compared with standard of care; this effect was sustained during 12 months. Notably, self-reported percentage of days abstinent using the timeline follow-back interview was validated using the alcohol biomarker phosphatidylethanol. In the 12-month visit, the proportion of virally suppressed participants increased by 5% in the brief intervention group and dropped by 6% in the SOC group. In the combined intervention arm, the proportion of patients who had viral suppression stayed approximately the same across visits. The 11% difference in viral suppression between the brief intervention and SOC groups more than halved the proportion of participants who were not virally suppressed and has major clinical implications for transmission in this high-risk population.</p>
