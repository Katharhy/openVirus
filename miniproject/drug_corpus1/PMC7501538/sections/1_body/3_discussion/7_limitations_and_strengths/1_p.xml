<p>This study has limitations. Self-reported alcohol abstinence is susceptible to social desirability bias. To assess the extent of this bias, we compared phosphatidylethanol level of less than 8 ng/mL, the established cut-off for abstinence, to self-reported alcohol abstinence. Only 1% to 6% reported no alcohol use in the past 21 days but had phosphatidylethanol levels of greater than 8 ng/mL, suggesting social desirability at play. However, we saw a similar percentage of those with phosphatidylethanol levels of less than 8 ng/mL who reported alcohol use in the past 21 days, suggesting possible imperfections in either or both measures that work in both directions. Therefore, while there was a strong association between phosphatidylethanol levels of less than 8 ng/mL and self-reported alcohol abstinence, it is still unclear how to best use phosphatidylethanol.</p>
