<p>This study also has several strengths. The interventions were designed to be scalable. Both interventions were conducted in the very clinic settings in which they could be implemented during scale-up. By integrating into an existing structure and enrolling current ART clients, we had the opportunity to evaluate the interventions in real-world clinic settings to directly inform future scale-up.

 </sup> and was relatively higher for the brief intervention, which was expected given the lower burden on the participants (ie, 6 in-person sessions vs 2 in-person sessions plus 2 brief telephone sessions). Duration of sessions, including the brief intervention telephone sessions, was also longer than expected, reflecting high engagement during the sessions. Counselor fidelity to the intervention manual was also acceptable.
