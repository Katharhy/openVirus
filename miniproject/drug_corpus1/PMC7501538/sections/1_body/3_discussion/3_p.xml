<p>Heavy alcohol use among PWH is prevalent and is associated with lower ART adherence, lower rates of viral suppression, and increased sexual and injecting risk behaviors.

 </sup> People who drink alcohol excessively may be more likely to become HIV infected.

 </sup> But higher rates of drinking among PWH is likely due in part to coping with the stress of HIV-related stigma and negative life events, such as an HIV diagnosis, as well as lack of social support.

 </sup> Training in alternative means of coping may both reduce alcohol use and enhance well-being. But alcohol treatment has rarely been incorporated into HIV care settings. In the United States, a stepped alcohol treatment intervention for patients with HIV and alcohol use disorder incorporating a physician-managed medication-based intervention, motivational enhancement therapy, and referral to intensive outpatient or residential treatment led to improvements in the proportion of days abstinent and the proportion of patients with an undetectable HIV viral load at 52 weeks.

 </sup> We showed the effects of 2 counseling-only interventions on these same outcomes at 52 weeks, which, unlike physician-managed medication-based interventions, can be realistically scaled in low-resource settings. Specifically, both the combined and brief interventions have a highly structured format that are manualized and can be delivered by trained paraprofessionals. Notably, alcohol reduction and associated improvement in viral load were achieved in patients who were drinking at hazardous or heavy levels but were not seeking alcohol treatment.
