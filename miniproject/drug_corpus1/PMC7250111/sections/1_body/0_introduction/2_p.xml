<p id="p0015">The antiviral properties of CQ were first explored against viral hepatitis as far back as 1963 [

 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>]. Yet the ultimate test for their benefit as antivirals comes from human clinical studies, and to our knowledge neither of these drugs is used as a mainstream antiviral agent for any viral infection. This review focuses on the clinical evidence for using CQ and HCQ as antiviral agents against any viral infection. This reflection and summary of evidence is needed in the current context for judicious, evidence-based recommendations for off-label use of these drugs. Even when such evidence may be incomplete or unavailable for emerging infections such as COVID-19, historical attempts for repurposing these agents for other emerging viral infections from time to time may draw parallels with the current scenario to inform a rational approach to clinical trials and guideline recommendations.
