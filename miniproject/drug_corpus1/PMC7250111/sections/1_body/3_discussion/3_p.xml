<p id="p0120">For COVID-19 we are unsure whether either CQ or HCQ is of any benefit as per currently available evidence (very-low-certainty evidence). The only peer-reviewed publication describing an RCT on using HCQ for COVID-19 was a small trial that did not demonstrate any benefit of HCQ. The other peer-reviewed publication which did show a benefit was an open-label, non-randomized trial with a serious risk of bias in sample selection, confounders and assessing outcomes. The sample size was small, and there was a marked age discrepancy (of approximately 14 years) between test and control groups. Administration of azithromycin to six subjects who also received HCQ does not seem to be based on an 
 <italic>a priori</italic> hypothesis or a study protocol. Some control-group patients were from a different centre, and it is unclear whether management protocols in the two institutions were the same. More importantly, it is now established that most patients with COVID-19 (&gt;95%) will recover after a mild infection regardless of antiviral treatment. Therefore, the primary outcome assessed in this study (clearance of viraemia) is less useful for patient management compared to outcomes that demonstrate a benefit in the more severe end of the disease spectrum, such as mortality benefit, reduction in intensive care unit admissions, or faster discharge from intensive care (or high dependency units), faster recovery from assisted ventilation or prevention of the need for assisted ventilation. Examining such outcomes requires a well-coordinated multicentre study (preferably with a randomized, double-blind study design) with similar management protocols across all centres. The other two studies from China (available as preprints) mentioned in the results section also does not help to resolve this issue because of methodological issues and conflicting conclusions. For example, in one of these studies [
