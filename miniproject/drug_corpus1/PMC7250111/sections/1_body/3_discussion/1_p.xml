<p id="p0110">Despite being researched for several decades and being supported by a large volume of 
 <italic>inÂ vitro</italic> and animal study data for plausible mechanisms for antiviral effects, neither HCQ nor CQ is currently recommended as an antiviral agent for any of the infections for which they were tested in clinical trials (with the exception of COVID-19 which is an evolving situation at the time of writing). The most researched infection in this regard is HIV. However, mainstream antiretroviral treatment in HIV is highly successful in viral load suppression, allowing reasonable control of the disease though it is not a cure. These newer combinations have not been tested against CQ/HCQ, and given the inconsistent evidence from existing trials in this regard there is no need to do such tests. The same can be said of HCV infection where pan-genotypic direct-acting antiviral agents can now achieve &gt;90% cure rates with minimum adverse events [
