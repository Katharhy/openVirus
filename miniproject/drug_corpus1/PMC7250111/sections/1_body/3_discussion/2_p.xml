<p id="p0115">In contrast, for acute viral infections such as dengue, chikungunya or COVID-19, effective antivirals are not available. These infections cause epidemics in vulnerable populations, exerting an enormous financial burden on resource-limited healthcare systems. For dengue fever, given the evidence presented here we conclude that CQ is of no benefit (high-certainty evidence). This conclusion is supported by a single well-designed RCT with an adequate sample size and a low risk of bias. CQ may have little or no effect in curing acute chikungunya infection (low-certainty evidence) and this conclusion is supported by a small clinical trial which may have inadvertently recruited people with more severe disease to the CQ arm despite randomization.</p>
