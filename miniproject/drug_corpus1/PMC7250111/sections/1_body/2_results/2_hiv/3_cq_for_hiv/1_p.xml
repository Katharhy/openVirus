<p id="p0060">Two double-blind RCTs enrolled adult patients with HIV (CQ 150–300 mg base/d, 8–12 weeks) [
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and one open-label trial enrolled paediatric patients (CQ 4 mg/kg/d for 24 weeks) [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The smallest trial had 13 patients [
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] while the largest had 70 patients [
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The comparators were either placebo [
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] or zidovudine plus didanosine (paediatric trial) [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Both adult trials enrolled patients with a CD4 cell count of at least 250/μL and demonstrated a modestly beneficial immunomodulatory effect of CQ (a significant decline in activated CD8 cells) [
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, in one trial which had a complex cross-over design, the HIV viral load increased when CQ was administered without any other antiretroviral therapy [
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. There was no significant virological or immunological improvement with CQ in the third (paediatric) trial [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] but significantly more gastrointestinal adverse events were observed with CQ.
