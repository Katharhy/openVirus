<p id="p0080">Chikungunya is a viral illness endemic in the tropics. Acute infection mimics a viral flu and sometimes leads to a debilitating, persistent inflammatory arthritis. There was only one RCT that had evaluated CQ as an antiviral agent (none evaluated HCQ) in acute chikungunya infection. This double-blind RCT, conducted in French Reunion Islands in 2006, enrolled 54 adult patients with virologically confirmed acute chikungunya infection to receive either CQ (600 mg of base/day for 3 days followed by 300 mg/d for 2 days) or placebo [

When followed up at day 200 (since onset of symptoms) by a telephone interview, the CQ-treated group was significantly more likely to have persistent arthralgia. However, a later analysis of cytokines and chemokines from plasma samples revealed higher levels of IFNα, IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1 in the group that received CQ (more severe disease at baseline and hence increased likelihood of persistent arthralgia) [
