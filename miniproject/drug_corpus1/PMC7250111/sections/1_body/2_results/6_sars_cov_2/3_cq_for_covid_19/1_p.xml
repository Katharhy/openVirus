<p id="p0105">There are two published RCTs on using CQ for COVID-19. The first study from China randomized 22 virologically confirmed COVID-19 patients to receive either a lopinavir/ritonavir combination or CQ 600 mg (base)/day for 10 days [
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. There was no statistically significant difference for having a negative RT-PCR by day 14 of illness (10/10 in the CQ group versus 11/12). However, on average, the lopinavir/ritonavir group had started treatment later than those in the CQ group (2.5 versus 6.5 days from the onset of illness, p &lt; 0.001). The second RCT was a dose-ranging study for CQ which did not have a no-CQ comparator group [
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It randomized 81 patients clinically suspected of having COVID-19 to receive either CQ 12 g over 10 days or CQ 2.7 g over 5 days. Diagnosis was later confirmed (virologically) in 31 patients in each group. The recruits had severe infection at the time of enrolment as defined by tachycardia, tachypnoea, oxygen saturation &lt;90%, and hypotension. Recruitment to the high-dose arm was terminated early (by day 13) as mortality was significantly higher in this group (15% versus 39%, p 0.03).
