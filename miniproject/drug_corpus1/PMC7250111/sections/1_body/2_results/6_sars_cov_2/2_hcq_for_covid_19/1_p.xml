 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and two non-peer-reviewed preprints (two RCTs) on this topic [
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. A third study (from the USA) available on MedRxiv as a preprint was excluded as it was a retrospective analysis [
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The only peer-reviewed publication of an RCT (in Mandarin, abstract in English) was not indexed in any of the databases searched and was identified from a secondary bibliography search. It describes a randomized clinical trial (NCT04261517) that recruited 15 non-severe, confirmed COVID-19 patients to an HCQ arm (400 mg/d for 5 days) and a no-HCQ arm [
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Clearance of viraemia (RT-PCR of a throat swab) by day 7, fever clearance time, and total duration of hospital stay were similar between the two groups. A non-randomized controlled trial from Marseille, France (full-paper reviewed) enrolled 26 patients with virologically confirmed COVID-19 to receive HCQ 600 mg/d [
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Twenty patients completed HCQ treatment (six patients also received azithromycin) and all had radiological evidence of pneumonia (CT scan). The control group (
 <italic>n</italic> = 16) was younger (mean age; 51.2 versus 37.3 years) and had patients treated at another institution or those treated at the same institution but refusing HCQ. More patients in the HCQ group were virologically cured by day 6 (70% versus 12.5%, p 0.001), including all patients who received azithromycin.
