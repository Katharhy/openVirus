<p id="p0090">The ongoing epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 disease (referred to as COVID -19) is rapidly evolving. Potential use of CQ for COVID-19 associated pneumonia first emerged in February 2020 based on several Chinese studies, and an expert consensus from Guangdong Province of China (abstract in English) recommends using CQ 500 mg (presumably 300 mg of CQ base) two times daily for 10 days to treat patients with COVID-19-associated pneumonia [
