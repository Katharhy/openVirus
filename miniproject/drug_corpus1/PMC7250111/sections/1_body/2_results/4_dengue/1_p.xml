<p id="p0075">Two studies had assessed CQ for dengue infection (none assessed HCQ). A double-blind RCT (

 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) or placebo to clinically suspected dengue patients within the first 3 days of fever. A large proportion of the enrolments (84%) were later confirmed to have dengue. CQ failed to demonstrate a clinical benefit in any of the following—clearance of viraemia, clearance of NS1 antigen positivity, fever clearance time, prevention of dengue haemorrhagic fever, prevention of a decrease in platelet count or increase in haematocrit (surrogate markers of dengue-associated plasma leakage)—but significantly increased gastrointestinal adverse events (p &lt; 0.05) [

The second study enrolled 129 patients with clinically suspected dengue to a two-arm randomized controlled trial to receive either 600 mg CQ base/d for 3 days or placebo. Only 37 participants were later confirmed to have dengue (19 in the CQ group, 18 in the placebo group) [
