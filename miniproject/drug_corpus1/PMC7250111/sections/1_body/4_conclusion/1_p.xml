<p id="p0130">CQ and HCQ have been examined for their antiviral properties in many 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and animal studies for more than five decades and in a limited number of human clinical studies spanning over 25 years. For HIV and HCV infections, the benefit of either drug is doubtful and perhaps no longer relevant as other effective treatments are now available for viral load suppression (HIV) or cure (HCV). There is good evidence that CQ is ineffective in curing dengue infection or preventing dengue haemorrhagic fever. CQ also may not have any benefit in curing acute chikungunya infection. A role for HCQ or CQ in COVID-19 is as yet unclear and needs to be assessed by well-designed randomized double-blind clinical trials.
