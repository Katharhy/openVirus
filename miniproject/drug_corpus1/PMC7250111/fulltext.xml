Two authors independently screened abstracts, and all authors agreed on eligible studies. A meta-analysis was planned if studies were available which were similar in terms of participants, intervention, comparator and outcomes. Nineteen studies (including two preprints) were eligible (HIV 8, HCV 2, dengue 2, chikungunya 1, COVID-19 6). Nine and ten studies assessed CQ and HCQ respectively. Benefits of either drug for viral load suppression in HIV are inconsistent. CQ is ineffective in curing dengue (high-certainty evidence) and may have little or no benefit in curing chikungunya (low-certainty evidence).

Chloroquine (CQ), a well-established antimalarial agent, and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a similarly established disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD), have both received increased attention in recent days for their purported efficacy as antiviral agents in the context of COVID-19. Both drugs are out-of-patent, cheap, and widely available in high-, middle- and low-income countries.</p><p id="p0015">The antiviral properties of CQ were first explored against viral hepatitis as far back as 1963 [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Since then many observations from <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> and animal experiments have suggested a beneficial role of HCQ and CQ in viral infections [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>]. Yet the ultimate test for their benefit as antivirals comes from human clinical studies, and to our knowledge neither of these drugs is used as a mainstream antiviral agent for any viral infection. This review focuses on the clinical evidence for using CQ and HCQ as antiviral agents against any viral infection. This reflection and summary of evidence is needed in the current context for judicious, evidence-based recommendations for off-label use of these drugs. Even when such evidence may be incomplete or unavailable for emerging infections such as COVID-19, historical attempts for repurposing these agents for other emerging viral infections from time to time may draw parallels with the current scenario to inform a rational approach to clinical trials and guideline recommendations.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Study selection criteria</title><sec id="sec2.1.1"><title>Types of studies</title><p id="p0020">Interventional and observational studies (controlled and non-controlled), including case series, were considered, but case reports limited to single patients were excluded.

. Bibliographies of eligible articles were also searched. The date of the last search was 30th April 2020. Two authors searched and selected abstracts independently, and all authors identified studies for full-text review by consensus. The following data items were extracted from each included study: study design and location, viral infection and diagnostic criteria, participant demographics, intervention and control groups (if any), drug doses, primary and secondary outcomes, and adverse events attributable to therapy. A meta-analysis was planned if any clinical trials were comparable in terms of participants, interventions, comparators and outcomes. Risk of bias for all randomized controlled studies, regardless of whether published or deposited as preprints, were assessed according to Cochrane guidelines [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Risk of bias in non-randomized trials with more than one intervention was assessed with the ROBINS-I tool [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. All other study designs were considered to have an inherent high risk of bias. Certainty of evidence was assessed for each infection (only from randomized controlled trials, RCTs) according to the GRADE recommendations [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Uncontrolled studies and RCTs available only as preprints were not considered for assessing certainty of evidence.<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Search strategy (last date of search 30th April 2020)</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0020">Table&#x000a0;1</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Database</th><th>Search terms</th><th>Field limits</th><th>Language limits</th><th>Time limits</th><th>Comments</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>PUBMED</td><td>&#x02018;hydroxychloroquine AND antivir&#x02217;&#x02019;, &#x02018;chloroquine AND antivir&#x02217;&#x02019;, &#x02018;Hydroxychloroquine AND virus&#x02019; and &#x02018;chloroquine AND virus&#x02019;</td><td>None</td><td>None</td><td>None</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Scopus</td><td>As above</td><td>Title, Keywords or Abstract</td><td>None</td><td>None</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Web of Science</td><td>As above</td><td>None</td><td>None</td><td>None</td><td/></tr><tr><td>EMBASE</td><td>As above</td><td>None</td><td>None</td><td>None</td><td/></tr><tr><td>CENTRAL</td><td>&#x0201c;hydroxychloroquine&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;chloroquine&#x0201d;</td><td>None</td><td>None</td><td>2015&#x02013;2020</td><td>Any unpublished/incomplete trial registered prior to 6&#x000a0;years was considered as unlikely to be completed</td></tr><tr><td>Chinese Clinical Trials Registry</td><td>&#x0201c;hydroxychloroquine&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;chloroquine&#x0201d;</td><td>None</td><td>None</td><td>2015&#x02013;2020</td><td>As above</td></tr><tr><td>MedRxiv</td><td>&#x0201c;hydroxychloroquine&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;chloroquine&#x0201d;</td><td>Title or Abstract</td><td>None</td><td>Within 12&#x000a0;months</td><td>Once a preprint is deposited, if the study met peer-review standards for publication, it is likely to have been published within this time frame</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Results</title><p id="p0045">A total of 2267 abstract results were found from all databases after removing duplicates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>
). The majority of these (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2026) were published after 1990. After removing retrospective studies, <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> and animal studies, reviews, letters, opinion papers and editorials, only 209 abstracts remained. Further examination identified 26 articles for full-text review, revealing a significant disparity with the large number of articles demonstrating <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> evidence for antiviral effects of HCQ and CQ. Only 19 publications (including two preprints) from this subset met the inclusion criteria. One full-text paper was in Mandarin but had an English abstract. The studies included randomized and non-randomized controlled trials and uncontrolled prospective studies equivalent to case series. These had tested the efficacy of CQ and HCQ in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), dengue, chikungunya, hepatitis C and COVID-19 infections. A meta-analysis was not performed due to unavailability of similar studies.

Ongoing trials are listed in <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;3</xref>.</p><sec id="sec3.5.1"><title>HCQ for COVID-19</title><p id="p0095">There are two peer-reviewed publications (one RCT and a non-randomized controlled study) [<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and two non-peer-reviewed preprints (two RCTs) on this topic [<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. A third study (from the USA) available on MedRxiv as a preprint was excluded as it was a retrospective analysis [<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The only peer-reviewed publication of an RCT (in Mandarin, abstract in English) was not indexed in any of the databases searched and was identified from a secondary bibliography search. It describes a randomized clinical trial (NCT04261517) that recruited 15 non-severe, confirmed COVID-19 patients to an HCQ arm (400 mg/d for 5&#x000a0;days) and a no-HCQ arm [<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Clearance of viraemia (RT-PCR of a throat swab) by day 7, fever clearance time, and total duration of hospital stay were similar between the two groups. A non-randomized controlled trial from Marseille, France (full-paper reviewed) enrolled 26 patients with virologically confirmed COVID-19 to receive HCQ 600 mg/d [<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Twenty patients completed HCQ treatment (six patients also received azithromycin) and all had radiological evidence of pneumonia (CT scan). The control group (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;16) was younger (mean age; 51.2 versus 37.3&#x000a0;years) and had patients treated at another institution or those treated at the same institution but refusing HCQ. More patients in the HCQ group were virologically cured by day 6 (70% versus 12.5%, p 0.001), including all patients who received azithromycin.</p><p id="p0100">Results of two more RCTs from China on using HCQ in COVID-19 are available as preprints [<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The largest was a multicentre open-label clinical trial (ChiCTR2000029868) that enrolled 150 virologically confirmed COVID-19 patients (75 per group) to receive HCQ plus standard care (as defined by Chinese guidelines for COVID-19 management) or standard care only [<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The HCQ group received 200 mg/d for 3&#x000a0;days followed by 800 mg/d for 14&#x02013;21&#x000a0;days. Only two patients (one in each group) had severe illness. There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of aviraemic patients by day 28 (85.4% in the HCQ group versus 81.3% in the control group, p&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;0.05). There was also no difference in time to aviraemia or symptom resolution by day 28. Many secondary outcomes proposed in methods&#x02014;including all-cause mortality&#x02014;are not reported in results, presumably due to lack of events. The second study (ChiCTR2000029559) enrolled and randomized 62 virologically confirmed COVID-19 patients with evidence of pneumonia on CT scan to receive HCQ (400 mg/d for 5&#x000a0;days) or no HCQ treatment (31 in each group). The respiratory distress was not severe (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FIO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003e;300 or SaO<sub>2</sub>/SPO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003e;93%) at enrolment in all recruits. The authors report faster time to clinical recovery (defined as normalization of body temperature and cough relief maintained for 72&#x000a0;h) and earlier radiological improvement in the HCQ group, but the calculations and radiological reporting standards for these conclusions are unclear. Four patients in the control group versus none in the HCQ group progressed to severe illness.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.5.2"><title>CQ for COVID-19</title><p id="p0105">There are two published RCTs on using CQ for COVID-19. The first study from China randomized 22 virologically confirmed COVID-19 patients to receive either a lopinavir/ritonavir combination or CQ 600 mg (base)/day for 10&#x000a0;days [<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. There was no statistically significant difference for having a negative RT-PCR by day 14 of illness (10/10 in the CQ group versus 11/12). However, on average, the lopinavir/ritonavir group had started treatment later than those in the CQ group (2.5 versus 6.5&#x000a0;days from the onset of illness, p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001). The second RCT was a dose-ranging study for CQ which did not have a no-CQ comparator group [<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It randomized 81 patients clinically suspected of having COVID-19 to receive either CQ 12 g over 10&#x000a0;days or CQ 2.7 g over 5&#x000a0;days. Diagnosis was later confirmed (virologically) in 31 patients in each group. The recruits had severe infection at the time of enrolment as defined by tachycardia, tachypnoea, oxygen saturation &#x0003c;90%, and hypotension. Recruitment to the high-dose arm was terminated early (by day 13) as mortality was significantly higher in this group (15% versus 39%, p 0.03).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0110">Despite being researched for several decades and being supported by a large volume of <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> and animal study data for plausible mechanisms for antiviral effects, neither HCQ nor CQ is currently recommended as an antiviral agent for any of the infections for which they were tested in clinical trials (with the exception of COVID-19 which is an evolving situation at the time of writing). The most researched infection in this regard is HIV. However, mainstream antiretroviral treatment in HIV is highly successful in viral load suppression, allowing reasonable control of the disease though it is not a cure. These newer combinations have not been tested against CQ/HCQ, and given the inconsistent evidence from existing trials in this regard there is no need to do such tests. The same can be said of HCV infection where pan-genotypic direct-acting antiviral agents can now achieve &#x0003e;90% cure rates with minimum adverse events [<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Repurposing HCQ/CQ for these infections is largely redundant and of historical interest only.</p><p id="p0115">In contrast, for acute viral infections such as dengue, chikungunya or COVID-19, effective antivirals are not available. These infections cause epidemics in vulnerable populations, exerting an enormous financial burden on resource-limited healthcare systems. For dengue fever, given the evidence presented here we conclude that CQ is of no benefit (high-certainty evidence). This conclusion is supported by a single well-designed RCT with an adequate sample size and a low risk of bias. CQ may have little or no effect in curing acute chikungunya infection (low-certainty evidence) and this conclusion is supported by a small clinical trial which may have inadvertently recruited people with more severe disease to the CQ arm despite randomization.</p><p id="p0120">For COVID-19 we are unsure whether either CQ or HCQ is of any benefit as per currently available evidence (very-low-certainty evidence). The only peer-reviewed publication describing an RCT on using HCQ for COVID-19 was a small trial that did not demonstrate any benefit of HCQ. The other peer-reviewed publication which did show a benefit was an open-label, non-randomized trial with a serious risk of bias in sample selection, confounders and assessing outcomes. The sample size was small, and there was a marked age discrepancy (of approximately 14&#x000a0;years) between test and control groups. Administration of azithromycin to six subjects who also received HCQ does not seem to be based on an <italic>a priori</italic> hypothesis or a study protocol. Some control-group patients were from a different centre, and it is unclear whether management protocols in the two institutions were the same. More importantly, it is now established that most patients with COVID-19 (&#x0003e;95%) will recover after a mild infection regardless of antiviral treatment. Therefore, the primary outcome assessed in this study (clearance of viraemia) is less useful for patient management compared to outcomes that demonstrate a benefit in the more severe end of the disease spectrum, such as mortality benefit, reduction in intensive care unit admissions, or faster discharge from intensive care (or high dependency units), faster recovery from assisted ventilation or prevention of the need for assisted ventilation. Examining such outcomes requires a well-coordinated multicentre study (preferably with a randomized, double-blind study design) with similar management protocols across all centres. The other two studies from China (available as preprints) mentioned in the results section also does not help to resolve this issue because of methodological issues and conflicting conclusions. For example, in one of these studies [<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] the control group is said to have received &#x02018;standard&#x02019; treatment which includes &#x02018;antivirals, antibiotics and steroids or immunoglobulins&#x02019;. These may have a serious confounding effect on the interpretation of results.</p><p id="p0125">The role of CQ in COVID-19 is also unclear and not supported by evidence at the moment. One small RCT reported no benefit of CQ in terms of achieving negative viraemia by day 14 compared to treatment with lopinavir and ritonavir [<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The authors report faster radiological improvement and reduced hospital stay with CQ, but on average the CQ group received treatment at an earlier stage of the illness than the comparator group. This plus the small sample size make interpretation of the results difficult. The other RCT did not have a no-CQ control group, which is rather surprising. Instead of proving the efficacy of CQ, the authors investigated whether a higher dose of CQ was safe in patients with severe infection. Notably this CQ dose (1200 mg/d for 10&#x000a0;days) was much higher than that used for cure of malaria which is the standard indication for CQ. Mortality was significantly higher in the high-dose CQ group, and patient recruitment was halted prematurely. Thus, this trial also doesn't help to confirm whether CQ is beneficial for COVID-19.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0130">CQ and HCQ have been examined for their antiviral properties in many <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> and animal studies for more than five decades and in a limited number of human clinical studies spanning over 25&#x000a0;years. For HIV and HCV infections, the benefit of either drug is doubtful and perhaps no longer relevant as other effective treatments are now available for viral load suppression (HIV) or cure (HCV). There is good evidence that CQ is ineffective in curing dengue infection or preventing dengue haemorrhagic fever. CQ also may not have any benefit in curing acute chikungunya infection. A role for HCQ or CQ in COVID-19 is as yet unclear and needs to be assessed by well-designed randomized double-blind clinical trials.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Author contributions</title><p id="p0135">SR conceived the study.
