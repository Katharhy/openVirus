<p id="par0045">Natural or synthetic peptides have drawn great attention in a variety of applications as therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostic agents. Due to their high specificity and ability to access hard to reach targets, peptides as therapeutics can offer the combined advantages of small and large molecules [
 <xref rid="bib0695" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. As vaccines, peptides are popular modalities for inducing anti-viral immune response driven by B and/or T cells. Peptide optimization such as multimerization and fusion to immunostimulatory adjuvants can be used to further enhance the immune response [

 <xref rid="bib0675" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. Moreover, peptides are employed in detection assays to diagnose various infectious diseases. Peptide-based diagnostic reagents are generally preferred due to their specificity, safety, suitability, and flexibility [
 <xref rid="bib0535" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. In this article, we provide an overview of the five infectious diseases; influenza (flu), chronic hepatitis B (CHB), AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and COVID-19. The current FDA approved therapeutics are reviewed for each disease and the applications of novel peptide-based agents are summarized. We highlight the discovery and development of peptide-based candidates under various development stages (pre-clinical and clinical) and their potentials as therapies, vaccines, and diagnostics. A summary of the strategies discussed in this article is depicted in
