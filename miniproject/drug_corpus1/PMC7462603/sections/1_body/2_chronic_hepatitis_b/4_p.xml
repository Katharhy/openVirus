<p id="par0110">In preclinical research, peptides derived from natural proteins have demonstrated promising potential for treating CHB. An example is a peptide called PTD-p37 that was designed to inhibit viral regeneration. The peptide contained an N-terminal cell-penetrating domain (YGRKKRRQRRR) fused to the residues 444–480 of the heat shock protein gp96 (p37). Typically, HBV activates the gp96 promoter through the NF-κB pathway. This results in an up-regulation of gp96 expression, causing positive feedback to stimulate HBV replication in cell culture [

 <xref rid="bib0770" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. Peptide p37 binds to gp96 at the N-terminal helix-loop-helix region without interfering with the C-terminal dimerization domain. The peptide interrupts the helix-helix interaction and locks gp96 in an inactive "open" conformation. As a result, Mdm2 is disassociated and p53 levels are increased [
