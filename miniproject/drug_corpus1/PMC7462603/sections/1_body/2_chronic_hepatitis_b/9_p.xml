<p id="par0135">In addition to targeting virus antigens, peptides that block virus maturation have also been considered as antiviral therapeutics. A stretch of 13 residues corresponding to the C-terminus of the pre-S1 domain (PLSPPLRNTHPQA) and amino acids corresponding to the 56–80 region of S domain (PISNHSPTSCPPTCPGYRWMCLRRF) bind the core antigen, HBcAg. It was suggested that these fragments were responsible for virion maturation during which the pre-S domain of L protein is switched from inside to outside of the virion. This topological change allows HBV to become a "binder-type particle" and recognizes the receptors on the host cells [
