<p id="par0075">In a parallel approach, viral proteins are used to develop anti-viral peptides. For example, a 16-residue long peptide, Flufirvitide-3, derived from the fusion initiation region of the HA protein, has shown high efficacy in plaque inhibition assay and

 <italic>In silico</italic> and bioinformatic approaches were utilized to design peptides based on highly conserved regions of HA1 and HA2. As a result, nine peptides were identified that bound to HA stalk regions and had anti-viral activity at micromolar concentrations against H1N1 and H5N2 strains in MTT reduction assay using MDCK cells [

The scaffolds presented the HA-binding peptide with the needed flexibility, stability, and multivalency. In particular, the dumbbell-shaped carbosilane dendrimer had the strongest inhibitory activity of 0.72 μM and 0.6 μM against H1N1 and H3N2, respectively [
