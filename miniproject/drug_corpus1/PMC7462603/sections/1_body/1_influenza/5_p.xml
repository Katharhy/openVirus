<p id="par0065">In addition to the naturally occurring peptides that are derived from the innate immune system, some proteins have shown potential as the starting point for the discovery and development of anti-viral peptides. Four examples will be discussed next. First, lactoferrin, found in bovine milk was shown to bind to HA and inhibit the infection of influenza subtypes H1N1 and H3N2. By molecular docking, three fragments on lactoferrin, SKHSSLDCVLRP (418–429), AGDDQGLDKCVPNSKEK (506–522), and NGESSADWAKN (552–563) were identified with the inhibitory activity against influenza virus at picomolar and femtomolar concentrations [
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Scala and colleagues identified minimum pharmacophore of the most potent peptide (SKHSSLDCVLRP) and generated three tetrapeptides 14 (VLRP), 15 (SLDC) and 17 (SKHS) with broader anti-influenza activity. Tetrapeptide 17 was more active than the parental peptide in the neutralization assay in MDCK cells [

The second example, a 20-residue peptide EB derived from the signal sequence of fibroblast growth factor 4, was reported to exhibit antiviral activity against influenza viruses, including the H5N1 subtype. EB (RRKKAAVALLPAVLLALLAP) bound specifically to HA, prevented viral cell entry in the MDCK cell line, and had protective activity in mice at low micromolar concentration [
 <xref rid="bib0530" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. In the third example, a suppressor of cytokine signaling protein called tyrosine kinase inhibitor peptide was used to develop a family of 12–16 residue long anti-viral peptides termed FluPep (FP) for targeting influenza. FluPep inhibited HA binding to host cells and cell entry. One of the FP peptides (FP4: RRKKWLVFFVIFYFFR) showed nanomolar efficacy for Influenza A virus subtypes H1, H3, and H5 in a plaque-reduction assay. To compensate for the high hydrophobic content of FP peptides [
 <xref rid="bib0745" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>] and to enhance their solubility, Alghrair and team constructed gold and silver nanoparticle–FP conjugates. Interestingly, the peptide-nanoparticle conjugates showed enhanced solubility and increased activity in plaque assay using MDCK cells. The authors suggested that the use of FluPep-functionalized nanoparticles might be safe for delivery to target organs [
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The last example includes the NA inhibitory peptide (PGEKGPSGEAGTAGPPGTPGPQGL) derived from cod skin hydrolysates. The peptide was reported to have considerable anti-viral activity and hence potential utility in preventing inﬂuenza virus infections. However, the peptide was shown to be highly susceptible to degradation in the presence of the simulated
