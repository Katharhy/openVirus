<p id="par0095">The currently used influenza diagnostic tests are based on molecular assays and antigen detection [
 <xref rid="bib1010" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>]. FDA-licensed tests are designed to detect and differentiate influenza A and B viruses but have a limited capability to identify subtypes of influenza A viruses. Therefore, newer approaches that are cost-effective, less labor-intensive, easy to perform, and able to detect and differentiate influenza subtypes are needed. A recently developed approach is a peptide-based molecular beacon (PEP-MB) for the detection of Influenza type A using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). A HA1-specific binding peptide is conjugated to two complementary nucleotides on each end. Sulfo-succinimidyl-4-(
 <italic>N</italic>-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (sulfo-SMCC) is used to cross-link the complementary nucleotides: a Cy3-modified oligonucleotide (Oligo-Cy3) and a black hole quencher 2 (BHQ2)-modified oligonucleotide (Oligo-BHQ2). In the absence of virus particles, PEP-MB constructs form hairpin structures that result in the quenching of donor Cy3 by BHQ2. In the presence of the H1N1 virus, PEP-MB undergoes a conformational change due to the binding to viral HA. As a result, strong fluorescence is emitted and detected by the beacon [

In another detection method, sialic acid-mimic pentapeptide (ARLPR) identified by phage display is immobilized on boron-doped diamond electrodes using click chemistry. Electrochemical detection of HA binding to the peptide indicates the presence of the Influenza virus [

This method can be used as an alternative approach to agglutination assay using red blood cells since it is more stable with an extended storage period [
