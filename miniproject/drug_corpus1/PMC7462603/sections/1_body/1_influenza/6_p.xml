<p id="par0070">The broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) targeting HA protein have also been utilized to generate peptides with improved potency. A linear peptide, P1 (SQLRSLEYFEWLSQ) was designed based on the complementarity-determining region loops of the heavy chain and framework region of two bnAbs called FI6v3 and CR9114 [

 <sub>D</sub> 17–37 nM). P7 inhibited HA conformational rearrangement in the endosome, preventing viral fusion with the host cell membrane [
