<p id="par0090">In one study, conserved sequences from influenza proteins that are targeted by T cells (human and mice) were identified using a proprietary epitope prediction algorithm. The mixture of chemically synthesized peptides (FLU-v) induced a specific HLA-A*0201-mediated CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell response in immunized transgenic mice model and significantly increased their survival rate when the animals were challenged with a lethal dose of influenza [
 <xref rid="bib0950" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>]. Equimolar combination of four peptides (M1: DLEALMEWLKTRPILSPLTKGILGFVFTLTVP, NPA: DLIFLARSALILRGSVAHKSC, NPB: PGIADIEDLTLLARSMVVVRP, and M2: IIGILHLILWILDRLFFKCIYRLF) were tested in clinical trials and the safety and efficacy were reported. This suggested that FLU-v-like peptides activate the T cell arm of immune response and have potential as vaccines [

It consists of three repetitions of nine conserved B and T cell epitopes from influenza HA, NP, and M1 proteins expressed as a single recombinant polypeptide. M-001 immunization was shown to induce B and T cell-specific immune responses and offers protection against infection with different influenza strains, including H5N1 strain. M-001 is the first universal vaccine, which is expected to protect against existing and future seasonal and pandemic virus strains [

A proprietary peptide design platform was used to identify the four peptide components of Vacc-Flu from the conserved regions of M2 and NP of influenza A. Immunization by Vacc-Flu results in the induction of IFNÎ³-producing T cells and antibody-producing B cells, both of which can protect from severe disease symptoms upon infection [
