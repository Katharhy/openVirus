<p id="par0055">FDA approved influenza therapeutics targeting M2 and NA proteins shorten the disease time-course and reduce the severity of symptoms. Adamantane derivatives, amantadine (Symmetrel) and rimantadine (Flumadine), are small molecule inhibitors that target M2 proteins encoded by influenza A viruses. [
 <xref rid="bib0555" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Orally delivered oseltamivir (Tamiï¬‚u), intranasally administered zanamivir (Relenza), and intravenously injected peramivir (Rapivab) are FDA approved NA inhibitors that prevent the virus release from infected host cells. In 2018, FDA approved Baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza) for influenza A and B. Xofluza inhibits polymerase acidic endonuclease, an enzyme essential for viral replication [

 <xref rid="bib0335" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] and it is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19. It is important to note that the use of adamantane is no longer recommended due to its poor tolerability and a high rate of drug resistance [
 <xref rid="bib0755" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. In addition, resistant viral mutants have shown decreased sensitivity to oseltamivir [
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The emergence of resistant influenza viruses mandates the discovery of novel therapeutics with high specificity and efficacy. The developments of antiviral peptides for the treatment of influenza is discussed next.
