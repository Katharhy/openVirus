<p id="par0160">Most of the FDA approved anti-HIV drugs target viral reverse transcription factor, proteases, integrases, and structural proteins to stop the fusion, entry, replication, or maturation of the virus. Since the first approved HIV drug azidothymidine in 1987, a reverse transcriptase inhibitor, more than 30 antivirals for AIDS have been approved [

In 2003, the FDA approved the first peptide-based fusion inhibitor, Enfuvirtide, a 36 residue long peptide designed to mimic the C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR) of the helical region of gp41 [
