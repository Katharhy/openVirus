<p id="par0155">Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a disease caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV can directly weaken the immune system and make it vulnerable to other pathogens. The viral envelope (Env) protein is a key driver of the viral binding and fusion to the target cells and contains two major non-covalently associated glycoproteins, surface subunit gp120 and transmembrane gp41. These glycoproteins surround the nucleocapsid containing viral RNA and reverse transcriptase. The binding of viral gp120 to the CD4 receptor exposes its binding site to the chemokine coreceptor. Depending on the cell type, different chemokine receptors are recruited, for example, CXCR4 on T-cells and CCR5 on macrophages are identified as CD4 coreceptors. After binding of the virus to the host cells, gp41 undergoes a receptor-activated conformational change to form a six-helical bundle (6HB). The 6HB initiates viral entry by triggering the insertion of the fusion peptide (hydrophobic N-terminal fragment of gp41) into the host cell membrane [

The viral RNA is transcribed to dsDNA. Integrase then carries dsDNA through the nucleopore to the nucleus and inserts it into the host chromosome causing lifelong infection. The viral DNA is replicated, translated, and assembled at the cell membrane as an immature polypeptide chain, which is cleaved by the viral proteases to form mature infectious virion [
