<p id="par0170">Peptides that bind to gp41 have emerged as potential treatments for AIDS. An example is DP-178 (T-20), which binds to CHR and prevents the formation of 6HB. As a result, viral fusion to host cells is inhibited [
 <xref rid="bib0520" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib1055" ref-type="bibr">211</xref>]. This peptide is currently marketed under the name Enfuvirtide [
 <xref rid="bib0580" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. Despite the safety profile and efficacy of Enfuvirtide, its poor stability in serum and large-dosage requirement have highlighted the need for other peptide-based drugs. Sifuvirtide (SFT), a second-generation HIV-1 gp41 fusion peptide developed by FusoGen Pharmaceutical, Inc. is currently in phase III clinical trials in China. SFT is an optimized version of Enfuvirtide with 10-fold enhanced efficacy and prolonged half-life [
 <xref rid="bib0705" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. Other advantages of SFT include stability and higher selectivity toward rigid membrane models, such as saturated dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and sphingomyelin (SM). The ability of SFT to strongly interact with rigid lipidic areas on the fusion site possibly contributes to its improved efficacy [
 <xref rid="bib0430" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Another example of a peptide that interacts with gp41 is a PIE12 (Pocket-specific Inhibitor of Entry). PIE12 is a trimerized D-peptide identified using phage display and has a picomolar binding affinity to trimeric gp41 and a potency in the mid picomolar to low nanomolar range. Further, the half-life of PIE12-trimer was improved three-fold by cholesterol conjugation making the peptide less vulnerable to renal filtration in rat models. The optimized pegylated D-peptide (Cholesterol-PIE12-trimer-PEG31) with its sustained-release formulation has provided feasible dosing over an extended period in a non-human primate model [
 <xref rid="bib0865" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. Another example is the P3 peptide, which targets HIV-1 gp41 HR1 site. P3 is a 34 amino acid peptide derived from HIV-2 helical region 2 of gp41that blocks HIV infection at a sub-nanomolar concentration in both HIV-1 and HIV-2 primary isolates [
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It was suggested that the alpha-helical structure of P3 provides resistance to proteases compared to the unstructured peptides like T-20. Due to the high stability in the human vaginal environment (pH 3.5–4.5) and the ability to retain its bioactivity at 25°, 37°, and 65 °C for a weeklong period, P3 can be a potential candidate for the development of microbicides [
 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A novel lipopeptide, LP-19 that is derived from the integration of multiple design approaches, targets the conserved pocket region of gp41 and prevents viral fusion to host cells. LP-19 with a membrane-anchoring lipid tail showed high affinity and potency 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> for inhibiting HIV-1 and HIV-2 entry. LP-19 exhibited extended half-life in rhesus macaques and drastically reduced viral loads in infected monkeys [
 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Peptides derived from viral sequences, including gp41 can be potentially immunogenic. However, it is possible to lower the immunogenicity risk through peptide engineering. The novel HIV fusion inhibitor, V2o, is derived from the gp41 heptad repeat 2 region of HIV-2 and HIV-1. The removal of MHC-I epitopes from the naturally derived peptide reduced its immunogenicity and improved its antiviral activity profile. V2o efficiently inhibited the viral entry in PM-1 cells infected with lentiviral vector particles with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> in the picomolar range [
 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It is worth mentioning that peptides derived from host cells that are involved in viral infection have also been considered. An example is peptide 2C which is derived from the C-terminal portion of the extracellular loop of CCR5. C2 competes with CCR5 for binding to gp120 [
 <xref rid="bib0270" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and inhibits HIV-1 entry at a double-digit micromolar concentration 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].
