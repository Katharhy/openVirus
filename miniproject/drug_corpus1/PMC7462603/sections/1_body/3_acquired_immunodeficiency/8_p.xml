<p id="par0185">Peptides have also played a critical role in developing HIV diagnostic reagents. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends two types of diagnostic tests for AIDS; p24 antigen test for early-stage detection and HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody test for early to chronic stage detection. Commonly used HIV tests range from immunofluorescence to nucleic acid-based assays [

The FDA has approved OraQuickb HIV-1 rapid antibody test, which detects anti-gp41 antibodies in saliva, serum, plasma, or whole blood using synthetic gp41 peptide [

 <xref rid="bib0350" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] and a bifunctional colorimetric/fluorescence assay that uses short peptides derived from HIV-1 p17 protein tagged to a sensitive dye (P-17 antibodies are prevalent in the early stages of infection). Biosensors are advantageous due to their rapid turnover and minimal use of reagents and equipment [
 <xref rid="bib0915" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>]. Another sensor-based assay utilizes a 35-residue peptide fragment derived from gp41 (579–613) polymerized on a surface of quartz crystal microbalance to detect the majority of anti-HIV-antibodies in biological samples [
