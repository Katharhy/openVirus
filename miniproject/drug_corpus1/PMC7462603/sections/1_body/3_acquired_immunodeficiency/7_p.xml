<p id="par0180">Despite the lack of success, tremendous effort has been made to develop vaccines. Some of this work that has employed peptides will be discussed next. The variable loops of gp120 (V1-V3) have shown promise as vaccines. Peptides corresponding to the variable loop 3 (V3) of gp120 are more accessible compared to other loops, hence have been marked as neutralizing epitopes. Immunization with the 31–39 amino acid long V3-peptides has induced generation of bnAbs in mice that could possibly block the interaction of gp120 with host co-receptors [

Vacc-4x is comprised of four synthetic peptides derived from HIV capsid protein p24, which is present at high levels during the early and late stages of HIV infection. In REDUC clinical study, administration of Vacc-4x as part of combination therapy with an antiretroviral drug, Romidepsin, resulted in the activation of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cells and the reduction in HIV load in patients [
