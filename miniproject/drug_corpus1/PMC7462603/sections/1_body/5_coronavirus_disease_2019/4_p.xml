<p id="par0235">The co-crystal structure of S protein RBD with ACE2 led to the identification of a 23-residue peptide (SBP1) that disrupts the protein-protein interaction between the virus and host receptor and prevents viral cell entry. SBP1 (IEEQAKTFLDKFNHEAEDLFYQS) was derived from α1 helix region of the human ACE2 and bound to SARS-CoV-2 RBD with a KD of 47 nM determined by biolayer interferometry [

Another peptide in development is EK1 (SLDQINVTFLDLEYEMKKLEEAIKKLEESYIDLKEL), which is derived from the heptad repeat 2 (HR2) domain of the S protein. After binding to the RBD, heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and HR2 interact with each other to form a 6HB fusion core bringing the viral and host membrane in close proximity for fusion. EK1 peptide binds to the HR1 domain inhibiting the viral infection as shown in S-mediated cell-cell fusion assays [

A similar lipidation strategy that was used to develop anti-HIV-1 peptide LP-19, was implemented to improve the antiviral activity and half-life of the EK1 peptide. EK1 was linked to cholesterol or palmitic acid through either a glycine-serine linker, polyethylene glycol (PEG) spacer, or both combination [

 <xref rid="bib1150" ref-type="bibr">230</xref>]. Three weakly positive-charged amino acids in the P9 (H21, K23, and K28) were substituted with arginine to increase the overall net positive charge from +4.7 to +5.6 (P9R: NGAICWGPCPTAFRQIGNCG
 <underline>R</underline>F
 <underline>R</underline>VRCC
 <underline>R</underline>I). It was hypothesized that a peptide with a stronger net positive charge could further neutralize protons in the endosome to inhibit endosomal acidification, thereby preventing viral RNA release. P9R showed 1000-fold enhanced potency compared to its parent for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication in a multicycle growth assay.
