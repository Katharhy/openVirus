Liu et al. created an extensive overview of notable published scientific articles, key viral target proteins, existing drugs with potential therapeutic use, select patents for drug repurposing, small molecules in development, and patents on therapeutic antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="bib0630" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. In addition, Gordon et al. used affinity-purification mass spectrometry to identify 66 druggable human proteins that interact with 26 SARS-CoV-2 proteins, and reported 69 compounds at various stages (approved, clinical or preclinical) that target these interactions [
