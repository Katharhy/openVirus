<p id="par0265">Peptide-based vaccines are considered as a novel means for the induction of a robust immune response. A few peptide-based vaccines have shown great potential in the clinical studies, including FLU-v-like peptides (phase I), Multimeric-001, and Vacc-4 × . The use of minimal microbial components in peptide-based vaccines can eliminate some of the problems associated with the use of whole organisms or proteins, such as allergic and autoimmune responses. However, low immunogenicity can be a limiting factor for peptide-based vaccines and may require the use of adjuvants [
