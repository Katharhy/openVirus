  <title>Background</title>
  <p>The population in Mexico has high prevalence rates of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Hospitalization and death of COVID-19 patients in the countries most affected by the pandemic has been associated to chronic comorbidities.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Objective</title>
  <p>To describe the prevalence of NCDs in patients with COVID-19 in Mexico and analyze the increased risk due to comorbidities and risk factors on hospitalization, utilization of intensive care units and death.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>A cross-sectional study was performed from 212,802 confirmed COVID-19 cases reported by the Ministry of Health up to June 27, 2020. Odds ratios were performed using logistic regression model.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Results</title>
  <p>Up to 47.40% of patients with COVID-19 diagnosis were also reported with a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most frequent (20.12%). The report of at least one NCD significantly increased the risk of death with respect to patients without such diagnoses. Chronic kidney disease increased the risk of death the most (OR 2.31), followed by diabetes (OR 1.69), immunosuppression (OR 1.62), obesity (OR 1.42), hypertension (OR 1.24), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 1.20). The comorbidities that most increased the risk of ICU and of intubation were diabetes, immunosuppression and obesity.</p>

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p>NCD comorbidities increase the severity of COVID-19 infection. Given high NCD prevalence rates among the Mexican population, the pandemic poses a special threat to the health system and to society. Special prevention measures need to be strengthened for persons with NCD diagnoses in the short-term. In the mid-term, disease control strategies need to be improved to protect these patients against COVID-19 severity.</p>
