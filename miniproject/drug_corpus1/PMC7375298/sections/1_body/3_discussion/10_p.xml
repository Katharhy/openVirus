<p id="p0125">Non-communicable chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, COPD and chronic kidney disease directly and indirectly affect the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. The presence of a state of inflammation in the cardiovascular system in COVID-19 patients has been demonstrated, with the increased release of inflammatory cytokines and cardiac enzymes such as troponin, which can cause diffuse microangiopathy with thrombosis. Inflammation in the heart can lead to myocarditis, failure, arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome, and death (

The expression of ACE2 is significantly increased in patients with hypertension and diabetes types 1 and 2 treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. Therefore, the increased expression of ACE2 facilitates infection with COVID-19, increasing the risk of developing severe and fatal COVID-19 (
