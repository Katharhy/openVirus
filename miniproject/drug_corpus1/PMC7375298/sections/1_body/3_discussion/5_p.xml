<p id="p0100">Asthma patients presented a protective factor for hospitalization, intubation and death in this Mexican population. Other countries have reported that is unclear if asthma increases the risk of contracting COVID-19, or increases the risk of worse outcomes from COVID-19 disease. Probably COVID-19 can trigger asthma exacerbations, given that viral respiratory infections are a frequent cause of asthma attacks (
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), and exacerbations that require emergency department visits and hospitalizations increase annually when viral infections increase (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). However, studies from China and Korea did not find that patients with asthma had more risk to be hospitalized in the COVID-19 infection (

The low prevalence of Asthma as a chronic respiratory disease related to Covid-19, has conditioned asthma to be considered as a protective factor for covid-19 infection. This can be explained by immune response conditioned by chronic respiratory disease itself, as well as a different and routine treatment of asthmatic patients with inhaled corticosteroids alone or in combination with bronchodilators, which have demonstrated their ability to suppress viral replication and decrease the production of cytosines responsible for the inflammatory storm by COVID-19. A widely used drug among patients with asthma is montelukast, which have bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory effects, it even decreases the need for high doses of steroids (
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Moreover, montelukast has exhibited antiviral efficacy against ZIKA infection in vitro and in vivo, showing that montelukast could disrupt the integrity of the virions to release the viral genomic RNA, hence irreversibly inhibiting viral infectivity (
