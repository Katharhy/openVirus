<p id="p0085">Limitations of our study are those of the sources of information based as it was on official reports stemming from a COVID-19 surveillance system that has not been adequately validated (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). No analyses have been undertaken yet of the quality of the database, although anecdotal evidence suggests that quality has been improving on a daily basis. As in other countries, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is underreported, although this could be a greater concern in Mexico given low levels of testing (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Furthermore, the sentinel system reports cases based on a sample which may be biased towards MoH providers. These limitations pose minor challenges for our study as we aim to assess the relative risks posed by NCDs and modifiable risk factors on health services utilization; the completeness of reports would play a negligible error. However, health care institutions could be subjected to different internal constraints on health service utilization. Sampling biases would, could, therefore be more challenging. However, the observed distribution of cases across institutions does not deviate significantly over normal distribution of hospital utilization in Mexico across public institutions. Private providers, however, could be under-represented.
