<p id="p0045">Continuous variables were described using measures of central tendency. Categorical variables were described as percentages. A Ï‡
 <sup>2</sup> test was performed to compare the percentages of patients with and without NCDs and modifiable risk factors against the percentage of patients with and without hospitalization, ICU, endotracheal intubation and death. The likelihood of being hospitalized, admitted to ICU, intubated or death for COVID-19 was assessed according to NCD comorbidities and modifiable risk factors, estimating odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals and their corresponding 
 <italic>p</italic> values. A multivariate logistic regression model was used adjusting by age, sex and for each of the comorbidities and risk factor analyzed (CKD, immunosuppression, diabetes, COPD, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, asthma, obesity and smoking). All statistical analysis was performed using Stata SE version 15.0 software (Stata corporation, College Station, TX, USA).
