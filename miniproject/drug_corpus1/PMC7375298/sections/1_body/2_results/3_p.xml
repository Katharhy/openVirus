<p id="p0060">Patients with COVID-19 and NCD comorbidities had greater risk of hospitalization comparted to patients without an NCD diagnosis or risk factors, as shown by the odds ratio (OR) expressing the risk multiplier with respect to not having the NCD diagnosis or risk factor (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">TableÂ 3</xref> ). CKD is the NCD that poses greatest hospitalization risk (OR 2.54), followed by immunosuppression (OR 2.17), diabetes (OR 1.98) and COPD (OR 1.34). Patients with modifiable risk factors also had a greater risk of hospitalization, of 1.29 in the case of obesity. Interestingly, asthma and smoking were found to be a protective factor of hospitalization (OR 0.83 and OR 0.93, respectively).
