<p>There has been a rapid response from the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> diagnostic industry to develop assays for SARS-CoV-2. These have migrated into UK laboratories at a much faster rate (50,442 tests on 18 March 2020) than in the US, due in part to stringent Food and Drug Administration regulations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0004563220921888">Figure 1</xref>). Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used for SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral detection in upper and lower respiratory specimens, and serological analysis of anti-COVID-19 antibodies by automated immunoassays can be used for disease surveillance. The preferred testing is by molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 by real-time RT-PCR, such as the RdRp gene assay, which amplifies a conserved region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene that is specific to SARS-CoV-2, which has been used for confirmation of this disease by Public Health England laboratories. In addition, oligonucleotide primers and probes selected from regions of the virus nucleocapsid (N) gene are also included in the panel. In confirmed COVID-19 cases, the laboratory testing should be repeated to demonstrate viral clearance prior to healthcare discharge.
