<p>There has been speculation that the virus was a result of genetic manipulation; however, SARS-CoV-2 more likely originated by natural selection in an animal source. The current SARS-CoV-2 virus demonstrates similar genetics to bat SARS-CoV like coronaviruses.

 </sup> There is, however, no evidence of direct bat-to-human transmission, suggesting an intermediate animal host is involved. This follows similar zoonotic infection routes of other coronaviruses entering into the human population.
