<p>The epidemiology of COVID-19 infection is evolving rapidly. As new cases are identified, understanding of clinical and diagnostic presentations is being refined. Cardiac biomarkers, in particular cTn and natriuretic peptides, are commonly elevated in patients with COVID-19 disease. As with many other non-ACS pathologies, elevation of cTn is associated with disease severity and poor prognosis. With the fast-moving development of disease progression across the globe and with better understanding of the mechanisms of cardiovascular complications in COVID-19, cardiac biomarkers can be utilized as a metric of a worsening clinical scenario or as an indicator of improving response due to cardioprotective intervention.</p>
