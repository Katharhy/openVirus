 </sup> a 37-year-old male presented with a three-day history of chest pain and dyspnoea. Electrocardiographic changes suggested an ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction, and cTnT was substantially elevated at &gt;10,000 ng/L (99th percentile reference limit &lt;14 ng/L), with concomitant elevations in CK and B-type natriuretic peptide. The initial working diagnosis was ACS. Subsequent CT coronary angiography revealed no evidence of coronary stenosis. A sputum sample was assayed for 13 viral nucleic acids, of which only coronavirus was positive. The working diagnosis changed to coronavirus fulminant myocarditis with cardiogenic shock and pulmonary infection. The patient was successfully treated with glucocorticoid and human Ig and cTnT decreased to 220 ng/L by one week and 21 ng/L by three weeks.
