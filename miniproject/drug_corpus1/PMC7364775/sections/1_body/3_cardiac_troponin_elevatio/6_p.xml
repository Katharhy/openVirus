<p>A further mechanism for consideration involves angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is expressed in myocardial tissue. SARS-CoV-2 binds cells expressing ACE2.

 </sup> Binding of the virus can down-regulate ACE2 intracellular pathways and mediate inflammation and oedema, contributing to respiratory failure.

 </sup> In theory, this could have a potential impact on patients taking ACE inhibitors (ACEi), resulting in greater risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection and increased severity of disease. However, at present, the European Society of Cardiology has highlighted a lack of scientific evidence regarding COVID-19 infection in patients on ACEi or angiotensin receptor blockers and supports continuation of antihypertensive therapy in patients with confirmed infection (ESC.org).
