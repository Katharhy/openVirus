<p id="p0025">What does history teach us in regard to vaccine development? First, expect the unexpected. Research is non-linear and often presents problems and barriers that are unanticipated. From these we learn (supposedly) and build on both successes and failures for the future. In vaccine development, we need only look back a handful of decades to recall failed vaccines against measles and RSV that used inactivated virus approaches. These vaccines led to antibody enhanced disease (AED) in people who were immunized and later infected with wild virus

For example, influenza viruses mutate so fast that nearly annual strain changes are necessary for influenza vaccines. This occurs despite vaccines containing both H and N protein antigens, rather than depending upon single protein/antigen preparations. Third, issues of broad immunogenicity exist. Given that this is an RNA virus, I believe it is critical that more than one viral antigen be included in the vaccine. While the significance remains unknown to date, researchers have already identified at least one mutation in the receptor binding domain of the S gene 
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Further mutations could conceivably lead to issues of original antigenic sin with resultant disease enhancement after exposure or to vaccines that simply are not effective into the future. “S only” vaccines risk these issues, whereas vaccines that include other relevant SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens considerably reduce this risk. Fourth, decisions must be made regarding how much safety data is needed before initiating first-in-man clinical trials. Of concern is the push for starting clinical trials in the absence of completed animal studies. Novel phase I vaccines should not be administered to humans prior to completion and evaluation of appropriate animal studies for safety, toxicity, and immunogenicity. Rushing through animal studies, using irrelevant or single animal species models, and avoiding non-human primate studies is simply transferring risk from animals to humans in an attempt to rush vaccine development. This may be even more important in studies of novel vaccine antigens, vaccine approaches, and concomitant adjuvants or immunostimulants. Fifth, some are beginning to call for human challenge models as a method for quickly moving through vaccine development. This would require extensive discussion and ethical consultation to consider factors such as the lack of known effective treatment, the balance between public health need and expediency, what full informed consent would be composed of in a situation like this, and what safeguards would need to be in place if this were even possible. A compelling ethical case must first be made prior to addressing these other issues.
