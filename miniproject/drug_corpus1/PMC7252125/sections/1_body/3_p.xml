<p id="p0020">Vaccine development has a long and documented history. In the US, as is true to greater and lesser degrees around the world, vaccines go through both scientific and regulatory pathways. These pathways, informed by science and the past history of successes and failures, are designed to maximize the chances of efficacy and safety. Further, these pathways are designed to be deliberate, reflective, evidence-based, and peer-reviewed … in short, to maximize the chance that the data generated are robust, interpreted correctly, and lead to safe and effective vaccines when used in the population-at-large. Perhaps the fastest a vaccine has been licensed in response to a new human pathogen of public health concern is the example of Ebola virus. From the first cases to licensure in the US took some 6 years, although work on a vaccine had started in the 1990s. Even the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 vaccine in 2009 took over 6 months to produce and distribute, and this was for a vaccine we had decades of experience in producing and testing with annual strain changes. Even then, many concerns were raised by the public of an “experimental and untested” vaccine being foisted on the public. It turns out that perception is important (at least in terms of vaccine uptake), and that human decision-making under conditions of uncertainty is both biased and flawed, particularly under distorting influences such as economic incentives or perceived losses, peer pressure, and wide-spread fear.</p>
