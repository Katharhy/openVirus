<p id="p0005">In the Aesop fable, “The Hare and the Tortoise,” the tortoise unexpectedly beats the hare in a race. The moral of the story is that the race is not always to the swift. This same moral also appears in the wisdom literature of the Old Testament book of Ecclesiastes 9:11, which more generally concerns the limitations of human wisdom—which is nearly always disregarded by humans themselves.</p>
