<p id="p0080">These and other such questions are raised to consider more carefully and thoughtfully how best to approach the development and distribution of a COVID-19 vaccine. Under current knowledge and disease severity, a vaccine is urgently needed. But such vaccine development must begin and progress cognizant of the many lessons learned from the past. In addition to safety issues, I raise concern over “S-only” vaccine approaches for the mid- to long-term control of this RNA virus. We need a vaccine—and we need it as quickly as one can be developed—that demonstrates safety and efficacy in adequately powered studies. Such an extraordinary event as COVID-19 is an argument for carefully developing a new playbook for how to develop novel vaccines against emerging pathogens in the context of epidemics and pandemics. Modern science has the ability to rapidly develop vaccine candidates, but wisdom lies in attending to the many lessons of the past … including that of the tortoise and the hare.</p>
