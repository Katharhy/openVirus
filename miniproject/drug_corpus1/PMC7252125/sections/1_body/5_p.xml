<p id="p0030">Rushed studies to get quickly to licensure presuppose evidences of safety, efficacy, and benefit. These should not be supposed;rather, the burden of proof lies upon the vaccine developer to demonstrate that those presuppositions are justified. For example, what level of risk are we willing to tolerate to immunize against an infection that may disappear in the next year or two? Or that could diminish in severity in the short- to mid-term? Or to administer to young children whose risk of both serious illness or death is quantifiably very, very low?</p>
