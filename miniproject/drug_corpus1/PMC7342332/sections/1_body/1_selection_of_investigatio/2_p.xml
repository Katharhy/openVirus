<p>One reason for the lack of efficacy of lopinavir could be high concentration required to inhibit viral replication compared to serum levels found in patients treated with lopinavir.[
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] It would be tempting to conduct a trial with higher doses of lopinavir; the unknown safety profile of higher dose and duration beyond the approved prescribing information in seriously ill patients would be a strong deterrent. However, higher unapproved doses could be used if the rationale for use is justified based on the laboratory and animal studies. In Ebola proof-of-concept trial, the investigators used
