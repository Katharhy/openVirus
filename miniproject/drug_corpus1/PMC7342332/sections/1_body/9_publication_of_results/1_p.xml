<p>The investigator has fundamental moral obligation to share available results as soon as these are adequately quality controlled for release.[
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] There is high social, media, and political pressure to disseminate the results without waiting for publication in scientific journals. The researcher can post preliminary reports of clinical study on electronic platforms such as medRxiv preprint server, without waiting for peer review. MedRxiv cautions that such preprints should not be relied on to guide clinical management and should not be considered by the news media as proven information. However, as soon as the results are available in public domain, medical practitioners, society, and media will put pressure on the government to support the use of any therapeutic intervention reported which appears to benefit the seriously ill patients. The government agencies have a responsibility to ensure that such rapid publications are reviewed judiciously, and the new therapy is used rationally.
