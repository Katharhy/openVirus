<p>The WHO has planned SOLIDARITY – a large global trial of four drugs – remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir–ritonavir, and lopinavir-ritonavir plus interferon-beta.[
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Its simple design allows the physician to recruit a confirmed case of COVID-19 after obtaining informed consent and to administer any of the four drugs locally available as per randomization by the WHO. The physicians are required to enter patient's data at randomization and at outcome assessment – recovery or death, the duration of the hospital stay, and requirement of oxygen or ventilation.
