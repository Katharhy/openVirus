<p>In an Indian situation, there is a big difference between standard care for critical illness available in private and public hospitals. As trials conducted in severe COVID-19 will require robust intensive care support, they are likely to be conducted in private hospitals. This would deprive socioeconomically disadvantaged who visit public hospitals from getting benefits of participation in trial. It would be desirable to conduct a centrally supervised trial by a government agency to allow all COVID-19 patients to be considered for enrollment in clinical trial irrespective of their socioeconomic status.</p>
