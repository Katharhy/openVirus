<p>The EC is responsible for closely monitoring the conduct of clinical trial. However, this would be difficult as the study conduct processes – consent, recruitment, follow-ups, clinical procedures, and serious AEs – would be managed by the investigator and her team rapidly while attending to the critically ill patient. Furthermore, the EC members cannot physically meet the patient or the site in a potentially infectious environment. A review of scanned documents could be an option. Otherwise, the monitoring should be conducted when the study is completed to ensure that the investigator team complied with the protocol and good clinical practice during the conduct of the trial.</p>
