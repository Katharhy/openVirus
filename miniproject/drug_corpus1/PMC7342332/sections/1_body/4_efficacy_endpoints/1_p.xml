<p>COVID-19 trials were not blinded, and investigators were aware of treatment assignment. Hence, there was a potential for information bias in the assessment of clinical endpoints. However, there are also challenges in evaluation of objective endpoint â€“ reduction of viral load. The LOTUS China trial was initiated early in the evolution of COVID-19 when viral testing was probably not fully characterized. Of 199 patients, 69 (35%) who were screened positive for SARS-CoV-2 by respiratory tract sample tested negative at the day 1 visit by the oropharyngeal swab.[
