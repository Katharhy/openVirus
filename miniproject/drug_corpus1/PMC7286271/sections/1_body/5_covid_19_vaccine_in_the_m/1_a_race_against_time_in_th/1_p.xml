 </xref> The world is facing a major health catastrophe and economic devastation, and one of the definitive solutions is to have an effective and safe vaccine in the shortest possible time. The global vaccine R&amp;D efforts have been unprecedented in history. The virus causing COVID-19 has been sequenced in a few weeks. Ordinarily, it has taken from 5 to 10 years to clone, and sequence a virus from the time the disease is discovered. There has been a tremendous race against time to develop candidate vaccine in a matter of few weeks, and as of now, 10 candidate vaccines have entered phase I-II clinical trials. It has taken us from 5 to 10 years in the history of vaccine development against other infectious agents to reach a stage as we are now with the COVID-19 vaccine. However, clinical trials as are undergoing now will be the greatest limiting factor, as these need time to acquire human data. Normally phase I, II, and III trials to be done on humans are completed between 2 and 5 years and sometimes more. This is necessary for qualifying a vaccine to be safe, immunogenic, and efficacious. As of today, candidate vaccines are undergoing phase I or parallel I-II studies and shall take several months for acquiring these data to start phase III trials. Phase III trial once initiated can take as long as 2 years. To compress the period, vaccine developers are involved in adopting parallel and adaptive development phases (I-II) to acquire safety and immunogenicity data as soon as possible to initiate phase III trials. By any imagination, these data shall not be available by early 2021 for any vaccine for regulatory authorities to allow vaccine marketing. COVID-19 vaccines could be available for human use earlier if innovative methods of clinical trials and regulatory processes are employed. One such is the use of “Challenge studies” to testify vaccine efficacy.

 </xref> Here, following proof of safety and immunogenicity in phase I-II trials, controlled “challenge studies” which can be completed in a matter of weeks are done to confirm vaccine efficacy. Challenge studies have been done in the past in other infectious diseases namely influenza, typhoid fever, cholera, and malaria. Whether “challenge studies” are ethical in COVID-19, considering the risk to the volunteer is a matter of debate before the vaccine developers.

 </xref> Also, regularity authorities can use innovative procedures to allow guarded emergency use of a vaccine. This would need careful consideration of interventional animal safety data and data of safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy acquired from phase I-II trials. With all this, vaccine developers have to be ready to scale manufacturing capacity to massive demands once the product is allowed for marketing.
