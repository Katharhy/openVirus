<p id="p0050">Are people who recover from COVID-19 infection protected from a second or a third infection? Should re-infections occur, it would imply that immune response against SARS-CoV-2 is not protective, making possibilities of a successful vaccine difficult. There were scary reports from South Korea about patients thought to have recovered from COVID-19 had tested positive again.

 </xref> An intense debate started about re-activation or re-infections of the virus. Soon these reports were put to rest, and the positive sample were found to be residual dead fragments of the virus, not the virus, which had re-activated or re-infected.

 </xref> After these reports, 2 groups of investigators have shown that SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are protective. Bao et al. showed that 2 monkeys who recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection were protected from re-infection on the challenge during convalescence.

 </xref> Gao et al. administered candidate vaccine 
 <italic>PiCoVacc</italic> Sinovac Biotech to mice, rats, and nonhuman primates. The antibodies raised against the vaccine in animals showed neutralizing ability against SARS-CoV-2 strains. Three immunizations of 2 doses (3 μg or 6 μg per dose) gave partial or complete protection in macaques against SARS-CoV-2.

 </xref> These data are exciting and if reproducible in humans confirm that vaccines against COVID-19 shall be protective.
