 </xref> SARS-CoV-2 has shown mutations as is true to every RNA virus. However, the mutations are slow and mild, and mutants show nearly similar sequences as in the parent strain. Dorp et al.

 </xref> studied genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 and recorded 198 filtered recurrent mutations; however, most of the mutations were either neutral or even deleterious and of no clinical significance in vaccine immunity. Ahmad et al.

 </xref> found no mutations in 120 available SARS-CoV-2 sequences and identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleoprotein (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. These findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide experimental efforts toward the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
