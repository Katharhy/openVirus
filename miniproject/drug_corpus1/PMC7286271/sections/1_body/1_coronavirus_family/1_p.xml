<p id="p0015">SARS-CoV-2 belongs to a family of zoonotic viruses known as 
 <italic>Coronavirus</italic>, genus 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> and is closely related to 2 other viruses namely Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

 </xref> All 3 are bat viruses and cross over to cause human infection through an intermediate host (civets for SARS-CoV, camels for MERS-CoV, and possibly pangolins for SARS-CoV-2).

 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses, around 125 nm in diameter, with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome of around 30 kb and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry. This is wrapped in an icosahedral protein shell. The surface has multiple club-shaped spikes, which creates the appearance of solar corona on electron micrsocopy (EM). The viral envelope consists of a lipid bilayer, in which the membrane (M), envelope (E), and spike (S) structural proteins are anchored. All the coronaviruses use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors as a cellular entry receptor; however, the propensity of SARS-CoV-2 to attach to these receptors is much higher, giving it high infectivity.
