<p id="p0105">Nucleic acid vaccines are the new generation vaccines, made available by modern technology. A DNA vaccine is made by inserting DNA encoding the antigen from the pathogen into plasmid DNA. RNA vaccines employ lipid-coated mRNA of the SARS-CoV-2 which expresses Spike protein. The expressed proteins are presented BY MHC class I to CD+ 8Â T cells and inducing a strong T cell response. These vaccines are safe, easy to manufacture by the platform technology, and maybe gamechanger in the future of vaccines. As of today, there are no nucleic acid vaccines in clinical practice.</p>
