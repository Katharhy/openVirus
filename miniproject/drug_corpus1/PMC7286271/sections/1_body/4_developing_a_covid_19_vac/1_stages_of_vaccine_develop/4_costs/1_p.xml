The figure includes vaccines that are abandoned during the development process. Here, given impending human catastrophe and global devastation, several Governmental and nongovernmental agencies have supported institutions with sufficient funds. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is a foundation that takes donations from public, private, philanthropic, and civil society organizationsÂ to finance independent research projects to develop vaccines against emerging infectious diseases. In March 2020, CEPI announced the US $ 2 billion to accelerate the development of the COVID-19 vaccine.
