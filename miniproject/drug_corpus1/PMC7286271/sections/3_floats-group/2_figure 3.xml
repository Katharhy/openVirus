  <p>Schematic drawing showing steps in vaccine development. The vaccine development follows a unique stepwise pattern and is broadly divided into Exploratory, Preclinical, Clinical, and Postmarketing stages. The clinical stage is divided into 3 phases, namely phases I, II, and III. There are 2 regulatory permissions needed namely “Clinical Trial Authorization” before the clinical stage to allow “First-in-human” testing and marketing of the vaccine after successful clinical trials.</p>
