  <p>Schematic drawing depicting FCγ receptor (FCγR)–mediated antibody-mediated enhancement. This response is mediated by the type of nonneutralizing antibodies mounted against infection or vaccination. The immune response to such vaccines is subverted, leading to exacerbated illness. The Fc-region of the antibody binds to FCγR on the immune cells, which subverts the immune response by reducing T
   <sub>H</sub>1 cytokines (IL-2, TNF-a, and IFN-γ) and skews T
   <sub>H</sub>2 cytokines (IL-10, IL-6, PGE-2, and INF-ά) and inhibits STAT pathway leading to increased viral replication. 
   <bold>STAT-A,</bold> signal transducer and activator of transcription protein-A; 
   <bold>IRF,</bold> interferon regulatory factor, 
   <bold>INOS,</bold> inducible nitric oxide synthase.
