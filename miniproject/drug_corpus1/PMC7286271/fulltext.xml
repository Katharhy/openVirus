Governments have implemented lockdown measures, blocked international travel, and enforced other public containment measures to mitigate the virus morbidity and mortality. As of today, no drug has the power to fight the infection and bring normalcy to the utter chaos. This leaves us with only one choice namely an effective and safe vaccine that shall be manufactured as soon as possible and available to all countries and populations affected by the pandemic at an affordable price. There has been an unprecedented fast track path taken in Research &#x00026; Development&#x000a0;by the World community for developing an effective and safe vaccine. Platform technology has been exploited to develop candidate vaccines in a matter of days to weeks, and as of now, 108 such vaccines are available. Six of these vaccines have entered clinical trials. As clinical trials are &#x0201c;rate-limiting&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;time-consuming&#x0201d;, many innovative methods are in practice for a fast track. These include parallel phase I-II trials and obtaining efficacy data from phase IIb trials. Human &#x0201c;challenge experiments&#x0201d; to confirm efficacy in humans is under serious consideration. The availability of the COVID-19 vaccine has become a race against time in the middle of death and devastation. There is an atmosphere of tremendous hype around the COVID-19 vaccine, and developers are using every moment to make claims, which remain unverified. However, concerns are raised about a rush to deploy a COVID-19 vaccine.

Vaccine development from the exploratory stage to marketing is a lengthy process and generally takes between 5 and 10 years. For the COVID-19 vaccine, this period is being substantially compressed by the use of modern platform technology to develop the candidate vaccine (preclinical stage) and fast authorization by regulatory agencies for clinical trials. It took Moderna Inc. (American biotechnology company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts) only 42 days from sequence analysis of the virus to create a new generation vaccine (mRNA-1273) at the Company's cGMP facility. This would have normally taken more than 2 years period without platform technology to develop such a vaccine. However, clinical trials that follow a unique protocol are &#x0201c;rate-limiting&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;time-consuming&#x0201d;. Here also, to respond to the pandemic, the investigators are exploring innovative methods of data collection. Many developers are running clinical trials in parallel (phase I-II) to shorten the time for approval. Some have started collecting data on efficacy from phase II itself (IIb). There is an intense debate on whether challenge studies are ethical in COVID-19, assessing the risk to a healthy volunteer.<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr"><sup>56</sup></xref> If allowed and done, efficacy data on the COVID-19 vaccine shall be available in a matter of weeks rather than years. However, it will be dangerous to grant authorization without proof that the COVID-19 vaccine is immunogenic, effective, and safe.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.1.2"><title>Success Rate</title><p id="p0080">The second item which needs consideration is the success rate of vaccine development from clinical trial authorization to License.&#x000a0;Typically, this rate was &#x0003c;10% during the period 2000-2010. A 2016 study showed that around 20% of vaccine clinical trials make up from phase I to license.<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr"><sup>57</sup></xref> Of the 37 vaccines&#x000a0;developed for the Ebola virus, only one was licensed based on efficacy and safety in the phase II trial. In the COVID-19 vaccine landscape, investigators have introduced a few new generation vaccines based on nucleic acid technology.

Such vaccines are good to attain herd immunity in the population and block transmission of disease. However, there is a small chance of reversion of mutation to virulence and the occurrence of disease. Besides, such vaccines need a cold chain for distribution to the community. Examples of such vaccines are BCG, smallpox, MMR (Measles, Mumps, &#x00026; Rubella), Rotavirus, Poliomyelitis (OPV), etc. Inactivated vaccines are treated with formaldehyde or heat, and as the virus is killed, such vaccines are safe and cannot cause disease. However, such vaccines do not replicate, cause a suboptimum immune response, and need repeated dosing and adjuvants to enhance immunity. ADE has been reported in such vaccines, and to avoid this, we need to maintain the structure of epitopes on the surface antigen during inactivation. Examples of such vaccines include poliomyelitis (IPV), HAV, rabies, etc.</p><p id="p0105">Nucleic acid vaccines are the new generation vaccines, made available by modern technology.

It has taken us from 5 to 10 years in the history of vaccine development against other infectious agents to reach a stage as we are now with the COVID-19 vaccine. However, clinical trials as are undergoing now will be the greatest limiting factor, as these need time to acquire human data. Normally phase I, II, and III trials to be done on humans are completed between 2 and 5 years and sometimes more. This is necessary for qualifying a vaccine to be safe, immunogenic, and efficacious. As of today, candidate vaccines are undergoing phase I or parallel I-II studies and shall take several months for acquiring these data to start phase III trials. Phase III trial once initiated can take as long as 2 years. To compress the period, vaccine developers are involved in adopting parallel and adaptive development phases (I-II) to acquire safety and immunogenicity data as soon as possible to initiate phase III trials. By any imagination, these data shall not be available by early 2021 for any vaccine for regulatory authorities to allow vaccine marketing. COVID-19 vaccines could be available for human use earlier if innovative methods of clinical trials and regulatory processes are employed. One such is the use of &#x0201c;Challenge studies&#x0201d; to testify vaccine efficacy.<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr"><sup>56</sup></xref> Here, following proof of safety and immunogenicity in phase I-II trials, controlled &#x0201c;challenge studies&#x0201d; which can be completed in a matter of weeks&#x000a0;are done to confirm vaccine efficacy. Challenge studies have been done in the past in other infectious diseases namely influenza, typhoid fever, cholera, and malaria. Whether &#x0201c;challenge studies&#x0201d; are ethical in COVID-19, considering the risk to the volunteer is a matter of debate before the vaccine developers.<xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr"><sup>83</sup></xref> Also, regularity authorities can use innovative procedures to allow guarded emergency use of a vaccine. This would need careful consideration of interventional animal safety data and data of safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy acquired from phase I-II trials. With all this, vaccine developers have to be ready to scale manufacturing capacity to massive demands once the product is allowed for marketing.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref>

Public claims about breakthrough research based on poorly conducted studies or data collected through fraud is a real possibility.
