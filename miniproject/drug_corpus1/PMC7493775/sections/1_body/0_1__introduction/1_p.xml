<p>The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was quickly confirmed as the causal pathogen leading to the outbreak of SARS-like illness (later named coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) in China.

 </sup> As for now, COVID-19 has become a pandemic that led to healthcare crisis all over the world. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> genus of coronaviruses (CoVs) that are known to cause multiple respiratory infections in humans. The history of CoVs can trace back to the middle of nineteenth century.

 </sup> The CoV particles are enveloped and contain a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome. The CoV genome encodes both structural (such as envelope [E] protein, transmembrane [M] glycoprotein, spike [S] glycoprotein and nucleocapsid [N] protein) proteins responsible for virus replication and virus entry and nonstructural proteins that are involved in genome replication and transcription. The viral membrane harbors the S protein that plays an important role in virus entry and is responsible for inducing host immune response.

 </sup> The CoV infection begins with the interaction of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral S protein and the receptor on the cell surface such as dipeptidyl peptidase-4 for MERS-CoV and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for SARS-CoV.

 </sup> According to the recent results, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes a similar host receptor, ACE2 for its attachment and entry. Therefore, the treatment strategy designed for SARS-CoV can be potentially applied to use against SARS-CoV-2.

 </sup> After the entry, the virus gets uncoated and translates its open reading frames 1a and 1b (ORF1 and ORF1b) into polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab. Subsequently, these polyproteins are cleaved into several nonstructural proteins by several proteases, which further assemble and form the transcription-replication complex. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) transcribes the positive strand of RNA to negative strand, which is further transcribed into positive-strand subgenomic mRNAs. These subgenomic mRNAs are translated to make new accessory and structural proteins. Interfering with any specific step of the virus replication cycle would be a potential therapeutic target to combat SARS-CoV-2. Increasing evidence reveals potential therapeutic agents acting directly against SARS-CoV-2, such as interferon (IFN), RdRp inhibitors, protease inhibitors, coronaviral protease inhibitor, viral entry blocker, neuraminidase inhibitor, vaccine, antibody, agent targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome, natural killer cells, and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking inhibitors. Some of them have already demonstrated both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and clinical efficacy.
