<p>Remdesivir, by far, is the most promising drug among all ongoing clinical trials. Due to its structural similarity to adenosine, it can inhibit the RdRp by incorporating into viral RNA, thus halting viral genome replication. Recently, the first experience of remdesivir usage in the United States for the COVID-19-infected patient was reported.

 </sup> The

 </sup> The most updated cohort study showed clinical improvement observed in 36 of 53 patients (68%).

 </sup> Therefore, remdesivir alone or together with IFN-β might be the potential regimen for the therapy of COVID-19.
