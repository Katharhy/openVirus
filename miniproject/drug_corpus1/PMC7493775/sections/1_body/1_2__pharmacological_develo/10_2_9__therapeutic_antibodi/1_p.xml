<p>Passive immunity by antibody therapy might be another strategy to control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Passive immunization with the antibody, which can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 virus, might inhibit the virus replication and mitigate the disease severity. According to the prior experience in treating MERS, SARS, Ebola, and influenza viral infections with convalescent plasma from recovered patients that contains high antibody titers against virus, convalescent plasma could ameliorate the viral level and mortality.

 </sup> However, the challenges such as unknown viral kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 and insufficient donors with suitable clinical status still exist.
