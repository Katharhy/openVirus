<p>On the other hand, the rationale of ACE2 receptor as a specific target against SARS-CoV-2 has been proposed.

 </sup> It is reasonable to use the ACE2 receptor as a target for neutralizing the virus. Currently, recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2; GSK2586881) is being investigated for evaluation of its clinical effects in COVID-19 patients (NCT04287686). Moreover, in order to target ACE2 against SARS-CoV-2, it would be advisable to convert the soluble ACE2 receptor to the immunoadhesin form, which can be achieved by binding with the immunoglobulin Fc domain (ACE2-Fc). This modification will extend its lifespan and recruit immune response against the virus in the future antibody development. Nevertheless, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein-derived cell entry not only depends on ACE2 but also on the host cellular serine protease TMPRSS2.

 </sup> Moreover, the HR loops including HR1 and HR2 domains on the S2 fragment of SARS-CoV-2 are involved in viral entry mechanism.

 </sup> Furthermore, ultimately, the cocktail antibodies strategy might be required to pursue full SARS-CoV-2 protection coverage for specific population, which would elevate the complexity for formulation and manufacturing. Hence, antibodies targeting the fusion/entry mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 are still ongoing investigated and be worthy to expected in the future.
