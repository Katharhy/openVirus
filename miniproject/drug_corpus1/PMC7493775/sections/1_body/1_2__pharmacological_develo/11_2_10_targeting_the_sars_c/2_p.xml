<p>Targeting the RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 by a novel CRISPR RNA knockdown system might be another option. Recent evidence revealed that the CRISPR/Cas13 RNA knockdown system might be used against SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome.

 </sup> The CRISPR/Cas13d system encompasses Cas13d protein and guides RNA specifically targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. It is believed that the CRISPR/Cas13 system might be delivered to the SARS-CoV-2-infected lung tissue by adeno-associated virus vector. Therefore, the CRISPR system against the SARS-CoV-2 might be a potential developmental strategy in the future.
