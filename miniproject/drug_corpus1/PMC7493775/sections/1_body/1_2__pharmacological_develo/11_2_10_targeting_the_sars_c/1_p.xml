<p>Beyond targeting the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, directly targeting the viral RNA genome through inducing its degradation might be a reasonable strategy. SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome sequence has been recently identified (Gen-Bank: MN908947.3), and using RNA interference by small interfering RNA (siRNA) or antisense oligonucleotides against the virus might be another potential treatment strategy.

 </sup> However, several challenges still exist, first, the conserved RNA sequence domains of SARS-CoV-2 are still unclear; second, it is unclear whether the oligonucleotides can be efficiently delivered into the lungs. By using such tools as liposomes, it is possible to deliver oligonucleotides to some extent; however, it is still unclear whether sufficient amount of oligonucleotides could be effectively delivered into the lung lesions and could eliminate the virus in clinical settings.

 </sup> Therefore, there still exists an uncrossed gap for immediate and quick development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy using oligonucleotides.
