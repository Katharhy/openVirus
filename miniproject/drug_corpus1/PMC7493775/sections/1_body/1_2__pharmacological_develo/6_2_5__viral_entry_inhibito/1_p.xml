<p>Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are aminoquinolines, which have been used to treat autoimmune diseases and malaria. They are weak diprotic bases that can elevate the pH of the endosomes, which in turn prevent viral entry fusion.

 </sup> Chloroquine can also interfere with ACE2 glycosylation of the cellular receptor of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.

The preliminary study in France evaluated the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 patients. The results showed that the virologic cure rate was significantly higher in hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin-treated group (

 </sup> However, the comprehensive evaluation of safety and clinical efficacy in chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine therapy for COVID-19 patients is still under investigation. Hence, the benefits and risk of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine therapy for COVID-19 remains to be carefully elucidated.
