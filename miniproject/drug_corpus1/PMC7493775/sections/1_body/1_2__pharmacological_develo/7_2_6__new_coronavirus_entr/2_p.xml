<p>In addition to the ACE2, it has been revealed that S protein-derived cell entry also depends on transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2).

 </sup> Hence, camostat mesylate, a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, can eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection

 </sup> Moreover, anti-HR peptides possess anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity through inhibition of viral fusion.

 </sup> The pH- and receptor-dependent endocytosis are also involved in coronavirus entry mechanism.

 </sup> Adaptor protein complex 2-associated protein kinase 1 is a host kinase responsible for regulation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

 </sup> Recent evidence suggested that baricitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor and also an adaptor protein complex 2-associated protein kinase 1-binding drug identified by artificial intelligence technology research, might be a novel candidate drug for the future COVID-19 treatment.

 </sup> Targeting novel coronavirus entry mechanisms might provide an alternative potential strategy for future anti-SAR-CoV-2 drug development.
