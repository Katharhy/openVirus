<p>In a recent study, it was shown that SARS-CoV-2 recognizes ACE2 more efficiently than SARS-CoV.

 </sup> Therefore, interfering with the interaction between S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 might be a potential approach for antiviral therapy. Recently, the COVID-19 high-performance computing (HPC) Consortium has been established for the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy and prediction of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the world’s most powerful supercomputer, SUMMIT, the high-throughput screening of the possible docking models and identification of novel small molecules which can bind to the viral S protein or S protein–human ACE2 interface has been proposed. At present, the initial 77 novel compounds were identified for the subsequent clinical efficacy tests against SARS-CoV-2 (ChemRxiv. Preprint.
