<p>Oseltamivir, an antiviral medication used for influenza A/B through neuraminidase inhibition, has gained considerable attention and has been proposed for evaluation of its efficacy for COVID-19 treatment. There is no evidence that oseltamivir has significant anti-SARS-CoV activity

 </sup> Coronaviruses do not utilize neuraminidase and thus there is no specific enzyme to be targeted by oseltamivir or any other neuraminidase inhibitor. Hence, the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> data have suggested that neuraminidase inhibitors such as baloxavir would exert activity against SARS CoV-2 or other coronaviruses should be carefully interpreted.
