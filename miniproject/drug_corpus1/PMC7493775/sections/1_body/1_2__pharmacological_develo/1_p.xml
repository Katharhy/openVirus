<p>The drug discovery process to develop new antiviral agents and obtaining the clinical approval usually takes a long period of time. Until now, no significantly effective antiviral drugs are clinically approved for treating coronavirus infections. To enhance the progress of potential treatment for coronaviruses especially for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, repurposing of broadly acting antiviral drugs such as IFNs and ribavirin that have been used for other viral infections or other indications is usually employed. These drugs have the significant superiority for their well-known characteristics of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics. Another approach for discovery of anti-CoV drugs includes the 
 <italic>de novo</italic> development of ideal, novel agents according to the biochemical understanding of the specific coronavirus. The novel specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents might comprise inhibitors interfering with the viral replication cycle, antibody targeting the host receptor and virus S protein, and inhibitors of host cellular proteases involved in the virus endocytosis pathway.
