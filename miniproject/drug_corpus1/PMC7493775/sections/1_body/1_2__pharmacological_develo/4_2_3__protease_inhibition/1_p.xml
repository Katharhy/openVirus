<p>A co-formulation of lopinavir and ritonavir, which was reported to have 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> activity against the SARS-CoV and was revealed to have some activity against MERS-CoV

 </sup> The component of lopinavir can bind to HIV-1 protease and block the cleavage of viral Gag-Pol precursor polyprotein into specific proteins essential for HIV infection, resulting in dysfunctional viral particles. Another component, ritonavir, can increase the plasma level of lopinavir by inhibiting the CYP3A-mediated metabolism of the latter. It has been used for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.

 </sup> However, lopinavir–ritonavir treatment might not have benefit in the severe COVID-19 hospitalized patients.

 </sup> Nelfinavir, another HIV protease inhibitor, has previously been shown to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV.

 </sup> In addition, nelfinavir has revealed rational binding conformation with the viral main protease of SARS-CoV-2. (BioRxiv doi:10.1101/2020.01.28.922922.) Therefore, nelfinavir might be a potential therapeutic option for COVID-19.
