<p>Ivermectin, an approved antiparasitic medication have been recognized as an antiviral agent against several viruses such as influenza, HIV, dengue virus, West Nile virus, and 
 <italic>Venezuelan equine encephalitis</italic> virus 
 <italic>in vitro.</italic>

 </sup> Initially, the inhibitory activity of ivermectin on interaction of virus integrase protein (IN) and the importin (IMP) α/β1 heterodimer was proposed as the antiviral mechanism because various RNA viruses are dependent on IMPα/β1 for infection.

 </sup> Previous studies demonstrated that IMPα/β1 was involved in a signal-dependent SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein nucleocytoplasmic trafficking during SARS-CoV infection and could affect host cell division.

 </sup> Besides, the SARS-CoV accessory protein can evade innate immune antiviral response through sequestering IMPα/β1 on the rough ER/Golgi membrane.

 </sup> The evidence suggests that ivermectin might be used against SARS-CoV-2 through nuclear transport inhibitory activity. Recently, an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experiment showed that a single treatment with ivermectin resulted in about 5000-fold reduction in SARS-CoV-2 virus.

 </sup> The next step of drug development is to clarify the dosing regimen. Based on its 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> efficacy and a well-known safety information, ivermectin might be worthy to further evaluate as a potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug.
