<p>Coronaviruses encode two proteases, chymotrypsin-like and papain-like proteases, which are responsible for the viral replication and interfering with the host innate immunity. Hence, targeting specific coronaviral proteases is a potential treatment option against coronaviruses.

 </sup> Cinanserin, an old serotonin receptor antagonist, inhibits the chymotrypsin-like protease and might be a potential inhibitor of replication of SARS-CoV.

 </sup> In addition, some flavonoids, which have inhibitory activity on chymotrypsin-like protease might be used against SARS-CoV.

 </sup> Moreover, evidence showed that diarylheptanoids, the natural products derived from Japanese alder (

 </sup> Therefore, specific coronaviral proteases might be good candidate targets for developing new drugs to fight COVID-19.
