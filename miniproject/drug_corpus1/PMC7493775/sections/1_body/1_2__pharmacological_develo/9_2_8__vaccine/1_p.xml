<p>Effective vaccines are important to prevent and control viral pandemics such as influenza vaccines. Unfortunately, even after numerous studies on coronaviruses, the licensed vaccines are still lacking. Theoretically, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is a promising target for vaccine development. Recently, Wrapp et al.

 </sup> found that the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of SARS-CoV-2 S trimer provides additional protein engineering information and thus can speed the progress of vaccine development. In addition, discovering the unique pentapeptides of SARS-CoV-2 S protein provides several candidate epitopes for vaccine development.

 </sup> Due to high similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, a researcher identified the SARS-CoV-derived B- and T-cell epitopes were identically mapped to SARS-CoV-2 proteins which might be helpful for the initial phase of vaccine development.

 </sup> Inactive vaccines derived from SARS, might be tested for SARS-CoV-2. Besides, rhesus Î¸-defensin and protein cage nanoparticles, which are innate immunomodulators, exhibit high anti-SARS-CoV potency.

 </sup> Protein cage nanoparticles designed vaccine for SARS-CoV might be further evaluated for their antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.
