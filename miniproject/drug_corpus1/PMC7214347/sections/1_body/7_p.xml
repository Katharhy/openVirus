<p id="p0040">Despite discrepancies in timing, modality and rule severity, China and Italy adopted similar containment procedures, yet the spread of contagion was much faster in Northern than in Southern Italy (almost invariably comparable to Lazio). It is quite evident from Wuhan experience that the stricter the isolation rules for assessed or potentially infected people, the easier it is to prevent SARS-CoV-2 spreading. This was the case in Rome where, immediately after being diagnosed, the two Chinese infected persons were admitted into the Spallanzani Hospital, a 40-year-renowned research and care center for infectious diseases and all their travel-mates and contacts were identified and isolated into the Cecchignola military citadel on the outskirts of Rome. All over Lombardy, instead, due to the lack of symptoms of infected people for several days or even weeks, virus spread was much wider, thus reaching out to Veneto and Emilia-Romagna regions, and presumably required longer to develop earlier symptoms after being infected.</p>
