<p id="p0100">A final report coming from TOSCA, a recent nationwide study on people with T2DM, known to affect mostly older patients who, in turn, are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 disease, shows that a high adherence to the Mediterranean diet is significantly more frequent among people living in the southern regions of Italy

 <xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. This takes on a particular significance when comparing the absolute and relative death rate of subjects with T2DM in Lombardy (11,384 deaths; 56.9% of infected individuals) to that observed in Lazio (259 deaths; 1.3% of infected individuals). Might this add to the picture? At the moment, ours can only be taken as speculation but we strongly believe that also lifestyle components deserve further investigation with respect to COVID-19 disease.
