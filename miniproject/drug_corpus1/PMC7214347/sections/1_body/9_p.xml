<p id="p0050">Are there any other possible explanations for accelerated coronavirus spread in Lombardy? Indeed, the most affected area in the region, including Milan and its hinterland, is quite rich in farms and industries asking for intensive daily commuting and in the early phases of the epidemic most activities were still in place and partially stopped only about two weeks later. In fact, beginning of March, after the outbreak had already shown its threatening potential, only “crucial” activities were allowed to go on including food and drug chains, logistic support providers, general practitioner (GP) offices, which anyway involved some 40% of the working population 
 <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. So considerable train, metro and bus commuting, relatively late recognition and multiple outbreak sites might have favored such a large infection spreading pattern in Northern Italy.
