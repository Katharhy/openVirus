<p id="Par115">Although COVID-19 primary triggers a respiratory disease, pervasive myocarditis and fatal arrhythmia cases in infected patients suggest COVID-19’s deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system. Moreover, a subset of patients also manifests neurologic symptoms likely due to the virus’ ability to retrogradely travel from the lung to the brainstem cardiorespiratory center via neuronal synapses. This multi-organ, heart-brain infection may exacerbate respiratory failure. The critical entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, is the ubiquitous ACE2 receptor to which viral SP docks. The ACE2 may reveal acute and chronic multi-organ effects of COVID-19 which warrants further investigation and continued action to lessen the spread of the virus.</p>
