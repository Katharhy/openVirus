<p id="Par44">This review will cover our current understanding of the pathology of COVID-19 and highlight similarities between the Spanish flu and past pandemicsâ€™ pathology, social behavior, and treatments. By focusing on these disease overlaps, in particular convalescent plasma and stem cells targeting the virus entry point, we may gain insights on the best treatments and human behavior to address the current pandemic. Furthermore, we will discuss the latest preclinical and clinical data of available therapies and by highlighting critical gaps in knowledge, we hope to emphasize the importance of human behavior and innovative therapies as we wait for the development of a vaccine.</p>
