<p id="Par43">History repeats itself and when assessing the proper responses to the current pandemic, it is important to learn from the past. In a historical review of viral pandemics, the 1918 Spanish flu stands out which infected 500 million people and led to an estimated 17 to 50 million deaths [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Like the current pandemic, the Spanish flu began from a zoonotic transmission, progressed rapidly from infection to symptom onset with viral consolidation in the lung, and lead to death primarily by pneumonia in severe cases [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The main catalyst of the high mortality rate of the Spanish flu was lack of initial response, overcrowding, and poor hygiene, emphasizing the critical role human behavior plays in the spread of infectious diseases. Three important takeaways stand out from the 1918 pandemic. First, those who survived the first wave developed immunity against the virus and gave these individuals immunity during the second wave. This highlights the potential of passive immunity-based treatments using antibodies collected from the plasma of recovered COVID-19 patients. The second lesson is that the end of Spanish flu cases in 1920 marking the eradication of the pandemic may not capture the full picture of the pandemic. Evidence of slow-progressive cases of Spanish flu has been associated with secondary bacterial pneumonia linked to neurological disorders like pediatric encephalitis lethargica in the 1920 s [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], which was suggested to manifest in adulthood as Parkinson’s disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Similarly, the potential long-term neurological and cardiac repercussions of COVID-19 warrant critical attention as the research surrounding this pandemic unfolds. Third, the overcrowding in military camps and lack of sanitation due to poverty during World War I contributed to the escalation of the Spanish flu, emphasizing the importance of human behavior on containing the current pandemic. As states reopen in response to the current economic crisis and restrictions continue to ease over the next few months, the security blanket of disillusioned comfort—or ignorance of the dangers of the virus—may be the biggest threat to the future health of our society.
