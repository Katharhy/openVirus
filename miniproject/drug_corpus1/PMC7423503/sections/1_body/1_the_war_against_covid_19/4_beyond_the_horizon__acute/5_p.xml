<p id="Par77">The incidence of stroke in COVID-19 patients exemplifies the need for vigilance on non-respiratory diseases that may present with devastating symptoms as that produced by the primary lung pathology. Cerebrovascular disease appeared in 5.7% of COVID-19 patients with dire symptoms during the late onset of the virus [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. In Italy, ischemic stroke appeared at a rate of 2.5% in a group of hospitalized patients. This percentage was 5% in China and 3.7% with Dutch COVID-19 patients [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Since ACE2 receptors are prominent in the endothelial lining of blood vessels, COVID-19 may spur vascular endothelial damage, increasing the chance of thrombogenesis and cerebrovascular ischemia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. COVID-19 may also incite stroke by intensifying inflammation through an increase in D-dimer and CRP [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. However, the exact mechanism behind COVID-19-induced ischemic stroke is unknown, so further examination is warranted [
