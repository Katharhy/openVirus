<p id="Par75">The cardiovascular repercussions of COVID-19 infection may be primarily due to the presence of the ACE2 receptor in cardiac tissue. COVID-19 internalization via the ACE2 receptor leads to a loss of the ACE2 peptidase pathway, which can generate a rise in blood pressure, fibrosis, and inflammation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Infected patients have substantially greater angiotensin II (ANG II) levels than healthy individuals, indicating the loss of ACE2 activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. In addition, ACE2 plays a role in the progression of diabetes mellitus and hypertension [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Individuals with diabetes and hypertension are at higher risk from COVID-19 because of increased ACE2 expression. Furthermore, COVID-19â€™s affinity for the ACE2 receptor may have detrimental effects on the cardiovascular system, potentially causing acute and chronic cardiac injury in patients. Although the expression of the ACE2 pathway may be a prominent agent of cardiovascular complications in COVID-19 patients, there may be other signaling pathways that lead to COVID-19-induced cardiac complications. COVID-19 can cause vascular inflammation by spurring the secretion of the following inflammatory factors: troponin, natriuretic peptides, and IL-6 cytokines. Inflammation in the cardiovascular system can lead to diffuse microangiopathy, thrombosis, myocarditis, cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and acute coronary syndrome [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. COVID-19 can cause myocardial trauma through an increase in inflammatory factors, such as IL-6, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, and D-dimer, which indicates the formation of a cytokine storm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. The virus can also impair myocardial tissue through hypoxemia and respiratory damage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. COVID-19 may also impact the heart directly, inducing myocardial injury through viral myocarditis and stress cardiomyopathy rather than via inflammatory factors [
