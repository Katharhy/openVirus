<p id="Par49">The potent interaction between ACE2 and SP mediates the efficient entry of the virus into host cells. Electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged ridges that flank the catalytic domain of ACE2 and the positively charged receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SP enable SARS-Cov-2 to localize to its receptor [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. ACE2 receptors contain a peptidase domain that binds to the RBD of SPs through polar interactions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Following this docking, two proteolytic cleavage events take place. First, furin protease cleaves SP into S1 and S2 subunits. Second, the serine protease TMPRSS2 cleaves SP on the S2 subunit, initiating a series of conformational changes that prime the virus to enter the cell [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. TMPRSS2 also cleaves ACE2 between amino acids 697 to 716, and this cleavage is crucial to enhancing viral uptake [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The metalloprotease ADAM17 also acts on ACE2, but this does not augment viral uptake [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Therefore, TMPRSS2 both activates SARS-Cov-2 for uptake and simultaneously amplifies the rate of its uptake by cleaving ACE2.
