<p id="Par55">Although there are animal reservoirs of the virus, SARS-Cov-2 is most strongly associated with pathological effects in humans. Transgenic animal models expressing human ACE2 recapitulate its specificity and affinity for SP. Upon inoculation with SARS-Cov-2, mice expressing human ACE2 rapidly display signs of lethal infection in the lungs and brain, whereas mice expressing murine ACE2 do not develop infection [
