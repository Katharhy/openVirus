<p id="Par54">The specific structural features and amino acid sequences of SP and ACE2 underlie the selectiveness of their binding and explain the preferential binding of SARS-Cov-2 to ACE2 and rbsACE2. SP makes direct contact with ACE2 at three different points. In the first region of interaction, Gln
 <sup>498</sup>, Thr
 <sup>500</sup>, and Asn
 <sup>501</sup> on the RBD interact with Tyr
 <sup>41</sup>, Gln
 <sup>42</sup>, Lys
 <sup>353</sup>, and Arg
 <sup>357</sup> on ACE2 [

 <sup>417</sup> and Tyr
 <sup>453</sup> on the RBD associate with Asp
 <sup>30</sup> and His
 <sup>34</sup> on ACE2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The final point of contact is between Gln
 <sup>474</sup> and Phe
 <sup>486</sup> on the RBD and Gln
 <sup>24</sup> and Met
 <sup>82</sup> on ACE2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Substitutions of these amino acids may disrupt the affinity of the binding between SP and ACE2. Indeed, certain variants of the ACE2 allele exhibit weakened intermolecular interactions, pointing to the possibility of COVID-19-resistance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Similarly, the level of expression of ACE2 may be an indicator of resistance to SARS-Cov-2 infection or a prognostic marker whereby increased expression correlates with higher infectivity. Leveraging this to identify high-risk populations could help slow the spread of the virus. In contrast, alterations in the amino acid sequence may also increase the ability of the virus to enter the cell by further stabilizing the SP-ACE2 interaction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In addition to the RBD, amino acids 450–650 of SP are arranged in two anti-parallel β-sheets, β5 and β6. These SP structures, especially β6, bind with high affinity to ACE2, further emphasizing SPs’ importance as the ligand for ACE2 [
