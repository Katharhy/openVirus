<p id="Par46">SARS-Cov-2 is a single-stranded, non-segmented, positive-sense RNA virus that measures 65–125 nm in diameter and 29.9 kb in length [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It is composed of a 5’-untranslated region (UTR), 3’-UTR, replicase complex, membrane protein gene, nucleocapsid gene, envelope protein gene, and spike protein gene [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The trimeric spike protein (SP) of SARS-Cov-2 mediates the entry of the virus into host cells and is therefore critical to the pathogenesis of the disease (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). SP is a class one dual subunit transmembrane fusion glycoprotein exclusively expressed by viruses that binds to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an endogenous extracellular receptor. This initiates cleavage events that facilitate SARS-Cov-2 fusion and entry into the host cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The S1 and S2 subunits of SP are non-covalently bound, host-processed proteins that mediate the binding and fusion capabilities of SARS-Cov-2, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The S1 subunit recognizes and binds to ACE2 with high affinity, implicating the interaction of viral SP and human ACE2 as the key intermediary for host-cell entry [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].
