<p id="Par48">ACE2 is a type 1 integral membrane protein that functions as an extracellular receptor attached to the plasma membrane of cells in the lungs, heart, brain, and other vital organs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It is primarily expressed on type 2 pneumocytes in the lungs and on enterocytes in the small intestine. ACE2 normally modulates blood pressure through the renin-angiotensin system by cleaving circulating angiotensin II into the vasodilator angiotensin. SARS-Cov-2 leverages the ubiquitous expression and physiologic importance of ACE2 to enter and replicate within healthy cells throughout the body. This leads to an increase in viral load and systemic adverse multi-organ effects.
