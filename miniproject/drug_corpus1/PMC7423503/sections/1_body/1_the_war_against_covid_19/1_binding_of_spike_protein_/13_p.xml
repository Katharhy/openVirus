<p id="Par57">The highly specific interaction between SP and ACE2 is well defined and is a critical target for therapeutic strategies that attempt to prevent infection. A variety of vital organs express the ACE2 receptor and are thus susceptible to SP-binding and the lethal damage induced by viral infection. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the effects of SARS-Cov-2 in the most commonly affected organ, the lungs, but also in other ACE2- and SP-expressing organs such as the brain, heart, intestines, and liver.</p>
