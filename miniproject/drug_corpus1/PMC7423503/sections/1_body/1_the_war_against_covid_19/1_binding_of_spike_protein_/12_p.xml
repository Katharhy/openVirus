<p id="Par56">The capacity of SP to utilize human ACE2 to enter cells ensures the viability of the virus in several tissues. ACE2 expression is high in the small intestines, kidneys, heart, and lungs, although it is also present in key organs such as the nerves and brain [

 <sup>5</sup> and 2.7 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> copies per gram of tissue, respectively [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The prevalence of SP-ACE2 binding in these organs explains their substantial capacity to harbor the virus. It also justifies the elevated viral loads in those other organs such as the heart and brain.
