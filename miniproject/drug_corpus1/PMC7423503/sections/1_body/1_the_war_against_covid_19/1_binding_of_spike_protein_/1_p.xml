<p id="Par45">The term coronavirus refers to more than 40 species of viruses within the family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> that cause respiratory tract infections in humans. Coronaviruses classify into either alpha and beta subtypes that infect humans, or into gamma and delta subtypes, which mainly infect avians. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-Cov) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus (MERS-Cov), are two betacoronaviruses that precipitated the SARS and MERS epidemics in 2003 and 2012, respectively. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) is a new genetically-related betacoronavirus species responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.
