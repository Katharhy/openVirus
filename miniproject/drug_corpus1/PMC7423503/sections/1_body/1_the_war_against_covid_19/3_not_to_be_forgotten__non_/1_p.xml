<p id="Par68">The neuroinvasive capacity of SARS-CoV-2 has been demonstrated in both humans and animals. Intensive care patients display neurological symptoms such as nausea, headaches, and vomiting [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. A recent study on SARS-CoV-2 found that 78 out of 214 patients demonstrated infection of the central nervous system (CNS). More severe patients manifested acute cerebrovascular diseases, impaired consciousness, and skeletal muscle injury [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Although the exact route SARS-CoV-2 takes to infect the CNS is not known, SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Looking at the mechanisms of entry of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may provide key insight into the route SARS-CoV-2 takes to infect the CNS. SARS-CoV, like SARS-CoV-2, utilizes the ACE2 receptor for entry to the cell while MERS-CoV enters cells through dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). The presence of ACE2 alone is not conclusive of a cell’s vulnerability to infection. Interestingly, human intestinal endothelial cells expressing ACE2 were not infected by SARS-CoV, and hepatocytes, non-detectable-ACE2 expressing cells, were infected by SARS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were found to infect the brains of patients in the early 2000 s, and most viral material was found in neurons [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Transgenic mice inoculated intranasally with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV displayed a high mortality rate. Mice administered low concentration of MERS-CoV intranasally only displayed viral infection of the CNS, not the lungs, indicating that the cause of death may be directly due to CNS infection. For both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infected mice the brain stem was most concentrated with viral particles. Evidence now suggests coronaviruses enter the CNS via synaptic avenues upon infection of peripheral nerve terminals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Swine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV) particles, a coronavirus, were enclosed in smooth surface vesicles within the axons of mice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Vesicles containing HEV were transported via microtubules to perikaryons and dendrites, where the viral material was later found in high concentrations. Upon replication in these cells, virions were packed in spinule-coated vesicles in the trans-golgi networks. It is hypothesized that coated vesicles mediate endo- and exocytosis of the virus into and out of the CNS. Extracellular virion accumulation may have been the causing factor of dilated synaptic clefts, consequently allowing the trans-synaptic transfer of the coated virus-containing vesicles to other host neurons [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. This phenomenon must now be explored with SARS-CoV-2 to attenuate brainstem-induced cardiovascular and pulmonary complications. Further elucidation regarding the neuroinvasive capacity of SARS-CoV-2 may provide insight to better mitigate symptoms and prevent infection in humans.
