<p id="Par72">SARS-CoV-2, the cause of viral pneumonia spreading across the globe, can infect many vital organs via SP-ACE2 mediated cellular infection. SP is critical to extrapulmonary organ infection due to its ability to promote viral uptake in these tissues. Furthermore, certain mechanisms in the gastrointestinal tract and heart bolster SP-mediated viral uptake. In the gastrointestinal system, the high concentration of the TMPRSS2 protease enhances the ability of SARS-Cov-2 to enter intestinal epithelial cells [

Establishing effective treatments to mitigate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on non-lung organs will be very beneficial for sequestering the spread of the virus outside of the lungs, which will likely treat the noted comorbidities.
