<p id="Par67">The lungs are a conduit through which SARS-Cov-2 accesses the systemic circulation to infect other vital organs and tissues. As the virus travels from the lungs to the rest of the body, it propagates widespread damage and dysfunction by promoting inflammation that culminates in a cytokine storm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. This worsens patient outcomes and results in long-term tissue damage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Therefore, it is essential to continue to investigate the pathology and treatments for SARS-Cov-2 infection in the lungs as the primary target of the virus. Notwithstanding, the recognition that ACE2 is also highly expressed in other organs equally warrants examination of the role of this enzyme/receptor in the downstream consequences of SARS-Cov-2 beyond lung infection.
