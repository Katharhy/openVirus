<p id="Par65">While the severity of respiratory symptoms is useful in predicting outcomes, several non-invasive methods also allow tracking of the extent of COVID-19-induced lung damage. Computer Tomography (CT) analysis is a diagnostic imaging procedure useful for evaluating the pathology of the lungs. CT image-calculated well-aerated lung volume predicts the risk of ICU admission and death [

Ultrasound is another valuable imaging technique to explore the extent of lung damage. COVID-19 pneumonia increases the presence of B-lines, consolidation, and pleural line abnormalities in the posterior regions of the lungs [
