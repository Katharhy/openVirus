<p id="Par66">The interaction of SARS-Cov-2 with the lungs directly explains its tremendous infectivity potential. Not only is the respiratory tract is the primary point of entry of the virus into the body, but it also contains the highest concentration of ACE2 receptors for SP to complex with. Furthermore, SARS-Cov-2 survives within the respiratory tract more effectively than it can in other tissues, highlighting the imminent need for therapeutics targeting the lungs [

Excess virus production results in catastrophic lung damage and effectively destroys the tissues within which SARS-Cov-2 lives. SP-induced downregulation of ACE2 expression thus enhances viral survival, which increases the probability that SARS-Cov-2 will successfully transmit to another host. Simultaneously, ACE2 is also upregulated in the presence of lung tissue damage due to interferon activity [
