<p id="Par93">Another antiviral drug being explored for the treatment of COVID-19 is lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r). Lopinavir is a protease inhibitor and ritonavir is a booster and they are commonly used to treat HIV infection in combination. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have demonstrated the ability of lopinavir in inhibiting SARS-CoV, reducing symptoms such as diarrhea and recurrence of fever, and lowering the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome with LPV/r and ribavirin [
