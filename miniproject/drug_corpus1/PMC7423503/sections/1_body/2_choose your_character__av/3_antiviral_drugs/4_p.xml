<p id="Par94">Favipiravir (brand name Avigan) has been developed and used for the treatment of avian influenza or other types of influenza that are resistant to NA inhibitors. Favipiravir inhibits the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of RNA viruses such as Ebola, influenza, and norovirus and induces lethal RNA transversion mutations to produce a nonviable virus phenotype [
