<p id="Par97">A potential target for drug development for COVID-19 also involves inhibition of ACE2, the host cell receptor for the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 that is primed by TMPRSS2 protease and may prevent the entry of the virus. The antimalarial drugs, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine have been shown to inhibit terminal phosphorylation of ACE2 and serve as candidate drugs against the COVID-19 disease [

Additionally, the triple combination of cepharanthine/selamectin/mefloquine hydrochloride serves as a candidate drug combination against the SARS-CoV-2 infection with access through ACE2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. The ability to weaken the binding of the virus to ACE2 may prevent entry and replication of the virus and can be blocked by experimental and established drugs. Further studies are required to determine the benefits of such medications and their therapeutic potential in inhibiting the binding of the virus to ACE2.
