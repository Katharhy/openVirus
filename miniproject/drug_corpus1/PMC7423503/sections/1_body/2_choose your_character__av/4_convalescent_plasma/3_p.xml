<p id="Par101">Based on previously mentioned research advancements in plasma therapy, its utility for COVID-19 patients has reached clinical testing. In addition to 152 publications of review and commentary articles on convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19, there are 173 ongoing clinical trials that are investigating the use of convalescent plasma for COVID-19. Small clinical studies conducted in the US and East Asian countries have displayed an increase in antibody titers and a decrease in the viral activity of plasma-treated patients [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>]. The viral load in COVID-19 patients was nearly undetectable and assumed to be eliminated after treatment [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>]. Despite different dosage of plasma, ranging from 200 mL to 500 mL, no findings on adverse events of convalescent plasma therapy were reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>]. Additionally, significant recovery in respiratory functions was demonstrated seven days after convalescent plasma infusion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. Infusion of convalescent plasma also stabilized the health conditions of critically ill COVID-19 patients, removing the need for ventilators over time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. Patients who fully recovered after receiving convalescent plasma therapy were discharged from hospitals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>]. Current evidence favors the effective use of convalescent therapy for COVID-19. To further encourage the idea of plasma therapy as a possible COVID-19 treatment, direct comparisons of protocols, safety, and efficacy in ongoing or proposed clinical trials should be made to assess the potential of convalescent plasma for COVID-19.
