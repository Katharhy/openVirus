<p id="Par108">In addition to its anti-immune and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, MSCs may possess the ability to interfere with viral docking via ACE2-SP interaction. As previously discussed, MSCs regulate immune and inflammatory activity by inhibiting inflammatory factors and cytokine storms. MSCs are able to bind to various surface receptors to activate these mechanisms, such as IL-1R, TNFI, and IIR [

If MSCs possess this ability, the stem cell may competitively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 from entering and infecting the cell while also promoting anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Future studies should investigate this potent interaction between ACE2 and MSCs or other compatible stem cells that can interfere with ACE2-SP docking of SARS-CoV-2 and modulate immune and inflammatory responses.
