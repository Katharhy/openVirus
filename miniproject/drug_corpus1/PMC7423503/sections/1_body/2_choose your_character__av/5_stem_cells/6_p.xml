<p id="Par109">Preclinical studies have investigated the use of MSCs in treating lung diseases with similar dysregulation of regular immune and inflammatory responses as COVID-19. In one notable study, the endotoxin model of acute lung injury was used to observe the therapeutic effects of MSC [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>]. Mice were treated with MSC 4Â h after severe lung damage. MSC treated mice demonstrated significant pulmonary recovery. Significant survival and histological improvements were also observed in MSC-treated groups compared to the control. Additionally, proinflammatory activity was replaced with an anti-inflammatory response to endotoxin after MSC doses were introduced, highlighting the immunomodulatory effects of MSC [

However, when the same group rolled out the phase IIa study, there were no statistical differences between treatment and placebo groups in mortality and the number of ventilator-free days [

Another phase I, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessing the safety of human adipose tissue-derived MSC transplantation in patients with ARDS revealed short-term improvement in oxygenation, but ventilator-free days, ICU-free days and duration of hospital stay remained unchanged (NCT01902082) [
