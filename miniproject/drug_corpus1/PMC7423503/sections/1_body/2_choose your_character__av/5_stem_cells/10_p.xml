The validated safety and efficacy of stem cells in treating respiratory conditions, including ARDS and lung damage, predicts their value for ameliorating COVID-19 outcomes. Furthermore, stem cells effectively repair and regenerate extra-pulmonary tissues damaged by SARS-Cov-2 infection, notably the heart and brain. Perhaps most compelling is that MSCs cannot be infected by SARS-Cov-2, as they are ACE2 negative. Therefore, SP-mediated viral uptake is blocked, allowing healthy MSCs to directly counter inflammation and tissue damage induced by SARS-Cov-2. This ensures that patients treated with MSCs will continue to benefit through the full life cycle of the transplanted stem cells, particularly the sustained anti-inflammatory and regenerative effects. The future of stem cell therapy for COVID-19 is promising, with anticipated positive clinical trial results to come over the next few months.
