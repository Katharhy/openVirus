<p id="Par106">Prominent sources of stem cells for regenerative therapy are embryonic stem cells (ESCs), fetal stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), and adult stem cells. Pluripotent ESCs generated from the blastocyst can differentiate into all three germ layers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]. Their great differential ability elucidates their therapeutic potential for regenerative therapy, as they can evolve into specialized cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>]. However, ethical concerns surrounding the destruction of embryos and high risk for tumorigenicity limit the use of ESCs in clinical applications. Fetal stem cells are produced from fetal tissues, such as the placenta, amniotic fluid, and fetal membranes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>]. They have great proliferative capabilities, can differentiate into a variety of progenitor cells, and are less likely to spur immune rejection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>]. iPSCs are genetically reprogrammed somatic cells that behave similarly to ESCs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]. They show promise in the treatment of degenerative disorders due to their self-renewal and differentiative capabilities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>]. However, they are likely to be rejected by the host and have the highest tumorigenicity of other stem cell types. Adult stem cells are generated from adult tissue and include mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), hematopoietic stem cells, and resident adult stem cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>]. They show significant therapeutic potential for damaged tissue repair as they can be engineered to differentiate into specialized cells, replacing impaired cells, as well as secrete anti-inflammatory agents [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>]. MSCs derived from bone marrow and the human umbilical cord demonstrate significant therapeutic efficacy for regenerative therapy and have a long track record of safety in hematologic disorders [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>]. MSCs carry significant restorative capabilities, as they can differentiate into specialized cells like chondrocytes, adipocytes, and osteoblasts and secrete paracrine and autocrine factors that promote tissue rehabilitation and ameliorate inflammation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>]. Clinical trials using MSCs to treat hematologic disorders have confirmed their safety profile, expediting their application in non-hematological disorders, and the use of MSCs for brain disorders associated with a destructive immune response like stroke and TBI have reached clinical trials with promising results [
