<p id="Par107">Because MSCs possess the ability to regulate the immune and inflammatory activity, MSC therapy can potentially be used to treat COVID-19. As previously described, the intermolecular interaction between the viral SP and human ACE2 initiates the infection of host cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>]. Once the virus enters the host, macrophages of the immune system detect and bind to the foreign molecule to fend off the virus, recruiting proteins and initiating the immune cascade in the process [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The viral-induced immune cascade causes extensive tracheobronchial inflammation, further causing pulmonary damage in COVID-19 patients and promoting SARS and ARDS symptoms, such as pulmonary edema, hypoxia, respiratory distress, and lung damage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Furthermore, replicated SARS-COV-2 utilizes the lungs to circulate within the patientâ€™s body. Similar to the pathology of the pulmonary infection, SARS-CoV-2 can infiltrate and infect ACE2-harboring cardiac or neural tissue. The viral activity prompts an increased immune response, leading to inflammation and further causing damage in the heart or brain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Since COVID-19 causes pulmonary damage as well as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular infection by overreacting the immune system and increasing inflammation, MSC transplantation may be a suitable approach against COVID-19.
