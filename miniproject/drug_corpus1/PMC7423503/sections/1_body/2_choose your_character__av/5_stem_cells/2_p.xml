<p id="Par105">Stem cell therapy stands as the prominent regenerative approach in a wide range of diseases, which interestingly include COVID-19 primary symptoms (i.e., lung disease) and co-morbid diseases such as but not limited to diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders [

Besides their regenerative capabilities, stem cells release immune system modulators which highlight their applicability in COVID-19’s aberrant immune and inflammatory response. To this end, stem cells can impart protection by attenuating inflammation and are being explored as treatment options for COVID-19 in clinical trials (Table 1). Preclinical studies have consistently shown the therapeutic effects of stem cell therapy on animal models of diseases plagued with impaired immune and inflammatory reactions [
