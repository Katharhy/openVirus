<p id="Par83">Quarantine is an old yet effective tool in controlling disease outbreaks. This practice was commonly employed in fourteenth-century Italy when ships coming from a plague-infected port arrived at a port in Italy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. The ships were required to anchor and wait for 40 days before passengers were allowed to disembark. These 40 days allowed for asymptomatic passengers to begin showing symptoms and be identified. This allowed for only healthy passengers to be allowed off the ship while infected individuals were sent to get treatment. This also prevented the asymptomatic passengers from spreading the disease to people in the port city.
