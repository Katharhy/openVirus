    <td>Human Embryonic Stem Cells (CAStem)</td>
    <td>Phase II</td>
    <td>CAStem cells will be intravenously injected into patients with or without acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) induced by COVID-19. Patients will receive doses of either 3, 5 or 10 million cells/kg, and dose escalation will ensue if initial cell infusion proves to be safe. Adverse events, mortality rate, time it takes for RT-PCR to be negative for SARS-CoV-2, and changes in blood oxygen levels will be assessed. In addition, levels of IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-6, and IL8 will be evaluated to further elucidate CAStem efficacy.</td>
