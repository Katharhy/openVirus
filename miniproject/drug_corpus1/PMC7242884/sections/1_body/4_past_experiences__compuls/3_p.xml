<p>Two countries that had notable success with decreasing the price of antiretroviral drugs in the mid-2000s were Thailand and Brazil. Both countries provided free antiretroviral treatments to all citizens living with HIV/AIDS and were thus keenly motivated to seek out affordable antiretroviral supplies. Specifically, both sought to procure and provide efavirenz (marketed as Sustiva by Merck) and lopinavir/ritonavir (marketed as Kaletra by AbbVie, then Abbott Laboratories) to their patients. In initial price negotiations with Thailand, Merck offered efavirenz at the price of US$500 per patient per year (PPPY), and Abbott offered lopinavir/ritonavir at the price of US$2200 PPPY. The Thai government rejected both of these offers due to the high prices and issued compulsory licenses for both drugs in late 2006 and early 2007. These licenses allowed the Thai government to import generic versions of the antiretroviral drugs from India at a significantly lowered cost â€“ generic efavirenz at US$224 PPPY and generic lopinavir/ritonavir at US$676 PPPY [
