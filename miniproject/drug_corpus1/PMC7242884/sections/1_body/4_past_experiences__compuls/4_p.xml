<p>Like Thailand, Brazil issued a compulsory license for efavirenz in 2007. Merck initially offered efavirenz to Brazil at the price of US$760 PPPY. By issuing a compulsory license for efavirenz, Brazil was able to generically import efavirenz at US$170 per patient/y. However, unlike Thailand, Brazil did not issue a compulsory license for lopinavir/ritonavir. In response to Brazil’s persistent price negotiations and credible threat of using a compulsory license, Abbott Laboratories eventually lowered the price of lopinavir/ritonavir in Brazil from US$3241 PPPY to a price of US$1380 PPPY for an older version and US$1518 for a heat-stable version [
