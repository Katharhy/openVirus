<p>The experiences learned from the HIV/AIDS epidemic should be applied to the fight against COVID-19. Countries that previously used compulsory licenses to provide affordable antiretroviral drugs for their citizens should do so again if necessary.

The WHO, WTO, and legal organizations such as the Advisory Centre on World Trade Organization Law (ACWL) can facilitate knowledge sharing among public health officials and government lawyers across developing countries. Whether it is through virtual workshops or other collaborative online forums, now is an important time to help developing countries build the legal and logistical capacity to use compulsory licensing in the face of COVID-19.</p>
