<p>In anticipation of the needs of their most vulnerable populations, governments of developing countries should prepare to issue compulsory licenses of any effective COVID-19 treatments. Compulsory licensing, a provision in the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (“TRIPS Agreement”), enables governments to supply its citizens with generic versions of patented treatments either through domestic production or foreign imports. As will be discussed below, compulsory licensing was used as a successful policy tool for improving access to antiretroviral drugs in the face of the AIDS epidemic. While there is no approved treatment for COVID-19 at present, national governments are legally entitled to issue compulsory licenses and should not shy away from this policy option when a treatment is available.</p>
