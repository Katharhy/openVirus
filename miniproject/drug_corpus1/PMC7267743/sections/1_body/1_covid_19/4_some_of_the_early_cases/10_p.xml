<p>Wang et al. examined the epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and treatment data on 138 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. They found that 26% of patients needed ICU admission and 4.3% died. The median patient age was 56 years and 54.3% were male. Older age, comorbidities and abnormal laboratory tests including lymphopaenia, increased D-dimer, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and prolonged PTT were associated with a worse prognosis.
