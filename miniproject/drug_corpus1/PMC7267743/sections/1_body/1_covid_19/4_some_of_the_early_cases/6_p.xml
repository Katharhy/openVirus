<p>Li et al. collected demographic information, exposure history and illness timelines on 425 of the initial confirmed cases in Wuhan. The median age was 59 years and 56% were male. As 55% of cases were linked to the original Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, this was evident of human-to-human transmission. They described a doubling of cases every 7.4 days and suggested a 14-day observation or quarantine period for exposed persons. They described that each infected person spread the virus to an average of 2.2 people they come in contact with. As none of their cases were children, they postulated that children may be less likely to be infected or have milder symptoms.
