<p>Liu et al. performed a small study on only 12 patients in Shenzhen China, of which eight were males and seven were older than 60 years. They found that laboratory parameters associated with worse prognosis were decreased albumin concentrations, lymphopaenia and elevated CRP and LDH concentrations. They measured angiotensin II concentrations by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and found them to be increased. This increased angiotensin II was associated with a high viral load and lung injury suggesting an imbalanced renin angiotensin system (RAS). The authors therefore questioned the possible utility of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) as possible treatment modalities.
