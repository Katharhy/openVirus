<p>The cytokine storm occurs in a subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19. This is defined as a hyperinflammatory state characterized by a fulminant and fatal increase in inflammatory cytokines with subsequent multiorgan failure. Ferritin concentrations are raised, cytopaenia occurs and approximately half of the patients develop significant pulmonary involvement such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
