<p>A study of 195 COVID-19 patients from two hospitals in China, of which one was in Wuhan, found that 54 (27.6%) died in hospital. Increased risk of in-hospital death was associated with older age, organ failure and raised D-dimer levels, and the authors postulated that these could possibly be used on admission to identify patients with a worse prognosis.
