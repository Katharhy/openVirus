<p>The RAS is an important regulator of blood pressure homeostasis. Renin is a protease secreted by the kidney, which cleaves angiotensinogen, a serpin family protein produced by the liver, to inactive angiotensin I. This is then cleaved to the active angiotensin II by ACE which is secreted by the kidneys and lungs and expressed ubiquitously in the vasculature. Angiotensin II binds angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptors and causes vasoconstriction and the secretion of aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone with subsequent renal sodium and water reabsorption and raised blood pressure.
