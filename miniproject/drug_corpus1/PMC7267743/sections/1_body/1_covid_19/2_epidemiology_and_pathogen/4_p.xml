<p>All CoVs have zoonotic origins, with bats considered the natural reservoir hosts.

 </sup> In SARS-CoV-2, the sequence identity of pangolin origin CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is 99%, and this raised the question whether the virus is of pangolin origin.

 </sup> The natural hosts, namely bats, have a limited inflammatory response as seen by lower interleukin (IL)-1β concentrations and adequate type I interferons, giving rise to a generalized anti-inflammatory milieu and an ability to limit excessive inflammatory response.

 </sup> Interestingly, this may also explain bats’ relatively long lifespan of 30–40 years.

 </sup> Type I interferon is known to assist with antiviral control. CoV cannot infect humans unless the virus undergoes mutation and recombination in animal hosts.
