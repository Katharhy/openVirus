<p>The SARS-CoV-2 has a single-stranded RNA genome enveloped in a lipid membrane embedded with glycoprotein spikes giving the impression of a crown â€“ hence the name coronavirus (CoV). RNA viruses use an error-prone RNA polymerase for replication and therefore have high mutation rates and can easily mutate during epidemics adapting to local environment to facilitate transmission.

 </sup> However, these mutations are part of the virus life cycle and should not impact outbreaks.
