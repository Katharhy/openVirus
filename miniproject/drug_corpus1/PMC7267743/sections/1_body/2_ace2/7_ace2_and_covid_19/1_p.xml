<p>Human ACE2 is a functional receptor essential for cellular entry of CoVs and is the same receptor used by SARS-CoV to gain access to cells.

 </sup> When ACE2 knockout and wildtype mice were infected with SARS-CoV, the knockout mice had very low levels of viral replication in their lungs. In the wildtype mice, SARS-CoV infection was associated with lung failure which was attenuated by treatment blocking the RAS. They postulated that SARS-CoV infection downregulated ACE2 concentrations, possibly explaining the decline in lung function observed with viral infection.
