<p>The spike (S) proteins of CoVs facilitate viral entry into the target cells by attaching to ACE2 as an entry receptor.

 </sup> SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV, has a viral envelope studded with spikes consisting of glycoproteins made up by two subunits, namely S1 and S2. Subunit S1 binds the cell surface bound ACE2 and subunit S2 fuses with the cell membrane.

 </sup> The cellular serine protease, TMPRSS2, is essential for S-protein priming and facilitates viral cell entry.

 </sup> TMPRSS is expressed on SARS-CoV target cells.

 </sup> After subunit S1 of the spike binds to membrane bound ACE2, TMPRSS2 activates the spike and cleaves the ACE2 receptor. TMPRSS2 also acts on the S2 subunit, causing an irreversible conformational change facilitating fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell membrane and endocytosis.

 </sup> Therefore, both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are essential for cellular entry. SARS-CoV-2 binds human ACE2 with 10â€“20-fold higher affinity than SARS-CoV.

 </sup> This may be due to a more compact virus structure enabling better receptor affinity and enhanced ability to be internalized.
