 </sup> determined that SARS-CoV infection has a detrimental effect on cardiac function and led to cardiac dysfunction, arrhythmias and death. They measured ACE2 concentrations in mice infected with human strain SARS-CoV and in hearts obtained from autopsy of patients who died from SARS infection. They found that SARS-CoV infection led to a decrease in ACE2 expression in the myocardium of mice with subsequent myocardial dysfunction. SARS-CoV mRNA expression was found in 35% of the autopsy heart samples, which was associated with decreased ACE2 protein expression. Therefore, they postulated that SARS-CoV leads to cardiac dysfunction by downregulating myocardial ACE2, possibly due to a cytokine-mediated downregulation of ACE2 mRNA.
