<p>An interesting observation is the difference in infection rate and adverse outcomes in adults and children. Although there have been reports of less COVID-19 infection in children, there is a lack of evidence that ACE2 changes with age.

 </sup> A possible hypothesis is that children are less susceptible to COVID-19 infection due to cross-protective antibodies from multiple upper respiratory tract infections and that their lower respiratory tracts have less ACE2.

 </sup> Limited studies and data in children are available, and conclusive evidence to support postulations that children are less likely to be adversely affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection is lacking.
