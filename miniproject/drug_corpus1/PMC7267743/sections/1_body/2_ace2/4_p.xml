<p>There are two forms of ACE2. The full-length ACE2 is found in cell membranes and consists of a transmembrane anchor and an extracellular domain which is the receptor site for the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. The second form is a soluble form which is shed into the circulation. This form of ACE lacks membrane anchors and circulates in low concentrations.

 </sup> Circulating levels do not reflect issue levels. It has been proposed that the soluble form of ACE2 may inhibit the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to membrane-bound ACE2 and therefore proposed a soluble recombinant of ACE2 as a potential treatment for COVID-19.
