<p>ACE2 is involved in the possible protective arm of the RAS. The ACE2/angiotensin (1–7)/MAS axis counterbalances the ACE/angiotensin II/AT1 axis which is associated with vasoconstriction, inflammation, cell proliferation, hypertrophy, fibrosis and tissue modelling. Therefore, ACE2 protects against RAS-induced injuries by decreasing angiotensin II and generating angiotensin (1–7), which increases substrate availability of the protective axis.

 </sup> ACE2 knockout mice and those on ACE2 inhibitors had increased susceptibility to myocardial infarction, hypertension, angiotensin II-induced myocardial hypertrophy, microvascular complication, inflammation, fibrosis, diastolic and systolic dysfunction and oxidative stress.
