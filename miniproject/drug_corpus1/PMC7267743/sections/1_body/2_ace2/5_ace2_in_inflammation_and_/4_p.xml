<p>A strong association between RAS and cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disorders and acute lung injury was demonstrated in mice with acid aspiration lung injury. In severe acute lung failure, a significant downregulation of ACE2 was noted. The expression of ACE was unchanged leading to a marked increase in angiotensin II, as its formation is upregulated by ACE. Therefore, ACE promotes disease through increased angiotensin II, and ACE-deficient mice were partly protected against acid-induced lung injury. Recombinant ACE2 and AT2 receptor expression protected mice from severe lung disease in this scenario.

 </sup> The inactivation of ACE on an ACE2 knockout background rescued the mice from severe lung failure. Therefore, it was postulated that ACE promotes acute lung injury, and ACE2 alleviates it.
