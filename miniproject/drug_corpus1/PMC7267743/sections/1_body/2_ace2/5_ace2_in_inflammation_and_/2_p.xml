<p>When AT2 is bound, NO is released, which is an anti-inflammatory vasodilator, reduces platelet aggregation and may facilitate the insulin action.

 </sup> Therefore, angiotensin II binding of AT1 is an inflammatory mediator via reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nuclear factor kappa β (NFKβ) and provides a mitogenic stimulus for smooth muscles leading to oxidative stress. This is a common feature of atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. Stimulation of AT1 also leads to upregulation of adhesion molecules and interferes with insulin signalling leading to insulin resistance. ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy were found to decrease circulating CRP, and this is thought to be due to decreased angiotensin II stimulation of AT1.
