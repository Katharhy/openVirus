<p>Disruption of ACE2 in mice leads to severe cardiac contractility defects, increased angiotensin II concentrations and the expression of hypoxia-induced cardiac genes. When ACE was also decreased, this cardiac phenotype was rescued. However, loss of ACE2 did not affect blood pressure or kidney development in these mice, and it was postulated that ACE could potentially compensate for loss of ACE2. Yet, even when these mice were treated with ACE inhibitor, there was a similar reduction in blood pressure as in wild type; therefore, ACE2 has no apparent direct effect on blood pressure.
