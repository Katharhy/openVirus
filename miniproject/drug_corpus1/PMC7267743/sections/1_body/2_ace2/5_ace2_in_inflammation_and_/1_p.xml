<p>When angiotensin II binds to the AT1 receptor, vasoconstriction, inflammation, fibrosis and proliferation follow leading to hypertension, cardiac fibrosis, thrombosis and ARDS. Binding of angiotensin (1â€“7) to MAS receptor leads to vasodilatation, anti-apoptotic, anti-fibrotic and anti-proliferation activity and a reduction in blood pressure, decreased cardiac fibrosis, decreased thrombosis and decreased ARDS.
