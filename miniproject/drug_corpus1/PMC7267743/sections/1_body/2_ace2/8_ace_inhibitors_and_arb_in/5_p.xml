<p>Avian influenza A (H5N1) primarily infects poultry and birds, but since 2003 has also been infecting humans. Increased angiotensin II and downregulation of ACE2 was linked to infection severity and mortality. When mice infected with H5N1 were given recombinant ACE2, the virus-induced lung injury was ameliorated.
