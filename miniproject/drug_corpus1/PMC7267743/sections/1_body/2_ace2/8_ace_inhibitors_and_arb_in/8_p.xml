<p>When COVID-19 binds ACE2 and enters the cell, the expression of ACE2 is downregulated. This downregulation essentially ‘removes the brakes’ from angiotensin II and possibly induces local activation of immune cells. In lungs, decreased ACE2 in alveolar type II cells leads to surfactant deficit and the development of lung injury.

 </sup> Although an increase of ACE2 may lead to higher cell infection rates and proliferation of the virus, it may be beneficial in patients with lung injury and withdrawal may be harmful especially in high-risk patients.
