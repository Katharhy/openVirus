<p>A lot can be learned from studies involving other respiratory viruses where the use of ACE2-lowering treatment was investigated. A study on patients with novel influenza A (H7N9), a virus of avian origin from eastern China in 2013, found that more than 70% developed ARDS and had a high mortality. Patients with markedly elevated angiotensin II concentrations had poorer disease outcome with a predictive value higher than CRP. The authors speculated that recombinant ACE2 and angiotensin II-lowering treatment such as ACE inhibitors and ARB could be beneficial.
