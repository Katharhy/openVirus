<p>Although ACE2 mRNA is found in almost all organs, its protein expression is mainly in the lung (airways and type II alveolar cells), heart, kidney and intestine. It is also found in oral and nasal mucosa, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, testis and brain.

 </sup> ACE2 has an extracellular domain which is the receptor site for the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 to gain entry to the cell. It is specifically in lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes that it plays an important role in the entry of CoVs.

 </sup> ACE2 in enterocytes of the duodenum, jejenum and ileum may explain the virus being found in stool samples and support a possible faeco-oral transmission route.
