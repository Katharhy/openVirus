<p>Trials are underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of recombinant human ACE2 and the ARB losartan in COVID-19-infected patients. Infusion of recombinant human ACE2 may act as a decoy to interfere with viral replication. Soluble ACE2 could potentially bind SARS-CoV and thereby prevent the binding of the viral spike protein to full length membrane-bound ACE2

 </sup> Wang etÂ al. found that ACE inhibitors and ARB offer partial cardiovascular protection by increasing ACE2, and that IV recombinant ACE2 may be beneficial in preventing pulmonary arterial hypertension and acute lung injury.
