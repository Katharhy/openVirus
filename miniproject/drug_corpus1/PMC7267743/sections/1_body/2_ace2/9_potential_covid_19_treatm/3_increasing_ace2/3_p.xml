<p>ACE2 interaction with SARS-CoV is important in the development of SARS-associated cardiomyopathy, as viral RNA was found in the myocardium on postmortem examination. The associated cardiac injury due to reduced expression of ACE2 possibly played a major role in the morbidity and mortality of patients infected with SARS-CoV. Recombinant ACE2 was found to normalize angiotensin II concentrations, suggesting that it may be beneficial to prevent organ damage caused by SARS-CoV. The question thus arose if it is possible and beneficial to balance RAS control to reduce infection and prevent organ damage in COVID-19-infected patients.
