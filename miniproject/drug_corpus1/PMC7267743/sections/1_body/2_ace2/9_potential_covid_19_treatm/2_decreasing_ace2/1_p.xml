<p>Downregulation of ACE2 was proposed as a possible treatment to reduce susceptibility to COVID-19 infection. However, the ensuing relatively unopposed action of angiotensin II could lead to worsening hypertension, inflammation, thrombosis and adverse lung and cardiac outcome.

 </sup> A study by Kuba etÂ al. determined that infection with SARS-CoV downregulates the expression of ACE2. These low ACE2 concentrations were associated with lung oedema and acute lung injury, which contributed to the severe lung pathology in patients already on ACE inhibitors at the time of SARS-CoV infection. They concluded that modulating RAS may therefore be useful in treating infection.
