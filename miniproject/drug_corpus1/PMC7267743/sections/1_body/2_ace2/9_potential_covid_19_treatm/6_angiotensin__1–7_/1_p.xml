 </sup> Experimental studies found that angiotensin (1–7) reduced the acute inflammatory response and subsequent fibrosis in acid-induced ARDS in mice.

 </sup> Angiotensin (1–7) protected the lung against inflammation and fibrosis, inhibited alveolar cell apoptosis, attenuated endothelial cell activation, loss of barrier function and oedema, and decreased synthesis of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines. The authors therefore recommended that the concentrations of angiotensin (1–7) should be increased to protect COVID-19-infected patients.
