<p>Strategies to decrease ACE2 may possibly attenuate SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. This may happen in a number of ways. Firstly, endogenous angiotensin II theoretically prevents infection by binding the ACE2 during its degradation and therefore may compete with SARS-CoV-2 to bind to the receptor. Secondly, binding of angiotensin II to AT1 causes internalization and downregulation of ACE2. And lastly, angiotensin II causes AT1-dependent destruction of ACE2 further decreasing the virusâ€™ ability to enter cells. Angiotensin II is not yet available for use commercially, but due to the number of critically ill patients, and the promising outcome of the drug, it has been made available for compassionate use in Italy, Germany and UK.
