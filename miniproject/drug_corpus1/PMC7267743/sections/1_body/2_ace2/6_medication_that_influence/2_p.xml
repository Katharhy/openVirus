<p>Another area of interest is peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-γ). Insulin resistance is strongly associated with hypertension. ACE2 expression is increased with the use of PPAR-γ agonists.

 </sup> PPAR-γ agonists, thiazolidinediones, attenuate the development of hypertension and improve endothelial dysfunction in angiotensin II-infused rats.

 </sup> These rats had decreased AT1 expression; therefore, the effects were most likely mediated through AT2 receptor activation.

 </sup> However, PPAR-γ agonists were shown to increase the risk of congestive heart failure and possibly myocardial infarction.
