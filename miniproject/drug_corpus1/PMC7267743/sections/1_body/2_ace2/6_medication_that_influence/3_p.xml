<p>Other medications that have an effect on ACE2 concentrations include mineralocorticoid antagonists such as the aldosterone receptor antagonist spironolactone, which possibly increases ACE2 concentrations in macrophages. This was not the case in the heart tissue of patients suffering from chronic heart failure.
