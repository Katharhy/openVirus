<p id="Par4">After entry into a suitable host, the first step of the viral replication cycle is the binding of the virion to the receptors on the target cells in the human respiratory tract. The genomic analysis suggests that COVID-19 will utilize similar receptors that were used by SARS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The COVID-19 will be attached to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor, which is expressed in the lungs, heart, kidney, small intestine and other tissues, while MERS-CoV uses the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), a transmembrane glycoprotein as a receptor [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. After binding with a specific receptor, it will enter into host cells via fusion of viral envelope with the plasma membrane or endosomal membranes. After entry, the viral genome RNA is released in the cytoplasm and translates into, pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The translation produced the non-structural proteins and form replication-transcription complex (RTC) in double-membrane vesicles [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The RTC replicates continuously and synthesizes a nested set of sub-genomic RNAs that encode accessory and structural proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The newly formed genomic RNA, nucleocapsid proteins and envelope glycol-proteins assemble and form viral particle buds. At last, the virion-containing vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus. Coronavirus infections were responsible for a variety of cytopathic effects (CPE), which depend upon the viral strains and host cells. The mechanism of CPE attributed to a variety of causes; interfere with signal pathway, derangement of cellular function, enhanced cytokine/chemokine expression, inhibition of transcription and translation of cellular proteins. Some coronaviruses cause cell fusion while many others induced apoptosis.
