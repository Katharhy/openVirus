The COVID-19 is similar to other respiratory viruses, can be transmissions from infected to susceptible persons, via droplets, contaminated body parts, and objectives. A susceptible person got the infection through these contaminated objectives, amplify the virus and spread to other persons. The infected or suspected person should follow the cough etiquette, maintain distance, cover coughs/sneezes via tissues or clothing, frequently wash their hands and safe dispose-off infected material to a reduced viral transmission.

In India, COVID Care Centres (CCC) is set up in public or private hostels, hotels, schools, stadiums, lodges etc. COVID suspected patients can be divided into three; Groups a): These are suspect cases with mild fever and upper respiratory tract infection. They may be admitted and screen for COVID-19. Negative patients should discharge after the symptomatic management while COVID-19 positive patients need to be admitted to CCC. Their health monitor regularly and symptomatic treatment will be given. Group b): Suspect pneumonia with respiratory rate 15–30/min and SpO
 <sub>2</sub> 90–94% come under moderate categories. They will be admitted as suspect cases in section of dedicate COVID-19 health centre and screen for infections of COVID-19. Negative patients transfer to Non-COVID hospital/block and manage according to clinical assessment and discharge as per clinical assessment. While COVID-19 positive need to shift into the confirmed case section of CCC. Monitor for clinical severity can be shift to COVID-19 dedicated hospital. Their health monitor regularly and symptomatic treatment will be given. Group c): COVID-19 suspect patient with pneumonia and respiratory rate more than 30/minute and SpO
 <sub>2</sub> more than 94% come under severe categories. They will be admitted to dedicating COVID-19 health centres with ICU facilities and screen for infections of COVID-19. Negative patients should be a shift to Non-COVID hospital/block. While COVID-19 positive patients should be remain in ICU and their management will be done according to clinical assessment. They can be discharged as per clinical assessment after their negative reports (

Some antiviral like Remdesivir, lopinavir-ritonavir and interferon-α 2b and other drug was tried to control the 2019-nCoV but expecting results were not obtained. There is no specific antiviral available against CVID-19.
