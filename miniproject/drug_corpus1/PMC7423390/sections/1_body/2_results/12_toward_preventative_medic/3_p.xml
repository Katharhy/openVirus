<p>At present, the main barrier to large-scale telemedicine screening for COVID-19 is testing coordination. As the availability of testing sites increases, development and integration of local systems into telemedicine workflows is needed to test appropriate patients while decreasing exposure using tents, in-car testing, or dedicated office space. To keep pace with the evolving recommendations regarding COVID-19, health systems are employing bots or automated logic flows that can refer only moderate- or high-risk patients to nurse triage lines and can also allow patients to request video visits with on-demand providers [
