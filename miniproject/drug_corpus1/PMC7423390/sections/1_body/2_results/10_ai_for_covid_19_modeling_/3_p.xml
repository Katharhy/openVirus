<p>Disruption of one or more of these steps may impair or prevent propagation of the virus. Similarly, destabilizing the infective virions before they can attack host cells may be an effective way to prevent propagation. From a therapeutic viewpoint, the process of modeling and simulating the molecular-level dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in detail at every stage in addition to the virions themselves is important and desirable in such situations and can greatly aid understanding and management of infection with the virus. This knowledge would also be required to address emerging drug-resistant viral strains and future outbreaks of novel pathogenic species similar to COVID-19. In theory, developing therapeutics that can target single or multiple steps in the viral replication cycle or critical processes that have limited capacity for viable mutation can reduce the opportunity for SARS-CoV-2 to develop resistance to administered drugs. Likewise, if simulations aid understanding of the dynamic and structural basis for COVID-19 drug resistance, antiviral drugs can be modified to account for mutations [
