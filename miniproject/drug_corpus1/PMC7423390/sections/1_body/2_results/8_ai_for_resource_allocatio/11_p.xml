<p>Developing an expert system or framework for reasonable and fair allocation of COVID-19 therapeutics and resources is very complex and requires coordination of many variables and estimations that must be guided by comprehensive and accurate information based on IoT technology, which can provide information about distributions, numbers, sizes, capacities, and risks related to both resources and the affected populations worldwide. The realization of such frameworks or expert systems will mainly depend on sharing and collecting data; this can be greatly facilitated by the IoT.</p>
