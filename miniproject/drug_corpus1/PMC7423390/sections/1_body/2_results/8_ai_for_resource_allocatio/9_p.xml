<p>Applying big data analysis and data mining algorithms, including unsupervised and supervised machine learning, to optimize the prioritization process would be very helpful to reduce harm as much as possible in emergency situations when resources are scarce. With the use of a trained model, machine learning can also minimize human effort while improving or maintaining accurate prioritization.</p>
