<p>If we attempt to calculate conservative estimates of the resources that will be needed to fight COVID-19, we find that the resources needed are beyond the available capacities of health care facilities. To achieve an accurate estimation of these resources, estimations should include human resources (such as medical staff, including therapists and nurses) and other facilities (including numbers of hospitals, emergency departments, intensive care units, adult beds, neonatal beds, pediatric beds, ventilators, oxygen concentrators, oxygen cylinders, oxygen plants, liquid oxygen, medications, personal protective equipment, critical medical supplies, and pulse oximeters). It is very important to assess all these resources before establishing any action plan for resource allocation.</p>
