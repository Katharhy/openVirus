<p>AI-based automated analysis tools for tracking the discharge criteria for patients with COVID-19 should be developed to determine and differentiate treated patients from those who still need to be isolated. In addition, AI-based automated CT image analysis tools for tracking, quantification, and detection of COVID-19 can assist in differentiating patients with COVID-19 from individuals who do not have the disease. Moreover, artificial neural networks can be trained to infer qualitative characteristics that are based on intensity as well as network inferences, which can be correlated according to the patientâ€™s condition.</p>
