<p>Developing a video imagingâ€“based high-speed medical monitoring system that uses motion tracking monitoring algorithms for patients with COVID-19 can also provide a large amount of factual information regarding vital signs (temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation) as well as status, condition severity, existing comorbidities, and patient discharge. Modal parameters can be subsequently extracted to analyze the level of severity or damage from COVID-19. Motion tracking monitoring has been investigated in several studies with very promising results [
