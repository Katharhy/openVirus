This revolutionary idea has contributed to the rapid identification of new outbreaks of the disease. The information on this dashboard is updated twice daily, which provides an added advantage. This has opened a new spectrum of AI to predict and recommend quarantine in areas where a threshold number of cases is reached. It can also aid early diagnosis of patients if they report travelling to these areas. All these data are displayed freely through Google Sheets and the ArcGIS Living Atlas [
