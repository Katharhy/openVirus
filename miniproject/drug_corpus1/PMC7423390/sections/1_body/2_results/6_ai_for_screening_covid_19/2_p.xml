<p>It has been reported that radiologists can distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from other types of pneumonia in chest CT images with high specificity. Other reports have demonstrated that reverse transcriptaseâ€“polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis has a low sensitivity of about 60% to 71% for detection of COVID-19 [

The false negatives produced by RT-PCR analysis can hinder quarantine efforts and require tests to be repeated. On the other hand, the sensitivity of chest CT has been established to be approximately 56% to 98% for COVID-19 detection at initial presentation, and it may help rectify false negative results that are obtained by RT-PCR analysis during the early stages of development of the disease. Additionally, chest CT images can reveal disease progression [
