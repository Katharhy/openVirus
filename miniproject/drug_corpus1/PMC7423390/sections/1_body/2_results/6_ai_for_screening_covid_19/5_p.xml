<p>Although the fields of machine learning and pneumonia research are individually well developed, very limited work is currently available regarding the application of machine learning for diagnosis of pneumonia, especially for patients with COVID-19. Research on deep learning algorithms has recently shown rapid progress. In general, pneumonia diagnosis for medical fields is a broadly known discipline. The combination of those two areas would be novel and promising [

Other algorithms have been developed to crop and extract the lung regions from images. The Otsu thresholding method has been used to segregate infected cloudy pneumonia lung regions from healthy regions. Another detection method has been proposed based on cellular neural networks; the simulated results showed remarkable performance in differentiating the lung region area and normal area based on changes in segmentation and grayscale color [
