<p>Exploration of automated pneumonia analysis via deep learning is a very important issue for examination for many different reasons. The most important reason is that the chest radiographs of COVID-19 patients must be reviewed by highly trained specialists, which creates large amounts of work for those specialists. Further, it is very difficult to read these images because pneumonia is normally revealed over one or more areas of increased opacity [

Thus, when an amplified attenuation area (opacification) is reviewed on a CT or chest radiograph, it is crucial to define where the opacifications occur. Diagnosis is very complicated because other conditions can alter the appearance of a radiograph, such as bleeding, surgical changes, post-radiation changes, pulmonary edema, lung cancer, and volume loss due to collapse or atelectasis; aspects such as inspiration depth and patient positioning may also affect the radiograph. Due to these issues, interpreting chest images of COVID-19 patients by the human eye alone is extremely challenging [
