<p>It was also reported that machine learning has the important advantage of increased capability to evaluate the effects of interventions when studying subpopulations in clinical pneumonia research [

This has resulted in the development of a range of networks for image classification. These networks usually employ backpropagation algorithms. Very large neural networks are usually needed for deep learning architectures. Some commonly used deep learning architectures include GoogLeNet, ResNet, and AlexNet [
