<p>Compared to nonâ€“COVID-19 pneumonia, CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia are more likely to show vascular thickening, fine reticular opacity, ground-glass opacity, peripheral distribution, and reverse halo sign in addition to bilateral peripheral involvement of multiple lobes. The CT signs may improve gradually approximately 14 days after the onset of symptoms. On the other hand, CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia are unlikely to show both peripheral and central distribution, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, lymphadenopathy, or air bronchogram [
