<p>Research has provided insights into testing difficulties associated with very large radiograph image data sets. Most research in this area focuses on small and controlled data sets. For these data sets, irregular features may not be an issue. However, as the size of the data set increases, the number of irregular images also increases. It is particularly important to overcome this potential hurdle for COVID-19 diagnosis because a model that is used by medical industries must be capable of considering all radiographic forms. However, the model will still be required to function at high levels regardless of whether these image types are imputed [
