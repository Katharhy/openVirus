<p>The assessment of COVID-19 severity by clinical presentation can no longer meet urgent clinical needs. Thus, introducing a deep learning–based model by quantitating clinical features to predict the severity and mortality rates of COVID-19 will be of significant value. Deep learning–based quantitative CT measurements of the extent of lesions and clinical features on initial admission can assist in predicting COVID-19 severity; this will enable physicians to triage patients and design treatment protocols and follow-up evaluations in advance.</p>
