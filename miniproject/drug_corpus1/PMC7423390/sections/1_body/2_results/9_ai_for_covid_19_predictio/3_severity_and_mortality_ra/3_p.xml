<p>In a recent study, a new model to forecast the prognosis of COVID-19 was established. It has been reported that parsimonious models, which contain five features (age, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell counts, and mass of infection), are an ideal measure for predicting COVID-19 severity. This is a common regression method with high-dimensional data (Cox proportion hazard regression model) that has been extended to and broadly used in logistic regression models for outcome forecasting and survival analysis. This approach may be superior to conventional methods when choosing predictors and may allow researchers to combine selected particular features into single signatures [
