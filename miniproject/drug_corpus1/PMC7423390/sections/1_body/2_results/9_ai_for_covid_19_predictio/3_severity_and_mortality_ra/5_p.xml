<p>In a recent study, researchers suggested an algorithm that could anticipate the mortality rate of patients with COVID-19 with accuracy that reached 90%. In that study, machine learning methods were used to establish a predictive model for early recognition of critically sick patients based on clinical and epidemiological data obtained from patients infected with COVID-19. The working mechanism for this machine learning model was based on quantitative sorting of the clinical features according to their criticality. The revealed features were then sorted, and an interpretable clinical route was obtained [
