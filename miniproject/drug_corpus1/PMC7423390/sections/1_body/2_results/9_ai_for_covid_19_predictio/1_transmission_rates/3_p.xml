<p>AI approaches can account for these delays as well as for uncertainty by explicitly incorporating delays that result from the natural history of virus infection or reporting processes. In addition, individual data sources may be incomplete, be biased, or only capture some aspects of the dynamics of the outbreak. However, evidence synthesis approaches that fit with multiple data sources can enable more robust estimations of the transmission dynamics that can be gathered from noisy data [
