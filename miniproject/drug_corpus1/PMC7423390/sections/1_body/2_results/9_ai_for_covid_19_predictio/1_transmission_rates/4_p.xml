<p>Many factors can affect the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 throughout a country, such as outflow population size from a certain place to affected provinces or cities, geographic locations, interventions, social and economic activities, health care facilities, and environmental heterogeneity. The process of clustering temporal dynamics will provide various insights into the patterns of COVID-19 propagation. In addition, modified auto-encoders have been used to predict the accumulative number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19. By hypothesizing the initial amounts of the epidemical outbreak, modified autoencoders can be used with known architectures and parameters to predict the sizes of future outbreaks and simulate the impact of interventions on the severity and size of epidemics [
