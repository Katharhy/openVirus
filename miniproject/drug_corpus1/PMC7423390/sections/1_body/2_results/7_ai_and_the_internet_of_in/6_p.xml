<p>Intelligent computing systems can support decision-making even when the problems are complex. A great deal of success has been achieved in integrating expert systems into intelligent systems. However, expert systems may face difficulties in acquiring and processing COVID-19 knowledge. Thus, to recognize the involved patterns and the knowledge gained from different fields, it is vital to combine data mining with intelligent computing systems to determine the information gathered and the patterns involved, which may include clustering algorithms, neural network algorithms, regression algorithms, and Bayesian algorithms [
