<p>The mining of very large COVID-19 data sets may present difficulties in terms of computation and storage. For example, combining various types of information in heterogeneous COVID-19 data sets with global information systems can be complicated. Additionally, numerous COVID-19 experts are needed to formulate the data mining process. Finally, the accuracy of data mining results depends on the level of diversity of the gathered COVID-19 data set.</p>
