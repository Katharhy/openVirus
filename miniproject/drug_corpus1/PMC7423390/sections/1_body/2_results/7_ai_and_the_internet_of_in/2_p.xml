Thus, if we divide COVID-19 medical and diagnostic devices in health centers or hospitals into things and modulate these things to be sufficiently intelligent to operate on their own, we can establish a behavior for every subsystem. The challenge is to understand each thing separately. Therefore, to understand the behavior of things used to help control COVID-19, it is necessary to understand the main subcomponents of each thing; then, we must understand the behavior of each subsystem to understand the behavior of the thing as a whole and how to enable it to connect and communicate with other things via the internet.
