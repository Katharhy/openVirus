<p>Intersectoral programmes that recognise the special needs of older people and in unique contexts such as care homes must be developed and implemented, with the full participation and agreement of older people at all stages. Such programmes should include: (i) need-based health awareness programmes in areas such as self-care and prevention; (ii) increasing the availability and accessibility of essential basic healthcare services (including telehealth) for addressing both acute infections and co-morbidities and (iii) enhancing education programmes for healthcare professionals to include topics that remain neglected in traditional curricula and (iv) strengthening the collection and analysis of data to guide programmes and policies for the protection and care of older people.</p>
