Seasonal influenza vaccine coverage of older people has improved in recent years, but in some countries at least, it is far from universal. Vaccination, even when available, often provides only partial protection to older people [

New vaccines are often tested on healthy volunteers, and their safety and usefulness for older people requires specific testing, and this is likely to be the case for candidate COVID-19 vaccines. In lower-income nations, healthcare access for older people remains limited both in quantity and quality, even during normal times [
 <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. COVID-19 has already provoked a debate on ‘who should get a ventilator?’ Older people (and those who care for them) are at risk of being considered at ‘low priority’ for a variety of healthcare interventions that are in short supply [
