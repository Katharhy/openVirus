<p>Older people suffer more co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal disease and cancer. A 2016 study from Hubei, China, reported the prevalence of one or more non-communicable diseases amongst older people to be 74% [

Related to, but distinct from, the effects of multimorbidity are the effects of frailtyâ€”the loss of homeostatic reserve that renders many older people disproportionately vulnerable to the impact of even relatively minor stressors. Recovery from any illness is less likely when frailty is present, recovery takes longer and those recovering are more prone to further episodes of illness.
