<p>Many older people require personal care delivered by paid carers. There were 1.2 million adult social care workers in the United Kingdom in 2018, who see up to 20 clients a day. An estimated 540,000 older people in the UK receive home care at least weekly. Epidemics pose a challenge in ensuring that such care is still deliverable without increasing the risk of infection either directly from care staff or by cross-transmission between clients. This depends on an adequate supply of personal protective equipment, robust and frequent staff testing, processes that enable exposed or infected staff to stop work and isolate without financial penalty and adequate staff in reserve to enable services to continue when staff are ill. Epidemics pose similar challenges for older people living in care homes, assisted living facilities, foster and group homes and chronic disease wards, who are known to be vulnerable to seasonal influenza and norovirus outbreaks.</p>
