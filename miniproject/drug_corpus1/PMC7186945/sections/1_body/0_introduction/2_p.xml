<p id="Par3">In patients with COVID-19, delirium may be a manifestation of direct central nervous system (CNS) invasion, induction of CNS inflammatory mediators, a secondary effect of other organ system failure, an effect of sedative strategies, prolonged mechanical ventilation time, or environmental factors, including social isolation. Drawing from experience with other closely related viruses from the 
 <italic>coronaviridae</italic> family, direct CNS invasion appears to occur rarely and late in the disease course but may be associated with seizures, impairments in consciousness or signs of increased intracranial pressure [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Such symptoms may require specialized neuro-intensivist management. Immunologic responses to 
 <italic>coronaviridae</italic> appear to be mediated by acute cytolytic T cell activation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This response could, if dysregulated, cause an autoimmune encephalopathy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Secondary effects include cerebral hypoxia or metabolic dysregulation in association with failure of pulmonary or other organ systems, such as can be seen in a variety of other types of delirium [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Environmental and iatrogenic factors such as prolonged mechanical ventilation, sedatives (especially benzodiazepines), and immobility also contribute heavily to the risk of ICU delirium [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and can contribute to its development in the context of acute COVID-19 infection.
