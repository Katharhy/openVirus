<p>Results of laboratory tests can increase the support for the diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of patients through the detection and measurement of different biomarkers. Although nonspecific, some biomarkers have been reported to be associated with the infectious process of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, low lymphocyte and platelet counts; low serum albumin levels; and increased serum levels of C-reactive protein, D-dimer, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, transaminases, and interleukin-6 can be used in risk stratification to predict the severity of COVID-19
