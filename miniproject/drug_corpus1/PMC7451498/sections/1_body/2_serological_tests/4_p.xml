<p>Currently, antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 remain poorly understood, and the clinical usefulness of the serological test is still unclear

 </xref>. Although the detection of IgM and IgG by ELISA is positive even on the fourth day after the onset of symptoms, high levels of these antibodies are produced in the second and third weeks of the disease

 </xref>. From the time of onset, the IgM antibody titer increases; 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms, both IgG and IgM are present and their levels start to decrease after the fourth week. IgM is notoriously nonspecific, and because it takes weeks to develop specific IgG responses, serological detection is unlikely to play an active role in case management, with diagnosis/confirmation of late cases of COVID-19 or determining the immunity of health professionals being the exceptions

 </xref>. The acute antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in 285 patients in Chinaâ€™s Hubei province was detected using a chemiluminescence immunoenzymatic test (CLIA). The result showed that the proportion of patients positive for specific IgG reached 100% approximately 17 to 19 days after the onset of symptoms. Meanwhile, the proportion of patients with specific IgM reached 94.1% at 20 to 22 days after the onset of symptoms. Seroconversion to IgG and IgM occurred simultaneously or sequentially, giving an average seroconversion time of 13 days after the onset of symptoms. The study data indicate that serological tests can be complementary, especially in the diagnosis of suspected patients with negative molecular results and also in the search for asymptomatic infections among close contacts
