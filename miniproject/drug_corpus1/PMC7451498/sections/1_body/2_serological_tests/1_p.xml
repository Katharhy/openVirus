These tests can have several benefits, such as estimating the transmissibility and lethality rates, assessing individual and community immunity, and valuing the need and effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions (e.g., social isolation). Furthermore, the plasma of convalescents with high levels of antibody production could be used as a therapeutic support

 </xref>. Several serological tests based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and lateral flow immunochromatography (LFI) devices have been developed by different companies worldwide. IgM and IgG antibodies detected on ELISA have more than 95% specificity in the diagnosis of COVID-19 (18). High titers of IgG antibodies detected by ELISA demonstrate a positive correlation with neutralizing antibodies
