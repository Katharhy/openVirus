<p>It is worth mentioning that the majority of immunoassays for SARS-CoV-2 have immunogenic proteins as their main target: 1) protein S (spike), which is the most highly exposed viral protein, and 2) nucleocapsid protein (N), which is abundantly expressed during infection

 </xref>. Normally, most antibodies are produced against the most abundant protein present in the virus (N). Therefore, tests that detect antibodies to N would be the most sensitive. However, the protein S receptor binding domain (RBD-S) is the host's attachment protein, and antibodies to RBD-S would be very specific and are expected to be neutralizing. In this case, the use of one or both antigens to detect IgG and IgM would result in high sensitivity
