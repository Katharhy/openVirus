 </xref>. The diagnostic methods for COVID-19 fall under two main categories: immunological and molecular. Immunological tests can be serological tests that mainly detect antibodies in blood or viral antigens in respiratory secretions, and both can be performed with point-of-care platforms. Regarding molecular tests, they are based on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA mainly in nasopharyngeal samples, which in most cases require adequate laboratory infrastructure. In addition to the cited tests, other laboratory parameters have been used as an aid in the clinical monitoring of patients with COVID-19
