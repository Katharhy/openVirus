<p>Most molecular tests, unlike serological tests, are performed in a specialized laboratory using cutting-edge equipment and highly qualified staff, so their use is limited. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs are considered the standard samples for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. In addition to the NP swabs, the use of samples from the lower respiratory tract (sputum or bronchial lavage) and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs are used as alternatives to improve the biosafety of health care workers

 </xref>. A robust study on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in different clinical samples involved 205 hospitalized patients from three Chinese hospitals, with a total of 1,070 samples collected. The NP swabs had the highest viral load, although at the time of collection, the stage of disease or the associated clinical history was not available for many of these patients
