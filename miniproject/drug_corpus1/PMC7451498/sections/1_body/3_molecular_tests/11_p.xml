<p>Laboratory testing is a process divided into three main phases: preanalytical, analytical, and postanalytical. In the preanalytical stage, individual protection measures in relation to sample collection are fundamental to good biosafety practices. Based on the WHO guidelines, all clinical samples should be considered potentially infectious, and health professionals must use suitable and a complete set of personal protective equipment (PPE) when obtaining/handling patient samples. Normally, the use of a disposable apron, gloves, bonnet, foot protection, protective goggles, and an N95 breathing mask is expected.</p>
