<p>Another molecular approach that may be useful, especially in places where there is no need for expensive thermocycling equipment is reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) using the SARS-CoV-2 spike ORF1ab and S genes

 </xref>. In addition, the use of biosensors to detect SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA has also been tested. The newly developed biosensor integrates the plasmatic photothermal effect and plasmon resonance detection transduction. Validity and selectivity were determined by using the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and ORF1ab sequences as targets
