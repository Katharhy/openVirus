<p>These results show that our inclusion of behavioural dynamics yields a model that accords with realistic assumptions about human behaviour. We expect that people will adhere strictly to a stay-at-home measure at first, but will begin to relax their compliance over time, especially if staying at home is costly. At the same time, we expect that people will be more likely to comply with a stay-at-home order if its cost is low, perhaps because of social programmes enacted alongside the stay-at-home order. This qualitative analysis of our model shows that complex behavioural-dynamics models can be useful for assessing the effectiveness of public-health policy in a pandemic.</p>
