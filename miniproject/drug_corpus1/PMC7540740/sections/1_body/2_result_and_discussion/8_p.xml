<p>Next, we investigate the model with shield immunity included. The peak hospitalizations and fractions of infected and susceptible at equilibrium are plotted against the shield immunity rate 
 <italic>θ</italic> for different costs in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS201095F4">figure 4</xref>: (
 <italic>a</italic>) 
 <italic>C</italic> = 1.0, (
 <italic>b</italic>) 
 <italic>C</italic> = 0.5 and (
 <italic>c</italic>) 
 <italic>C</italic> = 0.0. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS201095F4">Figure 4</xref>
 <italic>a</italic> suggests that sufficiently small 
 <italic>θ</italic> (less shield immunity) leads to the maximum values for FES 
 <italic>R</italic>(∞) and peak-hospitalized 
 <italic>H</italic>(max). Higher 
 <italic>θ</italic> tends to reduce FES and increase the amount of free riders 
 <italic>S</italic>(∞) that reduces hospital burden. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS201095F4">Figure 4</xref>
 <italic>c</italic> represents the situation in which staying at home has no cost, and we see that individuals stay at home if shield immunity is high enough. In this case, free riding and breaking the stay-at-home order has no benefit.
