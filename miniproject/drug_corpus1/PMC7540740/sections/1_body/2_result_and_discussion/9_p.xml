<p>As a final step, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS201095F5">figure 5</xref> presents a two-dimensional phase–plane analysis that varies the cost 
 <italic>C</italic> and transmission rate 
 <italic>β</italic> for a range of shield immunity factors 
 <italic>θ</italic>; (i) 
 <italic>θ</italic> = 0, (ii) 
 <italic>θ</italic> = 5, (iii) 
 <italic>θ</italic> = 10 and (iv) 
 <italic>θ</italic> = 20. In all cases, shield immunity affects the FES and peak hospitalizations significantly. As the values of both 
 <italic>C</italic> and 
 <italic>β</italic> increase, the FES as well as 
 <italic>H</italic>(max) grows remarkably as expected, since individuals are less likely to take quarantine when the cost is high, and individuals are more likely to be infected if the transmission rate is high. Meanwhile, natural shield immunity has a significant effect if and only if both the shield immunity factor is high and the cost of staying at home is low. This finding indicates that the effects of stay-at-home orders and shield immunity complement each other, but only if the cost of a stay-at-home order is sufficiently low and the tendency toward shield immunity is sufficiently high. Policymakers can affect the cost of staying at home, but the effectiveness of shield immunity is determined by the nature of the virus. Since no one yet knows if or for how long recovered individuals are immune to COVID-19, our models suggest that policymakers should do everything possible to lessen the cost of staying at home.
