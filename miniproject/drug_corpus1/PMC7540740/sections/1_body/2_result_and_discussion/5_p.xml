<p>When the cost 
 <italic>C</italic> is low, the models show some interesting qualitative differences. In phase 1, individuals' tendency toward counter-compliance is constant at 
 <italic>q</italic> = 1.0, meaning that individuals have no incentive to self-isolate; in this case, the FES is highest. However, in phase 2 in which 
 <italic>q</italic> depends on both cost and time, FES is lower in the phase 2 model for small 
 <italic>C</italic> and the models behave the same for higher 
 <italic>C</italic>.
