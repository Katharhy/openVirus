<p>Our qualitative analyses of increasingly complex models suggest that complex social-learning dynamics can be captured in compartmental epidemic models that include game-theoretic concepts of imitation in an evolutionary game. Our parametric analysis suggests that naturally acquired shield immunity is unlikely to be effective in quelling an epidemic in the absence of social control measures that carry reasonably low costs for individuals. The results discussed above demonstrate the feasibility of analysing complex models of epidemics and social learning. With further development, we expect that such a model will prove helpful in developing insights about how to balance the economic costs of social controls as governments continue to navigate their responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
