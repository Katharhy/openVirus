<p>The COVID-19 pandemic presents urgent policy questions that must be addressed with modelling, as no vaccine is available and data about the pandemic is scarce [
 <xref rid="RSOS201095C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="RSOS201095C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Policy actions like quarantines, mobility restrictions, self-isolation and social distancing have been attempted across the globe, and empirical evaluations of their effectiveness are difficult with such an unprecedented virus [
 <xref rid="RSOS201095C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–
 <xref rid="RSOS201095C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The effectiveness of such measures will be affected by the socio-economic cost of those measures, which can be modelled in game-theoretic terms. As the pandemic progresses, shield immunity may begin to emerge if recovered patients are immune to infection or if a vaccine is developed. Policy decisions about vaccination and relaxing of stricter social measures can be informed by game theory models [
