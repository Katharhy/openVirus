<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than 8 000 000 confirmed cases and more than 440 000 deaths across the globe as of 16 June 2020 [

 <xref rid="RSOS201095C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], strict stay-at-home orders have been essential policy tools [
 <xref rid="RSOS201095C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Such a strict order has severe economic costs, as businesses close, services are reduced, unemployment increases and individuals' incomes are slowed [
 <xref rid="RSOS201095C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. If strict shutdowns are ordered without social support to mitigate the costs incurred by individuals, an epidemic may continue to spread among the disadvantaged despite shutdown measures [

 <xref rid="RSOS201095C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the United States and the United Kingdom [
 <xref rid="RSOS201095C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], for example, have implemented several emergency-relief packages that benefit people and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. These measures highlight economic disparities among countries, and those with fewer resources are less able to provide social support. In a society with limited access to social supports, individuals' compliance with stay-at-home orders requires them to balance the risk of financial damage while staying at home against the risk of infection if deciding not to stay at home. The outcomes of these individual-level decisions directly affect the society-level effectiveness of stay-at-home orders. So, the relationship between the economic costs of a social lockdown and individuals' likelihood to comply with that lockdown is a relevant relationship to model to better understand policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.
