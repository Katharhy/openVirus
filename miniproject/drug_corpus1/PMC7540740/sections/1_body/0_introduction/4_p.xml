 <xref rid="RSOS201095C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] provides a framework for explaining individual behaviours in a social setting in which individual preferences depend on a variety of risks. This paper proposes a relatively complex game-theoretic model that is intended to give a realistic picture of how the cost of policy actions determines their effectiveness. The model gives insight into how the spread of an epidemic is affected by both the individual economic costs of public-health measures and the real risk of infection. The effects of a lockdown's costs are modelled with a counter-compliance factor [
