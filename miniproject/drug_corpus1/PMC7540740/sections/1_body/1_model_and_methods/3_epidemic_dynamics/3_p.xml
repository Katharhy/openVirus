  <sup>S</sup>

  <sup>A</sup>

 <italic>β</italic> is the infection's transmission rate, 
 <italic>α</italic> is the rate at which individuals progress from exposed to quarantined or exposed to infected (
 <italic>E</italic> to 
 <italic>Q</italic> or 
 <italic>I</italic>*), 
 <italic>δ</italic> is the rate at which individuals change compartments from quarantined to exposed (
 <italic>Q</italic> to 
 <italic>E</italic>), 
 <italic>r</italic> is the rate at which individuals change compartments from symptomatic infected to hospitalized (

  <sub>s</sub>
 </italic>,

  <sub>A</sub>
 </italic> and

  <sub>h</sub>
 </italic> are the recovery rates for symptomatic infected, asymptomatic infected and hospitalized individuals, respectively. The tendency to not comply is modelled with 
 <italic>q</italic> and the tendency that an infected individual is hospitalized is 
 <italic>h</italic>. Shield immunity is modelled with the term (1 +

 <italic>θ</italic> = 0, shield immunity has no effect.
