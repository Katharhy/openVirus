<p>We test three different versions of this model to qualitatively compare the model behaviour with different factors included. In 
 <bold>phase 0</bold>, each of the parameters are taken from 
 <xref rid="RSOS201095TB1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>, and the model behaviour serves as a baseline. 
 <bold>Phase 1</bold> tests the behavioural model in equation (2.2) in isolation, with 
 <italic>q</italic> = 1.0. 
 <bold>Phase 2</bold> varies both 
 <italic>η</italic> and 
 <italic>q</italic> as given by equations (2.2) and (2.10), respectively.
