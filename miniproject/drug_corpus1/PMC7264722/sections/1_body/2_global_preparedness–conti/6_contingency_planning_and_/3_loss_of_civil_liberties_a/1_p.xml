<p>Interrupting the transmission chain in a pandemic may require lock‐down, which imposes major personal sacrifices on the public, including confinement: loss of freedom of movement/social activities/family visits; closure of workplaces/loss of employment and income, resulting in economic hardship/increases in debt; closure of schools/places of worship/hospitality venues/fitness studios/clubs of all sorts; restrictions on shopping; and elevated stress/worsening of psychiatric conditions. It is, therefore, crucial that such measures are accepted and supported by the public. For this, people must be engaged and presented with coherent lock‐down plans that are convincingly justified, in order to solicit compliance, solidarity and sharing of responsibilities. Federal structures, like those in the USA, Germany and Switzerland may lead to uncoordinated actions in different parts of the country that are unsettling and unconvincing, because the public perceives them as arbitrary. Such countries require coherent national plans that are consistent for the entire country.</p>
