It will, therefore, be important for the government to have a public discussion on different risk scenarios, to obtain, present and discuss human/economic cost:benefit estimates (e.g., human lives against cost in loss of income /economic prosperity underlying the lock‐down versus herd immunity approach—how much unemployment averts how many deaths or years of productive life when considering the age structure of death). And this discussion needs to take place in the context of the probabilities of loss of life through other adverse causes, such as annual influenza epidemics.</p>
