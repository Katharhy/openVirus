<p>It is well known that experts have been warning of impending deadly epi/pandemics, including coronavirus outbreaks, for a long time (e.g., Turinici and Danchin,

Now while the nature, evolution, timing and source of novel emerging infectious agents is uncertain, pandemics are always counteracted by the same time‐honoured strategy: interruption of infection chains and anticipation of a surge in need for treatment of acute disease (here, we are nearly in the same situation as in the world confronted by Spanish flu in 1918). We, therefore, only need one epidemic preparedness. Despite this, the SARS‐CoV‐2 outbreak has clearly exposed how unprepared we were. There are multiple reasons for this, including.
