<p>From earlier infectious disease outbreaks, we can assume that the most probable source of a new pandemic will be an animal virus, probably a coronavirus, whose natural host is a wild animal, possibly a bat (e.g., see Brüssow, 
 <xref rid="emi15029-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>), that mutates and, as a result, becomes infectious for humans, or for an intermediate host, from which it subsequently jumps to humans. Close contacts between humans and the animal host provide the opportunities for transmission. Reducing such close contacts will reduce the probability of spillover and thus of an outbreak. Close contacts between wild animals and humans occur in wet markets in Asia, small‐scale mixed farming activities with ducks and pigs, and so forth, or when humans encroach into wildlife habitats, e.g., through ecotourism, or destroy wildlife habitats for economic activities, forcing wildlife to enter human habitats (e.g., the destruction of rainforest for palm oil cultivation appears to have catalyzed a Nipah virus outbreak; Brüssow, 
 <xref rid="emi15029-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). In any case, although pathogen:host interactions underlying disease are generally well studied, current knowledge about the ecology of infectious agents – where pathogens are and what they are doing 
 <italic>prior to infection of humans</italic>, especially those having alternative hosts, and how they are circulating and evolving new pathogenic and host‐range potential – is inadequate. In order to transit from response mode to pro‐active ecological measures to prevent outbreaks from occurring, there needs to be a major research effort to obtain a fundamental understanding of pathogen ecology (see e.g. Timmis, 2001).
