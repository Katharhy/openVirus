<p>A primordial responsibility of government is to protect its citizens. This includes effective contingency planning for pandemics. However, due to the global nature of pandemics, coordination with neighbours (and factoring in potential flashpoints located more distantly, such as refugee camps in Greece and elsewhere, which could become, if not cared for, sources of a second wave of infection when the first is over), and intergovernmental cooperation is essential. Adequate contingency planning for deadly and devastating infectious disease outbreaks is not an optional policy, and the public have the right to insist on it, even if it becomes politically or economically expedient to neglect. For the public—the key stakeholders in this—transparency is essential and it must have access to information on the current state of preparedness, and future plans of government, and those of different political parties during election campaigns. Trusted biomedical science organizations must support the public in this by providing expert scrutiny and assessment. Governments must become accountable for the efforts they make to protect us.
