<p>If, despite the explicit warning of the World Health Organization in 2011 that ‘The world is ill‐prepared to respond to a severe influenza pandemic or to any similarly global, sustained and threatening public‐health emergency’ (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA64/A64_10-en.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA64/A64_10-en.pdf</ext-link>), it was not apparent to those in charge, and to the general public—i.e., those suffering from COVID‐19 infections and the funders of health services (tax/insurance payers)—that existing health systems had inherent vulnerabilities which could prove to be devastating when seriously stressed, the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic (e.g., see Brüssow, 
 <xref rid="emi15029-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) has brutally exposed it now. In some countries, preparedness, despite being officially considered to be of strong operational readiness against health emergencies (Kandel 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="emi15029-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), was inadequate at multiple levels (e.g., Horton, 
 <xref rid="emi15029-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Similarly, a fundamental lack of preparedness is the case for a number of impending non‐health crises (e.g., global warming, poverty, the soil crisis, etc.). Once we are over the COVID‐19 pandemic, important questions will be: what have we learned/can we learn and how can we improve our systems? Below, we argue for the necessity for major realignment of crisis responsiveness, and indeed of health system operationality, based on international benchmarking and adequately funded preparedness. International benchmarking is mandatory, because it has become clear that there is a wide range of effectiveness in the ability of different countries with developed economies to respond to this crisis (and probably others), and the tax‐paying public has no compelling reason to tolerate perpetuation of factors underlying poor responses to crises.
