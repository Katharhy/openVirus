<p>It is the responsibility of government to protect its citizens and the role of industry to innovate and create commercial products and services. These two goals are not always aligned for current clinical exigences. But to provide a vital health system, government and industry must align and form alliances that create synergies. There are, of course, many successful examples of such beneficial alliances. However, there is sometimes an unrealistic perception of the role of industry, particularly by some governments when confronted with a crisis for which they are not prepared, as articulated in the generic cry: why do not we have a vaccine for this, why do not we have a drug for that? For example, regulatory and payment hurdles incentivize industry to develop cancer drugs rather than antimicrobials, so it is irrational and unwarranted to complain about the poor state of pipelines for new antivirals in the time of COVID‐19, of antimicrobials in the time of the antimicrobial resistance crisis. If industry is to realign its research priorities towards current clinical priorities, it needs incentives to do so, e.g., through adequately funded creative government–industry–academia–clinical‐regulatory strategic alliances.</p>
