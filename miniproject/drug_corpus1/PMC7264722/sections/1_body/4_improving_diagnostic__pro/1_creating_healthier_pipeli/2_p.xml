<p>We have previously proposed a mechanism to create novel pipelines for accelerated discovery of new drugs and diagnostics (Timmis 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="emi15029-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; and, simultaneously, to promote long‐term revival of struggling economies, interestingly in response to a financial crisis—that of 2008—which the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic will again unleash with considerable severity). This proposal calls for the use of infrastructure budgets (not overstretched research‐education‐health budgets) to be targeted to the creation of new strategic national/regional alliances between (i) cell biology and microbial diversity research groups, to discover and develop new diagnostics, drug targets and assays, and new drug leads from new microbes, (ii) biochemical engineers, chemists and pharma, to produce, evaluate and develop drug candidates, (iii) pharma, clinical research and regulatory agencies to assess clinical efficacy and safety of, and develop new drug candidates. In the context of the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic, an alliance between virology, cell biology, microbial diversity, and synthetic microbiology groups in upstream discovery would accelerate new antiviral discovery and populate antiviral drug pipelines, but also pipelines of new antimicrobials urgently needed for the treatment of bacterial superinfections responsible for some of the COVID‐19 mortalities. And: while advanced age, underlying co‐morbidities and infection dose are identified as predisposing factors for development of severe COVID‐19 disease, deaths among young healthy individuals also occur for reasons currently unknown. Once predisposing factors for this group have been elucidated, diagnostics to identify young people at risk, especially those most exposed to SARS‐CoV‐2, will be needed in order to reduce their exposure.
