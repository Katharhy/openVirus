<p>An important aspect of the SARS‐CoV‐2 outbreak is that, in most countries, it has become more difficult to obtain consultations with primary healthcare clinics/physicians, because of social distancing practices, illness or involvement in crisis management (e.g., see Keesara 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="emi15029-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). As time goes on, the inability to access many primary healthcare services leads to progressive worsening of existing and new conditions in some individuals. Access to primary healthcare, which in some countries was already unsatisfactory before Covid‐19, is becoming a new crisis. This has resulted in the ‘flight to the web’ for information (sometimes obtaining disinformation in the process): the web is becoming a substitute for clinical consultations, in terms of obtaining information relating to symptoms experienced. This will ultimately have a significant impact on how the public views the computer as a facilitator‐mediator of primary healthcare. While classical telemedicine—the 
 <italic>ad hoc</italic> consultation of a remote, unknown physician who can advise on the symptoms presented—may be helpful in times of inadequate access to regular primary healthcare facilities, it cannot replace clinical advice informed by patient case histories and personal knowledge of the patient.
