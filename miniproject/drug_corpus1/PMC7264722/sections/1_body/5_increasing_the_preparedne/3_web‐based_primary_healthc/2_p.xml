<p>Reduced access to primary healthcare below a certain threshold constitutes itself a significant health hazard and is counter to a government's duty to protect its citizens. What to do to increase resilience of primary health care and increase access? One important contribution will be the ‘digital healthcare revolution’ (Keesara 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="emi15029-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), i.e., some traditional one‐on‐one meetings between patient and doctor being replaced by web‐based consultations. But also imagine teleconsultations based on (i) complete personal case histories, combined with (ii) up‐to‐date population epidemiological information, combined with (iii) individual patient best practice recommendations based on precision medicine analyses/predictions: welcome to the National Clinical Informatics Centre (NCIC; Timmis and Timmis,

 <xref rid="emi15029-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). In some countries/regions, access to primary healthcare already involves significant waiting periods. The additional restrictions on access to primary healthcare resulting from the SARS‐CoV‐2 outbreak are resulting in further suffering and frustration that will surely make the prospect of a consultation with a virtual doctor providing personalized medicine, who is instantly available 24/7, an increasingly attractive future possibility. Of course, many health issues cannot be handled remotely via the web (though the proportion will increase steadily with the development of informatic infrastructure and easy‐to‐use home diagnostics), and will result in referral to a clinician. But, web‐based consultations can significantly reduce numbers of patients requiring clinician consultations and the associated stress on the health system.
