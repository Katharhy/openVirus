<p>Healthcare systems are by and large extremely large, complex, heavily bureaucratic and fragmented. The often system‐wide, multi‐level consultations, decisions and responses needed in times of emergencies are challenging and often slow, usually slower than crisis development, which means that healthcare systems follow and react to events, rather than managing them. Crises are in some ways analogous to wars, and bureaucracies are not designed to manage wars, which is the job of the military. In crises, we need crisis strategy‐tactics specialists, a taskforce with short, well defined and effective chains of command, tasked with overriding normal procedures and taking charge of supply chains and requisitioning of assets, (re)deployment of personnel, organization and prioritization of allocation of infrastructure, managing logistics, and so forth. These could be specially trained taskforces of existing staff within healthcare systems, external taskforces or combinations of both.</p>
