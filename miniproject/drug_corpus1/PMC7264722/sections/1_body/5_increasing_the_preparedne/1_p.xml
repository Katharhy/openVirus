<p>There is great diversity in stress resilience (e.g., the ability to deal with peaks of illness) of different health systems, with some being at least regionally overwhelmed during the winter influenza season. The less resilient systems will generally be the first to become overwhelmed in a health crisis. While there are numerous parameters involved in health system resilience, and experts know most of the pinch points and solutions that can deal with these (but also what is uncertain and what needs to be understood before effective ‘solutions’ can be formulated), three elements worth consideration in efforts to increase health system resilience are discussed here.</p>
