<p>Another lesson learned is that the SARS‐CoV‐2 outbreak has revealed new synergy potentials, such as the manufacture of ventilators by engineering companies not normally active in the manufacture of medical devices. It is not unreasonable to assume that new innovations can and will emerge from new interactions between creative engineers and clinicians. For example, best practice for breathing difficulty and poor blood oxygenation is intubation and ventilation. The paucity of ventilators is a ‘critical control point’ for best treatment practice in some hospitals, which has been discussed above. Anecdotal evidence suggests that, of those individuals who die, despite best treatment practice involving intubation, the cause of death is often due to superinfection by antibiotic resistant bacteria (Vincent

 <xref rid="emi15029-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). The cause of this may indeed be intubation, causing perturbation of normal lung physiology and creating susceptibility to superinfection. There are, however, less invasive means of increasing blood oxygen levels. Perhaps engineers, together with clinicians, will devise new or improved non‐invasive approaches to blood oxygenation. And once creative engineers from the non‐medical field start to expertly scrutinize current medical devices, perhaps we will see new approaches and new designs that significantly advance medical practice.
