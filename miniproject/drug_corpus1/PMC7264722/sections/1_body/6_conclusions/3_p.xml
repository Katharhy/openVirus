<p>But perhaps the most important lesson learned is about our frontline health professionals ministering to COVID‐19 patients, especially those with severe disease.

These are the heroes of the pandemic, the faces of resilience of COVID‐19 healthcare, exceptional citizens demonstrating exceptional fortitude, personal sacrifice and professional dedication: they are our role models of the 21st century.</p>
