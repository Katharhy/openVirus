<p>Achievement of optimal preparedness for, and operational responses to, a pandemic demands two things: international benchmarking and transparency/accountability in health systems (and of those who regulate and finance them). This includes chains of command and shared administrative responsibilities, procurement services, reliance on external suppliers of essential materials, and so forth. The disparities in responses we have listed above, that demonstrate significant differences between countries in the ability to respond to pandemics, are not justifiable in terms of operational efficiency, protection of front‐line professionals, clinical outcome, and so forth, and cannot be allowed to persist, to be manifested again in future crises. Health systems worldwide largely operate within narrow national perspectives, with little interest in better systems elsewhere. We urgently need objective and transparent benchmarking, and automatic mandating of adoption of the best practices in the world, where feasible. Transparency and convincing justification for failure to adopt the benchmark must become the norm. Of course, different health systems operate in different frameworks—payers, insurance, authorization and recommendation agencies, and so forth—but the tail cannot be allowed to wag the dog. Existing frameworks can no longer be accepted as default excuses not to improve. They must be adapted to allow adoption of the benchmarks, where possible, not the other way round. In the final analysis, there are only two elements relevant: the person in the ICU, who pays tax/insurance, and hence for the health system, and the government, which is responsible for health system functioning/evolution and protection of its citizens. Both of their goals are in principle aligned, so there should be no controversy: provision of the best achievable health system that is adequately prepared for catastrophic pandemics.
