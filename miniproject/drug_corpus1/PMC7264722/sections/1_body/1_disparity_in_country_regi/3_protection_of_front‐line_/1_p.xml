<p>It may seem so trivially obvious to say, but obviously needs saying because it was not apparent from the health system responses of a number of countries: those most at risk of infection are those in contact with the infected, i.e., front‐line doctors and nurses. And as they become infected, the numbers of available health professionals left to treat patients goes down as patient numbers go up. And, of course, infected health professionals become transmitters of infection among one another, and to uninfected patients, since in the hectic reality of emergencies, they may not always be able to practice adequate physical distancing. This obviously means that the greatest protection from infection must be accorded the front‐line professionals. However, there were substantive differences between countries in terms of the availability and use of best practice protective clothing (personal protective equipment, PPE) in the early days of the COVID‐19 crisis; these differences were mainly in different degrees of deficiencies. The incomplete protection of front‐line health professionals that occurred in a number of countries in the early days of the crisis, and that resulted in many infections and some deaths, is an unacceptable deficit in their health systems, particularly since the COVID‐19 outbreak was, from end of January 2020, a predictable disaster of international magnitude.</p>
