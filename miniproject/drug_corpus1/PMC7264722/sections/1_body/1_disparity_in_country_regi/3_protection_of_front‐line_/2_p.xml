Since the people they care for are, because of their ages and underlying morbidities, often themselves particularly vulnerable to severe outcomes, infected carers may, unknowingly and unwillingly, become ‘angels of death’. Accessory front‐line professionals thus also require best PPE. There are wide regional and occupational differences in the availability and use of such clothing by these professionals.
