<p>Patients having contracted COVID‐19 are grouped into three categories: in the China outbreak, 81% experienced mild, 14% severe and 5% critical infections (Wu and McGoogan, 
 <xref rid="emi15029-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). For those requiring hospitalization, and those with the most acute symptoms requiring intensive care, two key variables in treatment capacity seem to be bed availability generally, and in intensive care units particularly (images of patients lying on the floors of some hospitals made this abundantly clear to the entire world), on one hand, and ventilator/intubation tube availability for patients needing intubation, on the other. There are enormous differences between countries in terms the availability of hospital beds/1000 population (e.g., Japan 13.1, Germany 8.0, France 6.0, Switzerland 4.5, Italy 3.2, UK/Canada/Denmark 2.5, India 0.5:

An insufficiency of beds (and often health professionals) also resulted in ‘non‐critical’ interventions

There are different reasons for insufficient beds and clinical devices. But the fact remains: some countries manage better than others; some countries do not have enough beds for even small increases representing normal fluctuations in patient needs and anticipated seasonal variations, let alone exceptional demands made by epidemics.

    <italic>It is essential to increase bed, especially ICU bed, capacities in many countries, in order to reduce stress situations where patients cannot receive required treatment, and to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed in times of crisis, when there is a spike in patients requiring hospitalization</italic>.
