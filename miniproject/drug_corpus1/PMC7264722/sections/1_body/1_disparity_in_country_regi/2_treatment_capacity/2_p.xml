<p>One new development triggered by the COVID‐19 pandemic was the creation of so‐called ‘Fangcang shelter hospitals’—rapidly constructed, large scale, low cost, temporary hospitals, by converting existing public venues into healthcare facilities in Wuhan to manage the rapidly increasing COVID‐19 patient numbers (Chen 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="emi15029-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Instead of being delivered to regular hospitals, COVID‐19 patients were sent to shelter hospitals, where they were isolated and received basic medical care and frequent monitoring. Patients whose mild disease state transitioned to severe were then transferred to regular hospitals where they received intensive care. Although new emergency hospitals have been created in other countries, the purpose of these is generally to receive spillover from traditional hospitals, when these become overwhelmed by patient numbers. The purpose of Fangcang shelter hospitals is, in contrast, to centralize clinical management of the epi/pandemic 
 <italic>outside of the traditional hospital system</italic>. COVID‐19 patients are channelled to shelter hospitals, thereby minimizing viral ingress into hospitals and infection of health professionals, and helping to maintain staffing levels and normal functioning of outpatient and inpatient facilities. It is important to note that shelter hospitals constitute low‐cost clinical settings—they require fewer health professionals and diagnostic‐treatment infrastructure than normal hospitals, because all patients have the same clinical issue and most have only mild‐to‐moderate disease—and thereby relieve pressure on traditional hospitals with sophisticated infrastructure in limited capacity that constitute high‐cost clinical settings (The creation of parallel low‐cost clinical settings to relieve pressure on limited capacity high cost clinical settings is more broadly applicable over and above epi/pandemic response situations: see Timmis and Timmis, 2017, for an example in primary healthcare).

    <italic>Shelter hospitals should be incorporated into pandemic planning as the primary destination for pandemic patients, to allow traditional hospitals to continue functioning as normal as possible (or normally as long as possible)</italic>.
