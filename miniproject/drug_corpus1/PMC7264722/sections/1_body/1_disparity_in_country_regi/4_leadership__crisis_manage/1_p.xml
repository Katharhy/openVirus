<p>Leadership in times of crisis is crucial to ongoing damage limitation and outcome severity, quite apart from its importance in planning crisis preparedness. Although we need to look back when all this is over, and take stock of what went right, what was wrong, and what went wrong (i.e., to perform a gap analysis), at this point it seems that most countries were on their own, acting largely independently of others during the SARS‐CoV‐2 outbreak, at least in the early days. However, a pandemic is by definition an international crisis, requiring an international response (national—self‐interest—policies may even be counterproductive in times of pandemics). Extensive and effective cooperation, coordination and sharing of resources were not evident (e.g., see Herszenhorn and Wheaton,

Where leadership is suboptimal, dissemination of misinformation flourishes, and people are subjected to unnecessary levels of uncertainty and associated stress.
