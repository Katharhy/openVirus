<p>Widespread testing for viral RNA must be complemented by widespread testing, or at least the testing of sentinels of the population, for anti‐viral antibodies. This is essential for relating the dynamics of infection to virus shedding (being infectious = infective for others) and to symptom development. And if (and this is a big IF) the presence of antiviral antibodies reflects protective immunity, antibody testing is essential for herd immunity policy scenarios, to provide the data needed for monitoring and modelling immune population densities/granularity, and also for identification of those in the population who are in principle protected and hence able to return to normality and spearhead safe exit strategies from lockdown measures.
