<p>Leaving aside for the moment decisions about whether to robustly contain the outbreak—to kill it by throttling—the classical strategy of infection control, but which leaves most of the population susceptible to a new outbreak, or attempt to manage an outbreak to achieve herd immunity and a population unsusceptible to a repeat outbreak, it is obviously imperative to know how the outbreak is spreading and how effective are any containment measures that are instituted, so that a change in course of action remains an option. Widespread testing for the viral pathogen, with correct sampling and analysis procedures, is thus essential. This enables,

Early predictions of transmission and mortality trends are only as good as the adequacy of the information fed into models so, with inadequate testing, prediction of trends are unreliable. Mortality‐based policy formulation for SARS‐CoV‐2 responses in some countries was based on incomplete information.
