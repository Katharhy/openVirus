<p>On April 14, 2020, we conducted an online search at 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> using “COVID” as the search term. This yielded 588 studies, with only four (less than 1%) specifically designed for pregnant women (three registries, two from Italy and one from the United States, designed to determine the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection in pregnancy and a survey from Turkey to evaluate physical activity and sleep). Of the 588 studies listed on the 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClincalTrials.gov" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">ClincalTrials.gov</ext-link> website, 376 (64%) were interventional (22% in the United States and 16% in China) and involved agents such as remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, interleukin-6 inhibitors, lopinavir, ritonavir, hyperimmune or convalescent plasma, and others. Although none of these interventional trials were specifically designed for pregnant women, the majority (more than two thirds) specifically added pregnancy as an exclusion criterion or required a “negative pregnancy test” for participants to be included. Examples of these include ACTT (the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial), sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, evaluating the safety and efficacy of remdesivir, and the ORCHID trial (Outcomes Related to COVID-19 Treated With Hydroxychloroquine Among In-patients With Symptomatic Disease), sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, evaluating hydroxychloroquine. Even a trial evaluating high doses of antiinflammatory and antioxidant dietary supplements such as eicosapentaenoic acid and gamma-linolenic acid has excluded pregnant women. A singular bright example of inclusion is the CROWN CORONATION study, aimed to repurpose chloroquine to health workers for coronavirus mitigation. Although this is not a pregnancy-specific trial, the investigators specifically noted that pregnancy and breastfeeding are not exclusions for entry. A similar pattern of exclusion of pregnant women from COVID-19–related trials was noted in other international registries.
