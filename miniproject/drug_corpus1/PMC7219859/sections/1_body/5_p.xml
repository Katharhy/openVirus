<p>The prevalence of pre-existing medical conditions or complications in pregnancy has progressively increased over the past three to four decades. This is secondary to increased maternal age at the time of pregnancy and higher rates of obesity and chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, and asthma, during pregnancy. These comorbidities have been well established as risk factors for mortality for patients with COVID-19 infection.

 </sup> While we face this life-threatening emerging pandemic, it is significant that pregnant women are excluded from potentially beneficial interventions, with researchers failing to consider the concepts of justice, equity, and autonomy. Therefore, we urge the scientific community not to miss this opportunity, and we recommend that, without clear justification for exclusion, pregnant women should be given the opportunity to be included in clinical trials for COVID-19. Rather than automatically excluding them, investigators should consult with experts in obstetrics, teratology, and obstetric pharmacology. This automatic exclusion is both misguided and not justifiable. Pregnant women are fully able to weigh the ethical implications of health decisions they make for themselves and their fetuses, especially when provided with adequate counseling. We also call on the concerned professional organizations, such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, to endeavor to provide timely consultation as well as advocate for reversal of the decision to exclude pregnant women from the appropriate trials.
