 </sup> Currently there are no approved treatments for COVID-19 or vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Guidelines have focused on hand hygiene and social distancing and clinical management consisting of supportive and respiratory care, treatment of secondary pulmonary infections and respiratory failure, and management of other complications. Given the limited ability to contain the virus, and the relatively high transmissibility and case fatality rates, governmental institutions and pharmaceutical companies are racing to find therapeutics and vaccines that target this novel coronavirus.
