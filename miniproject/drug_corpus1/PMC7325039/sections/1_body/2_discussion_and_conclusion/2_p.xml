<p id="Par17">The genotypic prevalence of VZV in China showed that VZV genotype J was the major prevalent strain from 2008 to 2012. In addition, VZV genotypes M1 and M2 also circulated in Guangdong [

Further study needs to focus on the relationship between the clinical presentation and genogroups of VZV, which will provide a useful guide for clinical doctors diagnosing VZV infection. In conclusion, we first reported that infection with VZV genotype J causes a rare case of concurrent varicella and herpes zoster in an adult.
