<p id="Par12">Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in different open reading frames (ORFs) of the VZV genome have been used for VZV genotyping. Genogroups E (European), M (Mosaic) and J (Japanese) of VZV are further divided into seven clades (clade 1, E1; clade 2, J; clade 3, E2; clade 4, M2; clade 5, M1; clade 6, M4; and clade 7, M3) based on specific SNPs in ORFs 1, 21, 22, 50 and 54 [
