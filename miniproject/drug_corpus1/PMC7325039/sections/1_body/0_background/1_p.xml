<p id="Par11">Infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV) can cause trivial mucocutaneous lesions to life-threatening neurological syndrome complications, such as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and vasculitis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster (shingles) are two distinct clinical presentations of mucocutaneous lesions caused by VZV. Primary infection with VZV causes varicella in childhood; then, VZV establishes a latent state in peripheral ganglia, and reactivation of latently persistent virus causes herpes zoster decades later [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, varicella in adult populations have been reported in India [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and Japan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Several studies have confirmed concurrent varicella and herpes zoster in middle-aged and old adults [
