<p id="Par14">To determine the causative pathogen, vesicular fluids from varicella and herpes zoster were collected. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), HSV-2 and VZV were detected by nested PCR [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and only VZV was detected (Supplementary Fig. S
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>A). The viral load of VZV was assessed using real-time PCR [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and the viral load of VZV in the head (mean of Ct = 17.35) was higher than that in the trunk (mean of Ct = 18.64) (Supplementary Fig. S
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>B). To confirm the accuracy of the results, HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV and cytomegalovirus (CMV) were detected again [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Vesicles in the trunk and head were positive for VZV (Supplementary Fig. S
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>C).
