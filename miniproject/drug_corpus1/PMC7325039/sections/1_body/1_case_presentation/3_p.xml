 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). The SNP variations in 5 ORFs (ORFs 1, 21, 22, 50 and 54) were determined. A total of 13 SNP variations were found, and the synonymous mutations also confirmed that VZV in the trunk and head were genotype J (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). To assess this VZV whether a VZV glycoprotein E (gE) mutant virus (VZV-MSP), ORF68 (gE) was amplified. A synonymous G &gt; A mutation in codon 150 of ORF68 (SNP 116255) did not occur (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b); this result confirmed that VZV in the trunk and head was not a VZV-MSP mutant virus.
