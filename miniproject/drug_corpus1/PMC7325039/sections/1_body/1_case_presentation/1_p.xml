<p id="Par13">Here, we report a 44-year-old Chinese man who was suffering from vesicles surrounded by erythema on the left ear and was admitted to The Third Hospital of Xiamen. He complained of pain lasting for 5 days. The patient said he was previously healthy without history of varicella or known drug allergic history and denied any history of medical or medication-related immunosuppression when he was admitted to the hospital. Physical examination found small vesicles (1–2 mm diameter) surrounded by erythema had developed on his trunk and back (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a) and on the neck (Supplementary Fig. S
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>A). These vesicles were diagnosed as varicella. The papules and vesicles in ribbons on the left ear involved 1 to 3 dermatomes, the vesicular eruption was unilateral, lesions appeared over the first 5 days, and they were ulcerated. These lesions were diagnosed as herpes zoster (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). To exclude immunocompromised conditions and other diseases, the antibody titres of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and 
 <italic>Treponema pallidum</italic> were determined, but the patient was negative for these two pathogens. Chest computed tomography confirmed the patient did not have pneumonia. The laboratory test showed that the ratio of neutrophils (82.6%) and neutrophil count (7.8 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L), concentrations of haemoglobin (177 g/L) and complement C4 (0.43 g/L), and haematocrit (51.3%) were upregulated; however, the ratios of lymphocytes (14.3%) and monocytes (2.6%) were downregulated; the ratio of eosinophils (0.1%) and the eosinophil count (0.0 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/L) were significantly downregulated (Supplementary Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The patient was prescribed valacyclovir, ebastine, mecobalamine, pregabalin and calamine lotion. The vesicles became crusts and then disappeared after treatment for 1 week (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b and Supplementary Fig. S
