<p>Within the BE, environmental precautions that can be taken to potentially prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 include chemical deactivation of viral particles on surfaces (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). It has been demonstrated that 62 to 71% ethanol is effective at eliminating MERS, SARS (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), and SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). This ethanol concentration is typical of most alcohol-based hand sanitizers, making properly applied hand sanitizer a valuable tool against the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the BE. Items should be removed from sink areas to ensure aerosolized water droplets do not carry viral particles onto commonly used items, and countertops around sinks should be cleaned using a 10% bleach solution or an alcohol-based cleaner on a regular basis. Again, it is important to remember that the main and much more common spread mechanism of previous CoVs has been identified as droplets from talking, sneezing, coughing, and vomiting than by the fecal-oral pathway (

 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Administrators and building operators should post signage about the effectiveness of handwashing for at least 20â€‰s with soap and hot water, ensure soap dispensers are full, provide access to alcohol-based hand sanitizer, and implement routine surface cleaning protocols to high-touch surfaces where contamination risks are high, such as around sinks and toilets (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Most importantly, to prevent the transmission of microbes and thus, undesirable pathogens, it is important to exercise proper handwashing hygiene (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>).
