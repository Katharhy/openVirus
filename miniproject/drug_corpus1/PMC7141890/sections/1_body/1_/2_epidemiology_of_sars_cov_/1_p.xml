<p>The 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded positive-sense enveloped RNA virus ( with a genome that is approximately 30 kb in length (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Spike glycoproteins, the club-like extensions projecting from the cell surface, facilitate the transfer of viral genetic material into a host cell by adhesion (
