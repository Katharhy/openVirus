<p>As individuals move through the BE, there is direct and indirect contact with the surfaces around them. Viral particles can be directly deposited and resuspended due to natural airflow patterns, mechanical airflow patterns, or other sources of turbulence in the indoor environment such as foot fall, walking, and thermal plumes from warm human bodies (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). These resuspended viral particles can then resettle back onto fomites. When an individual makes contact with a surface, there is an exchange of microbial life (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), including a transfer of viruses from the individual to the surface and vice versa (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Once infected, individuals with COVID-19 shed viral particles before, during, and after developing symptoms (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). These viral particles can then settle onto abiotic objects in the BE and potentially serve as reservoirs for viral transmission (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Evidence suggests that fomites can potentially be contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 particles from infected individuals through bodily secretions such as saliva and nasal fluid, contact with soiled hands, and the settling of aerosolized viral particles and large droplets spread via talking, sneezing, coughing, and vomiting (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). A study on environmental contamination from MERS-CoV demonstrated that nearly every touchable surface in a hospital housing MERS-CoV patients had been contaminated with the virus (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), and a survey of a hospital room with a quarantined COVID-19 patient demonstrated extensive environmental contamination (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Knowledge of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 is currently developing, but based upon studies of SARS and MERS-CoV, preliminary data on SARS-CoV-2, and CDC recommendations, it seems likely that SARS-CoV-2 can potentially persist on fomites ranging from a couple of hours to 5 days (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) depending on the material (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Based upon preliminary studies of SARS-CoV-2 survival, the virus survives longest at a relative humidity of 40% on plastic surfaces (half-life median = 15.9 h) and shortest in aerosol form (half-life median = 2.74 h) (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>); however, survival in aerosol was determined at a relative humidity of 65%. Based on data related to SARS and MERS, we predict that the viability of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosol is likely longer at lower relative humidity levels. Survival of SARS-CoV-2 at 40% relative humidity on copper (half-life median = 3.4 h), cardboard (half-life median = 8.45 h), and steel (half-life median = 13.1 h) collectively fall between survival in the air and on plastic (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). However, it should be noted that there are no documented cases thus far of a COVID-19 infection originating from a fomite. There is preliminary data demonstrating the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in stool, indicating that transmission can potentially occur through the fecal-oral pathway (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). While transmission of COVID-19 has been documented only through respiratory droplet spread and not through deposition on fomites, steps should still be taken to clean and disinfect all potential sources of SARS-CoV-2 under the assumption that active virus may be transmitted by contact with these abiotic surfaces (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). With an abundance of caution, it is important to consider the possibility that the virus is transmitted through aerosols and surfaces (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). For a conceptualization of SARS-CoV-2 deposition, see
