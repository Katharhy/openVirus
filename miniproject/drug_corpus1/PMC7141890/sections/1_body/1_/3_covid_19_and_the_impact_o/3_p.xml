<p>Previously, it has been confirmed that SARS can be, and is most often, transmitted through droplets (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Considering that SARS-CoV-2 is from a sister clade to the 2002 SARS virus (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) that is known to transmit from person-to-person, the high incidence of observed person-to-person transmission and the rapid spread of COVID-19 throughout the world and communities, it is accepted at this time that SARS-CoV-2 can also be spread through droplets (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Based upon previous investigation into SARS (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), spread through aerosolization remains a potential secondary transmission method, especially within the BE. Mitigation of viral transmission through BE air delivery systems is most often reliant on inline filtration media. Residential and commercial systems typically require a minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) of 8, which is rated to capture 70 to 85% of particles ranging from 3.0 to 10.0 μm, a strategy employed to minimize debris and loss of efficiency impacts to cooling coils and other heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) components. Higher MERV ratings are required to filter incoming outside air based on local outdoor particulate levels. Protective environment (PE) rooms in hospitals require the most stringent minimum filtration efficiency (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). A MERV of 7 (MERV-7) or greater is required as a first filter before heating and cooling equipment, and a second high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter is placed downstream of cooling coils and fans. HEPA filters are rated to remove at least 99.97% of particles at 0.3 µm in size, representing the most penetrating particle size (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Most residential and commercial buildings utilize MERV-5 to MERV-11, and in critical health care settings, MERV-13 or higher and HEPA filters are used. MERV-13 filters have the potential to remove microbes and other particles ranging from 0.3 to 10.0 µm. Most viruses, including CoVs, range from 0.004 to 1.0 µm (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). However, viruses are rarely observed as individual particles, but instead are expelled from the body already combined with water, proteins, salts, and other components as large droplets and aerosols. Thus far, SARS-CoV-2 has been observed in aerosolized particles in a spectrum of sizes, including 0.25 to 0.5 µm (
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>), necessitating high efficiency filtration techniques to reduce the transmission potential of pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2. However, it has been found that gaps in the edges of filters in hospitals has been a contributing factor of the failure of filtering systems to eliminate pathogens from the shared air environment (
