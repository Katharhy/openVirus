  <title>Note Added after Publication</title>
  <p>After original publication of this paper, several changes were required and have been made in this version of the article.</p>
  <p>The text on page 5, first paragraph, line 18, originally read as follows: “HEPA filters are rated to remove at least 99.97% of particles down to 0.3 µm (
   <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Most residential and commercial buildings utilize MERV-5 to MERV-11, and in critical health care settings, MERV-12 or higher and HEPA filters are used. MERV-13 filters have the potential to remove microbes and other particles ranging from 0.3 to 10.0 µm. Most viruses, including CoVs, range from 0.004 to 1.0 µm, limiting the effectiveness of these filtration techniques against pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 (
   <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Furthermore, no filter system is perfect. Recently,….”

  <p>The text on page 6, third full paragraph, second sentence, originally read as follows: “Even though viral particles are too small to be contained by even the best HEPA and MERV filters, ventilation precautions can be taken to ensure the minimization of SARS-CoV-2 spread.”</p>
  <p>The first sentence of Acknowledgments originally said: “We thank Jason Stenson and Cassandra Moseley for comments on the manuscript.”</p>
  <p>Reference 96 has been added to this version.</p>
