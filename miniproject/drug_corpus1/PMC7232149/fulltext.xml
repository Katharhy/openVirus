More attention is needed in several areas, such as increasing virulence or pathogenicity of circulating B viruses and developing vaccines against current influenza. Since preclinical trials of anti-influenza drugs are mainly conducted in mice, we developed an appropriate infection model, using an antigenically-relevant IBV strain, for furtherance of anti-influenza drug testing and influenza vaccine protective efficacy analysis. A Victoria lineage (clade 1A) IBV was serially passaged 17 times in BALB/c mice, and adaptive amino acid substitutions were found in hemagglutinin (HA) (T214I) and neuraminidase (NA) (D432N). By electron microscopy, spherical and elliptical IBV forms were noted. Light microscopy showed that mouse-adapted IBVs caused influenza pneumonia on day 6 post inoculation. We evaluated the illness pathogenicity, viral load, and histopathological features of mouse-adapted IBVs and estimated anti-influenza drugs and vaccine efficiency in vitro and in vivo. Assessment of an investigational anti-influenza drug (oseltamivir ethoxysuccinate) and an influenza vaccine (Ultrix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, SPBNIIVS, Saint Petersburg, Russia) showed effectiveness against the mouse-adapted influenza B virus.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>influenza B virus</kwd><kwd>mouse-adapted</kwd><kwd>amino acid substitutions</kwd><kwd>pathogenicity</kwd><kwd>influenza model</kwd><kwd>virulence</kwd><kwd>antiviral drugs</kwd><kwd>influenza vaccine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-viruses-12-00470"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Influenza B viruses (IBVs) belong to the family <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> [<xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. IBVs have been isolated from humans and seals (<italic>Phoca vitulina</italic> and <italic>Halichoerus grypus</italic>) [<xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. They were first isolated in 1940, and since the 1980s two IBV genetic lineages have been identified: B/Victoria/2/87 (B/Vic) and B/Yamagata/16/88 (B/Yam). These lineages are differentiated by differences in hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), with almost have no antigenic crossover in the hemagglutination inhibition assay [<xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It is interesting to note that, in the mid-1990s, a new reassortant IBV with Victoria-like HA and Yamagata-like NA (VicHA&#x02013;YamNA) emerged which displaced the Victoria-like HA and Victoria-like NA viruses (VicHA&#x02013;VicNA) and continued to circulate into the 2000s [<xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Monitoring for IBVs showed that the highest levels of relative genetic diversity of the Victoria lineage occurred during the 2010&#x02013;2011 and 2016&#x02013;2017 seasons [<xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Human infection by IBV can lead to serious respiratory disease, the complications of which are particularly common among children of primary school age (5&#x02013;8 years) [<xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Data for the United States for each epidemic season from 200 to 2011 (excluding the 2009 pandemic) show that between 22% and 44% of all childhood influenza-related deaths were caused by IBV infection. Moreover, from 2004 to 2013, Canadian researchers found significantly higher mortality rates due to IBV compared to influenza A virus in children younger than 16 years of age [<xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In Europe, influenza B accounted for 63% of all influenza cases in the 2017&#x02013;2018 epidemic season [<xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A number of studies using ex vivo (explant) cultures of human bronchus or lung showed that IBVs are capable of causing severe lower respiratory tract infections which frequently lead to fatal complications [<xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Seasonal influenza vaccines are divided into types: trivalent, which consists of influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and one influenza B strain (B/Yam or B/Vic); or quadrivalent, which contains all four strains. The threat of IBV has been recently recognized [<xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and seasonal influenza vaccines are moving towards quadrivalent types [<xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which will have greater efficacy in the case of emergent of reassortant IBVs. Vaccines designs seek to provide protection against seasonal influenza viruses by eliciting antibody responses to surface viral HA proteins. Constant antigenic drift in HA necessitates regular updating of vaccine strains to ensure that the antigenic profile of circulating strains and vaccine components match [<xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), a quadrivalent vaccine is 28% effective among the especially susceptible, namely children within the age group of 9&#x02013;17 years of age [<xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Despite the fact that IBVs have repeatedly caused human epidemics, their genetic determinants of virulence and transmission are still poorly understood. Limited data on the range of hosts and the absence IBV modes of transmission complicate several areas including the study of pathogenicity factors, assessment of antiviral drugs, and vaccines effectiveness. The aim of this study is to develop non-lethal infection models, using clinically-relevant viruses, which facilitate testing of (anti-influenza) vaccine-induced protection. BALB/c mice were infected with mouse-adapted influenza B virus (B/Vic) and were characterized for illness, inflammation, viral load, and histopathology. Anti-influenza drugs and vaccine efficiency were also estimated in vitro and in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-12-00470"><title>2.

Three of seven mice from each passage with the most evident symptoms were sacrificed by decapitation on 3rd day post-infection (d.p.i.). The lungs of these mice were used to prepare 10% homogenates in PBS. Subsequently, new groups of mice were anesthetized with the same anesthetic and i.i. with 50 &#x000b5;L of 10% lung homogenate. In parallel, viral replication of viruses in the lungs of the sacrificed mice was measured by titration of a 10% homogenate using Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell culture [<xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Four of seven mice from each group, at each passage, were monitored daily for 14 d.p.i for signs of illness, weight loss, or lethality.

Viral Adaptation</title><p>To study the adaptation of B virus isolated from humans, we serially passaged the wild type IBV Victoria lineage strain <italic>B/2017</italic> in BALB/c mice. After 17 passages total, the mouse-adapted B virus <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> was obtained. We compared the pathogenicity of the <italic>B/2017</italic> and <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> strains. Groups of twelve 6&#x02013;8-week-old male BALB/c mice were i.i. with 50 &#x003bc;L of B/2017 or <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> viruses at 10<sup>4</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> (10 MID<sub>50</sub>). Body weight, temperature changes, morbidity, and mortality were monitored during 14 d.p.i, and the PBS-inoculated group of mice served as the controls. On the 3rd and 6th d.p.i., 3 animals from each group were sacrificed by decapitation, and internal organ samples (lungs, brain, heart, liver, kidneys, spleen) were taken for comparative virological analysis. On day 3 and 6 p.i., lungs were taken for examination by electron microscopy.</p><p>All mice i.i. with <italic>B/2017</italic> virus survived and showed no obvious clinical signs such as body weight or temperature changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00470-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B). In contrast, another experimental group of mice i.i. with <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> showed gradually weight loss: approximately 10% at 3 d.p.i.; 15% at 4 d.p.i.; 20% at 5 d.p.i.; 25% at 6 d.p.i.; and 30% at 7 d.p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00470-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). Temperature measurements indicated the peak infection time frame to be from the 4th to the 7th d.p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00470-f002">Figure 2</xref>B).</p><p>At 3 and 6 d.p.i., three mice were sacrificed, and their organs (lungs, brain, heart, liver, kidneys, spleen) were harvested. Viral titers in the collected organs were determined by the Kerber method with Ashmarin&#x02013;Vorobyov modification. The strain <italic>B/2017</italic> could replicate in mouse lungs only 3 days with titers 2.9 &#x000b1; 0.2 log<sub>10</sub>TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL. In contrast, strain <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> replicated very well in mouse lungs, with higher titers and a longer period: on the 3rd d.p.i., the titer was the 5 &#x000b1; 0.1 log<sub>10</sub>TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL; and on the 6th d.p.i. it was 3.3 &#x000b1; 0.3 log<sub>10</sub>TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL. Therefore, the mouse-adapted B virus strain <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> displayed much higher replication capability in mouse lungs. In other organs (such as brain, heart, liver, kidneys, or spleen) we did not find a viral load from either strain.</p><p>Histopathological analysis of mouse lungs infected with the <italic>B/2017</italic> virus showed slight damage, such as: small numbers of eosinophilic cells in the bronchioles; low blood filling of the capillaries; and edema with a high protein content on the 6th d.p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00470-f002">Figure 2</xref>C). In contrast, on the same d.p.i., pathomorphological changes in lungs of mice infected with the <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> virus were more pronounced due to viral triggered apoptosis, leading to desquamation of the bronchial epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00470-f002">Figure 2</xref>C, insertion). Other features noted included: a greater number of eosinophilic cells in the bronchioles; lymphocytic infiltration of various lung regions; and capillaries stasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00470-f002">Figure 2</xref>C). All of the pathomorphological changes listed were predominantly located in the root, cranioventral, and middle regions of the left and right lungs of the <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> virus infected mice.</p><p>Electron microscopic examination revealed budding of virions from the surface of type 1 alveolar cells on the 3rd d.p.i. in samples from mice in the <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00470-f002">Figure 2</xref>D,E).

Sequencing and Genetic Analysis</title><p>According to nucleotide sequence analysis of all eight genome segments, the <italic>B/2017</italic> virus and, consequently, its mouse-adapted variant <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> belong to the B/Vic genetic lineage. In addition, analysis of these strains of HA amino acid sequences revealed mutations (I117D, N129D, V146I) relative to earlier reference strains. These mutations are characteristic of strains belonging to the 1A genetic subgroup of the B/Vic lineage. The strains NA substitutions were also found to feature amino acid substitutions characteristic of genetic group 1A of the B/Vic lineage (N340D, E358K, S295R, I120V, and K220N). To assess the phylogenetic relationships between <italic>B/2017</italic> and <italic>B/2017-MA</italic>, all genome segments were analyzed using phylogenetic dendrograms. Analysis used IBV nucleotide sequences, available in the GISAID database, isolated from residents of Russia and Kazakhstan, as well as vaccine and reference strains according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification.</p><p>According to dendrograms (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00470">Supplementary Materials, Figure S1&#x02013;S8</xref>), the studied strains form a common phylogenetic group with other isolates from Novosibirsk, as well as strains from the neighboring Altai Republic and the Republic of Kazakhstan. At the same time, all of them are phylogenetically distanced (although only slightly) from IBV strains isolated in other Russian regions.</p><p>To identify strains that are the most genetically related to <italic>B/2017</italic> and <italic>B/2017-MA</italic>, BLAST analysis was performed. The results revealed that the study strains are 99&#x02013;100% identical to the IBV variants that circulated in the human population in the Novosibirsk region, Altai Republic, and the Republic of Kazakhstan (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00470">Table S1</xref>). Thus, strain <italic>B/2017</italic> is a typical genetic variant of the IBV that circulated during the 2016&#x02013;2017 epidemic season, and it is most genetically related to the strains that circulated in Asia at that time.</p><p>Comparative analysis of nucleotide and amino acid substitutions between the two strains (<italic>B/2017</italic> vs. <italic>B/2017-MA</italic>) showed the presence of synonymous (not leading to amino acid substitution) nucleotide substitution in the PB1 segment&#x02014;A2175G. Additionally, nucleotide substitution in the HA segment (C641T) led to amino acid substitution in the HA protein (T214I). According to the FluSurver resource [<xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], the detected substitution is rare and present in 0.46% HA of IBVs isolated from 2008 to 2016. The identified amino acid substitution is localized in the antigenically active subunit HA-HA1, which can potentially affect the biological properties of the virus. In the sequence coding NA, a nucleotide substitution (G1294A), which leads to the amino acid change D432N, was detected. According to the FluSurver resource [<xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], this substitution has only been found in one strain (B/Hawaii/37/2017) so far.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-viruses-12-00470"><title>3.3.

Assessment of Vaccine Efficiency Against Mouse-Adapted Influenza B Virus In Vivo</title><p>We assessed vaccine efficiency against the mouse-adapted <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> strain in vivo. In preparation, BALB/c mice were immunized with purified surface antigens from the influenza strain B/Colorado/06/2017 (lineage B/Victoria/2/87) (Ultrix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, SPBNIIVS, Saint Petersburg, Russia) in 0.25 &#x000b5;L twice (prime boost). On day 21 after vaccination, mice were i.i. with the <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> strain. Infected but not immunized mice served as controls.</p><p>Infection induced by <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> in non-immunized mice was characterized by body weight loss and hypothermia from the 2nd d.p.i, as well as conjunctivitis (up to 30%), with onsets between 1 and 3 d.p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00470-f003">Figure 3</xref>A&#x02013;C). All mice in this group huddled together, and their fur was ruffled on the 4th d.p.i. Peak illness was determined to be from the 5th to the 10th d.p.i., as seen by a large percentage of total body weight lost and visibly increased breathing effort caused by severe pathological processes in the lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00470-f003">Figure 3</xref>D). All mice unimmunized and i.i. with <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> lost significant amounts of body weight relative to the comparison groups (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).

The data suggest that the adapted IBV affects vaccinated mice for up to 10 d.p.i. No other influenza signs were observed in vaccinated mice, which indicate a mild IBV illness and effective Ultrix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> vaccination.</p><p>Lung viral loads were assessed via MDCK cell culture (all groups) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00470-f003">Figure 3</xref>E,F).

Discussion</title><p>Influenza B viruses have real epidemiological significance, especially among children. Together, IBV and influenza A cause significant seasonal burdens. A lack of information on the host range of IBVs and the need for an adequate infection model have complicated several areas including: the study of pathogenicity factors and transmission methods; the ability to evaluate the antiviral drugs effect; and assessment of vaccine effectiveness. The main drawback to the mouse model is the need to use mouse-adapted viruses. The most famous mouse-adapted virus (strain B/Lee/1940) is currently considered as antiquated because it is not genetically and antigenically representative of influenza viruses currently circulating among humans.</p><p>In the field of virology, there is an entire branch devoted to obtaining recombinant strains for vaccines. IBV strains that are commonly used in experiments in Russian laboratories are recombinant strains obtained for vaccines [<xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Such IBV strains, however, are attenuated and apatogenous for experimental animals, which, in turn, does not provide an opportunity to study the pathological process of influenza infection and makes it difficult to perform studies of anti-influenza drug effectiveness in vivo. Consequently, they do not provide an opportunity to study the pathological process of influenza infection. Moreover, many of the presented recombinant strains have lost their antigenic relevance today.</p><p>Since preclinical trials of anti-influenza drugs are conducted mainly in mice [<xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], we also sought a mouse model. An antigenically-relevant B/Vic virus (strain <italic>B/2017</italic> (VicHA&#x02013;VicNA), which had circulated and predominated in 2017) was chosen and adapted in mice in order to receive the antigenically- and clinically-relevant strain (<italic>B/2017-MA</italic>) for use in in vitro studies, and also in experimental infection on mice to evaluate the therapeutic and preventive effectiveness of antiviral drugs and vaccines in vivo. In our work we demonstrate productive infection and clinically apparent signs of disease of mouse-adapted IBV Victoria lineage which was first obtained in Russia. Both strains (<italic>B/2017</italic> and <italic>B/2017-MA</italic>) were deposited in the State collection of causative agents of viral infections and rickettsioses of the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology &#x0201c;Vector&#x0201d; (Koltsovo, Russia) under registration numbers V-810 and V-811, accordingly. Amino acid substitutions associated with IBV adaptation to mice were identified. They likely increase the pathogenicity and enhanced replication ability in infected mammals.</p><p>On the 6th d.p.i in BALB/c mice, influenza pneumonia featuring leukocyte and lymphocyte infiltration of bronchioles was detected in the lungs of animals infected with mouse-adapted IBV (strain <italic>B/2017-MA</italic>). On the same day, no viral loads were detected in the lungs of mice infected with wild type IBV (strain <italic>B/2017</italic>). Despite this fact, pathomorphological changes were registered and characterized as mild disease. Since the knowledge of the IBV virion structure remains limited [<xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], we utilized electron microscopy. Elliptical forms were noted in addition to spherical ones. This may possibly indicate that influenza B virions are pleomorphic in structure.</p><p>Comparative analysis of nucleotide and amino acid substitutions between wild strain <italic>B/2017</italic> and its mouse-adapted variant <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> strain revealed non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions that led to amino acid substitutions in two proteins, HA and NA. One of the amino acid substitutions identified (T214I in HA) is localized in the antigenically active subunit HA-HA1, thereby affecting the biological properties of the virus. Interestingly, the same substitution was present in 0.46% of IBVs reported from 2008 to 2016 [<xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This fact may explain severe cases and poor clinical outcomes in some patients infected with IBVs. Another substitution was found in NA and characterized as rare [<xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In light of the above, we assume that the Asn amino acid at position 432 of the NA protein in complex with other substitution(s) in the surface glycoprotein HA might jointly be responsible for the high pathogenicity.</p><p>Due to their roles in elevating seasonal morbidity and mortality among humans worldwide, influenza A and B viruses have epidemiological, social, and economic significance [<xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Selective inhibition of neuraminidase is used in the treatment of influenza to control the processes of budding and release of mature virions from the surface of an infected host cell (as a result of cleavage of sialic acid residues from hemagglutinin). In addition, NA plays a key role in the initial stages of infection, ensuring the penetration of influenza viruses into cells. Due to the specific activity of NA, inhibitors work effectively against influenza A and B viruses. Oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, and laninamivir are long-acting neuraminidase inhibitors for the treatment and prophylaxis of human influenza virus infection [<xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Between the NA inhibitors of oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) and zanamivir (Relenza<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>), the former is considered the most effective because of its higher bioavailability (30&#x02013;100%) [<xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, the use of anti-influenza drugs to prevent and treat diseases is complicated by viral resistance which has been observed in recent years [<xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B41-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In addition, it has been shown that Tamiflu<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is a lot less effective in treating influenza B, compared to influenza A [<xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Due to the facts that the investigational drug (oseltamivir ethoxysuccinate) is a modified version of Tamiflu<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and that it has shown (like Tamiflu<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) high effectiveness against the mouse-adapted IBV, oseltamivir ethoxysuccinate is a promising drug for the treatment of influenza caused by the B virus.</p><p>More attention should be paid to mammalian adaptation of IBVs and how such procedures and mechanisms can enhance the development of vaccines against current influenza strains. Due to the fact that no significant lung damage was detected in vaccinated mice on day 6 after challenge, we can conclude that the Ultrix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> quadrivalent vaccine is effective against our mouse-adapted IBV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-viruses-12-00470"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In this work, we serially passaged a Victoria lineage IBV 17 times in BALB/c mice. The mouse-adapted IBV caused influenza pneumonia on day 6 post inoculation. Apparently, selective accumulation of amino acid substitutions in the mouse-adapted IBV, including changes to HA (T214I) and NA (D432N), may increase pathogenicity following the adaptation and be important for the virions to attach to hosts airways. However, the specific effects of these amino acid substitutions on mammalian pathogenicity requires further study. Spherical and elliptical IBV virion morphologies were also shown. Assessment of the investigational anti-influenza drug oseltamivir ethoxysuccinate and influenza vaccine Ultrix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> showed effectiveness against our mouse-adapted influenza B virus. In summary, we demonstrated productive infection and clinically apparent signs of disease of Victoria lineage mouse-adapted IBVs (strain <italic>B/2017-MA</italic>) which are useful for estimation of anti-influenza drugs and protective efficacy of influenza vaccines in vitro and in vivo.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Sysolyatin Sergey at the Institute for Problems of Chemical and Energetic Technologies, Biysk, Russia, for providing antiviral drug oseltamivir ethoxysuccinate.
