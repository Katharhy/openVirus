<p>Lung samples were taken on the 3rd and 6th d.p.i. with 
 <italic>B/2017</italic> and 
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> viruses. Samples were: fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.4 for 4 h at 4 °C; re-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.4 at 4 °C for 2 h; then dehydrated in ethanol (50°, 70°, 96°, 100°) followed by acetone and Araldite-Epon mixture (1:6) (SPI, West Chester, PA, USA) with the addition of the catalyst 2,4,6-tris(dimethylaminoethyl)-phenol (DMP-30) and polymerized at 60 °C. Semi-thin sections were prepared from solid blocks, stained with Azur II and examined in a light microscope to highlight areas for ultrathin sectioning. Ultrathin sections were cut with an EM UC7 ultramicrotome (Leica, Wien, Austria). Sections were stained with uranyl acetate, followed by lead citrate (SPI, West Chester, PA, USA). The samples were examined on a transmission electron microscope LIBRA 120 (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) at 100 kV, and images were captured using a Veleta digital camera (EMSIS GmbH, Muenster, Germany).
