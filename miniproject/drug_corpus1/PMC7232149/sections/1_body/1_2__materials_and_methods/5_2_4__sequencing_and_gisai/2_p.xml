<p>Products of PCR were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and sequencing was performed using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Paired-end libraries for the MiSeq platform were prepared using the Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The sequencing library was quantified using the NEBNext Library Quant Kit (NEB, Evry, France). Library size was assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100.</p>
