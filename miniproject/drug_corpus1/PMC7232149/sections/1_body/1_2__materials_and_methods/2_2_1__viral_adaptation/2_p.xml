<p>To evaluate the pathogenicity of the 
 <italic>B/2017</italic> and 
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> viruses, groups of six 6-week-old male BALB/c mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10 per group) were anesthetized with Rometar (20 mg/kg) and i.i. with 50 μL of PBS containing 10
 <sup>4</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL and 10 MID
 <sub>50</sub>, respectively. Intact mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3 per group) were i.i. with 50 µL of PBS (pH 7.2) and served as the control. Body weight and temperatures changes, as well as mouse survival rate were monitored daily for 14 d.p.i. Body weight was measured by using a laboratory animal weighing analytical balances MASSA-K VK-1500 (MASSA-K, Saint Petersburg, Russia), and body surface temperature was taken from the ear canal using a hand-held infrared thermometer ‘AccuVET’ (Mesure Technology Co., Ltd., West Bromwich, UK).
