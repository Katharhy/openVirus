<p>To detect the tissue distribution of 
 <italic>B/2017</italic> and 
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> viruses, on days 3 and 6 p.i., three mice were sacrificed, and organ samples of lungs, brain, heart, liver, kidneys, and spleen were harvested in 1 mL of PBS. Samples were then homogenized and centrifuged, and viral titers in the homogenized supernatants were determined by the Kerber method with Ashmarinâ€“Vorobyov modification. To assess by light and electron microscopy pathological lesions in mice infected with 
 <italic>B/2017</italic> or 
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> viruses, their lungs were harvested at the 3rd and 6th d.p.i.
