<p>The virulence of the B virus was increased by serial passages in the lungs of 8-week-old male BALB/c (
 <italic>n</italic> = 7 per group) mice (State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR (FSRI SRC VB VECTOR), Novosibirsk, Russia). Seven mice were lightly anesthetized with Rometar (20 mg/kg) (Bioveta, Ivanovice na Hané, Czech Republic) and intranasally infected (i.i.) with 50 µL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10
 <sup>4</sup> TCID
 <sub>50/mL</sub> (50% tissue culture infective dose) of a wild type IBV strain B/Novosibirsk/40/2017 (
 <italic>B/2017</italic>) that was isolated from a human in 2017 in Novosibirsk, Russia and belongs to B/Victoria lineage. Three of seven mice from each passage with the most evident symptoms were sacrificed by decapitation on 3rd day post-infection (d.p.i.). The lungs of these mice were used to prepare 10% homogenates in PBS. Subsequently, new groups of mice were anesthetized with the same anesthetic and i.i. with 50 µL of 10% lung homogenate. In parallel, viral replication of viruses in the lungs of the sacrificed mice was measured by titration of a 10% homogenate using Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell culture [

After 17 passages in total, the clinical signs were registered: significant reduction in body weight (up to 30%); hypothermia; ruffled fur; and animals huddling together. The wild type IBV strain 
 <italic>B/2017</italic> and mouse-adapted variant (strain B/Novosibirsk/40/2017-MA (
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic>)) were patented [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The median mouse infectious dose (MID
 <sub>50</sub>) of the virus 
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> was 4.6 ± 0.26 log
 <sub>10</sub>/mL, or 1.88 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>; the TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of 
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> was 4.9 ± 0.21 log
 <sub>10</sub>/mL. Both strains (wild type strain and 
 <italic>B/2017-MA)</italic> are non-lethal for mice.
