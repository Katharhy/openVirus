<p>More attention should be paid to mammalian adaptation of IBVs and how such procedures and mechanisms can enhance the development of vaccines against current influenza strains. Due to the fact that no significant lung damage was detected in vaccinated mice on day 6 after challenge, we can conclude that the Ultrix
 <sup>Â®</sup> quadrivalent vaccine is effective against our mouse-adapted IBV.
