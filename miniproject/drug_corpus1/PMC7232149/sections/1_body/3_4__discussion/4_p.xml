<p>On the 6th d.p.i in BALB/c mice, influenza pneumonia featuring leukocyte and lymphocyte infiltration of bronchioles was detected in the lungs of animals infected with mouse-adapted IBV (strain 
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic>). On the same day, no viral loads were detected in the lungs of mice infected with wild type IBV (strain 
 <italic>B/2017</italic>). Despite this fact, pathomorphological changes were registered and characterized as mild disease. Since the knowledge of the IBV virion structure remains limited [
