<p>Influenza B viruses have real epidemiological significance, especially among children. Together, IBV and influenza A cause significant seasonal burdens. A lack of information on the host range of IBVs and the need for an adequate infection model have complicated several areas including: the study of pathogenicity factors and transmission methods; the ability to evaluate the antiviral drugs effect; and assessment of vaccine effectiveness. The main drawback to the mouse model is the need to use mouse-adapted viruses. The most famous mouse-adapted virus (strain B/Lee/1940) is currently considered as antiquated because it is not genetically and antigenically representative of influenza viruses currently circulating among humans.</p>
