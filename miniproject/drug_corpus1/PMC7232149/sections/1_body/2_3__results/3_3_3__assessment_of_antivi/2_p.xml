<p>The study also analyzed anti-influenza drug efficacy in vivo. No significant body weight or temperature changes between groups of animals i.i. with the 
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> strain, and then treated per os for 5 days with oseltamivir ethoxysuccinate or Tamiflu
 <sup>®</sup>, were seen (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00470-f002">Figure 2</xref>F,G). All mice treated with anti-influenza drugs lost no more than 10% of body weight and began to recover on the 7th d.p.i. In addition, no hypothermia was detected among them. Therefore, it was shown that the innovative drug (oseltamivir ethoxysuccinate) displays high effectiveness, like Tamiflu
 <sup>®</sup>, against the mouse-adapted B virus.
