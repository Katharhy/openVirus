<p>Comparative analysis of nucleotide and amino acid substitutions between the two strains (
 <italic>B/2017</italic> vs. 
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic>) showed the presence of synonymous (not leading to amino acid substitution) nucleotide substitution in the PB1 segmentâ€”A2175G. Additionally, nucleotide substitution in the HA segment (C641T) led to amino acid substitution in the HA protein (T214I). According to the FluSurver resource [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], the detected substitution is rare and present in 0.46% HA of IBVs isolated from 2008 to 2016. The identified amino acid substitution is localized in the antigenically active subunit HA-HA1, which can potentially affect the biological properties of the virus. In the sequence coding NA, a nucleotide substitution (G1294A), which leads to the amino acid change D432N, was detected. According to the FluSurver resource [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], this substitution has only been found in one strain (B/Hawaii/37/2017) so far.
