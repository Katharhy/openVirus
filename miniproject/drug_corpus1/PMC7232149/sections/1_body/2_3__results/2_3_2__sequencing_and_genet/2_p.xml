<p>According to dendrograms (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00470">Supplementary Materials, Figure S1â€“S8</xref>), the studied strains form a common phylogenetic group with other isolates from Novosibirsk, as well as strains from the neighboring Altai Republic and the Republic of Kazakhstan. At the same time, all of them are phylogenetically distanced (although only slightly) from IBV strains isolated in other Russian regions.
