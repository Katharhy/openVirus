<p>We assessed vaccine efficiency against the mouse-adapted 
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> strain in vivo. In preparation, BALB/c mice were immunized with purified surface antigens from the influenza strain B/Colorado/06/2017 (lineage B/Victoria/2/87) (Ultrix
 <sup>®</sup>, SPBNIIVS, Saint Petersburg, Russia) in 0.25 µL twice (prime boost). On day 21 after vaccination, mice were i.i. with the 
 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> strain. Infected but not immunized mice served as controls.
