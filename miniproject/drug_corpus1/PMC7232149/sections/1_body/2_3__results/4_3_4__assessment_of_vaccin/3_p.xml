<p>Lung viral loads were assessed via MDCK cell culture (all groups) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00470-f003">Figure 3</xref>E,F). The virus was detected in lungs via TCID
 <sub>50</sub> assay on day 3 for all infected mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00470-f003">Figure 3</xref>F). On day 6, the virus was only detected in unvaccinated mice (

 <italic>B/2017-MA</italic> infected group, it was noted that only 10â€“20% of cells in the walls were affected, but a 100% cytopathic effect was detected in the comparison group (
