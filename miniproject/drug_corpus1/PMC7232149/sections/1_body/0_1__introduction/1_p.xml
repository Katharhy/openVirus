<p>Influenza B viruses (IBVs) belong to the family 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. IBVs have been isolated from humans and seals (
 <italic>Phoca vitulina</italic> and 
 <italic>Halichoerus grypus</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. They were first isolated in 1940, and since the 1980s two IBV genetic lineages have been identified: B/Victoria/2/87 (B/Vic) and B/Yamagata/16/88 (B/Yam). These lineages are differentiated by differences in hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), with almost have no antigenic crossover in the hemagglutination inhibition assay [

 <xref rid="B5-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It is interesting to note that, in the mid-1990s, a new reassortant IBV with Victoria-like HA and Yamagata-like NA (VicHA–YamNA) emerged which displaced the Victoria-like HA and Victoria-like NA viruses (VicHA–VicNA) and continued to circulate into the 2000s [

 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Monitoring for IBVs showed that the highest levels of relative genetic diversity of the Victoria lineage occurred during the 2010–2011 and 2016–2017 seasons [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Human infection by IBV can lead to serious respiratory disease, the complications of which are particularly common among children of primary school age (5–8 years) [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Data for the United States for each epidemic season from 200 to 2011 (excluding the 2009 pandemic) show that between 22% and 44% of all childhood influenza-related deaths were caused by IBV infection. Moreover, from 2004 to 2013, Canadian researchers found significantly higher mortality rates due to IBV compared to influenza A virus in children younger than 16 years of age [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In Europe, influenza B accounted for 63% of all influenza cases in the 2017–2018 epidemic season [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00470" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A number of studies using ex vivo (explant) cultures of human bronchus or lung showed that IBVs are capable of causing severe lower respiratory tract infections which frequently lead to fatal complications [
