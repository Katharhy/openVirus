<p id="p0250">In conclusion, this report demonstrates the antiviral activity of 27OHC against SARS-Cov-2 and one related β-coronavirus and shows the dramatic decrease of physiological levels of 27OHC in severe COVID-19. Although the latter observation deserves further investigation, the identification of 27OHC as a novel physiological antiviral with a broad spectrum against β-coronaviruses may be of great importance for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections and possible future epidemics.</p>
