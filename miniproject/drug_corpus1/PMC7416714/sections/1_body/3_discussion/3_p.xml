<p id="p0200">This is especially true in case of 27OHC externally added to the cells, that is in a pharmaceutical mode, in other words as a drug product. Exogenously added 27OHC was proven to almost exclusively accumulate in lipid rafts, as opposed to oxysterols of not enzymatic origin that randomly localize in plasma membranes [
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thus, 27OHC is modifying structure and most likely function of these crucial membrane lipid-protein clusters, where by the way the ACE-2 receptor exploited by SARS-CoV-2 to enter the target cells is located [
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and it certainly induces a modification of multivesicular endosome biogenesis, that by lipid rafts is regulated [
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Further, we very recently observed in HeLa cells a significant 27OHC-dependent down-regulation of cation independent isoform of mannose-6-phosphate receptor (MPRci) [
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], a transporter located at late endosomes whose activity appears crucial for all viruses exploiting the endosomal way to enter and diffuse within cells [
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>]. All together, these facts and findings point to the inhibition of virus entry as the primary protective mechanism of 27OHC externally added to cells.
