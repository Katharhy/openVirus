 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>), indicating a severe impairment of cholesterol metabolism. Serum cholesterol has just been shown to be significantly decreased in COVID-19 patients in direct relation with the severity of the disease, with data highly consistent with those obtained in this study [
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], while the reduction of the main sterol precursors of cholesterol in COVID-19 has not been reported in the literature yet. A big impairment of cholesterol metabolism, at least in severe COVID-19 patients, was actually expected since a net reduction of cholesterol biosynthesis was described as associated with massive acute phase reaction [
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Certainly remarkable is the fact that, despite such a profound derangement of cholesterol metabolism in COVID-19, of the three cholesterol oxidation products of enzymatic origin physiologically present in human blood, i.e. 24OHC, 25OHC and 27OHC, only 27OHC showed a pronounced decrease whose intensity tightly correlated to the disease progression (
