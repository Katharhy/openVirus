<p id="p0195">The data reported in this study demonstrate that 27OHC blocks the replication in vitro of two human CoVs belonging to the β-coronavirus genus: SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43. These findings further confirm the broad spectrum of antiviral activity of 27OHC, which has been already demonstrated for herpes simplex virus, rhinovirus, rotavirus and papillomavirus [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Since all of these viruses are phylogenetically unrelated, with ample diversity in their replicative cycles and structures, it is unlikely that 27OHC targets specific functions such as viral enzymes or anti-receptors. Moreover, 27OHC does not directly inactivate the viral particle as shown also in previous studies [
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] (
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1</xref>). The ability to impair viral entry and/or replication when added up to 24 h before virus inoculum supports the idea that 27OHC modifies cell structures rather than targeting viral components. Indeed, the host-targeting antiviral mode of action has already been reported by Civra et al. [
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], showing that 27OHC induces accumulation of cholesterol in the late endosomal compartment resulting in sequestering human rotavirus particles inside these vesicles, thereby preventing cytoplasmic viral replication. Since also CoVs entry into the host cells involves the endocytic pathway [

 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>], the 
 <italic>anti</italic>-CoVs activity of 27OHC appears due, at least in part, to the transient modification of the endosomal membrane composition and function exerted by the oxysterol.
