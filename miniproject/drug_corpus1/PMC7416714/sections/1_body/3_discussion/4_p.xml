<p id="p0205">In this relation, very likely appears the involvement of redox reactions at the 27OHC concentration range proven to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and CoV-OC43 replication, since similar oxysterol's amounts have been previously demonstrated to transiently increase the level of oxidant species in human promonocytic cells through the activation of NADPH oxidase and the modulation of mitochondrial membrane potential [

 <italic>anti</italic>-SARS-CoV-2 and 
 <italic>anti</italic>-CoV-OC43 activity is matter of ongoing studies, that are also considering this oxysterol ability to induce autophagy [
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], a cellular degradation process in principle favouring the elimination of viral pathogens by delivering viral particles for lysosomal degradation and closely interacting with innate immunity [
