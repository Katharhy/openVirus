<p id="p0045">Due to the emerging role of 27OHC as a broad-spectrum antiviral, we deemed relevant to investigate whether it could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. Here we report on the in vitro antiviral activity of 27OHC against SARS-CoV-2 and the human coronavirus HCoV-OC-43. Moreover, we analyzed the serum levels of 27OHC in 123 healthy individuals, in 27 pauci-or a-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects (PACP) and in 117 COVID-19 patients and found quite a marked decrease of the oxysterol in COVID-19 patients that correlates with the severity of the disease. Another notable finding was the increase of serum 7-ketocholesterol and 7 Î²-hydroxycholesterol, two reliable markers of tissue oxidative imbalance, in moderate and severe COVID-19 patients.</p>
