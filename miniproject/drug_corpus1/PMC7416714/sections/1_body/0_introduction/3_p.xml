<p id="p0035">Selective cholesterol oxidation products, of the oxysterol family, which are ligands of Liver X Receptors (LXRs), have a well-recognized immunomodulatory role [

 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Oxysterols such as 25-hydroxycholesterol (25OHC) have shown to markedly inhibit the replication of a large variety of both enveloped and non-enveloped human viral pathogens [

 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>]. However, another oxysterol of enzymatic origin, namely 27-hydroxycholesterol (27OHC), is gaining increasing consideration as a protective molecule not only against the respiratory virus Rhinovirus, but also against a wide range of other viral infections [

 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>]. There is clear evidence that exogenously added 27OHC accumulates in plasma membrane lipid rafts, likely affecting viral entry but also modulating cell signaling stemming from such microdomains [
