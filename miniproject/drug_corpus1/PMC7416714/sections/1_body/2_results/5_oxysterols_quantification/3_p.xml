<p id="p0185">Actually, the serum 27OHC was already significantly reduced in the PACP group, the mean 27OHC decrease being of 17% in PACP group, 30% in the moderate and of 50% in the severe COVID-19 group (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The PACP group was in between controls and COVID groups (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>). With regard to the other side chain oxysterols physiologically present in human blood, namely 24OHC and 25OHC, only a slight but significant decrease was observed in all three groups of infected subjects, with the only exception of a modest but significant increase of 25OHC in the PACP group. No correlation at all was observed between 24OHC and 25OHC serum levels and the severity of the disease.
