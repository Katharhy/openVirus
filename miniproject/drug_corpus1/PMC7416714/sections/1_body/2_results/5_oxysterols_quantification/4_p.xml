<p id="p0190">Opposite to that of side chain oxysterols was the behaviour in COVID-19 shown by the two B-ring non enzymatic oxysterols of major pathological meaning, namely 7βOHC and 7KC, actually recognized markers of oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Serum concentration of both oxysterols showed a significant while moderate increment in severe COVID-19 patients as respect to controls (P &lt; 0.001 for both). Serum 7KC but not 7βOHC was significantly increased in the moderate COVID-19 patients as well (P = 0.002). In the SARS-CoV-2 positive but pauci- or a-symptomatic subjects, both markers of oxidative stress did not show any significant difference when compared to the control individuals (
