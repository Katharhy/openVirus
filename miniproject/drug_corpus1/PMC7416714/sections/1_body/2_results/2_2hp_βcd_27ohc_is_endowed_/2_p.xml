<p id="p0140">The activity of 27OHC against SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43, was assessed on Vero-E6 and MRC-5 cells, respectively. To improve its solubility and stability, 27OHC was complexed with 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, a carrier commonly used in drug formulations. Therefore, the complex (2HP-βCD:27OHC) and the carrier alone (2HP-βCD) were tested in parallel to rule out any contribution of the carrier to the antiviral activity.</p>
