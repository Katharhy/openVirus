<p id="p0145">As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, 2HP-βCD:27OHC, but not 2HP-βCD, exerted antiviral activity in a dose-response manner against both SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43 to maxima of inhibition of 100%, with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values falling in the low micromolar range and with a favourable selectivity index (SI). Conversely, 2HP-βCD:27OHC did not inhibit the infectivity of RSV, an enveloped RNA virus also causing respiratory diseases, thus demonstrating that the antiviral specificity of 27OHC is broad but yet selective.
