<p id="p0155">The efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43 infection was finally measured respectively in the human cell line Huh7 and MRC-5, in the presence of 2HP-βCD:27OHC. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A and C, and quantified in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B and D, 2HP-βCD:27OHC significantly (p
 <sub>ANOVA</sub> &lt; 0.001) reduced the number of infected cells 48 h post infection both at 3 μM and 20 μM. By contrast, 2HP-βCD failed to show any 
 <italic>anti</italic>-CoV activity, showing no significant difference from the untreated control, in terms of number of infected cells.
