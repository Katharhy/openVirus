<p id="p0150">Time-of-addition experiments were then performed to investigate the step of viral replicative cycle inhibited by 2HP-βCD:27OHC. Two different conditions were used: briefly, cells were treated for 24 h before viral inoculum (pre-treatment protocol) or 3 h after inoculum (post-infection treatment protocol). 2HP-βCD:27OHC showed antiviral activity against the two CoVs both when it was added before and after inoculation (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). However, the results show that 2HP-βCD:27OHC has greater efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 when added after infection, while it is more effective against HCoV-OC43 when added before inoculation. Furthermore, we investigated the ability of 2HP-βCD:27OHC to impair infectivity by directly targeting viral particles incubating HCoV-OC43 with 2HP-βCD:27OHC at high effective concentrations (EC
 <sub>90</sub>) and then determining the viral titer at dilutions at which the treatment was no longer active when added on cells. As reported in 
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1</xref>, 2HP-βCD:27OHC was not able to inactivate HCoV-OC43 particles.
