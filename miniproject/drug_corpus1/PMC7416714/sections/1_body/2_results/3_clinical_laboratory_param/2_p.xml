<p id="p0160">The in vitro evidence of effective inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by the formulation 27OHC+2HP-βCD prompted us to carry on an observational cohort study in COVID-19 patients with the aim to monitor 27OHC serum content in the different stages of the disease. As detailed in the Methods section, the groups studied here were: 1) control, 2) pauci-asymptomatic SASR-CoV-2 positive individuals (PACP), 3) moderate COVID-19, 4) severe COVID-19. No age differences were observed between controls and COVID-19 patients, while the subjects of the pauci-asymptomatic group were significantly younger than all the other groups (P &lt; 0.001 for all).</p>
