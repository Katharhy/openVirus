<p id="p0165">With regard to the standard laboratory parameters measured only in the hospitalized patients (see 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), HB and HCT, already below the normal values, were significantly lower in severe COVID-19 compared to moderate COVID-19 (P = 0.04 for both). Also serum creatinine was increased both in moderate and severe patients, being significantly higher in the severe COVID-19 group as compared to the moderate COVID-19 one (P = 0.03). Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) and Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) were moderately above the normal range, while Creatine Kinase (CK) was much higher respect to the normal values, in all cases without significant difference between the two groups of patients. C Reactive Protein (CRP), resulted to be markedly elevated in COVID-19 with a tendency to increase in the severe cases, and Procalcitonin (PCT), a marker of sepsis, showed a net average increase in the severe COVID-19 group, that however did not reach statistical significance.
