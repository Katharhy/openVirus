<p id="p0100">MRC-5 or Hep-2 cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup>/well in 96-well plates and treated the next day with 27OHC, 2HP-βCD:27OHC, or blank formulation at concentrations ranging from 0.07 to 150 μM to generate dose-response curves. Control samples (100% of viability) were prepared by treating cells with culture medium. After 72 h of incubation, cell viability was determined using a Cell Titer 96 Proliferation Assay Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and following the manufacturer's instructions. Absorbance was measured using a Microplate Reader (Model 680, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) at 490 nm. Viability of oxysterol-treated cells is expressed as a percentage relative to cells incubated with culture medium supplemented with equal volumes of ethanol.
