<p id="p0085">The antiviral activity was determined by the plaque reduction assay. For SARS-CoV-2 experiments, Vero E6 cells were seeded in a 48 well plate, at 6 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well density and incubated at 37 °C overnight. For HCoV-OC43 and RSV, MRC-5 or Hep-2 cells, respectively were first seeded (at 2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) in 96 well plates and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The medium was removed from the plates and infection was performed respectively with 10–20 viral PFU per well of SARS-CoV-2 at 37 °C for 1 h, ca. 30 PFU of a stock of HCoV-OC43 at 33 °C for 1 h or ca. 30 PFU of RSV at 37 °C for 3 h, allowing the viruses to attach and enter the cells. After incubation, cells were washed with medium, and overlaid with medium containing 1% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) with DMEM + 2% FBS, and compound dilutions for SARS-CoV-2 experiments, or with a 1:1 combination of 1.6% SeaPlaque Agarose and 2 × DMEM supplemented with different concentrations of compounds. After 72 h of incubation (33 °C, 5% CO2 for HCoV-OC43 or 37 °C, 5% CO2 for SARS-CoV-2 and RSV), the medium with oxysterols was removed, and the plates were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde (PFA) or 7.5% formaldehyde (Fluka) and stained with crystal violet (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.). The number of plaques formed was counted. The plaque reduction assays were conducted in 2× replicate in two independent experiments. Blockade of viral infectivity was expressed as mean % ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Where possible, half-maximal antiviral effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) values were calculated by regression analysis using the dose-response curves generated from the experimental data using GraphPad PRISM 7 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). EC
 <sub>50</sub> values were compared using the sum-of-squares F test.
