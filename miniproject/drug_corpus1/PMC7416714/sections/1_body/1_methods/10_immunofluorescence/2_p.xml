<p id="p0105">For SARS-CoV-2 analysis Huh7 cells were seeded on coverslips and infected with SARS-CoV-2 the following day at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 0.1 PFU/cell. After 1 h, inoculum was removed and fresh DMEM +2% FBS containing 2HP-βCD:27OHC or 2HP-βCD was added to the cells. After 48 h incubation, cells were fixed with 3.7% PFA, treated with 100 mM glycine and 0.1% Triton X-100, with intermediate washes with PBS. A blocking step was performed at 37 °C for 30 min with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.1% Tween in PBS (blocking solution). The coverslips were then probed with the mSIP-3022 anti-Spike recombinant antibody diluted 1/200 with blocking solution and incubated overnight at 4 °C in humidified container. The reaction was completed by incubating fixed cells with polyclonal anti-mouse antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes, Oregon, USA) diluted 1/500 for 1 h at 37 °C. Coverslips were finally washed and mounted on glass slides using Fluoro-Gel II mounting medium with DAPI (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Pennsylvania, USA) and analyzed with a Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope. For statistical purposes, 200 ± 10 cells were counted for each condition.</p>
