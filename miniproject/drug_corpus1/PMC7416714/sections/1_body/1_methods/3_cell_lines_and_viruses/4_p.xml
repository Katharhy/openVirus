<p id="p0065">Human coronavirus strain OC43 (HCoV–O43) (ATCC® VR-1558) was purchased from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD, USA) and propagated in MRC-5 cells, at 33 °C, in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. When the full cytopathic effect (CPE) developed, cells and supernatants were harvested, pooled, frozen, and thawed three times, then clarified and aliquoted. The virus was stored at −70 °C. CoV titers were determined by the standard plaque method. Briefly, MRC-5 cells were seeded 2 days before infection in 96-well plates, reaching 60%–70% confluence at the time of infection. The viral suspension was serially diluted in DMEM supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum and inoculated; the infected wells were incubated at 33 °C for 1 h, allowing viruses to attach and enter the cells. After this time, cells were washed with medium, and overlaid with a 1:1 combination of 1.6% SeaPlaque Agarose (BioWhittaker Molecular Applications) and 2 × DMEM medium (Gibco BRL) as described elsewhere [

 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and the number of plaques formed was counted; viral titers were expressed in terms of plaque forming units per ml (PFU/ml). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) strain A2 (ATCC VR-1540) was propagated in Hep-2 and titrated by the indirect immunoperoxidase staining procedure as described elsewhere [
