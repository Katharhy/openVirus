<p id="p0095">The cytotoxicity assay was conducted with Alamar Blue (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer's protocol. Vero E6 cells were seeded at 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well in a 96 well plate, and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Then 50 μL of compounds at the indicated concentrations were added to 150 μL of medium (final 200 μL). Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 3 days and then the colorimetric reagent was added (20 μL for 4 h). Measurements from compound-treated or vehicle-treated cells were normalized against those from untreated cells. The half maximum cytotoxic concentration (CC50) was calculated using GraphPad Prism Version 7. Cytotoxicity assay fluorescence readings were normalized for vehicle and percent plotted against dilutions expressed as antilog.
