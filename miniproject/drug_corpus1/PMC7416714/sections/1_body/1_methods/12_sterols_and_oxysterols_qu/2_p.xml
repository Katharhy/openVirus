<p id="p0115">To a screw-capped vial sealed with a Teflon septum, 0.25 mL of plasma were added together with 500 ng of D7-lathosterol, 50 ng of D6-lanosterol, 50 ng of D7-24S-hydroxycholesterol, 50 ng of D6-25-hydroxycholesterol, 50 ng of D6-27-hydroxycholesterol, 50 ng of D7-7-ketocholesterol, 50 ng of D7-7β-hydroxycholesterol (Avanti Polar Lipids), as internal standards, 50 μl of butylated hydroxytoluene (5 g/L) and 50 μl of K3-EDTA (10 g/L) to prevent auto-oxidation. Each vial was flushed with argon for 10 min to remove air. Alkaline hydrolysis was allowed to proceed at room temperature with magnetic stirring for 60 min in the presence of ethanolic 2 M potassium hydroxide solution. After hydrolysis, the sterols were extracted twice with 5 ml hexane. The organic solvents were evaporated under a gentle stream of argon and converted into trimethylsilyl ethers with BSTFA.</p>
