<p id="p0120">Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was performed on a GC equipped with an Elite column (30 m × 0.32 mmid × 0.25 mm film; PerkinElmer, USA) and injection was performed in splitless mode and using helium (1 ml/min) as a carrier gas. The temperature program was as follows: initial temperature of 180 °C was held for 1 min, followed by a linear ramp of 20 °C/min to 270 °C, and then a linear ramp of 5 °C/min to 290 °C, which was held for 10 min. The mass spectrometer operated in the selected ion-monitoring mode. Peak integration was performed manually, and sterols were quantified from selected-ion monitoring analysis against internal standards using standard curves for the listed sterols. Additional qualifier (characteristic fragment ions) ions were used for structural identification.</p>
