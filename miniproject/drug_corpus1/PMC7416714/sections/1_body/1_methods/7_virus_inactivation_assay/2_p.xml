 <sup>5</sup> PFU of HCoV-OC43 were incubated with a concentration of 2HP-βCD:27OHC corresponding to EC
 <sub>90</sub> in the antiviral assay. The HCoV-OC43/2HP-βCD:27OHC mixture was incubated for 1 h at 33 °C. A control experiment by treating the viral suspension with the blank formulation (2HP-βCD) was also performed. After the incubation, both treated and untreated viruses were titrated to the non-inhibitory concentration of 2HP-βCD:27OHC and the residual viral infectivity was determined by plaque counting. Statistical analysis was performed using One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test. Significance was reported for p-value &lt;0.05.
