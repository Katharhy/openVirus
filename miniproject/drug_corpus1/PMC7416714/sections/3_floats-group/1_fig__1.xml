  <p>Plaque reduction and cell viability assays. The antiviral activity of 2HP-βCD:27OHC was tested against SARS-CoV-2 (A) and HCoV OC43 (B), respectively on Vero-E6 cells and MRC-5 cells. Briefly, cells were infected for 1 h and treated for 72 h with increasing concentrations of 2HP-βCD:27OHC. Viral infections were detected as described in the Material and Methods section. Cell viability experiments were performed in the same conditions as for antiviral assays, in absence of viral inoculum. The percentage infectivity inhibition (black dots) and the percentage of cell viability (white squares) were calculated by comparing treated and untreated wells. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean (SEM) of 2 independent experiments.</p>
