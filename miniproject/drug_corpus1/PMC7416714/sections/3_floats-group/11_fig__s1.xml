  <p>Evaluation of the virucidal effect of 2HP-βCD:27OHC on infectious HCoV OC43 particles: virus was pre-incubated with 2HP-βCD:27OHC or blank formulation (2HP-βCD) at a concentration corresponding to EC
   <sub>90</sub> in the virus inhibition assay, for 1h at 33 °C. The residual viral infectivity was then determined by indirect immunostaining and compared with the infectivity of the untreated control. Viral titers are expressed as PFU/ml and error bars represent the SEM of two independent duplicates.
