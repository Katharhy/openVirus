  <p>Infectivity inhibition as assessed by immunofluorescence experiments. Huh-7 (A) and MRC-5(C) cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV OC43 in the presence of 2HP-βCD:27OHC, then fixed at 48 h post-infection and stained with DAPI and specific antibodies. Panels B and D show respectively the number of SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV OC43 positive cells. On the 
   <italic>y</italic> axis, this value is expressed as % of the virus positive cells as compared to DAPI positive cells. Error bars represent the SEM of 2 independent experiments.
