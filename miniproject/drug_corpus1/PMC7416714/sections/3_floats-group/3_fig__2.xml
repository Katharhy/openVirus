  <p>Time-of-addition experiments. The step of SARS-CoV-2 (A) and HCoV OC43 (B) replicative cycle inhibited by 2HP-βCD:27OHC was investigated. Time-of-addition experiments were performed by treating cells before or after viral inoculum (named respectively “pretreatment” and “post-infection treatment” protocols). The percentage of infectivity inhibition was calculated by comparing the number of viral plaques in treated and untreated wells. Error bars represent the SEM of 2 independent experiments.</p>
