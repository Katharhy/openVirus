<p>A large portion of patient with cardiovascular comorbidities in patient with COVID-19 and a significant number of patients would have received cutaneous coronary interventions. Thrombocytopenia, prolonged thrombin time, and elevated

Also, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) was reported as a common finding from lung pathology in SARS and COVID-19 patients. The safety concerns about antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) on life-threatening bleeding complications among COVID-19 should be addressed.
