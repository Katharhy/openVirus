<p>Evidences suggested that prehospital use of aspirin use was associated a lower risk of for developing ARDS and mortality in patients with community-acquired pneumonia. All P2Y12 inhibitors reduce platelet-leukocyte aggregates and platelet-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines. Ticagrelor is unique in having the most potent anti-inflammatory properties via dual inhibition of platelet P2Y12 receptor and equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1), which contributes to inhibition of cellular adenosine uptake. The XANTHIPPE trial, as well as post hoc analyses of PLATO study showed encouraging clinical benefit of ticagrelor in the management of pneumonia by preventing the complications of sepsis and reducing lung injury.

 </sup> However, P2Y12 inhibitors could aggregate DAH according to published literatures.

 </sup> Results from large randomized controlled trials provide evidence supports a net benefit of aspirin-free strategies (reduce aspirin duration to 1-3 months) after PCI for patients at low, intermediate, and high risk for both ischemia and bleeding.

 </sup> Zhou et al suggested among patients with COVID-19 who are currently on DAPT, maintaining P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy (preferably ticagrelor) may be scientifically reasonable for patients with PCI performed â‰¥3 months. Due to the lack of convening evidence, for those with PCI performed &lt;3 months, DAPT should not be discontinued.
