<p>Remdesivir (GS-5734), adenosine analogue, is a prodrug which is metabolized to its active form GS-441524 and thereafter interferes with the action of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, resulting a in decrease in viral RNA production. Remdesivir was effective against various types of coronaviruses in cell culture and a mouse model of SARS. A preliminary data also showed that remdesivir also inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection efficiently in a human cell line.
