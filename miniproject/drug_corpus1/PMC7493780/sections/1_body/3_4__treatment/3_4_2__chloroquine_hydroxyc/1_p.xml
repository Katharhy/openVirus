 </sup> Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are rapidly protonated and concentrated in endosomes and therefore increase the pH of the endosome, which prevents cathepsin-induced priming of the viral S protein. In vitro study showed both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine decrease SARS-CoV-2 replication in cultured cells and hydroxychloroquine was more potent than chloroquine.

 </sup> In a small single-arm study of patients with confirmed COVID-19, treatment with hydroxychloroquine was associated with a significant difference in clearing of viral nasopharyngeal carriage of SARS-CoV2 within 3 to 6 days when compared with untreated controls. Moreover, combining hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin showed even more efficient virus elimination in present observation.
