 </sup> Patient with COVID-19 would be like to be treated with anti-arrhythmic drugs whether due to disease progression or existing comorbidities. Amiodarone, a widely used antiarrhythmic drug, has been shown to inhibit in vitro spreading of SARS coronavirus. In vitro study showed amiodarone inhibited SARS-CoV infection and spreading via altering the late compartments of the endocytic pathway by acting after the transit of the virus through endosomes.

 </sup> Extrapolating current evidence, administration of prophylactic intravenous amiodarone to mitigate the risk of late sudden cardiac arrest among patients infected with the novel COVID-19 had been suggested.
