 <p>The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with first presentation of atypical pneumonia, has spread rapidly from Wuhan, China, on December 12, 2019 to over 200 countries, caused 2 310 572 infected individuals and 158 691 mortalities, updated on April 19, 2020. Many studies have published timely to help global healthcare workers to understand and control the disease. Vulnerable patients with risk factors such as elderly, cardiovascular diseases (eg, hypertension, coronary disease, or cardiomyopathy), diabetes, and chronic kidney disease have worse outcomes after COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 could directly cause cardiovascular injuries such as pericarditis, myocarditis, myocardial infarction, heart failure, arrhythmias, or thromboembolic events, which urge cardiologists to be involved in the frontline to practice. Here, we provide a review of COVID-19 on cardiovascular system to assist clinical cardiologists to better understand the disease and being capable of providing comprehensive medical support.</p>
