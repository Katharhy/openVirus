<p>Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are a significant cause of human morbidity and mortality worldwide. They are a large and diverse group of viruses that are transmitted from infected to susceptible hosts by the bite of an arthropod vector, predominantly mosquitoes and ticks. More than 500 arboviruses have been identified, with approximately 150 arboviruses known to cause disease in humans [

 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> (genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>), 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic> (genus 
 <italic>Alphavirus)</italic>, 
 <italic>Peribunyaviridae</italic> (genus 
 <italic>Orthobunyavirus)</italic>, and 
 <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic> (genus 
 <italic>Phlebovirus</italic>), with members of four other families, 
 <italic>Nairoviridae</italic> (genus 
 <italic>Orthonairovirus</italic>), 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> (genus 
 <italic>Thogotovirus</italic>), 
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic> (genus 
 <italic>Vesiculovirus</italic>), and 
 <italic>Reoviridae</italic> (genus 
 <italic>Orbivirus</italic>) also contributing. Although arboviruses often cause large numbers of infections, the vast majority of cases are either asymptomatic or present as a flu-like illness. For this reason, the actual numbers of infection cases may be under-reported or misdiagnosed as other illnesses. Only a small proportion of cases progress to the more severe forms of arboviral disease that can be debilitating or potentially fatal, and usually affects young children or the elderly [
