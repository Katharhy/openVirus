Screening natural products to discover novel antiviral compounds offers a head start on the drug discovery process, and could help to expedite the development of therapeutic and prophylactic treatment for arboviral diseases. This review article will summarize and discuss several studies on plant extracts, natural compounds including semi-synthetic derivatives, and synthetic compounds that have shown to demonstrate antiviral activity against DENV, JEV, WNV, ZIKV, and CHIKV that have been published in the last decade.
