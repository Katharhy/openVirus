<p>An indigenous medicinal plant ubiquitous in the Reunion and Mauritius Islands, 
 <italic>Psiloxylon mauritianum</italic> is widely used in traditional medicine among the local people for dysentery and common infectious diseases [
 <xref rid="B113-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Given the high content of polyphenols present in 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract, a study evaluated its ability to inhibit ZIKV and DENV infections [
 <xref rid="B113-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. The data showed that 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract was able to inhibit ZIKV attachment to the host cell surface, and was able to exert antiviral activity against four DENV serotypes [
 <xref rid="B113-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. The plant extract displayed low toxicity and did not exert a genotoxic effect on human primary cell lines tested [
 <xref rid="B113-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. However, more work needs to be done to identify the active compounds responsible for antiviral activity from the plant extract and to investigate its potential to be an anti-flaviviral agent.
