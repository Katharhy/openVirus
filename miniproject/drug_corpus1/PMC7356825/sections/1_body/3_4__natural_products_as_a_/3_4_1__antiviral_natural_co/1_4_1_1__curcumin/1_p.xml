<p>Curcumin is a yellow pigment present in turmeric, a spice widely used throughout the world, and in traditional Asian and African medicine to treat a wide range of illnesses for over 4000 years. It has been shown to exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, and anti-carcinogenic effects [
