<p>Quinine is a natural compound extracted from the bark of the Cinchona tree and is an important anti-malarial agent which has been used to treat malaria from as early as the 1600s [

 <xref rid="B109-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Drug repurposing is a strategy which uses established drugs to treat diseases that lack specific therapeutic treatments as it is a faster and more cost-effective approach compared to de novo drug discovery and development [
 <xref rid="B133-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. Of the four drugs examined, quinine markedly decreased DENV replication by inhibiting DENV RNA replication, protein synthesis, and virus production by targeting host factors; however, its specific antiviral mechanism could not be determined [
 <xref rid="B109-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. As quinine is reported to act on host cells rather than directly upon the virion, resistance to the compound could be minimized [
