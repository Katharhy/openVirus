<p>Natural compounds are expected to have good tolerability and minimal side effects, which are desirable traits for therapeutic and prophylactic treatment. In addition to vaccine development, drugs for prophylaxis, post-exposure prophylaxis, and treatment should be developed to prevent and mitigate the severity of arboviral diseases. As natural products provide a rich source of chemical diversity and pharmacological activities, it could potentially limit antiviral resistance, and also offer flexibility of use in other treatments including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and diabetes [

With an abundance of natural products to screen for new antiviral compounds, it is highly optimistic that natural products will continue to play an important role in contributing to antiviral drug development, and in reducing the infection burden that impacts millions globally.
