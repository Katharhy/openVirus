<p>To address the current lack of antivirals against arboviruses, great efforts to search for potential antiviral compounds against arboviruses have been made by applying various approaches, from drug repurposing to the screening of different bioactive compound libraries, as well as natural products. In particular, polyphenols—which are naturally occurring compounds present in a wide array of fruits, vegetables, and plant parts (roots, bark, leaves and flowers)—have increasingly gained medicinal interest as they have shown to possess numerous health benefits and broad-spectrum antiviral activities in various studies. Screening natural products to discover novel antivirals offer a more time-efficient and economical alternative to traditional drug discovery processes that involve developing drug candidates from scratch, which can be inefficient and costly. In addition, the chemical structures of the novel compounds identified to exhibit antiviral activity could be utilized as a scaffold for designing semi-synthetic or synthetic drug derivatives so as to optimise its stability, or to enhance its antiviral potency. By developing antivirals against arboviruses, therapeutic treatment can be made available to infected patients to accelerate viral clearance and to reduce disease severity [

Other applications for anti-arboviral drug development include prophylactic or early post-exposure prophylactic treatment for people living in arbovirus endemic areas where vaccines against the arboviruses are not yet available, or for travellers visiting countries with ongoing outbreaks [
