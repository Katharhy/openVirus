<p>Four main types of JE vaccines are currently in use, but the live attenuated SA14-14-2 vaccine is the most widely used vaccine in endemic countries, according to the WHO [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. SA14-14-2 is administered in a two-dose regimen, and it appears to be safe and protective as no vaccine-induced severe effects have been observed [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Still, there is a risk of reversion of the live attenuated virus to virulence. Hence, an urgent need for a safe and effective cure for JEV infection and the development of a safer, single-dose vaccine is necessary as JEV continues to expand its activity into new territories.
