<p>Symptoms of ZIKV infection resembles that of dengue fever, which includes fever, headache, rashes, and joint and muscle pain. Although infections are usually mild or asymptomatic, neurological disorders have been associated with ZIKV infections. An increased occurrence of congenital microcephaly resulting from abnormal brain development, as well as Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) and acute myelitis in adults were reported in ZIKV outbreak areas [

 <xref rid="B52-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-25-02796" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. There is currently no specific antiviral treatment and vaccine to protect against the devastating consequences of ZIKV infection. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of therapeutic and prophylactic treatment for the management of ZIKV infection, especially in pregnant women and at-risk groups who live in ZIKV-endemic regions.
