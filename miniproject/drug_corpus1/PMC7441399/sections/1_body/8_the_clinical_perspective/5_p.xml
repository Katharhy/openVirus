<p id="Par68">Fatigue has been commonly reported after many viral infections, most notably with Epstein-Barr virus

 </sup>, and is evident in many non-PD cases with COVID-19
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">159</xref>
 </sup>. Fatigue was also common in the series of PD cases reported
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>
 </sup> and is an important contributor of quality of life
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">160</xref>

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">161</xref>
 </sup>, and in some cases of COVID-19 with PD, myalgia can be severe and involve muscles of the back. If these observations are confirmed in larger cohorts of PD patients with COVID-19, specific anti-fatigue/myalgia measures may need to be implemented
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">160</xref>
 </sup>. Consideration for the use of amantadine-like drugs may be particularly relevant given their putative antiviral effects
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">162</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">163</xref>
