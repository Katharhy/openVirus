  <title>Possible entry routes for SARS-CoV-2 into central nervous system and potential intracellular consequences.</title>
  <p>There is evidence for SARS-CoV-2 invasion of vasculature in the brain, but little evidence for SARS-CoV-2 in brain parenchyma at this time: this issue will become clearer with results from ongoing autopsy studies. Whether or not the virus is present in neurons or astrocytes, there may be multiple consequences for brain cells, in part through intracellular responses to inflammation that could lead to protein misfolding, a feature of neurodegenerative disorders.</p>
