<p>With no cure or vaccine developed yet for this highly transmissible viral infection in humans, the risk of community spread is increasing worldwide. Globally, SARS‐CoV‐2 disease is severe among the geriatric population, as 95% of the deaths have been reported in individuals above 60 years. Additionally, 8 out of 10 deaths occur in individuals with at least one underlying co‐morbid condition, such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension and diabetes.

 </xref> There is an impending need to formulate specific guidelines/protocols for managing the older adults in the backdrop of COVID‐19, considering the physiological, psychological and treatment needs of geriatric patients, which are unique. This paper aims to develop a stepwise protocol for the dental management of geriatric patients.
