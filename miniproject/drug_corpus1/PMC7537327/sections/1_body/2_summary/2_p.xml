<p>The outbreak of the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic is a global concern that poses a severe threat to human health, well‐being and survival. The SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic has resulted in a higher mortality rate among the elder/geriatric age group. Addressing the unique needs of geriatric patients who present with co‐morbid conditions is critical to reducing mortality and preventing the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. In this paper, we have proposed generic protocols and stepwise guidelines for the effective management of geriatric patients in a dental setting. Universal guidelines to specifically meet the challenges of geriatric patients in the dental setting ensure the health of vulnerable sections of the society and the well‐being of the community at large.</p>
