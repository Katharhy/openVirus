<p>Apart from the signs and symptoms mentioned above, geriatric patients might present with severe difficulty in breathing, bluish lips, confused state of mind, persistent pressure on the chest and inability to stay awake. There have been reports of SARS‐CoV‐2 patients presenting with myalgia, encephalopathy, encephalitis, necrotising haemorrhagic encephalopathy, stroke, epileptic seizures, rhabdomyolysis and Guillain‐Barre syndrome.

 </xref> observed that, among patients who experienced neurological symptoms, 36% were mostly older adults. Additionally, patients with severe infection presented with neurologic manifestations in the form of acute cerebrovascular diseases, impaired consciousness and skeletal muscle injury. The onset of neurological symptoms is due to direct infection of the brain stem or as a result of the strong activation of the immune system. SARS‐CoV‐2 possibly targets the central nervous system (CNS) through the olfactory bulb and infecting the olfactory neurons, which enables the virus to spread from the respiratory tract to the brain. The infection then spreads to other parts of the brain by a synapse‐connected route and trans‐synaptic transfer. This infects the Pre‐Botzinger complex in the brainstem, the respiratory centre of the brain controlling the lungs, shutting down breathing and causing potential death.

 </xref> There have been reports which state that SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can also cause inflammation of the brain and indirectly cause neurological damage and neurodegenerative changes such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
