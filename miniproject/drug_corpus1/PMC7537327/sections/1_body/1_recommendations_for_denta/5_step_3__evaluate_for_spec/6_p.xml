<p>In light of these developments, it is prudent to screen all the patients for SARS‐CoV‐2. If any of the signs and symptoms are noted, the dental team must refrain from carrying out any dental treatment, unless it is an emergency. While the dentist has to record a detailed clinical history, noting the telltale signs and symptoms associated with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, it is also important to note that the mere presence of these manifestations may not confirm that the patient is COVID‐19 positive. Some of these may present as co‐morbidities related to old age, malnourishment, or other chronic ailments in multiple organs. However, the sudden onset of these clinical manifestations, particularly among the geriatric population, may provide necessary pointers to test for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. It could pose a severe risk of community transmission or prove fatal in other geriatric patients if SARS‐CoV‐2 is not diagnosed early. Further investigations by medical practitioners in the form of computerised tomography imaging and reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) tests, according to WHO (2020a) standards, need to be performed to confirm the presence COVID 19. Dentists should be aware that in geriatric patients infected with SARS‐CoV‐2, there is an increased risk of stroke, heart attack, coagulation disorders, lung complications and multiple organ dysfunction.
