 </xref> it was reported that 85.6% of COVID‐19 patients presented with olfactory and gustatory dysfunction, before the appearance of other symptoms. These symptoms generally appeared between 2 and 14 days after exposure to the virus. Around 80% of infected patients had mild symptoms and recovered from the disease without requiring hospital treatment. One in five people developed serious illness necessitating medical assistance. The majority of patients who required hospitalisation were older adults. Thus, it is crucial to record even the mildest symptoms during clinical examination and record temperature and travel history.
