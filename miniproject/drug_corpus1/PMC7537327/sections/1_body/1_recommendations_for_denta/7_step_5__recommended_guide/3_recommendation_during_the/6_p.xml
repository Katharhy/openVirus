<p>Studies have shown that sonic and ultrasonic scalers have a higher particle transmission incidence, followed by air polishing, air/water syringes and high‐speed handpieces.

 </xref> reported that ultrasonic instrumentation transmits nearly 100 000 microbes per cubic foot with aerosolisation of up to six feet. The use of ultrasonic scalers is best avoided. Instead, hand scalers/curettes should be employed for periodontal treatment. High‐speed handpieces for cavity and tooth preparation, and 3‐way syringes, are discouraged to reduce the risk of contamination of air and water tubes within the dental units and to prevent cross‐infection. A dentist should perform an atraumatic restorative technique (ART) procedure using hand instruments instead of conventional rotary instruments to avoid generating aerosol. Dentists can also explore alternative means for removing decay on teeth employing chemico‐mechanical means like CariSolv. Apart from eliminating the generation of aerosol or aspiration of viral particles, this technique ensures that only the carious dentine is removed without removing sound dentine.

 </xref> If root canal treatment (RCT) has to be performed, manual preparation of the root canal is preferred over rotary techniques. To reduce the older adults’ visits to the clinic, it may be worth considering a single visit RCT.
