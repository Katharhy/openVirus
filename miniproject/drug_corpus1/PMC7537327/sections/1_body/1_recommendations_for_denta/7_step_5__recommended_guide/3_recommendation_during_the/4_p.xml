<p>Dentists have to incorporate necessary modifications in their operatory to minimise aerosol production and prevent disease transmission from emitted particles. A critical step to reduce the salivary viral load is by enforcing the practice of preprocedural rinse with Povidone‐Iodine (PVP‐I) in patients.

 </xref> Studies have shown that SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV were highly susceptible to PVP‐I mouth rinse. Therefore, preprocedural mouth rinses with 0.2% povidone‐iodine might reduce the load of SARS‐CoV‐2 in saliva.

 </xref> Alternatively, the use of 0.5%‐1% hydrogen peroxide mouth rinses has demonstrated non‐specific virucidal activity against coronaviruses. However, one has to use hydrogen peroxide judiciously in geriatric patients. Hydrogen peroxide is a highly caustic and a reactive substance, which can damage oral soft tissues when used in high concentrations and for a prolonged duration.
