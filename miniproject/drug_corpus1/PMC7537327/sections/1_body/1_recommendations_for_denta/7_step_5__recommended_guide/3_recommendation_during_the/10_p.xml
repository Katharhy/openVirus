<p>Rational and appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE), including head cap and mouth masks with a timely change in attitude, perception and behavioural change among healthcare workers, is the key to reducing the impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. The PPE advocated for airborne agents (ie aerosol‐transmissible) is different from the PPE used to prevent transmission by large droplets or direct contact. For the dentist and staff working in areas of direct contact with aerosols, recommended PPEs include R/P95, N/R/P99 or N/R/P100 filtering facepiece respirator; an air‐purifying elastomeric (eg half‐face or full‐face) respirator with appropriate filters or cartridges; powered air‐purifying respirator (PAPR) with high‐efficiency particulate arrestance (HEPA) filter; or supplied‐air respirator (SAR).
