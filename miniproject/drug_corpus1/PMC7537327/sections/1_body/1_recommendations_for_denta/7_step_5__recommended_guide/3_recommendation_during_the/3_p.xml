<p>Aerosol generation, which is a common occurrence in the dental clinic, increases the vulnerability to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Airborne transmission facilitates microbes’ viability in the air for more extended periods and their transmission over distances greater than 1 m.

 </xref> reported that viral loads in nasopharyngeal swabs from a group of patients with severe COVID‐19 were 60 times higher than the viral loads among patients with a mild form of the disease. If such patients, with viral particles confined to the nasopharynx, were to be treated in a dental setting, and the procedure involved the generation of aerosols, other people would have increased susceptibility due to aerosol production.
