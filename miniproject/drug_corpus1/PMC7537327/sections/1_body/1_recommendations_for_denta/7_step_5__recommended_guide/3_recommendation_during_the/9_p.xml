<p>Geriatric individuals who are fully or partially edentulous may have a removable or fixed intraoral prosthesis. Removing and maintaining the hygiene of these prostheses, in general, improves the well‚Äêbeing of the patient. Unfortunately, institutionalised elderly often neglect oral care because of frailty, which impacts oral health. For prosthetic procedures, it is advised to evaluate the urgency of the treatment before scheduling an appointment. If the patient's existing denture is broken or a fixed prosthesis is dislodged, it should be disinfected before the dentist or the technician handles it. It is necessary to plan a treatment that requires fewest appointments. It is advisable to prepare for an immediate denture if the extraction of teeth is planned. One could even explore the possibility of immediate implant placement with temporisation after removal of the tooth on the same day.</p>
