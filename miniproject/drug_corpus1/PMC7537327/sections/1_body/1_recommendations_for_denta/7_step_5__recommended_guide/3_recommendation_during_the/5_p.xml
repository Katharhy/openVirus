<p>It is necessary to minimise intraoral imaging as patients tend to elicit a gag or cough reflex. When intraoral imaging is mandated, sensors should have a double barrier to prevent perforation and cross‐contamination.

 </xref> Latex finger cots used in conjunction with the standard plastic sheaths covering direct digital radiography (DDR) sensors may effectively prevent cross‐contamination than plastic sheaths alone. However, dentists are recommended to use extraoral imaging, such as panoramic radiography or cone‐beam computed tomography (CBCT). It is also necessary to disinfect the radiograph holders and machine heads after each patient.
