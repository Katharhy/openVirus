<p>Geriatric patients frequently arrive with an assistant/helper. It is advisable to have only the patient enter the clinical operating area. However, if the entry of the assistant/helper cannot be avoided, this person has to be thoroughly screened for COVID‐19 signs and symptoms before entering. Patients with special needs requiring wheelchairs and crutches have to be sanitised before entering the dental operatory.</p>
