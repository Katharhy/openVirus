<p>Dentists and dental auxiliary personnel must be trained to wear and remove the PPEs appropriately to prevent the spread of infection. It is also essential to change the mask when soiled or worn.

 </xref> It is critical to avoid touching the mask, or any inanimate objects with bare hands, as the transmission of the COVID‐19 virus can occur either by direct contact with an infected person or indirect contact with objects in the immediate environment used by the infected person. Utmost precaution must be taken not to touch the eye and nose when working in the dental clinic and to use a face shield and head cap while interacting with patients. The patient waiting area, screening zone, door and knob of the entrance must be frequently cleaned with an alcohol‐based spray.
