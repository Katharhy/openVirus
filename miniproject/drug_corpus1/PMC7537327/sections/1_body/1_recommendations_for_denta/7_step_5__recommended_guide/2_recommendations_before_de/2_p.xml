There is an agreement among the health professionals that the transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 is mainly through large respiratory droplets and secretions, with a droplet particle size ranging from &gt;5 to 10 μm in diameter. Particles &lt; 5 μm in diameter, are referred to as the droplet nuclei. Droplets are often heavy enough that they do not travel very far and fall from the air after moving up to six feet.
