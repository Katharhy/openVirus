<p>It is best to assign selected days/timings for geriatric patients in a week to reduce the waiting time and reduce their contact with other patients. Before examining the patient, the dental assistants have to record the patient's body temperature, using a non‐contact forehead thermometer, or with cameras having infrared thermal sensors. Patients having fever with or without accompanying respiratory disease symptoms should have their elective dental care deferred for at least 2 weeks.</p>
