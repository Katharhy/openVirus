<p>It is well‚Äêknown that ageing influences the flow rate and composition of saliva, and alters the taste sensation by affecting the ionic channels and receptors of the gustatory cells.

 </xref> Reduced salivary flow impairs saliva's flushing action and increases the risk of plaque formation. This predisposes the geriatric patients to the risk of bacterial and viral infection. Besides the reduced salivary rate associated with the ageing adult population, saliva has a lower protein and salivary immunoglobulin content.

 </xref> Thus, it is necessary to assess the salivary flow rate among older adults, which is reduced due to medications, hormonal changes and depression.
