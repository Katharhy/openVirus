<p>The age‚Äêassociated physiologic changes in the oral cavity that predispose geriatric patients to viral infections include thinning epithelium, enabling easier passage of viral particles into the host cells. The healing capacity of oral tissues is also impaired due to reduced collagen turnover rate, loss of elastin and adipose tissue in the submucosa, an increase in the fibrous stroma and degenerative changes in the collagen. The reduced epithelial thickness contributes to the onset of burning sensations, ulceration and bleeding from gums among geriatric patients. Oral care specialists have to be aware of the condition of the oral epithelium before preparing the patient for preprocedural mouth rinses with high alcohol content.</p>
