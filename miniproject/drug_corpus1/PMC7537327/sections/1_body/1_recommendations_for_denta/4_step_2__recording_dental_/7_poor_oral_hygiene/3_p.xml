<p>It has been demonstrated that angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors are the primary sites for SARS‐CoV‐2 entry into the host cells. The spike (S) protein of SARS‐CoV‐2 recognises the host cell receptors and fuses with the cell membranes before gaining admission in oral mucosa, tongue and salivary glands.

 </xref> Individuals infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 have higher viral loads in the saliva, oropharynx, nasal passages and upper respiratory tract.

 </xref> It is found that the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio at an early stage of COVID‐19 predicts patients who are likely to develop critical illness.

 </xref> Patients in ICU exhibit an exceptionally high bacterial load. Thus, it is obligatory to check the modifiable risk factors such as diet, poor oral hygiene and overall glycemic control. The oral cavity's viral load should be lowered by adopting effective oral and throat hygiene, and by seeking professional dental care.
