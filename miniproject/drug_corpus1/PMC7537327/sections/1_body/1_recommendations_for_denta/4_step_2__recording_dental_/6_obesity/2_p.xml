<p>Obesity, identified as one of the significant epidemics, has been identified as a novel and independent risk factor of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

 </xref> Obesity is known to lower immunity and cause severe impairment of organ and tissue function. It creates multiple systemic complications involving the heart, type‐2 diabetes, cancers, osteoarthritis and psychological disturbance.

 </xref> Most of the complications linked to obesity are due to increased oxidative stress and the release of adipokines. Obesity interferes with the respiratory function by decreasing the lung volume, particularly the expiratory reserve volume and functional residual capacity.

 </xref> The weak respiratory movements due to elevation of intra‐abdominal and pleural pressures will compromise breathing and result in the shortness of breath, further precipitating breathing complications in SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. The baseline inflammatory state in obese patients also presents a barrier to the induction of a robust antiviral response. Since the local innate and adaptive immune responses are blunted, viral spread is severe in the obese host.
