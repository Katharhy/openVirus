<p>However, for geriatric patients who test positive for COVID‐19, emergency treatment could be provided, even if they are in the acute phase of the disease after following the guidelines highlighted in Step 5. It is crucial to amend the protocol for patients residing in assisted institutions/nursing homes who might find it difficult to visit the dental office. This amendment might be inevitable in some cases if these areas have been sealed off as a containment zone or due to the non‐availability of healthcare workers/staff to bring them to the dental office. Under these circumstances, community dental health coordinators should consider arranging a mobile dental infrastructure at their disposal to provide on‐site treatment, taking necessary precautions. This approach is undoubtedly advantageous as it assures optimal geriatric dental care to non‐ambulatory patients who are relatively safe in their residence and minimises community transmission among the inmates at the institution. It is recommended that appropriate PPE be worn and the mobile dental unit be sanitised before and after the procedure.</p>
