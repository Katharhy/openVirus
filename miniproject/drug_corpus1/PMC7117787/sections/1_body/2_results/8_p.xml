<p>An important question about COVID-19, which has raised much concern among health care providers, health policy makers and the general population, is the degree of transmissibility or contagiousness of the coronavirus (infectivity). In general, epidemiologists use mathematical formulas with clear and acceptable assumptions to calculate the infectivity index. For this purpose, "basic reproduction number" termed R
 <sub>0</sub> is used, and it indicates the expected number of cases directly infected by one contagious case in a population that everyone is supposed to be susceptible. For viral pathogens in MERS and SARS epidemics, the index was approximated to be 2, indicating that each infected person could infect two people on average in an effective contact. However, for COVID-19, the calculated value in a study was slightly higher and the index value based on data calculated in Wuhan, China was 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9) (

 <sub>0</sub> has been reported with different values, the lowest of which corresponds to the WHO report of 1.95 (1.4-2.5) (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). A review study estimated an average R
 <sub>0</sub> for COVID-19 of 3.28 with a median of 2.79 and an IQR of 1.16 (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). As an explanation for variety of the calculated indices is that different calculation methods were used and calculations were done at different times of epidemics.
