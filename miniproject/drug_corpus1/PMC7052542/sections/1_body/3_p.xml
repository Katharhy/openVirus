<p>In the present study, we report detailed virological analyses in a range of clinical specimens from 180 Indonesian patients with laboratory-confirmed H5N1 infection, representing the first comprehensively studied series of human clade 2.1 H5N1 infections and the largest cohort of human H5N1 infections overall. In addition to confirming that high nasopharyngeal viral loads are associated with poor clinical outcome, the virus was more commonly detected in blood, and early antiviral responses to treatment with oseltamivir appeared less pronounced when compared to Vietnamese H5N1 clade 1â€“infected patients. Strikingly, the case fatality rate in Indonesia increased over time and was associated with increasing viral loads and the emergence of mutations in the matrix protein that confers adamantane resistance. These observations suggest that differences in virulence and other viral characteristics may contribute to the exceptionally high mortality related to human clade 2.1 H5N1 infections in Indonesia.</p>
