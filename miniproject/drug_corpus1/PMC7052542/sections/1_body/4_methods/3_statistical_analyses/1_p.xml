 <sup>2</sup> or Fisher exact test was used to compare categorical variables, and the Mann-Whitney test was used for group comparisons of continuous variables. Viral RNA loads were analyzed after log transformation. For statistical purposes, the lower detection limit of the assay (10 cDNA copies/mL) was used for correlation analyses in case no viral RNA could be detected. Correlations between variables were calculated using the Spearman rank correlation test. All statistical analyses were done using SPSS v14.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) or Graphpad Prism 7.02 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). A
