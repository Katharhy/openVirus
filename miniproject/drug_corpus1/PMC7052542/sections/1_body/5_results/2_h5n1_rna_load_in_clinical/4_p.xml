<p>Viral RNA was also detected in 85 of 92 lower respiratory tract specimens, of which all except 4 were collected from fatal cases (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). In 20 of 25 (80%) patients, viral RNA could be detected in rectal swabs or feces. Detection rates and viral loads were similar between fatal and surviving cases, but the number of surviving cases from whom specimens were available was small (n = 4). In available serum or blood specimens, viral RNA was detected in 22 of 26 (85%) patients, with similar detection rates observed in fatal and surviving cases (14 of 16 [88%] and 8 of 10 [80%] patients, respectively). Viral RNA levels in blood were higher in fatal cases, but this difference did not reach statistical significance (median, 3.7 log cDNA copies/mL [range, 2.9–4.4] vs 3.2 [range 2.5–3.9], respectively;
