<p>Viral RNA was detected in 144 of 157 pharyngeal and 142 of 163 nasal specimens obtained at admission, with significantly higher H5N1 RNA levels observed in throat swabs than in nasal swabs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). To estimate the natural course of viral RNA load during human H5N1 infection, viral loads in initial nasal and pharyngeal specimens obtained from individual patients prior to initiation of treatment were plotted against the days since reported onset of symptoms at the time of sample collection (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). This showed that H5N1 RNA could be detected up to 19 days after onset of symptoms with no clear trend toward lower viral RNA levels in specimens collected later during the course of infection.
