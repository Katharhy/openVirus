<p>Sequence analyses of the M2 gene in admission specimens from 153 patients revealed the presence of mutations that confer resistance to adamantanes in 131 (85.6%) patients. The mutations identified were Val27Ala (n = 109), Val27Thr (n = 1), Ser31Asn (n = 7), Val27Ala + Ser31Asn (n = 3), Val27Ala + Ser31Gly (n = 7), and Leu26Ile + Ser31Asn (n = 4). M2 resistance mutations were detected more frequently in fatal cases compared to survivors (117/132 [89%] vs 14/21 [67%], respectively; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .015). Over time, the prevalence of M2 resistance mutations increased gradually from 37.5% in 2005 to 95% in 2009 and to 100% during subsequent years (

 <italic>P</italic> = .0019). As a result, admission viral RNA loads in throat specimens from patients who harbored virus with M2 resistance mutations were higher than those from patients infected with virus without these mutations (median, 5.3 log cDNA copies/mL vs 4.3 log cDNA copies/mL;
