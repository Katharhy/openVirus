<p>Treatment with oseltamivir had a statistically significant impact on clinical outcome: 22 of 123 patients (18%) who received treatment survived vs none of the remaining 57 untreated patients (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The median duration from onset of illness to initiation of treatment was 7 days (range, 0–18), with no statistically significant differences between surviving and fatal cases (median, 6 days [range 0–18] vs 7 days [range 0–14], respectively; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .15). However, the survival rate was significantly higher in patients treated earlier than the median of 7 days compared to those treated on day 7 or later (16/51 [31%] vs 11/71 [15%], respectively; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .037). This difference in survival was more pronounced when patients treated on or before 4 days after illness onset were compared to those treated later (8/16 [50%] vs 19/106 [18%], respectively; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .004).
