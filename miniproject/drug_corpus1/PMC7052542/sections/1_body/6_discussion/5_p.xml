<p>Changes in mortality were observed during the study period, increasing from 69% overall to 100% in 2012 and beyond. These changes in mortality over time correlated with increasing admission viral loads and with an increasing prevalence of viruses that contain adamantane resistanceâ€“conferring M2 mutations during the same period. In turn, admission viral loads were higher in the presence of M2 mutations.</p>
