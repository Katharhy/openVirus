<p>In summary, our study of a large series of H5N1-infected Indonesian patients confirms the association between high upper respiratory viral loads and fatal outcome and provides information to explain the exceptionally high mortality related to H5N1 disease in Indonesia, including a high proportion of patients with viremia, potential suboptimal antiviral efficacy of oseltamivir, and an increasing virulence of circulating viruses, possibly associated with the emergence of M2 mutations. These observations deserve consideration in future further research efforts in human infections with H5N1 and other avian influenza viruses.</p>
