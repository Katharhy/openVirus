<p>Treatment with oseltamivir was associated with a survival benefit. This benefit was greater when treatment was started earlier in the course of infection, confirming earlier observations and emphasizing the need for early recognition and diagnosis [

Although differences in survival among countries may be difficult to interpret in view of possible differences in healthcare access and medical practices among H5N1-affected regions, reported survival in oseltamivir-treated patients infected by clade 1 H5N1 viruses is substantially higher than in our clade 2.1-infected patients (52.5% vs 18%), despite late treatment initiation in both [

In addition, we looked for a range of other neuraminidase mutations reportedly associated with reduced oseltamivir susceptibility in recently published whole-genome, next-generation sequencing data that we generated from 44 Indonesian patients to study viral quasispecies evolution during human infection (
