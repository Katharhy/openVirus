<p>Time from illness onset to presentation of patients and initiation of treatment remained similar until 2012 but appeared longer thereafter, which may have contributed to the high mortality during that period. However, the increasing viral loads during the same period remain striking given that no correlation between viral RNA load and illness duration was observed overall (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). In addition to supporting an important role of viral load in determining outcome, these observations suggest an increasing virulence of circulating H5N1 viruses over time, possibly associated with the presence of M2 substitutions. Similar to observations in seasonal human influenza viruses [

 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], the increasing prevalence of adamantane resistance M2 mutations in Indonesian H5N1 viruses occurred in the absence of apparent widespread use of amantadine, neither in poultry nor in humans. This suggests that the presence of these mutations is associated with a natural fitness advantage, either indirectly through a genetic “hitchhiking” effect in association with changes elsewhere in the viral genome or directly through potential advantageous effects on the biological function of the M2 protein. The latter direct biological role of observed M2 mutations in enhancing virulence cannot be excluded and deserves further study. In murine experiments, mortality in mice infected with isogenic recombinant H1N1 viruses that harbored amantadine resistance mutations (Val27Ala, Ser31Gly, or both) was higher than in mice infected with wild-type H1N1 viruses [

 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Furthermore, the Val27Ala change in M2, representing the most prevalent mutation observed in our patients, has been associated with increased M2 activity in avian influenza A/H7N1 viruses, which suggests that this particular substitution may have functional significance [
