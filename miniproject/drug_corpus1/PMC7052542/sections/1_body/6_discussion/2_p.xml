<p>As shown previously in small case series of patients infected with clade 1 H5N1 viruses, viral RNA could be detected in respiratory specimens at high levels for more than 2 weeks after illness onset, indicating prolonged virus replication and shedding during the course of the disease [

 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">â€“13</xref>]. Furthermore, a fatal outcome was not only associated with higher viral loads in the throat, as has been reported previously, but also in nasal specimens. The limited number of patients investigated in previous series may explain why the latter was not observed before. The detection rates of viral RNA in gastrointestinal specimens and particularly in blood were higher in Indonesian patients than previously reported in Vietnamese H5N1-infected patients (gastrointestinal, 80% vs 71% and blood, 85% vs 56%, respectively) [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It remains unclear whether the detection of viral RNA in these specimens reflects infectious virus since no attempts were made to isolate virus due to sample volume restrictions. However, isolation of infectious virus from feces and blood during human H5N1 infections has previously been reported [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Hence, although numbers of patients in this and previous series were small, it is tempting to speculate that higher rates of viremia in our patients and consequent increased risk of systemic spread of clade 2.1 viruses may have contributed to the higher mortality among Indonesian patients.
