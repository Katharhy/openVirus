<p>The above observations argue against the emergence of known resistance mutations to explain the apparent limited benefit of oseltamivir treatment in Indonesian patients. However, in vitro susceptibility testing of H5N1 viruses has shown that clade 2.1 viruses are intrinsically up to 30-fold less susceptible to oseltamivir than clade 1 viruses [

 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Along the same lines, it cannot be excluded that similar differences in drug susceptibility between clade 1 and clade 2.1 H5N1 viruses are associated with differences in antiviral responses and consequently clinical benefit. In a small case series of Vietnamese H5N1 clade 1–infected patients, rapid reductions in viral RNA to undetectable levels, mostly within 2 days of treatment, were observed in surviving patients, while viral RNA remained detectable at high levels in fatal cases and was associated with the emergence of resistance [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These observations appear to contrast with our findings in Indonesian patients that show that, despite an absence of oseltamivir resistance mutations, viral RNA was still detectable after 2 days of treatment in 42 of 44 patients and remained detectable throughout the course of treatment in the vast majority of patients who were followed. Although the numbers of evaluated patients are limited, this might be explained by the aforementioned differences in oseltamivir susceptibility.
