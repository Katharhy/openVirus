<p>The overall mortality related to reported human infections is high (53%), with remarkable differences among countries and regions, ranging from 33% in Egypt to as high as 84% in Indonesia, where fewer than one-quarter of all reported cases but more than one-third of all deaths occurred [
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These regional differences in outcome might be related to differences in access to healthcare and clinical management among countries, differences in virulence of circulating viruses, or both. The relatively low mortality in Egypt compared to south and southeast Asian countries, where the case fatality rate is more than twice as high (69%), may, in part, be attributable to earlier identification, hospitalization, and antiviral treatment of patients in Egypt [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, the timing of hospitalization and treatment cannot readily explain the mortality differences among Asian countries. For example, despite similarly late treatment of patients in Vietnam and Indonesia (median, 6 days after illness onset), reported mortality in Vietnam is substantially lower (50% in Vietnam vs 84% in Indonesia) [

 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although genetically distinct H5N1 virus lineages circulate in different regions and countries, insights into possible differences in virulence or other viral characteristics that could impact clinical outcome are very limited. Studies that relate virological determinants to clinical outcome are largely limited to observations in small numbers of Vietnamese and Cambodian patients infected by clade 1 H5N1 viruses. These studies showed that a fatal outcome is associated with high pharyngeal viral loads, the presence of viremia, and a poor response to oseltamivir treatment due to antiviral resistance [
