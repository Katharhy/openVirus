<p>Sporadic transmission to humans occurs during poultry outbreaks. Since 2003, 860 human H5N1 infections have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO), with nearly two-thirds of cases occurring in Egypt and Indonesia. While the number of reported human infections has declined substantially in recent years despite continued circulation in birds, underreporting due to reduced awareness and limited diagnostic capacity in affected African and Asian countries cannot be excluded.</p>
