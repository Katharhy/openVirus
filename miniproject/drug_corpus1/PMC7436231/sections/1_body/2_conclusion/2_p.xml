<p>Respiratory viruses such as SARS‐CoV‐2 are well‐characterized to cause severe disorders and pneumonia, particularly in individuals with serious medical comorbidities and aged populations. Additionally, respiratory virus infection could usually lead to enhanced susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections. However, the mechanisms responsible for bacterial‐SARS‐CoV‐2 co‐infection require further study. It has been noted that an elicited adaptive immune reaction toward viral infection fails the reaction of the host innate immunity against bacterial infection. This situation can explain why bacterial co‐infections occur when the virus starts to be eradicated from the lungs of patients with COVID‐19. This is accompanied by a shift in phagocytic activity of lung cells that mediate basal levels of innate protection via phagocytosis and pro‐inflammatory cytokines formation to cells better attuned to antigen presentation and stimulation of adaptive immune reactions. Additionally, recently it has been found the microbiome diversity shapes our immune system. In line with this, the depletion of the gut microbiome hinders the immune system's ability to create a humoral response against viruses like the flu virus. However, this novel paradigm ultimately allows the development of new immune intervention approaches for the prevention and management of viral‐bacterial co‐infections in COVID‐19 patients. The COVID‐19 pandemic reinforces the importance of preventative measures such as vaccination and antimicrobial treatments in maintaining human health.</p>
