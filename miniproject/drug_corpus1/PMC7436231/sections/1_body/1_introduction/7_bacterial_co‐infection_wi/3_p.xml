 </xref> The specific source and nature of these infections have not yet been fully investigated; however, there is evidence indicating that multidrug‐resistant bacteria are among those microbes responsible for the development of these secondary infections. In one study, five cases (5.1%) with bacterial co‐infections including 
 <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> were found among 99 patients,
