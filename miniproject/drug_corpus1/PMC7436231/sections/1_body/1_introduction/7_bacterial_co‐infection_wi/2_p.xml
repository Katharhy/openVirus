<p>Although numerous studies performed on viral and bacterial co‐infections, little information exists about human coronaviruses. In addition to seasonal influenza, it has been reported corona pathogens of pneumonia include coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, SARS, MERS, and SARS‐CoV‐2. These viruses can cause co‐infection in the setting of community‐acquired bacterial pneumonia.
