<p>Some patients infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 showed the increased levels of biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines related to co‐infection by bacteria, caused by dysregulation in the immune system.

 </xref> The management of the severe form of SARS‐CoV‐2 is similar to most viral pneumonia‐causing respiratory failure. In a study carried out by Bordi et al.,

 </xref> they detected 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> in five patients (4.0%), while only one patient was infected with 
 <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> and 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (0.8%), and mixed infections were also observed in a small number of cases. They found the importance of using a broad‐spectrum molecular diagnostic panel for rapid detection of the most common respiratory pathogens to improve evaluation and clinical management of patients with a respiratory syndrome consistent with COVID‐19.
