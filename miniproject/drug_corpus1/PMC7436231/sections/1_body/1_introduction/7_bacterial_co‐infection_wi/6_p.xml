<p>Despite the proven significance of co‐infections in the severity of respiratory diseases, these kinds of infections during large outbreaks of respiratory infections are underdetermined.

 </xref> For the precise diagnosis and evaluation of co‐infections during the COVID‐19 pandemic, samples must be taken longitudinally throughout the disease course via techniques independent of the culture for identifying mixed infections such as whole‐genome metagenomics (WGMs).

 </xref> Such works offer valuable monitoring findings on co‐infection pathogens and drug‐resistance infections resulting in improved antibiotic prescribing options.

 </xref> have reported fungal and bacterial co‐infections in patients with COVID‐19. COVID‐19 patients are hospitalized on invasive mechanical ventilation for a long time, leading to higher chances of using a ventilator and hospital‐acquired infections.

 </xref> Thus, the rapid diagnosis of a broad range of potential pathogens and antimicrobial resistances for subsequent monitoring of co‐infection would be crucial. The metagenome of COVID‐19 patients has shown that Prevotella is a key player in immune response in a Chinese study,
