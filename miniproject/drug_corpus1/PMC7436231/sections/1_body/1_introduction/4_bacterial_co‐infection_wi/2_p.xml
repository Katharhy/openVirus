<p>Viral pneumonia and lower respiratory tract infections are well characterized in adult patients, including those diagnosed with severe forms of viral infection.

 </xref> Most viral lower respiratory tract infections seem to be acquired in the community and considered a leading cause of infection in patients who undergo mechanical ventilation.

 </xref> The most common cases diagnosed with bacterial co‐infection with viral infections are seen in those infected with influenza virus.

 </xref> The oldest report of bacterial infections that occurred simultaneously or shortly after influenza is related to the 1918 Influenza pandemic, in which most deaths occurred as a result of co‐infection with infectious bacteria.

 </xref> Also, the H1N1 Influenza pandemic in 2009 was complicated by bacterial pneumonia in 4–33% of hospitalized patients.

 </xref> Bacterial‐viral co‐infection is not restricted to influenza and also caused by other respiratory viruses, such as parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, and human metapneumovirus.

 </xref> Despite the discovery of antibiotics and viral vaccines in 1918–1957, the mortality rate, resulting from secondary bacterial pneumonia remained a major problem. The mortality rate seems to be still growing mostly because of the rapid rate of aging in the human population.
