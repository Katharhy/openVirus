<p>Additionally, a recent clinical trial conducted by Hagan et al

 </xref> demonstrated that the use of broad‐spectrum antibiotics (which led to depleting gut microbiota) decreased and impaired the immune system's ability to generate antibodies. Also, the current study shows that the use of antibiotics perturbed bile acid metabolism and induced inflammatory responses.

 </xref> Hence, improved functional therapies, including antibiotics and alternative therapies as well as the prediction of bacterial respiratory infections using vaccines, should be regarded as potential therapeutic approaches. Besides, standard guidelines should also be established for the administration of the antibiotics. In addition to the direct effect on drug‐resistant bacteria as a result of enhanced antibiotic administration, the transmission of drug‐resistant bacteria through the medical system should be taken into account. The COVID‐19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of vaccination, the need for functional antimicrobials, as well as the necessity for supporting research into the understanding and control of co‐infections. Rapid characterization of co‐infection is essential in the treatment of the most COVID‐19 patients, and could help to save lives, and will improve antimicrobial stewardship during the pandemic. Additionally, mixed bacterial‐viral infections can result in antibiotic treatment failure. These observations show that a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms will enable researchers to design effective preventive and therapeutic options. Several functional suggestions for management and control of bacterial co‐infection with COVID‐19 are offered in Table
