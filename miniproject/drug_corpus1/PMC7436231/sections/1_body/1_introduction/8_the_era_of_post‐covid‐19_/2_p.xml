 </xref> While scientists attempt to understand and control the COVID‐19 pandemic, it would be also critical to prepare for the effect of the current and future viral pandemics on secondary bacterial infections, resulting in antimicrobial resistance in the near future. In combination with using an antimalarial drug, hydroxyl‐chloroquine, azithromycin has become a popular therapeutic option for COVID‐19 patients. Reports demonstrated that a combination of hydroxyl‐chloroquine and azithromycin was effective for a large proportion of Covid‐19 patients.

 </xref> It is hard to estimate how often this combination is prescribed, but such a rate would be high enough to cause a shortage of azithromycin. However, 30–40% of common types of bacterial agents are already resistant to azithromycin, and overuse could render this or other antibiotics even less effective.

 </xref> The findings could help experts' advice on using the antibiotics in COVID‐19 patients and help them to better understand the spread of co‐infections in hospitals and the mechanism of bacterial‐viral coinfection. One factor that involves in the antibiotic resistance in bacterial co‐infection is the widespread use of antibiotics in COVID‐19 patients. Emerging data show that more than 90% of COVID‐19 patients receive antibacterial drugs.

 </xref> This rapid increase in antibiotic administration can cause a strong selective pressure on bacterial pathogens to evolve resistance leading to the increased incidence of drug‐resistant bacterial infections in the years subsequent to the COVID‐19 pandemic. It was estimated that 10 million people could die from an antibiotic‐resistant bacterial infection in the year of 2050,

 </xref> but such prediction may be altered and shortened because of the devastating impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on the usage of antibiotics, so this timeline will almost have to be modified. Nevertheless, concerted efforts must be made to better understand antibiotic administration in COVID‐19 patients. Antibiotics do not directly act on viral infections but viral respiratory infections often lead to bacterial co‐infections.

 </xref> The current pandemic highlights the necessity for understanding the complex relationship between viral and bacterial infections. Of note, in patients who have treated with high‐dose antibiotics may have more co‐infections with drug‐resistant bacteria.
