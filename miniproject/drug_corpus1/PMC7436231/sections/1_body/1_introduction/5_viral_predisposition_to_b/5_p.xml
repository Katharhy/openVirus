<p>Also, there are a number of mechanisms that are independent of the phagocytosis process by which viral host infection can predispose the human body to secondary bacterial co‐infection. The production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), such as lipocalin‐2, cathelicidin, Regenerating Islet Derived Protein 3 Beta (REG3B), calprotectin, may be dysregulated by upper respiratory tract viruses.

 </xref> The respiratory syncytial virus infection is able to diminish the expression of human β‐defensin‐3 orthologue named chinchilla beta‐defensin 1 when used in vivo. Of note, con‐infection with the respiratory syncytial virus is capable of stimulating the viral load of

 </xref> The intranasal delivery of anti‐ chinchilla beta‐defensin 1, human β‐defensin 3, or the recombinant form of chinchilla beta‐defensin 1 showed that the disruption of the availability of even a single innate immune effector could have a great impact on bacterial load since the viral infection has a critical in the loading of
