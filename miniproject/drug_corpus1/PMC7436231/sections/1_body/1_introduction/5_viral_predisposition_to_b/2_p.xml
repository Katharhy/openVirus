<p>Commonly, viral infection can destroy histologically and functionally the respiratory tract of individuals upon viral spread.

 </xref> Depending on the type of the virus, the histopathological outcomes could be relatively different from mild types to severe ones. These detrimental changes include altered mucus secretion, cell death, hyperplasia, decreased mucosal clearance, reduced oxygen exchange, and impaired surfactant secretion.

 </xref> Peltola and colleagues found that influenza viruses can enhance the colonization of the nasopharynx by 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> bacterium, however, only particular subtypes were found to mediate the development of bacterial otitis media and sinusitis.

 </xref> The neuraminidase enzyme of the influenza virus has been found to be presented on the host cell receptors, and they are employed for the adherence of bacteria due to its sialidase ability that changes the carbohydrate moieties on the host epithelial cells.

 </xref> This enzyme is also capable of increasing the possibility of bacterial adherence to the host cells through the stimulation of transforming growth factor‐beta (TGF‐β) which triggers the up‐regulation of integrins and fibronectin. Integrins and fibronectin have been shown to act as receptors for bacteria.

 </xref> Besides, interferons (IFNs) induction of by influenza virus can cause reduced C‐C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2 (CCL2) expression resulting in failed macrophages recruitment that necessary for clearance of pneumococcal cells thereby enhance the colonization of 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> in vivo.

 </xref> Also, it has been found that the influenza virus predisposes the host to develop pneumonia caused by 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> where viral and bacterial loads are increased during co‐infection.
 <xref rid="iub2356-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">
  <sup>52</sup>
 </xref> It has been hypothesized that viral load is increased following bacterial co‐infection because of increased shedding rate of the virus from infected host cells; however, bacterial loads would be elevated as a result of impaired function of alveolar macrophages.
