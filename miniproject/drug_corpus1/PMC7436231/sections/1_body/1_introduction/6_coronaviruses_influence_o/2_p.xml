<p>The human immune reaction to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is a two‐step reaction that during the non‐severe infection phase, a particular adaptive immune reaction is necessary to viral eradicate and prevent the disease from progressing to a severe phase.

 </xref> To provide a protective immune reaction in the early phase, the host must be in a good general health condition and have a genetic background to be able to exhibit an acceptable antiviral reaction. Genetic diversity is well known to involve in particular changes in the host immune response to various microbial pathogens.
