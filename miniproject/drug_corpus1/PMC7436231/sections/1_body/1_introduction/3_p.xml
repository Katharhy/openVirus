<p>Emerging evidence suggests that the number of patients with COVID‐19 diagnosed with bacterial co‐infections during hospitalization periods is increasingly raised.

 </xref> The source and specific nature of these infections are yet to be fully explored, but there is some evidence suggesting that multidrug‐resistant bacteria are among the pathogens that are thought to be responsible for the development of these infections.

 </xref> Patients vulnerable to viral lung infections, such as influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and COVID‐19 are the greatest risk to be co‐infected with superbugs.

 </xref> In some severe form of SARS‐CoV‐2, patients exhibited increased levels of infection‐related biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines, suggesting potential bacterial co‐infection as a result of the dysregulated immune system.

 </xref> Besides, the emergence of antibiotic resistance could be an additional burden for the health care system as co‐infection with coronavirus and pneumonia stretches health care units beyond their capabilities and resources. Understanding the mechanism underlying the synergy between Covid‐19 and bacteria paves the way for the discovery of novel therapeutic agents to prevent the mortality rate in patients co‐infected with COVID‐19 and bacteria. In the current situation, appropriate and systematic analysis of COVID‐19 patients diagnosed with bacterial co‐infection should be implemented to choose proper antibiotics to increase the survival of patients and limit the spread of drug‐resistant bacteria. The use of rapid diagnostic tools and methods promoting the prescription of effective narrow‐spectrum antibiotics should be taken into account. In this review, we will summarize the current data available for bacterial infections in patients with COVID‐19.
