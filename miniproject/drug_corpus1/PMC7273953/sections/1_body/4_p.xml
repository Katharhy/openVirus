<p>While these restrictions are burdensome in the best of times, the impacts of the opioid crisis and COVID-19 are additive, compounding the risk of illness and death for high-risk individuals. People with OUD are likely at higher risk for COVID-19 due to higher prevalence of pre-existing health conditions and tobacco use, and because many people with severe OUD reside in congregate living situations, including group recovery housing, shelters, and correctional facilities, where they are unable to maintain physical distance from others.

 </sup> Unfortunately, some of the measures that have been taken to reduce harms associated with the novel coronavirus may inadvertently increase OUD-related harms.

 </sup> The offices of many medical providers, treatment programs, and harm reduction organizations have had to close or significantly reduce their hours, and disruptions to normal routines and increased social isolation may increase risk of resumed use among people in recovery from OUD. The crush of COVID-19 cases is increasing emergency medical services response times in some areas, and distancing efforts may reduce the probability than an individual who overdoses will be discovered and given naloxone in time to prevent lasting injury or death. Altogether, this places people with OUD at increased risk for overdose and overdose death.
