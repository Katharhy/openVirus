  <p>MSNs as nanocarrier of antimicrobial agent (levofloxacin, LEVO) and functionalized with a biofilm targeting agent (ConA). In this case, the functionalization of MSNs with ConA favours its internalization in 
   <italic>E. coli</italic> biofilms affording a synergistic combination with LEVO-loaded MSNs, which triggers an efficient antimicrobial effect on 
   <italic>E. coli</italic> biofilm. The image represents the percentage of covered surface by live bacteria (green) and mucopolysaccharide layer (blue) and the representative confocal images show a complete reduction after incubation with the nanosystems functionalized with ConA and loaded with LEVO (MSNConA@LEVO) [
