 <italic>t</italic>½ = 180 ± 40 min) than unmodified silica nanoparticles (
 <italic>t</italic>½ = 80 ± 30 min) and carboxylated silica nanoparticles (
 <italic>t</italic>½ = 35 ± 10 min), being partly excreted via renal clearance. A stealth behavior is acquired by PEGylation, which reduces the RES uptake and increases the circulation half-life. As a result, PEGylated MSNs of various sizes (80, 120, 200, and 360 nm) were excreted slower than unfunctionalized ones due to the much slower particle capture by the liver and spleen.
