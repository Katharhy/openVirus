<p id="Par36">When ingested by human beings through food sources, silicon species circulate through the blood plasma and are absorbed in the form of silicic acid being 41% excreted in the urine (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>). It is challenging to confidently draw trends between separated studies describing the clearance of silica nanoparticles because of the plethora of varying parameters, not least of which are the nanoparticle characteristics. Nevertheless, on animal models, several trends have been observed between MSNs characteristics and their clearance: i) the effect of size, ii) the effect of surface functions, iii) the effect of surface charge, and iv) the effect of morphology.
