 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>) reported an in-depth study of bare MSNs of various diameters (80, 120, 200, and 360 nm) and observed a significant nanoparticles excretion from 15 to 45% after the first 30 min with consistently higher excretion percentages for larger nanoparticles. Burns 
 <italic>et al</italic> . (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>) have shown that nonporous silica quantum dots (3-6 nm) can be effectively (â‰ˆ 70%) cleared out of an animal body by renal excretion in 2 days, while Kumar 
 <italic>et al</italic> . (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>) showed that larger silica nanoparticles (20-25 nm) preferred hepatobiliary excretion, with a complete clearance over a period of 15 days. Cho 
 <italic>et al</italic> . (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>) studied dye-labeled nonporous silica nanoparticles of 50, 100 and 200 nm and demonstrated their clearance in the urine and bile. The 50 nm nanoparticles cleared faster than 100 and 200 nm ones, and 200 nm nanoparticles were less excreted.
