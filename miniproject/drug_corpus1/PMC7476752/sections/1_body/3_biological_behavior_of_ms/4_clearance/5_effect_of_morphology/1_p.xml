<p id="Par40">The morphology influence on the clearance displayed that mesoporous silica nanorods of aspect ratio ≈1.5 (185 ± 22 nm long) are more rapidly cleared than longer nanorods of aspect ratio around 5 (720 ± 65 nm long). Comparing spherical-shaped and rod-shaped MSNs, nanospheres were mostly excreted during the first few hours, while nanorods had slower clearance rates (
