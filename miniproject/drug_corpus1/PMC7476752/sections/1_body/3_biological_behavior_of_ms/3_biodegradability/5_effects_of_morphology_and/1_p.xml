 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>) regarding the degradation of MSNs with spherical and rod-shaped morphologies with aspect ratios (ARs) of 1.75 and 5. Authors investigated these nanoparticles by TEM and sample weight measurements after degradation for 7 days by soaking in three different degradation media: simulated gastric fluid (SGF, pH 1.2), simulated intestinal fluid (SIF, pH 6.5), and SBF (pH 7). After a week in acidic gastric fluid, none of the three MSNs did displayed significant alteration, and their degradation was only about 10 wt% for all nanoparticles. On the contrary, the degradation was much more pronounced and AR dependent in both simulated intestinal and body fluids. In general, the SIF generated more degradation than the SBF. The same group also showed that spherical MSNs were more rapidly degraded than rod-like MSNs with ARs of 2 and 4, and the presence of FBS in the Dulbeccoâ€™s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) accelerated the degradation process (
