 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>) demonstrated that the degradation of MSNs is independent of their diameter with 390, 310, 200, and 150 nm nanoparticles in simulated body fluid (SBF) at 37 °C. During the first two days, the degradation rate was nearly 45% per day, which then slowed down to about 1% per day, and the degradation was completed in a week (

This study indicated, on the one hand, that there was a burst degradation in the first 2 to 4 h, leading to 30, 70, and 90% of silica hydrolytic degradation as the surface increased, and, on the other hand, a complete degradation was obtained in 15 days.
