<p id="Par32">The dissolution process of amorphous silica in aqueous media includes three steps: i) hydration, in which water is adsorbed into the siloxane framework, ii) hydrolysis, in which siloxane are hydrolyzed into silanols, and ii) ion exchange processes, which consist of nucleophilic attack of OH
 <sup>âˆ’</sup> leading to the silicic acid leaching. At the molecular level, silica hydrolyzes in aqueous media to form the same products as those of silica nanoparticles which are nontoxic and diffuse through the blood stream or the lymphatic system to be eventually cleared in the urine. Similar to silica nanoparticles, the solubility of silicic acid degradation products is key for the effective hydrolytic degradation of silica nanomaterials (
