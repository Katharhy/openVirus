<p id="Par33">Investigations have been carried out to assess the direct influence of the size, morphology and degradation medium parameters on the silica nanoparticles degradation. The physicochemical engineering of MSNs thus allows one to tune the dissolution silica rate in biorelevant media for specific biomedical applications (
