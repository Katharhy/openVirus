<p id="Par82">Currently, there is a great global concern regarding infectious diseases, especially those without well-established therapy or, mostly, which exhibits multidrug resistant microorganisms. Recently, nanomedicine has emerged from the nanotechnology as a wide and great approach to overcome drawbacks in biomedical field imposed by several diseases. More precisely, MSNs have great potential for biomedical application due to their interesting properties including biocompatibility, biodegradability, easy clearance, tunable physicochemical properties as size, shape and pores size. MSNs multifunctionality opens up several possibilities to fabricate smart and targeted nanomedicines or nanovaccines for infectious diseases prevention and treatment. These nanoplatforms can promote specific and controlled drug release at target disease cells/tissues improving treatment efficacy minimizing side effects besides no patient compliance. Despites MSNs potential has received great attention in the last years towards the design of new formulations and therapies, MSNs applications to treat infectious diseases such as parasites, viruses and fungi have been already scarce up to now. As depicted in this review, only MSNs-based nanocarriers for bacterial infections and treatment have been widely exploited, which opens up several opportunities to design multifunctional MSNs-based nanoplatforms for controlled drug delivery to threat the most of infectious diseases presented nowadays. Although very few reports are described regarding MSNs-based nanovehicles in clinical assays, the good biological behavior, unceasing preclinical tests performed and the last trends using these nanosystems, allow us to prospect a clinical translation in a near future.</p>
