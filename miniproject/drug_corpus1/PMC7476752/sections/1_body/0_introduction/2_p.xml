 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>). Nanotechnology is a multidisciplinary science field that studies the fabrication and application of structures with one of its dimensions less than 100 nm (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>). The use of nanostructures in health area are desirable due to the fact that their size are 100 to 10000 times smaller than eukaryotic cells and similar size to the most biological molecules and structures including DNA, proteins, cell membranes and pathogenic microorganisms (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>). In addition, the nanometric size can potentialize nanomaterials action and efficacy comprising an emerging tools to develop therapeutic agents, diagnosis systems, medical devices and drug delivery platforms including medicines and vaccines for infectious diseases treatment (
