<p>Infectious diseases are increasingly emerging as a cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, mainly due to the fact that some diseases are caused by multi-resistant microorganisms to existing drugs (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>). Antimicrobial resistance occurs when microorganisms (such as bacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites) change when they are exposed to antimicrobial drugs (such as antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals, antimalarials, and anthelmintics). As a result, the medicines become ineffective and infections persist in the body, increasing the risk of spread to others. Without effective antimicrobials for prevention and treatment of infections, medical procedures such as organ transplantation, cancer chemotherapy, diabetes management and major surgery (for example, caesarean sections or hip replacements) become very high risk. Beyond that, antimicrobial resistance increases the cost of health care with lengthier stays in hospitals and more intensive care required, as stated by World Health Organization (WHO) (
