<p id="Par58">MSNs have received great attention towards vaccines production due to the large amount of silanol groups on its surface that facilitates the functionalization and drugs incorporation. The surface functionalization with several molecules allows improving cells target and uptake besides favor drugs transport and release from the mesopores, leading to interesting immune and cellular responses, which makes MSNs attractive and potential nanoplatforms for vaccines fabrication against any infectious diseases (
