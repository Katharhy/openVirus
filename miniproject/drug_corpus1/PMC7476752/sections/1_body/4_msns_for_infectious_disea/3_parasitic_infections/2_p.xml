<p id="Par59">Few studies have been reported in the literature applying MSNs for parasitic diseases treatment (as shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">III</xref>). For instance, Oliveira 
 <italic>et al</italic> . (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">136</xref>) described that vaccine and prophylactic protection development against 
 <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> are essential to reduce the infection cases. In this way, authors reported the use of MSNs containing SWAP (Antigenic Preparation of Soluble Worm) as new strategy to treat 
 <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infection. MSNs were characterized according to their size (38.8 nm), polydispersity index (0.24), zeta potential (-32.9 mV), surface area (871.19 m
 <sup>2</sup> g
 <sup>-1</sup>) and porosity with pores volume and diameter of 0.243 cm
 <sup>3</sup> g
 <sup>-1</sup> and 6.91 nm, respectively. SWAP was successfully incorporated into MSNs showing EE up to 35.35%. Immunological tests indicated that MSNs were able to stimulate a high immune response compared to conventional adjuvants (SWAP-associated aluminum salt). Authors also reported that higher immunization performance observed for MSNs may be related to some unique characteristics presented by the nanosystem, such as high surface area, spherical morphology, high pores volume, stability, biocompatibility and non-toxicity which make SWAP-loaded MSNs a promising strategy to improve immune response against 
 <italic>S. mansoni</italic> and enabling vaccines production.
