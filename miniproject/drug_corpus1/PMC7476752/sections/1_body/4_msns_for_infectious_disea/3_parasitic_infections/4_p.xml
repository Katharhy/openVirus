 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>) fabricated praziquantel (PZQ)-loaded MSNs in order to evaluate its therapeutic effect against murine S. 
 <italic>mansoni</italic>. MSNs@PZQ showed spherical shape, average size ranging from 100 to 105 nm, zeta potential from +31.9 to +30 mV and EE of 83%. Mice were infected with 
 <italic>S. mansoni</italic> and treated 6 weeks after infection with similar doses of MSNs@PQZ and free PZQ evaluating several concentrations, orally and intraperitoneally (IP). A maximum anti-schistosomal effect was achieved using MSNs@PZQ administered orally. The biomarkers related to liver oxidative stress status and immunomodulatory effect (serum TNF-Î± and IL-10) were significantly improved showing IP route was less effective for PQZ delivery. Authors also reported that the MSNs@PQZ administration allows the reduction of the effective therapeutic dose, indicating MSNs as a safe nanoplatform that enhances anti-schistosomal, antioxidant, immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory PQZ actions in animal model infected by 
 <italic>S. mansoni</italic>.
