 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">139</xref>) synthesized whisker-formed SBA-15 nanoparticles as a pH-sensitive metronidazole (MNZ)-trapped nanocarrier. This nanosystem was modified with tannic acid (TA) aiming to block the mesopores and control drug release process. The SBA-15 nanowhiskers had small fibrous structures 0.5-1.5 Î¼m in length and up to 50 nm in diameter. Through characterization analysis, 2D ordered hexagonal mesostructures were detected, with surface area of 491.38 m
 <sup>2</sup> and pores volume and diameter of 0.593 cm
 <sup>3</sup> g
 <sup>-1</sup> and 6.06 nm, respectively. In addition, the modification with TA increased MNZ EE from 62.6 to 71.4%. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> release assays exhibited fast MNZ release from unmodified SBA-15 nanowhiskers whereas TA-SBA-15 nanocarriers controlled MNZ release for an extended time. Interestingly, the modified nanosystems displayed a pH-sensitive behavior, showing MNZ release up to 85% at pH 5.8. The minimal lethal concentration (0.5 mg mL
 <sup>-1</sup>) of TA-modified SBA-15@MNZ showed 100% protozoal growth inhibition for 180 min regarding to parasite control and free MNZ solution. These studies suggest this multifunctional nanoplatform as promising and efficient MNZ delivery system for parasitic diseases treatment.
