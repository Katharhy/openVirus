<p id="Par60">In another study, Nhavene 
 <italic>et al</italic> . (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">137</xref>) designed multifunctional MSNs based on MCM-41 functionalized with (3-glycidoxypropy) trimethoxysilane (GPTMS) and chitosan succinate (CS) containing benznidazole (BZ) onto modified MSNs surface aiming to evaluate their action against the parasite 
 <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> responsible for Chagas disease. The MSNs-like MCM-41 were successfully prepared with well-defined hexagonal arrays of uniform mesopores network, spherical shape and pores size of 3.3 nm. The MSNs functionalization with GPTMS and CS was confirmed by spectroscopic analysis. BZ anchored onto CS-modified MSNs surface via hydrogen bond interactions was confirmed by spectroscopic and density functional theory (DFT) analysis. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> assays showed that the nanosystem can effectively performed BZ delivery being thirty times more active against epimastiogotes 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> CL-Brener than free BZ, revealing its potential and effectiveness as nanocarrier for BZ delivery. Authors also concluded that all results demonstrated MSNs-GPTMS-CS as a potential and promising nanoplatform for drugs and genes delivery to treat neglected diseases such as Chagas disease or American trypanosomiasis.
