<p id="Par41">The direct drugs application in preclinical trials can generate undesirable changes in their physicochemical, pharmacokinetic and biological properties, minimizing their action in infectious diseases treatment associated with the risk of resistance by pathogens. In this context, the development of smart and specific MSNs-based nanocarriers comprise a promising and effective approach for efficient drug delivery and consequently infectious diseases treatment (
