<p id="Par73">Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is a primary etiological agent of post-weaning multi-systemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). PMWS are severe in acute outbreaks, causing death of up to 80% of affected animals. To develop new therapies for PCV2 infections is essential for pig industries. For this reason, Guo

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">148</xref>) reported the preparation of PCV2 GST-ORF2-E protein-loaded HMSNs as nanovaccines aiming to induce persistent immune responses of PCV2. The nanosystem was characterized exhibiting spherical shape with average size of 200 nm. Maximum protein loading amount of 15% (w/w) were achieved. Protein release profile (PBS at pH 7) was time-dependent showing rapid release (~50%) up to 12 h and slow release up to the sixth day. To evaluate the specificity of mice antibodies immunized by GST-ORF2-E, mouse sera were used in immunofluorescence experiments to determine the specificity of antibodies by PCV2-infected PK15 cells. Results displayed that no significant staining was detected suggesting specificity of the mouse antibody against PCV2. Indirect ELISA assays displayed that the antibody titers of mice immunized with PCV2 GST-ORF2-E@HMSNs were higher than those of mice immunized with the GST-ORF2-E protein, especially at the third- and fourth-weeks post-vaccination. Furthermore, the T-lymphocyte proliferation response in mice induced by the PCV2 GST-ORF2-E@HMSNs remained at levels higher than those in mice immunized with the GST-ORF2-E protein, demonstrating that the proteins loaded into the HMSNs not only stimulate humoral and cellular immune responses but also induce persistent immune responses because of the release kinetics from HMSNs. Results confirmed HMSNs as an interesting an efficient vaccine nanovehicle for PCV2 treatment and further studies regarding virus therapy.
