<p id="Par68">Viral infections and spreadability can be establish only by their interaction with host cells. The key and great challenge to develop viral infections treatment consist on understand and elucidate the interaction virus-host cells at molecular level. In addition, virus can evolve by genetic mutation and become drug resistant making urgeous and essential the design of new drugs. In current medical scenario, the lack of antiviral broad-spectrum drugs, the fast and wide spreadability and the long time demanded to elucidate virus mechanism action to design a safety and efficient vaccines or treatment making viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2 a great threat to human global health (
