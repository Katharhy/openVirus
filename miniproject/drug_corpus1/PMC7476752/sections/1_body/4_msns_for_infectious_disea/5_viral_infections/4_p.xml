<p id="Par71">Herpes simplex virus (HSV) provokes several infectious diseases such as orolabial and genital herpes being currently treated by guanine analogues such as acyclovir, valaciclovir and others, which inhibit viral DNA replication. However, these compounds suffer from antiviral drug resistance especially in immunocompromised individuals besides show poor bioavailability being necessary several and high doses administration (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">147</xref>). The HSV cells infection can start by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between viral glycoprotein (gB or gC) and cell glycosaminoglycans (GAGs, heparan sulfate) composed of negatively charged sulfonate groups linked by hydrophobic moieties. Molecules that mimic GAGs can interact with virus avoiding their interaction and penetration into susceptible cells (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">146</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">147</xref>) have designed GAG mimetic-functionalized MSNs to treat HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections. In a first work (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">146</xref>), aryl sulfonate GAG mimetic-modified MSNs exhibited low toxicity besides inhibited HSV-1 and HSV-2 penetration into health cells while controls were inactive. In this work, Lee 
 <italic>et al</italic> . (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">147</xref>) explored distinct functional groups related to GAG structure attached to MSNs and investigated their activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2. In addition, authors evaluated GAG mimetic-functionalized MSNs as smart nanocarriers for acyclovir (ACV) delivery aiming simultaneously inhibition of viral penetration and DNA replication. Five modified MSNs were prepared: benzene sulfonate-modified MSNs, propyl thiol-modified MSNs, propyl sulfonate-modified MSNs, zwitterionic sulfonate-modified MSNs and phenyl-modified MSNs ((MSNs-Phenyl-SO
 <sub>3</sub>, MSNs-Propyl-Thiol, MSNs-Propyl-SO
 <sub>3</sub>, MSNs-Zw-SO
 <sub>3</sub> and MSNs-Phenyl, respectively). All nanoplatforms were characterized showing average size from 100-150 nm and negative surface charge (~ -40 mV), conferring good colloidal stability by interparticle repulsion. Antiviral 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assays toward HSV-1 and HSV-2 were carried out displaying that sulfonate group presence was as a prerequisite for antiviral activity, with the benzene group (from benzene sulfonate-modified MSNs) enhancing the antiviral response regarding to an alkyl group (propyl sulfonate-modified MSNs). Phenyl-modified MSNs showed a relatively weak antiviral activity, reinforcing the sulfonate group importance. From second study concerning ACV-loaded benzene sulfonate-modified MSNs (labeled ACV@MSNs-phenyl-SO
 <sub>3</sub>), high drug loading (34% w/w) and controlled and prolonged ACV release (70% (w/w) up to 24 h) were detected. This release profile can be assigned to the mesopores functionalization with hydrophobic groups which can act as blockers controlling drug release. To evaluate post viral penetration into cells, Vero cells were infected with HSV-1 and then, treated with the nanoplatforms. Results exhibited higher antiviral activity for ACV@MSNs-phenyl-SO
 <sub>3</sub> than ACV@MSNs and free ACV. The targeting effect of GAG mimetic from ACV@MSNs-phenyl-SO
 <sub>3</sub> against HSV-1 was investigated achieving 100% antiviral activity whereas both no interaction with HSV-1 were detected for ACV@MSNs and free ACV. These results confirmed that the GAG mimetic-functionalized MSNs performed dual action mechanism against HSV-1 and HSV-2 opening up new possibilities for virus infections treatment.
