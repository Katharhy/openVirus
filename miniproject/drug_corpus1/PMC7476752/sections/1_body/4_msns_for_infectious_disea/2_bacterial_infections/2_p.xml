<p id="Par43">Considering the abovementioned advantages, authors have reported the use of MSNs containing peptides with antibacterial properties, aiming to prevent their enzymatic degradation potentiating their antimicrobial activity (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>). It can also guarantee the same effect for loading antimicrobial proteins (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>). Other studies reported the use of hydrophobic antimicrobials drugs-loaded MSNs to enhance their effect in biological media (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>). On the other hand, for hydrophilic antimicrobial drugs which are very soluble in an aqueous/biological environments, MSNs can also promote a controlled drug release (
