<p id="Par55">Regarding the high mortality and morbility caused by bacterial resistance, Cao 
 <italic>et al</italic> . (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>) proposed to ally the amazing properties of MSNs with metallic nanoparticles such as silver (Ag) and bismuth (Bi). Authors designed a multifunctional MSNs-suported Ag-Bi nanoparticles (NPs) associating hyperthermia generated by Bi nanoparticles with Ag release for synergistic antibacterial therapy as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. Ag-Bi nanoparticles were fabricated via in situ growth onto MSNs pores structure aiming to avoid their aggregation and oxidation under physiological environment. Under the NIR laser irradiation (808 nm laser irradiation, 1 W cm
 <sup>-2</sup>, 15 min), hyperthermia can be generated by Bi NPs destroying bacterial cell membrane and biofilm promoting and increasing Ag
 <sup>+</sup> release from the nanocarrier, resulting in photothermal-enhanced antibacterial activity. Spherical nanosystems with average size and pores of 200-240 nm and 3.4-4.8 nm, respectively were successfully fabricated. In addition, Ag NPs showed average size of ~15 nm. Photothermal therapy (PTT) ability of Ag-Bi@MSNs was evaluated exhibiting high stability and laser power irradiation and concentration dependence. As higher is laser power density and Ag-Bi@MSNs concentration, higher is the achieved temperature confirming great PTT performance. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> antibacterial activity was evaluated against MRSA cells by adding Ag-Bi@MSNs with or without laser irradiation. At same concentration (128 μg mL
 <sup>-1</sup>), 22 and 76% of cells death were achieved without and with laser irradiation, respectively. Additionally, release studies were performed for 75 min with and without laser irradiation (at the same concentration, 200 μg mL
 <sup>-1</sup>). Results corroborate antibacterial assays displaying a NIR-responsive Ag
 <sup>+</sup> release, with 11.3 and 37.3% of release without and with laser irradiation, respectively. Aiming to prove the synergic antibacterial effect, MRSA-infected mice were investigated with five groups: PBS, Bi@MSNs, Ag-Bi@MSNs, Bi@MSNs + NIR and Ag-Bi@MSNs + NIR groups. Regarding to the control group (PBS), the number of colonies were reduced to 90.3, 74.6, 35.1 and 5.9% for Bi@MSNs, Bi@MSNs + NIR, Ag-Bi@MSNs and Ag-Bi@MSNs + NIR, respectively, indicating that multimodal synergistic therapy based on Ag-Bi@MSNs could effectively treat MRSA skin infection. The therapeutic effect was confirmed by histological analysis. Beyond that, the animals evaluated showed no obvious changes in their body weight suggesting no biotoxicity. These findings made Ag-Bi@MSNs a promising multimodal nanoplatform against bacterial infections and for further clinical translations.
