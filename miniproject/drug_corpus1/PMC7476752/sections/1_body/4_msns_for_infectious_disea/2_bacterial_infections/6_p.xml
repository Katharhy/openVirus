 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>) reported the fabrication of norfloxacin (NFX)-loaded modified and unmodified MCM-type MSNs to evaluate their action against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. Authors synthesized five types of MSNs: MCM-41 with long mesopores channels, pristine MSNs without surfactant (MSN), surfactant non-extracted (MSN-E), modified with vinyl groups (MSN-vinyl) and MCM-48 nanosystems. All MCM-type carriers showed spherical nanosized morphologies up to 60 nm. High surface area (up to 1222 m
 <sup>2</sup> g
 <sup>-1</sup>) and pores size ranging from 2.5 to 9 nm were detected for these nanocarriers. MCM-41 types exhibited hexagonal mesopores arrays with average size of 2.5-3.1 nm whereas MCM-48 showed interconnected pores forming cubic arrays with sizes of 2.5-9 nm. The successfully nanoconfinement into mesopores by impregnation method confirmed NFX amorphization. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> release studies demonstrated NFX-loaded MSNs carriers enhanced dissolution rates regarding free NFX in same conditions. In addition, the association and dissociation NFX-nanocarriers processes were considered reversible with a first-order kinetics. In addition, high initial release of the antibiotic, which is suitable for applications in severe infections. Authors concluded that NFX-loaded MCM-based nanocarriers displayed good and similar antibacterial activity compared to free NFX. These nanosystems could be applied to avoid the use of high free NFX concentration, maximizing antibacterial effect in any biological media.
