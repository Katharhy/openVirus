<p id="Par45">Bacterial conventional treatment possesses challenges mainly due to the poor antimicrobial compoundâ€™s permeation into the infected cells. In this regard, Subramaniam

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>) proposed to evaluate distinct size of MSNs containing rifampicin (RIF) aiming to improve the intracellular bacterial infection treatment. Spherical MSNs were fabricated with average size of 40 and 100 nm (labeled MSNs-40 and MSNs-100, respectively), zeta potential values of -20 and -16.9 mV, respectively and pores size ranging from 8 to 9 nm. RIF was successfully encapsulated into MSNs-40 and MSNs-100 via passive diffusion method, showing encapsulation efficiency (EE) values of 26.8 and 22.5%, respectively. Cellular uptake assays performed in RAW 264.7 cells exhibited interesting MSNs-100 macrophage internalization achieving up to 80%, whereas MSNs-40 showed lower uptake values (up to 40%), assigned to the exocytosis process more pronounced for smaller nanoparticles. From 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> release assays, both RIF-loaded MSNs displayed low release rates up to 10% (in PBS buffer solution at pH 7.4). In contrast, at pH 5.0, no changes were detected in release profile for both nanosystems within 12 h, attributed to the low RIF solubility. Intracellular infection model was established using small colony variants (SCV) of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> in macrophages. Results exhibited high MSNs-RIF internalization and an antibacterial activity enhancement regarding free RIF solution. Authors concluded that despites low release rates achieved, high internalization and bacterial activity enable these nanoplatforms to treat bacterial biofilms.
