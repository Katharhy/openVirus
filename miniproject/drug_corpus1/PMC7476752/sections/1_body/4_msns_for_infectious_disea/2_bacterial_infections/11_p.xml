<p id="Par52">Doxycycline (DOXY) is an antibiotic very hydrophilic and soluble in biological fluid showing a high bioavailability at short time being the most part quickly eliminated by the kidneys. Aiming to overcome the aforementioned drawback and considering the development of bacterial resistance, Deaconu 
 <italic>et al</italic> . (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>) proposed to ally antibiotic properties and MSNs matrix by preparing DOXY-loaded MCM-41-type MSNs and modified MSNs to treat 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> strains. MCM-41 (using hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (C
 <sub>16</sub>TAB) and TMOS as surfactant and inorganic precursor, respectively) platforms were prepared and then modified with phenyl, mercaptopropyl, propylsulfonic and magnesium labeled (MCM-C
 <sub>6</sub>H
 <sub>5</sub>, MCM-SH, MCM-SO
 <sub>3</sub>H and MCM-Mg, respectively). MCM-C
 <sub>14</sub> was also synthetized by using reduced chain surfactant (C
 <sub>14</sub>TAB) and TEOS as inorganic precursor. All MCM-41 nanoplatforms exhibited spherical shape ranging from 200-400 nm with ordered hexagonal mesopores channels arrays with mean pores size from 1.75 to 2.98 nm. DOXY incorporation was performed for all nanocarriers by wetness impregnation method. From drug release studies (PBS pH 5.2) was detected that DOXY delivery profiles depend on the modification and distinct type of mesoporous silica matrix. The MCM-Mg showed lower DOXY release kinetic, which can be assigned to the enhanced basicity of the magnesium oxide particles formed on the silica surface. Despite distinct DOXY release kinetics obtained, effective and similar antibacterial activity was detected for all nanoplatforms. In addition, these results were similar to free DOXY expected that controlled and prolonged release can be achieved only by using the nanocarriers.
