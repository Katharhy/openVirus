<p id="Par50">The antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP) possesses wide antibacterial spectra and good permeation for bone tissues, however, low blood circulation in bone site, high drug concentration and several side effects makes its direct application inviable. In this context, Andrade 
 <italic>et al</italic> . (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>) fabricated ciprofloxacin (CIP)-loaded SBA-16-type MSNs and SBA-16/hydroxyapatite (HA) composites for bone infection treatment. Both nanoplatforms were modified with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), anchored with diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) for chelating technetium-99m. The SBA-16 and SBA-16/HA exhibited ordered cubic mesoporous structures with average pores size of 3.4 and 3.8 nm, respectively. CIP loading ranging from 28 to 31% were detected for modified and unmodified SBA-16 carriers. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> CIP release studies (SBF pH 7.3) displayed that SBA-16-APTES and SBA-16/HA-APTES were similar with initial burst release of 42-43% in the first 9 h, achieving the maximum release (51-53%) in 76 h. These results suggested that at SBF solution with pH 7.3, the nitrogen of piperazinyl ring is protonated and classified as a zwitterionic species, which can lead to great CIP interaction with the amine groups modified onto SBA-16 surface. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> antimicrobial assays by using 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> were performed for CIP@SBA-16-APTES and CIP@SBA-16/HA-APTES. Both aminated platforms presented high antibacterial activity against all microorganisms especially relating to free CIP. It is worth emphasizing that the tested free CIP amount was approximately three times greater than CIP-loaded SBA-16 carriers. 
 <sup>99</sup>mTc-DTPA-SBA-16-APTES and 
 <sup>99</sup>mTc-DTPA-SBA-16/HA-APTES were prepared as radiotracer platforms aiming to evaluate their 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> biodistribution. Both nanosystems were mostly uptaken by liver and spleen, reaching the highest radioactivity level at 4 h post-injection. Considering bone uptake, a higher uptake for 
 <sup>99</sup>mTc-DTPA-SBA-16/HA-APTES was detected relating to 
 <sup>99</sup>mTc-DTPA-SBA-16-APTES, at 1 and 4 h post-injection. These results suggested 
 <sup>99</sup>mTc-DTPA-SBA-16/HA-APTES was more specific for bone tissue than 
 <sup>99</sup>mTc-DTPA-SBA-16-APTES, which can be attributed to the presence of hydroxyapatite in the nanosystem that possesses high affinity for bone matrix. Authors pointed out that the fabrication of these nanocarriers are relevant showing low cost and easy preparation and effective CIP release, which make them promising nanoplatforms to treat bone infections.
