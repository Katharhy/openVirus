<p id="Par53">The use of MSNs to transport and deliver poorly soluble drugs to the target diseases sites comprises an attractive and useful method to improve drug’s efficacy. Notwithstanding, high loading and also total release drugs amount is a great challenge due to the nanoconfinement and possible interaction with the matrix. In light of this, Chen 
 <italic>et al</italic> . (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>) demonstrated the use of acetophenone (AP), an FDA-approved food additive as co-solvent (known as chaperone) to promotes efficient clofazimine (CFZ) entrapment and release from MSNs channels to aqueous environment. CFZ is a water-insoluble antibiotic used to treat leprosy and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Spherical and monodisperse MSNs with highly ordered hexagonal mesopores arrays and average size of 100 nm were obtained as well as high surface area (1060 m
 <sup>2</sup> g
 <sup>-1</sup>), negatively charged (zeta potential of -21.2 mV) with average pore size of 2.8 nm. All these results favor MSNs loading with CFZ and AP. CFZ loading and release assays were carried out in DMSO and AP solvents. The loading CFZ capacity by using AP increased as a function of CFZ concentration, showing 26.8% at 50 mM whereas by using DMSO the loading capacity was 5.9% at the same concentration. By using AP strategy, the CFZ release efficiency was 47.2% whereas by using DMSO was only 0.02%. The novel strategy showed release efficiency 2300 times higher than the conventional method with DMSO (0.02%). The high increase in CFZ release can be assigned to the release of AP from the MSNs pores carrying CFZ molecules together into the aqueous solution. The chaperon-based MSNs were evaluated in a macrophage model of 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection. The optimized CFZ-AP(10mM CFZ in AP)@MSNs exhibited high antimicrobial efficacy (dose-dependent) reducing the bacteria number by 1 log CFU (90% of bacteria were killed). In addition, no changes on the macrophages morphological appearance were detected for the applied nanosystems. This loading/delivery “chaperone-assisted” strategy can be used for other hydrophobic drugs with their suitable solvents (chaperone), opening up opportunities to design novel drug delivery MSNs-based nanosystems for biomedical applications.
