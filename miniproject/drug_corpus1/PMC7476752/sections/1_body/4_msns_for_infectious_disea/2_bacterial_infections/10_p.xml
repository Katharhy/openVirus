<p id="Par51">Bacterial biofilm comprises up to 70% of infection and inflammation in clinic being usually resistant to the most conventional antibiotic treatment. In light of this, Xu 
 <italic>et al</italic> . (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>) prepared rod shaped hollow MSNs (HMSNs) with large and small cone shaped pores (HMSN-LP and HMSN-SP, respectively) via oil-water system containing lysozyme (LYZ) to treat 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> biofilms. The synthetized nanosystems presented averages particle length and width of 400 and 200 nm, respectively. Average pores size of 40 and 3 nm were found for HMSN-LP and HMSN-SP, respectively. HMSN-LP exhibited loading capacity 7 times higher than HMSN-SP, ascribed to the pores size difference. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> release tests (PBS pH 7.4) revealed that slower drug release was achieved by HMSN-LP than HMSN-SP, with up to 80% of LYZ release over 48 h. Corroborating the aforementioned results, antimicrobial assays using 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> biofilms model confirmed the highest antimicrobial action of HMSN-LP-LYZ compared to HMSN-SP-LYZ and free LYZ. Additionally, the HMSN-LP was marked with fluorescent dye and its penetration ability into biofilms after 24 and 48 h of incubation was confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) analysis. All results demonstrated the high therapeutic activity of HMSN-LP towards 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> biofilms, which enable the design of novel and multi-responsive nanosystems against infectious pathogens.
