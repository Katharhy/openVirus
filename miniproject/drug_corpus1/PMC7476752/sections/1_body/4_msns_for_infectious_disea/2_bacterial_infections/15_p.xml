<p id="Par56">Fast and accurate bacteria detection and their effectively killing in the bloodstream in low doses are crucial and act as key roles in medicine and microbiology studies. Integrating diagnosis and treatment to achieve accurate diagnosis and efficient treatment of diseases has always been an important goal of modern medicine. In this context, Xu 
 <italic>et al</italic> . (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>) developed a smart and theranostic nanoplatform based on vancomycin (VAN)-loaded magnetic (Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> NPs) MSNs (MMSNs) modified with sufonated-hyaluronic acid (S-HA) and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> antibody (Ab) grafting via amidation reaction (labeled Ab@S-HA@MMSNs) for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> detection and treatment in bloodstreams. S-HA was selected due to its capping and targeting function, biocompatibility, biodegradability besides promotes drug sustained release and anti-adhesion effects. Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> NPs displayed average size of 180 nm whereas spherical MMSNs achieved average size and pores diameter of 240 and 3 nm, respectively. In addition, Ab@S-HA@MMSNs exhibited 180 nm core uniformly wrapped with 30 nm shell, with zeta potential of -5.32 mV. Van loading efficacy of 10.7 wt% was achieved and antibacterial assays were carried out since 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> can secrete hyaluronidase (Hyal), enzyme that degrades S-HA promoting controlled VAN release. Results exhibited 98% of bacterial reduction suggesting high antibacterial efficacy and Hyal-responsive controlled VAN release. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> release tests were conducted showing that no significant VAN was release without Hyal presence whereas after Hyal addition (up to 500 U mL
 <sup>-1</sup>), up to 83% of VAN corroborating the Hyal role in the “on-demand” drug release. The Ab@S-HA@MMSNs magnetization behavior was evaluated and despites magnetization values reduction after all modification, the nanosystem presented good magnetic responsivity and can be utilized to modify the surface of magnetic glassy carbon electrode (MGCE) (noted Ab@S-HA@MMSNs/MGCE) by magnetic interaction. From electrochemical and analytical studies, the fabricated immunosensor exhibited an excellent electrochemical response towards 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> in the range of 1x10
 <sup>1</sup>–1x10
 <sup>10</sup> CFU mL
 <sup>-1</sup> with high selectivity, stability and reproducibility. The detection limit with linear range was up to 3 CFU mL
 <sup>-1</sup>, and this responsiveness was also well demonstrated in the blood environment. Beyond that S-HA-modified MMSNs possess anticoagulant property, the Ab@S-HA@MMSNs/MGCE displayed antiadhesion property, ensuring that it can be directly applied to detect 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> in whole blood. Additionally, increasing 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> amount of arriving at Ab@S-HA@MMSNs/MGCE, the capping Ab@S-HA@MMSNs were degraded by Hyal secreted by 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and “on demand” VAN released was achieved. All results suggest this multifunctional theranostic nanoplatform for accurate diagnosis and efficient treatment of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> bloodstream infection.
