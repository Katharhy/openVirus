<p id="Par48">Conventional antibiotic treatments are less effective to 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> because this microorganism can invade host cells like osteoblasts and macrophages and use them as reservoir to reduce antibiotic action leading to infection recurrence. In this sense, Yang 
 <italic>et al</italic> . (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>) proposed to design a gentamicin (GEN)-loaded MSNs modified with a lipid bilayer surface shell and an bacterial-targeting peptide ubiquicidin (UBI
 <sub>29-41</sub>) onto lipid bilayer (labeled LU). Spherical MSNs with highly ordered mesoporous channels and average size of 80 nm were synthesized. GEN EE of 25.6% was achieved. MSNs surface modification was firstly performed with liposome layer aiming to prevent nonspecific nanoparticles uptake under physiological conditions whereas the conjugated UBI
 <sub>29-41</sub> allows the nanosystems targeting to bacteria in infected tissues. In addition, the liposomal bilayer can act as a blocker avoiding GEN leakage. When the nanocarrier reaches the infected cells, the liposome can be degraded by bacterial enzymes and toxins. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> assays were performed on planktonic and intracellular infection of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> bacteria. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> tests revealed that the 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> growth on agar plates showed higher microbial inhibition for Gen@MSNs-LU than the unmodified nanosystem (GEN@MSNs) and free drug besides a responsive-bacterial toxin release. From 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> assays, high specificity, bacterial reduction and no infection recurrence were detected by using GEN@MSNs-LU. In addition, physiopathology studies were performed and no histological changes were detected in major organs indicating no organ toxicity when submitted to GEN@MSNs-LU treatment. All these results enable this bacterial-responsive nanosytem as a promising and adaptable tool to delivery other drugs targeting distinct bacteria and, consequently, treat diverse kind of infections.
