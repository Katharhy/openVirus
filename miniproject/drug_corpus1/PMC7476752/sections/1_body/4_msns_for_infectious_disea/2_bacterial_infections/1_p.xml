<p id="Par42">The great challenge concerning bacterial infections treatment comprises the development of antibiotic resistance in several bacteria species, leading to ineffective treatment. One way to overcome this drawback consists on to use nanoparticles that can interact efficiently to the bacterial surface disrupting their cell wall leading to cell death. Interestingly, multifunctional nanoparticles can also interact with cellular organelles and biomolecules present in the bacteria, making difficult the resistance development against them (
