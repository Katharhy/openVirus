<p id="Par67">In another study, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), synthesized by green synthesis using 
 <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic> leaf extract as a reducing agent, were loaded into MSNs (noted MSNs-AgNPs) aiming to evaluate antifungal activity against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> 077 strains. The fabricated MSNs presented spherical shape with size of around 400 nm and hexagonal pores structures with average size of ~7.6 nm. The impregnated AgNPs were detected onto MSNs pores/surface showing spherical shape with average size ranging from 5 to 50 nm. From antifungal activity assays, MSNs-AgNPs proved to be efficient in inhibiting the fungus growth in a dose-dependent manner, both in the disc diffusion and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> killing assays, being a promising alternative approach to infections treatment caused by 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. However, more preclinical studies are already essential to better understand the real potential of the MSNs-AgNPs for future clinical translations (
