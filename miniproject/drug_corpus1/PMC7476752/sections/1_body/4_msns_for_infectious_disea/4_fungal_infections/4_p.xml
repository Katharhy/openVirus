 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">143</xref>) incorporated zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZNPs) into MSNs (noted ZnO@MSNs) in order to evaluate the antifungal efficiency against two strains of 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> (MTCC 10180 and MTCC 2196) and two strains of 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> (NCIM 1043 and NCIM 1072). The MSNs and ZnO@MSNs nanosystems displayed spherical shape with a size ranging from 20 to 40 nm with average pore size ranging from 2.5 to 3.1 nm, respectively. The authors observed that ZnO@MSNs activity was dose dependent, requiring high doses to achieve antifungal response. The enzymatic tests showed that ZnO@MSNs activity occurred through the generation of oxidative stress through ROS generation. The generated oxidative stress caused morphological changes in the fungi. Both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> tests indicated good biocompatibility of the developed nanosystem, with sustained release exerted by MSNs preventing the ZnO direct exposure reducing toxic effects, which makes the developed MSNs-based nanoplatform enable to desirable antimicrobial applications.
