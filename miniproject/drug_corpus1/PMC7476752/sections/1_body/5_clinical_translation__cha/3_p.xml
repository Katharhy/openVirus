 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">166</xref>) described the fabrication of C dots conjugated with the radiometal Zirconium-89 (
 <sup>89</sup>Zr, t1/2 = 78.4 h) using two different strategies: chelator-free and chelator-based radiolabeling. The best nanosystem (labeled 
 <sup>89</sup>Zr-DFO-cRGDY-PEG-C′ dots) fabricated by chelator-based radiolabeling exhibited higher 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> radiostability with good renal clearance, low reticuloendothelial system (RES) accumulation, high tumor uptake and target-to-background ratios relative to biological controls for human melanoma xenograft models. The first clinical trial using 
 <sup>89</sup>Zr-DFO-cRGDY-PEG-C′ dots has been carried out for bioimaging of malignant brain tumors (NCT03465618).
