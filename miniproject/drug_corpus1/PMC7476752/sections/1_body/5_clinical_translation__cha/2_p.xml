<p id="Par75">Wiesner group (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">162</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">163</xref>) described the fabrication of “Cornell dots or C dots” (labeled 
 <sup>124</sup>IcRGDY–PEG–C dots) as the first nanosilica approved by the FDA for clinical assays. A smart core-shell nanosilica containing Cy5 dye and 
 <sup>124</sup>I radiolabels for optical-PET (positron emission tomography) dual imaging was fabricated and modified with PEG and cRGDY peptides as target agent for molecular expression in human melanoma xenografts (
