<p id="Par74">The challenges of any designed nanostructure for therapeutic purposes consists on achieve good biocompatibility, biodegradability, complete and short clearance time as already stated by US FDA. Considering the aforementioned, MSNs are very attractive as nanocarriers/nanotherapeutics because their interesting properties such as chemical and physical stabilities, size, morphology, surface and pores structures can be easily modulated to achieve good biological behavior and also effective drug loading and delivery at the desired site, comprising efficient nanoplatforms in most of pre-clinical assays. Internal, external or multi stimuli-responsive MSNs controlled drug delivery systems have been designed as smart nanoarchitectures that control pharmacokinetics parameters and emphasize the amazing properties of MSNs, stimulating researches towards their application in clinical trials (
