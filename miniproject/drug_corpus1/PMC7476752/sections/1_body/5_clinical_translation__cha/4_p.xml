 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">167</xref>) described the application of plasmonic photothermal therapy (PPTT) by using near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation onto silica-gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for Angioplasty and artery remodeling. Interesting safety level and significant treatment efficacy with plaque burden reduction (79.4 mm

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">168</xref>) conducted a first-in-man trial (labeled NANOM-FIM, NCT01270139) by using multifunctional silica-AuNPs-dispersed on-artery patch associated with PPTT for atherosclerosis treatment. Results exhibited significant regression of coronary atherosclerosis with good biocompatibility and no significant toxicity besides lower risk of cardiovascular death in humans. This bioengineered nanostructure offers great potential for further atherosclerosis theranostic purposes.
