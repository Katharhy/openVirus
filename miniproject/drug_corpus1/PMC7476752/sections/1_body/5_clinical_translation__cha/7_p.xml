<p id="Par80">Another concern related to MSNs or any nanostructures for clinical translation relies on regulatory agencies (as US FDA) evaluation. Currently, nanostructured materials are evaluated as small-molecule drugs, being that some nanosystems can act only as nanoprobes or without loaded drugs. In this sense, the actual evaluation processes by agencies comprise a bottleneck that allow only a few percentages of nanostructures can be approved for commercial purposes. Authors suggested that regulatory agencies could create specific evaluation category for nanomedicines aiming to streamline their translation (
