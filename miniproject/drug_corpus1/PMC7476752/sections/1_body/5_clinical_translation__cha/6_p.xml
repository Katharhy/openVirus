<p id="Par79">Up to now, preclinical assays related to MSNs were successfully performed whereas no MSNs have been described in clinical trials. Authors (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">160</xref>) suggested that the clinical translation has failed due to the large physiological distinction between small animals and humans, indicating that animal models are not the better indication for further nanostructures success in humans. In addition, authors suggest that rather than prolonged xenografting experiments (in cancer treatment), positive animal toxicological results could allow to start phase 1 of clinical trials.
