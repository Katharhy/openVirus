<p id="Par78">The clinical applications of aforementioned silica-based nanostructures encourage researchers focuses on MSNs clinical translation and further commercialization. Although several researches have been performed in the last two decades towards the biological behavior and preclinical evaluation of smart and engineered stimuli-responsive MSNs for monitoring and/or therapeutic purposes (

The structural stability of nanoparticles is usually determined by interaction with the biological environment and between themselves. Poor colloidal and thermal stabilities can result in drawbacks with long-term storage and nanosystems administration. In this sense, MSNs present robust silica framework and exceptional electronic architecture easily optimized, making them amazing nanoarchitectures with interesting structural stability for biomedical applications (
