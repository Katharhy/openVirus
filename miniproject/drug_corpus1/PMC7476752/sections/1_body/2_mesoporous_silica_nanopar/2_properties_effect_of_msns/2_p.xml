<p id="Par26">The pores size control influences on loading and release rates of molecules. Increasing pores size, more molecules can be loaded inside the pores and consequently, an increase of release rates can be observed (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>). TUD-1 (disordered mesoporous) materials that present 3D pores arrangement showed faster drug release than 2D hexagonal mesopores materials (SBA-15 and MCM-41). Andersson 
 <italic>et al</italic> . (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>) demonstrated that similar hexagonal mesostructured materials with interconnected (SBA-1) pores displayed faster release rate than unconnected (SBA-3) pores systems. For these systems, similar drug loading amounts were detected.
