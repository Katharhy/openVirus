<p id="Par28">Particles size and shape can also influence their blood circulation, cellular uptake and tumor penetration, being determinant parameters to achieve therapeutic effects. Regarding particles size, a diameter range from 50 to 300 nm can favor an optimal cellular uptake, long circulation time, high drug loading and high accumulation in tumors (
