<p id="Par24">The resulting silica-based mesoporous matrices may offer the following unique structural: 1) 
 <italic>ordered porous structure</italic>. MSNs have along-range ordered porous structure without interconnection between individual porous channels, which allows fine control of the drug loading and release kinetics; 2) 
 <italic>large pore volume and surface area</italic>. The pore volume and surface area of MSNs are usually above 1cm
 <sup>3</sup> g
 <sup>-1</sup> and 700 m
 <sup>2</sup> g
 <sup>-1</sup>, respectively, showing high potential for molecules loading and dissolution enhancement; 3) 
 <italic>tunable particle size</italic>. The MSNs particle size can be controlled from 50 to 300 nm, which is suitable for facile endocytosis by living cells; 4) 
 <italic>two functional surfaces</italic>, namely cylindrical pore surface and exterior particle surface. These silanol-contained surfaces can be selectively functionalized to achieve better control over drug loading and release. Moreover, the external surface can be conjugated with targeting ligands for efficient cell-specific drug delivery (
