<p id="Par22">MSNs are commonly prepared by sol-gel “chimie douce” process in aqueous solution. This process involves the synthesis of an inorganic polymeric network at low temperature, being the gel formed from a colloidal suspension or by hydrolysis and subsequent condensation of an silica precursor (Si(OEt)
 <sub>4</sub>), generally the most used is a tetraethyl orthosilicate, TEOS, in solution. In hydrolysis reactions, the alkoxide group (OR) of the silica precursor is replaced by the silanol group (Si-OH), forming an alcohol in parallel, due to the nucleophilic attack of the oxygen atom of the water hydroxyl group (

Then, the silica precursors can condense at the micelles surface forming MSNs. Finally, the template surfactant can be removed either by calcination or by solvent extraction to generate pores (
