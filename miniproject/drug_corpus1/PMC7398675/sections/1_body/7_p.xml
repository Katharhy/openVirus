<p id="para480">South Africa is valiantly fighting COVID-19; the national response to the pandemic has gained unprecedented political support and mobilised resources that would have been unimaginable a year ago. There has been a massive refocusing of the political agenda on health and the opportunity—yet to be fully realised—to address the underlying social determinants that increase communities' vulnerability and result in differentiated mortality outcomes. The increased solidarity creates the opportunity for broader public participation and for addressing health as a public good, not just for COVID-19 but also for the other major health problems in the country, including HIV and tuberculosis. Though devastating, COVID-19 has offered the opportunity for true service delivery transformation that could result in lasting benefits when it comes to care for people with HIV and tuberculosis.</p>
