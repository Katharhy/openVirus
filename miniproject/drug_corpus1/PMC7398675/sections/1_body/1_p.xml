<p id="para420">The biological interactions between tuberculosis, HIV, and COVID-19, as well as health system factors contribute to the impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable populations. Modelling data show that COVID-19 could trigger an excess of 6 million tuberculosis deaths by 2025, with decreased diagnosis, treatment initiation, and successful treatment completion.

 </xref> Similarly, a 6-month disruption in antiretroviral therapy (ART) delivery for HIV could result in up to half a million additional deaths, double mother-to-child transmission in sub-Saharan Africa over one year, and increase mortality by up to 40% over the next 5 years.
