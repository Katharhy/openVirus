<p>In the present study, we suggest that nylidrin suppresses the membrane fusion step by preventing the structural changes of HA that occur at low pH. Accordingly, preincubation of influenza virus with nylidrin completely blocked intranasal infection of mice. Thus, nylidrin represents a new class of anti-influenza agents that act by blocking the HA2 function. Our findings provide insights into further chemical modifications of the hit compounds that could lead to the development of a direct-acting antiviral against influenza A with a distinct and novel mode of action.</p>
