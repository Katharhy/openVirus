<p>There are three classes of clinically available antivirals targeting NA, M2, or PA [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00581" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00581" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. NA inhibitors (NAIs) including oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, and laninamivir block NA-mediated cleavage of sialic acids attached to HA during the very late stage of infection and thus interfere with the release of progeny viruses from infected cells. Adamantanes such as amantadine and rimantadine attenuate M2 proton channel activity, which is required for virus–endosome membrane fusion. The most recently developed drug is the PA endonuclease inhibitor, baloxavir marboxil, which prevents the cleavage of 5’ caps from host mRNAs during the “cap-snatching” process, enabling initiation of viral mRNA synthesis. Despite the high potency of these drugs against influenza A and/or B viruses, the emergence or global spread of drug-resistant mutants is an increasing public health concern, and such mutations have arisen even in the absence of drug pressure [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00581" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The majority of currently circulating H1N1 and H3N2 isolates are resistant to adamantanes due to amino acid mutations in M2 (e.g., S31N and V27A [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00581" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]). The H274Y mutation in NA of H1N1 and H5N1 and the E119V and R292K mutations in H3N2 NA are associated with dramatically diminished sensitivity to NAIs [

 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00581" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Moreover, the I38T mutation in PA in the 2009 pandemic H1N1 and seasonal H3N2 strains confers reduced susceptibility to baloxavir marboxil [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00581" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This widespread drug resistance highlights the need for the development of antivirals with an alternative mode of action to respond to possible pandemics caused by multi-drug-resistant viruses.
