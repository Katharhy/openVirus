<p>Previously, we have screened a chemical library of approximately 7000 small molecules by the cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction assay using fluorescein diacetate (FDA); hit compounds were those that allowed 80% of influenza A or B virus-infected cells to survive at a final concentration of 20 µM [
