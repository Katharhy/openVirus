<p>To further investigate which step in the virus life cycle is targeted by nylidrin, we performed treatment during adsorption or at various time points p.i. over a total time of 5 h, in which EGCG was used as a control for the blocking of viral entry. This time-of-addition experiment revealed that nylidrin affected influenza virus replication in an incubation period-dependent manner (

Immunofluorescence imaging of viral NP at 5 h p.i. confirmed that nylidrin prevents the virus entry step, particularly after attachment or cellular membrane penetration of the virus, but before its RNA-dependent RNA replication in the nucleus, resulting in abnormal accumulation of vRNP in the cytoplasm (
