<p>In addition to the results from the indirect CPE-based antiviral assay, it was necessary to determine whether nylidrin could inhibit influenza viral infection by monitoring viral proteins or plaque reduction directly. We treated PR8-infected MDCK cells with increasing concentrations of nylidrin in which OSV-C and RBV were used as inhibitory controls. Western blot analysis of cell lysates revealed a dose-dependent decrease in the levels of three viral proteins, NP, HA, and M1, consistently (

This finding was reproduced in A549 cells, indicating that nylidrin has antiviral activity in human lung cells, and not limited in a canine kidney-derived cell line (
