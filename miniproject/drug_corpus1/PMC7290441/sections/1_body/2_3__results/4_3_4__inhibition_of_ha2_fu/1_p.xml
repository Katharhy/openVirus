<p>Given the limitation of nuclear migration of vRNPs in the presence of nylidrin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00581-f002">Figure 2</xref>D), we hypothesized that the compound could target one of the three viral protein functions during the virus entry step, (1) M2 proton channel, (2) HA2 fusion protein, and (3) NP NLSs-mediated nuclear import of vRNPs. To determine which protein is involved in antiviral activity, we first examined whether the cytoplasmic vRNP complexes were internalized into endosomal compartments. Confocal microscopy clearly revealed their colocalization with an early endosome marker, Rab5, and more frequently with a late endosomal marker, Rab7, at the perinuclear region by nylidrin at 4.5 h p.i., when NP had completely migrated to the nucleus in the absence of nylidrin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00581-f003">Figure 3</xref>). This result suggested that nylidrin could block the escape of vRNPs from the endosomes, simply excluding their NP-mediated nuclear import as a target step.
