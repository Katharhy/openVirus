<p>To narrow down the mode-of-action study, we prepared retrovirus-derived virus-like particles (VLPs) spiked with M2. As the wild-type PR8 M2 (named PR8M2-R) is intrinsically resistant to AMT, we constructed the A27V/N31S reverse mutant (named PR8M2-S), which is sensitive to the antiviral drug, thereby generating PR8M2-S- and PR8M2-R-coupled VLPs [

Therefore, we further investigated whether the compound could interfere with the rest function (i.e., HA2-mediated membrane fusion). Polykaryon formation assay revealed that syncytia formation by PR8-infected Vero E6 cells was suppressed by nylidrin as efficiently as by MEDI8852, a neutralizing antibody bound to HA2 (

The tryptic digestion assay showed that nylidrin affects the sensitivity of both HA1 and HA2 to trypsin under acidic conditions (both pH 5.0 and 5.2), but not under a neutral condition (pH 7.0) (
