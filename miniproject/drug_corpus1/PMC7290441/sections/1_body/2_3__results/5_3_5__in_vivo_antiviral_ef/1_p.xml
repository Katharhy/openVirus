<p>Next, it was studied whether nylidrin, as an HA2-mediated fusion inhibitor, could protect mice from viral infection. To test its ability, we intranasally infected immunocompetent BALB/c mice with 5 MLD
 <sub>50</sub> of maPR8 following preincubation of the virus with DMSO (delivery vehicle) or nylidrin (10 mg/kg) at room temperature for 30 min (

As a therapeutic control, maPR8-infected mice were orally administered with OSV-P twice per day at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day from days 0 to 5 p.i. beginning 4 h before virus challenge. Body weight changes and survival rates confirmed that nylidrin not only mitigated body weight loss induced by viral infection (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00581-f005">Figure 5</xref>B). In contrast, mice infected with the vehicle-treated maPR8 died between days 9 and 11. Taken together, these findings suggest that nylidrin protects mice from viral infection in vivo by directly targeting the HA2 function of influenza A virus (H1N1).
