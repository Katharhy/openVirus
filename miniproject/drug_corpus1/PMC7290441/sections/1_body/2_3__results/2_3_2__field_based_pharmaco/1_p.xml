<p>To identify the pharmacophore characteristics of these antiviral compounds, we performed ligand-based pharmacophore modeling (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00581-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Upon merging the three active compounds, nylidrin, ifenprodil, and clenbuterol, on the basis of their hydrophilic and hydrophobic field points, we found one negative and two positive electrostatic regions around the phenyl aminoethanol center (

Even though the completely inactive compounds, ritodrine and fenoterol, had main electrostatic regions similar to those of the active compounds, they had an extra positive electrostatic potential at the amino terminal phenol ring, which may hinder their specific interaction with a target protein or provide an unfavorably charged region, disrupting an essential hydrophobic interaction. Together, these results indicate that conservation of the three electrostatic potential sites of the phenyl aminoethanol derivatives is critical for anti-influenza viral activity in cells.
