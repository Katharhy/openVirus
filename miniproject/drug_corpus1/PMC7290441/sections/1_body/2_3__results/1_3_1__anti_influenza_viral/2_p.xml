<p>Nylidrin (also known as buphenine) is a β2-adrenergic agonist [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00581" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. On the basis of its structural and functional properties, we selected seven additional chemical analogues to investigate the relationship between chemical structure and antiviral activity (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00581">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). In the CPE-based antiviral assay, ifenprodil was comparable to nylidrin, with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 6.6 and 16.9 μM for PR8 and HK, respectively (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00581-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Clenbuterol was potently active only against PR8 with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 9.4 μM, whereas labetalol and eliprodil were only marginally effective against HK alone with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values above 44.0 μM. In contrast, ritodrine, fenoterol, and bambuterol had no antiviral activity against any viral strains. In further experiments, we tested the inhibitory compounds, even partially including nylidrin, ifenprodil, labetalol, eliprodil, and clenbuterol, against additional influenza A and B viruses (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00581-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Nylidrin, ifenprodil, and clenbuterol were consistently effective against A/H1N1 strains, but their efficacy varied among the H3N2 viral strains, and none had antiviral activity in influenza B-infected cells. As expected, the remaining two compounds, labetalol and eliprodil, had little effect against any of these viral strains, except for A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1), which was partially sensitive to eliprodil (EC
 <sub>50</sub>, 53.1 μM). These results indicate that nylidrin and its analogues, ifenprodil and clenbuterol, can reliably inhibit the infection of H1N1 strains of the influenza A virus at subtoxic concentrations.
