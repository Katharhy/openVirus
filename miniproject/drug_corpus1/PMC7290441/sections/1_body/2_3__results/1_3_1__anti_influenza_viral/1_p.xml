 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00581" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], we identified nylidrin as a hit compound that inhibits influenza A viruses (PR8 and HK). At a concentration of 20 µM, nylidrin maintained 80% viability in MDCK cells infected with influenza A, but conferred no benefit in CPE-reduction following infection with an influenza B strain (Lee). To verify this finding, we performed antiviral and cytotoxicity assays at various concentrations of nylidrin with a high purity of about 95% (3-fold serial dilutions from 900 to 0.05 μM) using AMT, RBV, and OSV-C as the controls. The data showed that nylidrin had EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 7.2, 12.1, and &gt;100 µM against the PR8, HK, and Lee strains, respectively, and a CC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 549.2 µM in mock-infected MDCK cells, resulting in selectivity indices (SI) of 76.3 against PR8 and 45.4 against HK (
