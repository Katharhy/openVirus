<p>Another point to be stressed is that nylidrin completely blocked intranasal influenza infections of mice when it was preincubated with the virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00581-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Even though the OSV-P–treated group showed a complete therapeutic effect, it led to transient decreases in body weight after virus challenge. Meanwhile, the nylidrin–treated group exhibited an overall body weight increase without mortality during the monitoring period, nearly identical to the mock–infected group. In light of this result, we examined the efficacy of the oral administration of nylidrin twice a day (at a dose of 200 mg/kg/day) for 13 days p.i. Unfortunately, oral post-treatment did not improve infection-mediated mortality, but instead moderated the slope of body weight loss relative to the virus-only group, enhancing mean survival time by 1.4 days (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00581">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). These observations suggest that although nylidrin is a potent, direct-acting inhibitor of influenza virus HA2, the pharmacokinetics of gastrointestinal absorption is not sufficient for oral administration to treat influenza virus infection. Future studies could also focus on chemical modifications that would render a broader range of viral strains sensitive to nylidrin derivatives as well as improve the pharmacokinetic properties for their therapeutic use.
