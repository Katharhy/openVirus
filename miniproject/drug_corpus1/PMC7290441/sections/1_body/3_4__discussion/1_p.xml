<p>From screening of a chemical library, we identified nylidrin, an ADRB2 agonist, as an antiviral compound against influenza A virus. ADRB2 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and primarily expressed on smooth muscle cells surrounding the bronchioles. ADRB2 exists in equilibrium between activated and inactivated forms under resting conditions. Agonists trigger its activation, resulting in conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into cyclic AMP (cAMP) by adenylate cyclase in a G
 <sub>s</sub>-type G protein-dependent manner [

 <sup>2+</sup> leads to muscle relaxation [

Related to the roles of adrenergic receptors on viral infection, it has been suggested that ADRB2 agonists could downregulate the innate immune response and reduce host resistance to viral infection in a murine cytomegalovirus infection model [

 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00581" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. As a counterplayer of ADRB2, ARDA2, a G
 <sub>i</sub>-type G protein-coupled receptor, decreases intracellular cAMP levels when bound to an agonistic molecule. On the basis of these two previous reports, it was wondered how ADRB2 agonists have antiviral activity against the influenza A virus. Here, this question was answered by the 3D-QSAR analysis and by better understanding of the mechanism of antiviral action. Primarily, in phenotypic antiviral assays, not only nylidrin, but also other GPCR-regulatory molecules including ifenprodil and clenbuterol exhibited antiviral activity against A/H1N1 and/or A/H3N2 strains with varying degrees of efficacy. However, not all ADRB2 agonists suppressed the virus infection (e.g., ritodrine, fenoterol, and bambuterol) were inactive. This inspired us to try a field-based pharmacophore analysis of the chemical analogues by fixing the phenyl aminoethanol motif as a core skeleton (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00581-f001">Figure 1</xref>) and explained why particularly ifenprodil and clenbuterol were as potent as nylidrin. It was because they shared a highly similar electrostatic potential map at the molecular level. No relationship between antiviral activity and ADRB2 agonistic function implied that nylidrin could be a direct-acting antiviral agent, instead of an indirectly acting, host factor regulatory one.
