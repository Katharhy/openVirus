<p>Decisively, the polykaryon formation assay verified that nylidrin targets the HA2-mediated membrane fusion by blocking pH-dependent conformational change of HA. As above-mentioned, additional evidence supporting this hypothesis was provided by subtype dependency on the antiviral efficacy: nylidrin, ifenprodil, and clenbuterol were active against all A/H1N1 strains tested; in contrast, nylidrin and ifenprodil were limitedly effective only against A/Hong Kong/8/1968 and A/Seoul/11/1988 among the H3N2 strains tested (

The strain-specific activity of the compounds against the H3N2 subtype viruses indicated that optimization of nylidrin through chemical modifications could be a plausible approach for identifying a broad-spectrum fusion inhibitor.
