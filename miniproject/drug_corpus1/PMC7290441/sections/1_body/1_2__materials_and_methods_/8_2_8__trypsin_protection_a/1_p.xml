<p>Trypsin susceptibility of HA was tested at 37 °C as previously described with some modifications [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00581" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Influenza A virus PR8 (5.5 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> PFU/mL) was incubated with increasing concentrations (0, 40, and 400 µM) of nylidrin for 20 min. Acidic pH (5.0 or 5.2) was achieved by adding predetermined amounts of 1 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.8). Samples were incubated for 15 min, and the medium was neutralized (pH 7.0) by the addition of 0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.0). Virus was digested with trypsin for 1 h, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of the SDS sample buffer. After 12% SDS-PAGE and electrotransfer, both HA1 and HA2 proteins were probed with rabbit anti-HA1 (cat no. 11684-T54; Sino Biological) and rabbit anti-HA2 antibodies (cat no. 86001-RM02; Sino Biological), respectively, followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody as described above.
