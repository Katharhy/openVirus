<p>Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK), African green monkey kidney (Vero) E6, and A549 cells purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in minimum essential medium (MEM; Gibco/Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Gibco/Invitrogen), and RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco/Invitrogen), respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco/Invitrogen) at 37 °C. Influenza viruses A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1; PR8), A/Hong Kong/8/1968 (H3N2; HK), and B/Lee/40 (Lee) were also obtained from ATCC, and A/California/7/2009 (H1N1), A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1), A/Seoul/11/1988 (H3N2), A/Perth/17/2009 (H3N2), A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2), A/Victoria/361/2011-like (H3N2), and B/Brisbane/60/2008 were provided by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC, Chungcheongbuk-do, Republic of Korea) [

Viruses were amplified by infection of 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs or MDCK cells in the presence of 2 µg/mL TPCK-trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for three days. Allantoic fluids or cell culture supernatants were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min, and aliquots were stored at −70 °C before use. Viral titers were determined by plaque assay. Mouse-adapted PR8 virus (maPR8) was prepared as described previously [
