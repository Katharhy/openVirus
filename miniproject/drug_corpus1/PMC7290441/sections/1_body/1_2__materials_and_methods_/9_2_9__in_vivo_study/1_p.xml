<p>Female BALB/c mice (6–7 weeks old; Orient Bio Inc., Gyeonggi-do, Republic Korea) were infected with mouse-adapted PR8 (maPR8). Five units of 50% mouse lethal dose (5 MLD
 <sub>50</sub>) of maPR8 was preincubated with nylidrin or DMSO as a control for 30 min at room temperature. Mice were intranasally challenged with maPR8 in the presence or absence of nylidrin at a dose of 10 mg/kg in a total volume of 50 μL. In another control group, oseltamivir phosphate (OSV-P [&gt;98%], provided by Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Gyeonggi-di, Korea) was administered from days 0 to 5 p.i. at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day (b.i.d.) beginning 4 h before virus challenge. Body weight changes and mortality were measured every day for 15 days. Mice were sacrificed when they lost at least 30% of their body weight, in accordance with the ethics guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT). The identification code of IACUC protocol is 2020-6D-03-01. The approval date of the committee was 12 March 2020. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were drawn using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).
