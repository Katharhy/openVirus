<p>For the development of a ligand-based pharmacophore model, seven compounds were selected from the phenyl aminoethanol derivatives used in the CPE assay. On the basis of antiviral efficacy against A/H1N1 strains, nylidrin, ifenprodil, and clenbuterol were defined as active compounds as they have selectivity indices over 20, whereas labetalol, ritodrine, fenoterol, and eliprodil were designated inactive or less active ones. Conformation of the compounds was generated to a maximum of 200 conformations using the Conformation Hunt module in Forge v.10.3 (Cresset, Litlington, UK). The 3D common field point pattern for three active compounds were generated using FieldTemplater in Forge v.10.3 by the default setting. Four different molecular field points such as positive and negative electrostatic, shape, and hydrophobicity were calculated by using Cresset’s eXtended Electron Distribution (XED) force field [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00581" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The top 3D field alignment model was selected where the resulting templates included three active compounds. To compare with the 3D common field point pattern from the inactive compounds, the same procedure was also employed using FieldTemplater. The top 3D field alignment model was selected where the resulting templates included the four compounds’ inactive compounds.
