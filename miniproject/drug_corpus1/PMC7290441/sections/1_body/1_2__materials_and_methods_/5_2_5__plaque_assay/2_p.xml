<p>For time-of-addition experiments, MDCK cells in 48-well plates were infected with PR8 (MOI, 0.001) at 4 °C for 1 h in the presence or absence of nylidrin. After washing with PBS to remove chemicals and unadsorbed virus, nylidrin was administered at 1, 2, and 4 h p.i. (−)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG; Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a control for blocking viral entry. Subsequently, all samples were washed with PBS at 5 h p.i., followed by incubation under the overlay medium for three days prior to crystal violet staining.</p>
