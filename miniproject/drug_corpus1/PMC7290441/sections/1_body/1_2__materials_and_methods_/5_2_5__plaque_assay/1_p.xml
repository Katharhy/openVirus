<p>PR8-infected MDCK cells were mock-treated or treated with the individual compounds. After 24 h at 35 °C, culture supernatants were harvested to prepare 10-fold serial dilutions, which were used to infect naïve MDCK cells seeded in 48-well plates for 1 h. After PBS washing, they were incubated in overlay medium (MEM with 0.6% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC; Sigma-Aldrich) and 2 µg/mL TPCK-trypsin) at 33 °C for three days. Plaques were counted by crystal violet staining.</p>
