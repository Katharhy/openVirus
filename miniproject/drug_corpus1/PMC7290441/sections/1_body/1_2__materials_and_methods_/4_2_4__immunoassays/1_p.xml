<p>To detect viral proteins, western blot analysis was performed as described previously [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00581" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. MDCK cells grown to 100% confluence in 6-well plates were infected with PR8 virus at an MOI of 0.001 for 24 h at 35 °C in the presence of nylidrin, OSV-C, or RBV. Viral proteins NP, HA, and M1 were detected by immunoblotting the appropriate antibodies: mouse anti-NP (cat no. 11675-T62; Sino Biological, Beijing, China), rabbit anti-HA2 (cat no. 86001-RM01; Sino Biological), and mouse anti-M1 (cat no. sc-57881; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), respectively. Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Cellular β-actin was used as the loading control.
