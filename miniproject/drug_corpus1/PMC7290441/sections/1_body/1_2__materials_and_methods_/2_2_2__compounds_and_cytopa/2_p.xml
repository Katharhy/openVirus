<p>Cell-based antiviral assays were performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00581" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00581" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Briefly, MDCK cells were seeded on 96-well plates (3 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well) and grown overnight. The cells were mock-infected or infected with individual influenza strains at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 to 0.005 for 1 h at 33 °C or 35 °C. After the removal of unadsorbed virus, test and control compounds were serially 3-fold diluted from 100 to 0.01 µM (total ten concentration points) in serum-free MEM with 2 µg/mL tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin and used to treat the cells. To synchronize the reading time point, at three days post-infection (p.i.), the plates were incubated at the following temperatures: 33 °C for A/California/7/2009, A/Brisbane/59/2007, A/Perth/17/2009, A/Brisbane/10/2007, A/Victoria/361/2011-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008); and 35 °C for PR8, HK, Lee, and A/Seoul/11/1988. The half-maximal cytotoxic concentration (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) and half-maximal effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) were determined by measuring cell viability using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT).
