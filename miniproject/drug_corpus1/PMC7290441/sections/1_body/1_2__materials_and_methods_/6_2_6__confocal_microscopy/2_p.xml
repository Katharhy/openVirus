<p>For investigating colocalization of viral NP with cellular Rab5 or Rab7, A549 cells were seeded in 4-well slides (4 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well). On the next day, cells were transfected with 0.4 μg of pEGFP-Rab5 or pEGFP-Rab7 (a kind gift from Prof. C. Bucci at Università del Salento, Lecce, Italy) using lipofectamine 2000, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). After 24 h, they were mock-infected or infected with PR8 at an MOI of 10 in the absence or presence of 100 μM nylidrin at 4 °C for 30 min and then at 37 °C for an additional 4 h. Viral NP protein was probed using the same primary antibody above-mentioned, but with Alexa Fluor 633-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen).
