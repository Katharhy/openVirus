<p>For fluorescence microscopy, PR8-infected MDCK cells were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of nylidrin. After fixation and permeabilization, viral NP was visualized using anti-NP antibody (cat no. sc-80481; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen); nuclear DNA was counterstained using 4´,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Images were captured on a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope with analysis using the ZEN software (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY, USA).</p>
