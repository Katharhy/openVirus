<p>Syncytia formation caused by influenza infection was evaluated as described previously [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00581" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00581" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Vero E6 cells were infected overnight at 37 °C with PR8 at an MOI of 1. After treatment with TPCK-trypsin (5 µg/mL) for 15 min, they were treated with either nylidrin (20 or 100 µM) or anti-HA2 antibody (5 µg/mL) for an additional 15 min. The samples were washed with 1 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> and 0.1 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> dissolved in PBS (PBS-CM) and incubated in acidic (pH 5.4) or neutral (pH 7.0) PBS-CM supplemented with nylidrin or the antibody for 15 min, followed by incubation for 3 h in DMEM with 10% FBS. Giemsa staining (Sigma-Aldrich) allowed the visualization of cell–cell fusion. Herein, a well-known neutralizing antibody for influenza A virus HA2, MEDI8852, was chosen as a control for the HA-mediated fusion assay [
