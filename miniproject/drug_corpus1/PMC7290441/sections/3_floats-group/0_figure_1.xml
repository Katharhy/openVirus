  <p>Identification of common pharmacophore active regions on the basis of field points from the ligand-based pharmacophore model. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Field-based template model of three active molecules, nylidrin, ifenprodil, and clenbuterol, and their merged image. Highly conserved electrostatic domains are highlighted in dotted blue circles. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Representation of four template compounds with little or no activity. Unfavorable electrostatic domains, distinct from the active compounds, are marked in dotted red circles. Field points are visualized as follows: blue, negative electrostatic potential; red, positive electrostatic potential; orange, hydrophobic; and yellow, van der Waals.
