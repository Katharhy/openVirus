  <p>Inhibition of influenza HA2-mediated membrane fusion by nylidrin. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Polykaryon formation assay. PR8-infected Vero E6 cells (MOI, 1) were incubated under acidic (pH 5.4) or neutral (pH 7.0) conditions for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence of nylidrin (20 or 100 μM) or the anti-HA2 antibody MEDI8852 (5 μg/mL). After syncytium formation for additional 3 h at neutral pH, the cells were fixed and stained with Giemsa for microscopic analysis (200×). (

   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001. Statistical comparisons were performed using a two-tailed unpaired 
   <italic>t</italic>-test. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Tryptic digestion assay. PR8 virus (5.5 × 10
   <sup>7</sup> PFU) was incubated with DMSO or nylidrin (40 or 400 μM) for 20 min. Under acidic (pH 5.0 or 5.2) or neutral (pH 7.0) conditions, the samples were individually incubated for 15 min. After neutralizing with Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), they were treated with (+) or without (-) trypsin for 1 h and subjected to western blot analysis to detect viral HA1 and HA2 proteins. Uncleaved proteins by trypsin are marked to the right of the panels.
