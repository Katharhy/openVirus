  <p>In vivo antiviral activity of nylidrin against a mouse-adapted influenza A virus (H1N1), maPR8. Before viral challenge, maPR8 (5 MLD
   <sub>50</sub>) was preincubated with DMSO (virus only) or with nylidrin (10 mg/kg) at room temperature for 30 min. Mice were mock-infected or infected with the preincubated samples. As a positive control, OSV-P (10 mg/kg/day) was orally administered twice a day beginning 4 h before virus infection at 8-h intervals from days 0 to 5 post-infection. Body weight (
   <bold>A</bold>) and mortality (
   <bold>B</bold>) were measured every day for 15 days. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed unpaired 
   <italic>t</italic>-test relative to the virus-only group. 
   <italic>n</italic> = 5; **,
