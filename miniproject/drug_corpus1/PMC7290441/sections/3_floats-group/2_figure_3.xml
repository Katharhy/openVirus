  <p>Colocalization of vRNP with endosomal makers, Rab5 and Rab7. A549 cells were transfected with pEGFP-Rab5 or -Rab7 expression plasmid. On the next day, PR8 virus mixed with DMSO or nylidrin (100 μM) were infected into A549 cells at an MOI of 10 at 4 °C for 30 min. After additional 4 h-incubation at 37 °C, cells were fixed and permeabilized for probing anti-NP antibody and Alexa 633-conjugated secondary antibody. Mock, no PR8 infection. Green, an EGFP-tagged endosomal marker, Rab5 (upper) or Rab7 (lower). Red, viral NP. Blue, cellular nuclei stained with DAPI. Original magnification, 630×.</p>
