The virus has since spread globally, resulting in the currently ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The first whole genome sequence was published on January 5 2020, and thousands of genomes have been sequenced since this date. This resource allows unprecedented insights into the past demography of SARS-CoV-2 but also monitoring of how the virus is adapting to its novel human host, providing information to direct drug and vaccine design. We curated a dataset of 7666 public genome assemblies and analysed the emergence of genomic diversity over time. Our results are in line with previous estimates and point to all sequences sharing a common ancestor towards the end of 2019, supporting this as the period when SARS-CoV-2 jumped into its human host. Due to extensive transmission, the genetic diversity of the virus in several countries recapitulates a large fraction of its worldwide genetic diversity. We identify regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome that have remained largely invariant to date, and others that have already accumulated diversity. By focusing on mutations which have emerged independently multiple times (homoplasies), we identify 198 filtered recurrent mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Nearly 80% of the recurrent mutations produced non-synonymous changes at the protein level, suggesting possible ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2. Three sites in Orf1ab in the regions encoding Nsp6, Nsp11, Nsp13, and one in the Spike protein are characterised by a particularly large number of recurrent mutations (&#x0003e;15 events) which may signpost convergent evolution and are of particular interest in the context of adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to the human host. We additionally provide an interactive user-friendly web-application to query the alignment of the 7666 SARS-CoV-2 genomes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0010"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="l0005"><list-item id="li0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0005">Phylogenetic estimates support that the COVID-2 pandemic started sometimes around 6 October 2019 &#x02013; 11 December 2019.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">The diversity of SARS-CoV-2 strains in many countries recapitulates its entire global diversity.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">198 sites in the SARS-CoV-2 genome appear to have already undergone recurrent, independent mutations.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">Detected recurrent mutations may indicate ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to its novel human host.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0025">Monitoring the build-up of genetic diversity in SARS-CoV-2 has potential to inform on targets for drugs and vaccines.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Betacoronavirus</kwd><kwd>Homoplasies</kwd><kwd>Mutation</kwd><kwd>Phylogenetics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0030">On December 31 2019, China notified the World Health Organisation (WHO) about a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology in Wuhan, the capital of the Hubei Province. The initial evidence was suggestive of the outbreak being associated with a seafood market in Wuhan, which was closed on January 1 2020. The aetiological agent was characterised as a SARS-like betacoronavirus, later named SARS-CoV-2, and the first whole genome sequence (Wuhan-HU-1) was deposited on NCBI Genbank on January 5 2020 (<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Human-to-human transmission was confirmed on January 14 2020, by which time SARS-CoV-2 had already spread to many countries throughout the world. Further extensive global transmission led to the WHO declaring COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11 2020.</p><p id="p0035">Coronaviridae comprise a large number of lineages that are found in a wide range of mammals and birds (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Shaw et al., 2020</xref>), including the other human zoonotic pathogens SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-COV. The propensity of Betacoronaviridiae to undergo frequent host jumps supports SARS-CoV-2 also being of zoonotic origin. To date, the genetically closest-known lineage is found in horseshoe bats (BatCoV RaTG13) (<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). However, this lineage shares 96% identity with SARS-CoV-2, which is not sufficiently high to implicate it as the immediate ancestor of SARS-CoV-2. The zoonotic source of the virus remains unidentified at the date of writing (April 23 2020).</p><p id="p0040">The analysis of genetic sequence data from pathogens is increasingly recognised as an important tool in infectious disease epidemiology (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Rambaut et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Grenfell et al., 2004</xref>). Genetic sequence data sheds light on key epidemiological parameters such as doubling time of an outbreak/epidemic, reconstruction of transmission routes and the identification of possible sources and animal reservoirs. Additionally, whole-genome sequence data can inform drug and vaccine design. Indeed, genomic data can be used to identify pathogen genes interacting with the host and allows characterisation of the more evolutionary constrained regions of a pathogen genome, which should be preferentially targeted to avoid rapid drug and vaccine escape mutants.</p><p id="p0045">There are thousands of global SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequences available on the rapid data sharing service hosted by the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.epicov.org" id="ir0025">https://www.epicov.org</ext-link>) (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Elbe and Buckland-Merrett, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Shu and McCauley, 2017</xref>). The extraordinary availability of genomic data during the COVID-19 pandemic has been made possible thanks to a tremendous effort by hundreds of researchers globally depositing SARS-CoV-2 assemblies (Table S1) and the proliferation of close to real time data visualisation and analysis tools including NextStrain (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://nextstrain.org" id="ir0030">https://nextstrain.org</ext-link>) and CoV-GLUE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk" id="ir0035">http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk</ext-link>).</p><p id="p0050">In this work we use this data to analyse the genomic diversity that has emerged in the global population of SARS-CoV-2 since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, based on a download of 7710 assemblies. We focus in particular on mutations that have emerged independently multiple times (homoplasies) as these are likely candidates for ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to its novel human host. After filtering, we characterise homoplasies at 198 sites in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We identify a strong signal of recurrent mutation at nucleotide position 11,083 (Codon 3606 Orf1a), together with two further sites in Orf1ab encoding the non-structural proteins Nsp11 and Nsp13. These, together with a mutation in the Spike protein (21,575, Codon 5), comprise the strongest putative regions under selection in our dataset.</p><p id="p0055">The current distribution of genomic diversity as well as ongoing allele frequency changes both between isolates and along the SARS-CoV-2 genome are publicly available as an open access and interactive web-resource available here:</p><p id="p0060">

A full acknowledgements table of those labs which generated and uploaded data is provided in Table S1. Filtering was performed on the downloaded assemblies to exclude those deriving from animals (bat, pangolin), those with more than 1% missing sites, and otherwise spurious assemblies as also listed by nCov-GLUE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/#/excludedSeqs" id="ir0045">http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/#/excludedSeqs</ext-link>).

While results presented here predominately focus on an analysis of the available assemblies as of April 19 2020, equivalent analyses were performed daily from March 24 2020.

Resulting alignments were manually inspected in UGene (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ugene.net" id="ir0055">http://ugene.net</ext-link>).

MPBoot was run on the alignment to reconstruct the Maximum Parsimony tree and to assess branch support following 1000 replicates (&#x02212;<italic>bb 1000</italic>). The resulting Maximum Parsimony treefile was used, together with the input alignment, to rapidly identify recurrent mutations (homoplasies) using HomoplasyFinder (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Crispell et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="p0085">HomoplasyFinder provides, for each site, the minimum number of state changes required on the tree to explain the observed character states at the tips, as described by Fitch (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Fitch, 1971</xref>), and measured via the site specific consistency index. For this analysis all ambiguous sites in the alignment were set to &#x02018;N&#x02019;. To assess whether any particular Open Reading Frame (ORF) showed evidence of more homoplasies than expected given the length of the ORF, an empirical distribution was obtained by sampling, with replacement, equivalent length windows and recording the number of homoplasies detected (Table S3).</p><p id="p0090">HomoplasyFinder identified 1132 homoplasies (1042 excluding masked sites), which were distributed over the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Fig. S5, Table S4). Of these, 40 sites have a derived allele at &#x0003e;1% of the total isolates. However, homoplasies can arise due to convergent evolution (putatively adaptive), recombination, or via errors during the processing of sequence data. The latter is particularly problematic here due to the mix of technologies and methods employed by different contributing research groups. We therefore filtered identified homoplasies using a set of thresholds attempting to circumvent this problem (filtering scripts and figures are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/liampshaw/CoV-homoplasy-filtering" id="ir0060">https://github.com/liampshaw/CoV-homoplasy-filtering</ext-link>).</p><p id="p0095">In summary, for each homoplasy we computed the proportion of isolates with the homoplasy <italic>p</italic>

We also required the proportion of isolates where the homoplasic site was in close proximity to an ambiguous base (&#x000b1;&#x000a0;5&#x000a0;bp) to be zero. The application of these various filters reduced the number of homoplasies to 198 (Table S5). We also plotted the distributions of cophenetic distances between isolates carrying each homoplasy compared to the distribution for all isolates (Fig. S6), and inspected the distribution of all identified homoplasies in the phylogenies from our own analyses and on the phylogenetic visualisation platform provided by NextStrain. Finally, we examined whether ambiguous bases were seen more often at homoplasic sites than at random bases (excluding masked sites), which was not the case (Fig. S7).</p><p id="p0105">To further validate the homoplasy detection method applied to the alignment of the 7666 SARS-CoV-2 genome assemblies, we took advantage of the genome sequences for which raw reads were available on the Short Read Archive (SRA). A variant calling pipeline (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/DamienFr/CoV-homoplasy" id="ir0065">https://github.com/DamienFr/CoV-homoplasy</ext-link>) was used to obtain high-confidence alignments for the 348 (out of 889 as of April 19 2020) SRA genomic datasets both meeting our quality criterions and matching GISAID assemblies. The topology of the Maximum Likelihood phylogeny of these 348 samples was compared to that of the corresponding samples from the GISAID genome assemblies using a Mantel test and the Phytools R package (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Revell, 2012</xref>) (Figs. S8-S9, see Supplementary text).</p><p id="p0110">As discussed, the GISAID dataset comprises assemblies of variable quality, potentially impairing the detection of genuine homoplasies and/or leading to false positive SNPs due to sequencing error or spurious allele assignment during the production of the <italic>de novo</italic> assembly from raw sequence reads. Therefore, to further assess the detection of homoplasies, we applied HomoplasyFinder to the two datasets comprising the same 348 strains (GISAID and SRA) (Table S6). We detected 19 homoplasies on the dataset originating from the SRA, and 21 on the dataset originating from GISAID assemblies. Of these, 19 were detected in both datasets (Table S7). Using the same filters as for the main dataset (with the exception of the &#x02265;0.1% frequency set to &#x02265;1%), 10 and 11 homoplasies were kept in the SRA dataset and in the GISAID dataset, respectively. Nine sites were detected in both datasets. For sites which failed the filtering thresholds, this was largely due to the low number of studied accessions, which increases the probability of an isolated strain displaying a homoplasy e.g. if <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2 isolates have a homoplasy, by definition they cannot be nearest neighbours, so <italic>p</italic>

All Coronaviridae assemblies were downloaded (NCBI TaxID:11118) on April 8 2020 and human associated MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 assemblies extracted. This gave a total of 15 assemblies for SARS-CoV-1 and 255 assemblies for MERS-CoV.

This rules out any scenario that assumes SARS-CoV-2 may have been in circulation long before it was identified, and hence have already infected large proportions of the population.</p><p id="p0210">Extensive genomic resources for SARS-CoV-1 should in principle also be key to informing on optimal drug and vaccine design, particularly when coupled with knowledge of human proteome and immune interactions (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>). Ideally, drugs and vaccines should target relatively invariant, strongly constrained regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, to avoid drug resistance and vaccine evasion. Therefore ongoing monitoring of genomic changes in the virus will be essential to gain a better understanding of fundamental host-pathogen interactions that can inform drug and vaccine design.</p><p id="p0215">As most (but not all) pathogens capable of causing epidemic at a pandemic scale, SARS-CoV-2 is in all likelihood of zoonotic origin. This implies that SARS-CoV-2 may not be fine-tuned to its novel human host. However, it is near-impossible to predict future trajectories for the virulence and transmissibility of horizontally transmitted pathogens (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Anderson and May, 1991</xref>). It is also possible that the population of SARS-CoV-2 will evolve into different lineages characterised by variable levels of virulence and transmissibility. However, despite existing phylogenetic structure (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Rambaut et al., 2020</xref>), it is important to stress that there is no evidence for the evolution of distinct phenotypes in SARS-CoV-2 at this stage.</p><p id="p0220">The vast majority of mutations observed so far in SARS-CoV-2 circulating in humans are likely neutral (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Cagliani et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Dearlove et al., 2020</xref>) or even deleterious (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Nielsen et al., 2020</xref>). Homoplasies, such as those we detect here, can arise by product of neutral evolution or as a result of ongoing selection. Of the 198 homoplasies we detect (after applying stringent filters), some proportion are very likely genuine targets of positive selection which signpost to ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to its new human host. Indeed, we do observe an enrichment for non-synonymous changes (80%) in our filtered sites. As such, our provided list (Table S5) contains candidates for mutations which may affect the phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 and virus-host interactions and which require ongoing monitoring. Conversely, the finding that 78% of the homoplasic mutations involve no polarity change could still reflect strong evolutionary constraints at these positions (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Hughes, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Yampolsky et al., 2005</xref>). The remaining non-neutral changes to amino acid properties at homoplasic sites may be enriched in candidates for functionally relevant adaptation and could warrant further experimental investigation.</p><p id="p0225">One of the strongest homoplasies lies at site 11,083 in the SARS-CoV-2 genome in a region of Orf1a encoding Nsp6. This site passed our stringent filtering cirteria and was also present in our analysis of the SRA dataset (Table S7). Interestingly, this region overlaps a putative immunogenic peptide predicted to result in both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell reactivity (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Grifoni et al., 2020</xref>). More minor homoplasies amongst our top candidates, identified within Orf3a (Table S5), also map to a predicted CD4 T cell epitope. While the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is poorly understood at this point, key roles for CD4 T cells, which activate B cells for antibody production, and cytotoxic CD8 T cells, which kill virus-infected cells, are known to be important in mediating clearance in respiratory viral infections (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Kohlmeier and Woodland, 2009</xref>). Of note, we also identify a strong recurrent mutation in nucleotide position 21,575, corresponding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (codon 5). While the spike protein is the known mediator of host-cell entry, our detected homoplasy falls outside of the N-terminal and receptor binding domains.</p><p id="p0230">Our analyses presented here provide a snapshot in time of a rapidly changing situation based on available data. Although we have attempted to filter out homoplasies caused by sequencing error with stringent thresholds, and also used available short-read data to validate a subset of homoplasic sites in a smaller dataset, our analysis nevertheless remains reliant on the underlying quality of the publicly available assemblies. As such, it is possible that some results might be artefactual, and further investigation will be warranted as additional raw sequencing data becomes available.</p><p id="p0235">However, given the crucial importance of identifying potential signatures of adaptation in SARS-CoV-2 for guiding ongoing development of vaccines and treatments, we have suggested what we believe to be a plausible approach and initial list in order to facilitate future work and interpretation of the observed patterns. More data continues to be made available, which will allow ongoing investigation by ourselves and others. We believe it is important to continue to monitor SARS-CoV-2 evolution in this way and to make the results available to the scientific community. In this context, we hope that the interactive web-application we provide will help identify key recurrent mutations in SARS-CoV-2 as they emerge and spread.</p></sec><sec id="s0070"><title>Author contributions</title><p id="p0240">L.v.D., and F.B. conceived and designed the study; L.v.D., M.A, D.R L.P.S., C.E.F., L.O., C.J.O., J.P., C.C.S.T., F.A.T.B., and A.T.O analysed data and performed computational analyses; L.v.D., and F.B. wrote the paper with inputs from all co-authors.</p></sec><sec id="s0075"><title>Acknowledgments and funding</title><p id="p0245">L.v.D and F.B. acknowledge financial support from the <funding-source id="gts0005">Newton Fund UK-China NSFC</funding-source> initiative (grant MR/P007597/1) and the <funding-source id="gts0010"><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>BBSRC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source> (equipment grant BB/R01356X/1).
