<p id="p0110">As discussed, the GISAID dataset comprises assemblies of variable quality, potentially impairing the detection of genuine homoplasies and/or leading to false positive SNPs due to sequencing error or spurious allele assignment during the production of the 
 <italic>de novo</italic> assembly from raw sequence reads. Therefore, to further assess the detection of homoplasies, we applied HomoplasyFinder to the two datasets comprising the same 348 strains (GISAID and SRA) (Table S6). We detected 19 homoplasies on the dataset originating from the SRA, and 21 on the dataset originating from GISAID assemblies. Of these, 19 were detected in both datasets (Table S7). Using the same filters as for the main dataset (with the exception of the ≥0.1% frequency set to ≥1%), 10 and 11 homoplasies were kept in the SRA dataset and in the GISAID dataset, respectively. Nine sites were detected in both datasets. For sites which failed the filtering thresholds, this was largely due to the low number of studied accessions, which increases the probability of an isolated strain displaying a homoplasy e.g. if 
 <italic>n</italic> = 2 isolates have a homoplasy, by definition they cannot be nearest neighbours, so 
 <italic>p</italic>

  <italic>n</italic>n
