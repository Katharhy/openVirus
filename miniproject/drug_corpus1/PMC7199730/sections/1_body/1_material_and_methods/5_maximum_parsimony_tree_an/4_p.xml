<p id="p0090">HomoplasyFinder identified 1132 homoplasies (1042 excluding masked sites), which were distributed over the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Fig. S5, Table S4). Of these, 40 sites have a derived allele at &gt;1% of the total isolates. However, homoplasies can arise due to convergent evolution (putatively adaptive), recombination, or via errors during the processing of sequence data. The latter is particularly problematic here due to the mix of technologies and methods employed by different contributing research groups. We therefore filtered identified homoplasies using a set of thresholds attempting to circumvent this problem (filtering scripts and figures are available at
