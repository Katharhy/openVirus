<p id="p0100">To obtain a set of high confidence homoplasies, we then used the following criteria: ≥0.1% isolates in the alignment share the homoplasy (equivalent to &gt;8 isolates),

 </sub> &gt; 0.1, and derived allele found in strains sequenced from &gt;1 originating lab and &gt; 1 submitting lab. We also required the proportion of isolates where the homoplasic site was in close proximity to an ambiguous base (± 5 bp) to be zero. The application of these various filters reduced the number of homoplasies to 198 (Table S5). We also plotted the distributions of cophenetic distances between isolates carrying each homoplasy compared to the distribution for all isolates (Fig. S6), and inspected the distribution of all identified homoplasies in the phylogenies from our own analyses and on the phylogenetic visualisation platform provided by NextStrain. Finally, we examined whether ambiguous bases were seen more often at homoplasic sites than at random bases (excluding masked sites), which was not the case (Fig. S7).
