<p id="p0085">HomoplasyFinder provides, for each site, the minimum number of state changes required on the tree to explain the observed character states at the tips, as described by Fitch (
 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Fitch, 1971</xref>), and measured via the site specific consistency index. For this analysis all ambiguous sites in the alignment were set to ‘N’. To assess whether any particular Open Reading Frame (ORF) showed evidence of more homoplasies than expected given the length of the ORF, an empirical distribution was obtained by sampling, with replacement, equivalent length windows and recording the number of homoplasies detected (Table S3).
