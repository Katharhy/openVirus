<p id="p0105">To further validate the homoplasy detection method applied to the alignment of the 7666 SARS-CoV-2 genome assemblies, we took advantage of the genome sequences for which raw reads were available on the Short Read Archive (SRA). A variant calling pipeline (available at

The topology of the Maximum Likelihood phylogeny of these 348 samples was compared to that of the corresponding samples from the GISAID genome assemblies using a Mantel test and the Phytools R package (
