<p id="p0125">MPBoot (
 <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Hoang et al., 2018</xref>) was run on both sets of alignments to reconstruct the maximum parsimony tree and to assess branch support following 1000 replicates (âˆ’
 <italic>bb 1000</italic>). The resulting maximum parsimony treefiles were used, together with the input alignment, to rapidly identify homoplasies using HomoplasyFinder (
 <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Crispell et al., 2019</xref>). For SARS-CoV-1 we detected six homoplasies and for MERS-CoV we detected 350 homoplasies (pre-filtering) (Fig. S11-S12). The distribution of homoplasies was assessed relative to the Genbank annotation files and in the context of the high confidence homoplasies that we detect in SARS-CoV-2.
