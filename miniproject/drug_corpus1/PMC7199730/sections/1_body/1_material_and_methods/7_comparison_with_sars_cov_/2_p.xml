<p id="p0120">SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV are both zoonotic pathogens related to SARS-CoV-2, which underwent a host jump into the human host previously. We investigated whether the major homoplasies we detect in SARS-CoV-2 affect sites which also underwent recurrent mutations in these related viruses as these adapted to their human host. All Coronaviridae assemblies were downloaded (NCBI TaxID:11118) on April 8 2020 and human associated MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 assemblies extracted. This gave a total of 15 assemblies for SARS-CoV-1 and 255 assemblies for MERS-CoV. Following the same protocol (Augur align) as applied to SARS-CoV-2 assemblies, each species was aligned against the respective RefSeq reference genomes: NC_004718.3 for SARS-CoV-1 and NC_019843.3 for MERS-CoV. This produced alignments of 29,751 bp (187 SNPs) and 30,119 bp (1588 SNPs) respectively.</p>
