<p id="p0075">The maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was tested for the presence of significant molecular evolution over the sampling period using the roottotip() function provided in BactDating (
 <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Didelot et al., 2018</xref>). After confirmation of a significant regression following 1000 random permutations of sampling dates (Fig. S3), temporal calibration of the phylogeny was performed using TreeDater (
 <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Volz and Frost, 2017</xref>), assuming a strict clock model of evolution, as we do not expect a significant difference in rate variation across lineages at these time scales (Fig. S4). To obtain confidence intervals around each temporal point estimate we conducted a parametric bootstrapping analysis with 50 replicates on the unmasked alignment, keeping the tree topology constant while generating new branch length estimates using a Poisson distribution and running the same model in TreeDater (
 <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Volz and Frost, 2017</xref>). We also evaluated all currently available estimates for tip-calibration estimates of the tMRCA of SARS-CoV-2 together with rate estimates for other closely related betacoronaviruses (
