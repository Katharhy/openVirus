<p id="p0070">Assemblies were aligned against the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome (NC_045512.2, EPI_ISL_402125) using MAFFT (
 <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Katoh and Standley, 2013</xref>) implemented via the rapid phylodynamic alignment pipeline provided by Augur (

Sites in the first 130 bp and last 50 bp of the alignment were masked, as were positions 18,529, 29,849, 29,851 and 29,853, following the protocol also advocated by NextStrain and to account for the fact many putatively artefactual SNPs are located at the beginning and ends of the alignment. Resulting alignments were manually inspected in UGene (
