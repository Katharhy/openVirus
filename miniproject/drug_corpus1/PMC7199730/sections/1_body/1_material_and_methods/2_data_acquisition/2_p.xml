<p id="p0065">7710 SARS-CoV-2 assemblies flagged as “complete (&gt;29,000 bp)”, “high coverage only”, “low coverage excl” were downloaded from the GISAID Initiative EpiCoV platform as of April 19 2020 (11:30 GMT). A full acknowledgements table of those labs which generated and uploaded data is provided in Table S1. Filtering was performed on the downloaded assemblies to exclude those deriving from animals (bat, pangolin), those with more than 1% missing sites, and otherwise spurious assemblies as also listed by nCov-GLUE (

This left a final dataset of 7666 assemblies for downstream analysis. Sequence metadata was obtained from the NextStrain Github repository (

While results presented here predominately focus on an analysis of the available assemblies as of April 19 2020, equivalent analyses were performed daily from March 24 2020. This allowed tracking of the emergence of genomic variants in public sequence data as assemblies were uploaded during the course of the pandemic.
