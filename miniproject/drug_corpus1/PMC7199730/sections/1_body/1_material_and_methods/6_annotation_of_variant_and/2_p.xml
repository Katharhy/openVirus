<p id="p0115">The alignment was translated to amino acid sequences using SeaView V4 (
 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Gouy et al., 2010</xref>). Sites were identified as synonymous or non-synonymous and amino acid changes corresponding to these mutations were retrieved via multiple sequence alignment. We assessed the change in hydrophobicity and charge of amino acid residues arising due to homoplastic non-synonymous mutations using the hydrophobicity scale proposed by Janin (
 <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Janin, 1979</xref>). The ten most hydrophobic residues on this scale were considered hydrophobic and the rest as hydrophilic. In addition, amino acid residues were either classified as positively charged, negatively charged or neutral at pHÂ 7. The charge of each residue can either increase, decrease or remain the same (neutral mutation) due to mutation (Fig. S10).
