<p id="p0210">Extensive genomic resources for SARS-CoV-1 should in principle also be key to informing on optimal drug and vaccine design, particularly when coupled with knowledge of human proteome and immune interactions (
 <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>). Ideally, drugs and vaccines should target relatively invariant, strongly constrained regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, to avoid drug resistance and vaccine evasion. Therefore ongoing monitoring of genomic changes in the virus will be essential to gain a better understanding of fundamental host-pathogen interactions that can inform drug and vaccine design.
