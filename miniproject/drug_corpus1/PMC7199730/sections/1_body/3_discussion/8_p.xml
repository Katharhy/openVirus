 <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Nielsen et al., 2020</xref>). Homoplasies, such as those we detect here, can arise by product of neutral evolution or as a result of ongoing selection. Of the 198 homoplasies we detect (after applying stringent filters), some proportion are very likely genuine targets of positive selection which signpost to ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to its new human host. Indeed, we do observe an enrichment for non-synonymous changes (80%) in our filtered sites. As such, our provided list (Table S5) contains candidates for mutations which may affect the phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 and virus-host interactions and which require ongoing monitoring. Conversely, the finding that 78% of the homoplasic mutations involve no polarity change could still reflect strong evolutionary constraints at these positions (

 <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Yampolsky et al., 2005</xref>). The remaining non-neutral changes to amino acid properties at homoplasic sites may be enriched in candidates for functionally relevant adaptation and could warrant further experimental investigation.
