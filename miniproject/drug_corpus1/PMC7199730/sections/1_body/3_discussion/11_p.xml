<p id="p0235">However, given the crucial importance of identifying potential signatures of adaptation in SARS-CoV-2 for guiding ongoing development of vaccines and treatments, we have suggested what we believe to be a plausible approach and initial list in order to facilitate future work and interpretation of the observed patterns. More data continues to be made available, which will allow ongoing investigation by ourselves and others. We believe it is important to continue to monitor SARS-CoV-2 evolution in this way and to make the results available to the scientific community. In this context, we hope that the interactive web-application we provide will help identify key recurrent mutations in SARS-CoV-2 as they emerge and spread.</p>
