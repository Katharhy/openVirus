<p id="p0230">Our analyses presented here provide a snapshot in time of a rapidly changing situation based on available data. Although we have attempted to filter out homoplasies caused by sequencing error with stringent thresholds, and also used available short-read data to validate a subset of homoplasic sites in a smaller dataset, our analysis nevertheless remains reliant on the underlying quality of the publicly available assemblies. As such, it is possible that some results might be artefactual, and further investigation will be warranted as additional raw sequencing data becomes available.</p>
