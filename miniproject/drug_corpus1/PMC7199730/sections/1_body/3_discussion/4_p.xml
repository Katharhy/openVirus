<p id="p0200">To put these numbers of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in context, it is interesting to consider parallels with the 2009 H1N1pdm influenza pandemic, the first epidemic for which genetic sequence data was generated in near-real time (

 <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2009</xref>). The genetic data available at the time looks staggeringly small in comparison to the amount that has already been generated for SARS-CoV-2 during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, Fraser et al. considered 11 partial hemagglutinin gene sequences two months after the WHO had declared 2009 H1N1pdm influenza a pandemic (
