<p id="p0195">One positive aspect of the current situation, relative to previous pandemics, is the unprecedented availability of scientific and technological means to face COVID-19. In particular, the rapid development of drugs and vaccines has already begun. Modern drug and vaccine development are largely based on genetic engineering and an understanding of host-pathogen interactions at a molecular level. The mobilisation to address the COVID-19 pandemic by scientists worldwide has been remarkable. This includes the feat of the global scientific community who has already produced and publicly shared well over 11,000 complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences at the time of writing (April 23 2020), which we have used here with gratitude. Further initatives in the United Kingdom (
