<p id="p0215">As most (but not all) pathogens capable of causing epidemic at a pandemic scale, SARS-CoV-2 is in all likelihood of zoonotic origin. This implies that SARS-CoV-2 may not be fine-tuned to its novel human host. However, it is near-impossible to predict future trajectories for the virulence and transmissibility of horizontally transmitted pathogens (
 <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Anderson and May, 1991</xref>). It is also possible that the population of SARS-CoV-2 will evolve into different lineages characterised by variable levels of virulence and transmissibility. However, despite existing phylogenetic structure (
 <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Rambaut et al., 2020</xref>), it is important to stress that there is no evidence for the evolution of distinct phenotypes in SARS-CoV-2 at this stage.
