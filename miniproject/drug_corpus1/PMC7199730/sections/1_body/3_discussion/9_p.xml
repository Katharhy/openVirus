<p id="p0225">One of the strongest homoplasies lies at site 11,083 in the SARS-CoV-2 genome in a region of Orf1a encoding Nsp6. This site passed our stringent filtering cirteria and was also present in our analysis of the SRA dataset (Table S7). Interestingly, this region overlaps a putative immunogenic peptide predicted to result in both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell reactivity (
 <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Grifoni et al., 2020</xref>). More minor homoplasies amongst our top candidates, identified within Orf3a (Table S5), also map to a predicted CD4 T cell epitope. While the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is poorly understood at this point, key roles for CD4 T cells, which activate B cells for antibody production, and cytotoxic CD8 T cells, which kill virus-infected cells, are known to be important in mediating clearance in respiratory viral infections (

Of note, we also identify a strong recurrent mutation in nucleotide position 21,575, corresponding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (codon 5). While the spike protein is the known mediator of host-cell entry, our detected homoplasy falls outside of the N-terminal and receptor binding domains.
