<p id="p0145">Some of the major clades in the maximum likelihood phylogeny (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>c and Fig. S1) are formed predominantly by strains sampled from the same continent. However, this likely represents a temporal rather than a geographic signal. Indeed, the earliest available strains were collected in Asia, where the COVID-19 pandemic started, followed by extensive genome sequencing efforts first in Europe and then in the USA.
