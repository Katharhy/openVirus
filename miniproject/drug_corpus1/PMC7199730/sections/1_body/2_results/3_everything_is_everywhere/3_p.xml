<p id="p0150">The SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity found in most countries (with sufficient sequences) essentially recapitulates the global diversity of COVID-19 from the 7666-genome dataset. 
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> highlights the proportion of the global genetic diversity found in the UK, the USA, Iceland and China. In the UK, the USA and Iceland, the majority of the global genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 is recapitulated, with representatives of all major clades present in each of the countries (
