<p id="p0155">This genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 populations circulating in different countries points to each of these local epidemics having been seeded by a large number of independent introductions of the virus. The main exception to this pattern is China, the source of the initial outbreak, where only a fraction of the global diversity is present (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>d). This is also to an extent the case for Italy (Fig. S2b), which was an early focus of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this global dataset includes only 35 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Italy, so some of the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 strains in circulation likely remains unsampled. The genomic diversity of the global SARS-CoV-2 population being recapitulated in multiple countries points to extensive worldwide transmission of COVID-19, likely from extremely early on in the pandemic.
