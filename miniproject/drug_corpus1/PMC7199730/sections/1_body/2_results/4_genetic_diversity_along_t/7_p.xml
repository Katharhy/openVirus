<p id="p0185">The genome alignment of the 7666 SARS-CoV-2 genomes can be queried through an open access, interactive web-application (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://macman123.shinyapps.io/ugi-scov2-alignment-screen/" id="ir0075" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://macman123.shinyapps.io/ugi-scov2-alignment-screen/</ext-link>). It provides users with information on every SNP and homoplasy detected across our global SARS-CoV-2 alignment and allows visual inspection both within the sequence alignment and across the maximum likelihood tree phylogeny. 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> illustrates some of the functionalities of the web application using position 11083 in the alignment as an example. This particular homoplasy was observed 1126 times across the genomes and requires a minimum of 37 character-site changes to become congruent with the observed SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny (
