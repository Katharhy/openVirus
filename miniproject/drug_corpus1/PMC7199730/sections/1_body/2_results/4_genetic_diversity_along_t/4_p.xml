<p id="p0170">Amongst the strongest filtered homoplasic sites (&gt;15 change points on the tree), three are found within Orf1ab (nucleotide positions 11,083, 13,402, 16,887) and S (21575). We exemplify the strongest signal and our approach using position 11,083 in 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and provide a full list of homoplasic sites, both filtered and unfiltered, in Tables S4â€“5. The strongest hit in terms of the inferred minimum number of changes required (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b-c) at Orf1ab (11,083, Codon 3606) falls over a region encoding the non-structural protein, Nsp6, and is also observed in our analyses of the SRA dataset (Table S7).
