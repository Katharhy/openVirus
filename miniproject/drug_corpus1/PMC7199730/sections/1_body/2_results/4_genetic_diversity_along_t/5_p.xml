Orf1ab is an orthologous gene with other human-associated betacoronaviruses, in particular SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV which both underwent host jumps into humans from likely bat reservoirs (

 <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Memish et al., 2013</xref>). We performed an equivalent analysis on human-associated virus assemblies available on the NCBI Virus platform. We identified six putative homoplasic sites within SARS-CoV-1, two occurring within the 3c-like proteinase just upstream of Nsp6 (10,384, 10,793) and a further two homoplasies within Orf1ab at Nsp9 and Nsp13 (Fig. S11). In addition, one homoplasy was identified in the spike protein and one in the membrane protein ORFs.
