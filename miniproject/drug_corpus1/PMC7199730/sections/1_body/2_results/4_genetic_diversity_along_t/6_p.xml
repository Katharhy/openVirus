<p id="p0180">For MERS-CoV, multiple unfiltered homoplasies were detected, consistent with previous observations of high recombination in this species (
 <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Dudas and Rambaut, 2016</xref>), though only one invoked more than a minimum number of 10 changes on the maximum parsimony tree (Fig. S12). This corresponded to a a further homoplasy identified in Orf1ab Nsp6 (position 11,631). It is of note that this genomic region coincides with the strongest homoplasy in SARS-CoV-2 which also occurs in the Nsp6 encoding region of Orf1ab. Codon 3606 of Orf1ab shares a leucine residue in MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, though a valine in SARS-CoV. The exact role of these and other homoplasic mutations in human associated betacoronaviruses represents an important area of future work, although it appears that the Orf1ab region may exhibit multiple putatively adapted variants across human betacoronavirus lineages.
