<p id="p0160">The SARS-CoV-2 alignment can be considered as broken into a large two-part Open Reading Frame (ORF) encoding non-structural proteins, four structure proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), and a set of small accessory factors (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>a). There is variation in genetic diversity across the alignment, with polymorphisms often found in neighbouring clusters (Fig. S5). A simple permutation resampling approach suggests that both Orf3a and N exhibit SNPs which fall in the 95th percentile of the empirical distribution (Table S3). However, not all of these sites can be confirmed as true variant positions, due to the lack of accompanying sequence read data. However, we closely inspected those sites that appear to have arisen multiple times following a maximum parsimony tree building step. We identified a large number of putative homoplasies (
