<p id="p0165">These 198 positions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome alignment (0.67% of all sites) were associated with 290 amino acid changes across all 7666 genomes. Of these amino acid changes, 232 comprised non-synonymous and 58 comprised synonymous mutations. Two non-synonymous mutations involved the introduction or removal of stop codons were found (*13402Y, *26152G). 53 of the remaining 101 non-synonymous mutations involved neutral hydrophobicity changes (Fig. S10a). In addition, 79 of the remaining 101 non-synonymous mutations involved neutral changes (Fig. S10b). Both Orf1ab and N had a four-fold higher frequency of hydrophilic → hydrophobic mutations than hydrophobic → hydrophilic mutations (Fig. S10). In addition, neutral hydrophobic changes were clearly favoured in the S protein. Lastly, 87 of the remaining 110 non-synonymous mutations involved neutral charge changes.</p>
