<p id="p0130">The 7666 SARS-CoV-2 genomes offer an excellent geographical and temporal coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a-b). The genomic diversity of the 7666 SARS-CoV-2 genomes is represented as Maximum Likelihood phylogenies in a radial (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>c) and linear layout (Fig. S1-S2). There is a robust temporal signal in the data, captured by a statistically significant correlation between sampling dates and ‘root-to-tip’ distances for the 7666 SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. S3;

 <sup>2</sup> = 0. 20, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Such positive association between sampling time and evolution is expected to arise in the presence of measurable evolution over the timeframe over which the genetic data was collected. Specifically, more recently sampled strains have accumulated additional mutations in their genome than older ones since their divergence from the Most Recent Common Ancestor (MRCA, root of the tree).
