<p id="p0140">The SARS-CoV-2 global population has accumulated only moderate genetic diversity at this stage of the COVID-19 pandemic with an average pairwise difference of 9.6 SNPs between any two genomes, providing further support for a relatively recent common ancestor. We estimated a mutation rate underlying the global diversity of SARS-Cov-2 of ~6 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> nucleotides/genome/year (CI: 4 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>–7 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>) obtained following time calibration of the maximum likelihood phylogeny. This rate is largely unremarkable for an RNA virus (
