<p id="p0035">Coronaviridae comprise a large number of lineages that are found in a wide range of mammals and birds (
 <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Shaw et al., 2020</xref>), including the other human zoonotic pathogens SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-COV. The propensity of Betacoronaviridiae to undergo frequent host jumps supports SARS-CoV-2 also being of zoonotic origin. To date, the genetically closest-known lineage is found in horseshoe bats (BatCoV RaTG13) (
 <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). However, this lineage shares 96% identity with SARS-CoV-2, which is not sufficiently high to implicate it as the immediate ancestor of SARS-CoV-2. The zoonotic source of the virus remains unidentified at the date of writing (April 23 2020).
