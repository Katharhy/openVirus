<p id="p0040">The analysis of genetic sequence data from pathogens is increasingly recognised as an important tool in infectious disease epidemiology (

 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Grenfell et al., 2004</xref>). Genetic sequence data sheds light on key epidemiological parameters such as doubling time of an outbreak/epidemic, reconstruction of transmission routes and the identification of possible sources and animal reservoirs. Additionally, whole-genome sequence data can inform drug and vaccine design. Indeed, genomic data can be used to identify pathogen genes interacting with the host and allows characterisation of the more evolutionary constrained regions of a pathogen genome, which should be preferentially targeted to avoid rapid drug and vaccine escape mutants.
