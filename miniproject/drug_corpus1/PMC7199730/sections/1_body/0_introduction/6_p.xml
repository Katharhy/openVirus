<p id="p0050">In this work we use this data to analyse the genomic diversity that has emerged in the global population of SARS-CoV-2 since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, based on a download of 7710 assemblies. We focus in particular on mutations that have emerged independently multiple times (homoplasies) as these are likely candidates for ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to its novel human host. After filtering, we characterise homoplasies at 198 sites in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We identify a strong signal of recurrent mutation at nucleotide position 11,083 (Codon 3606 Orf1a), together with two further sites in Orf1ab encoding the non-structural proteins Nsp11 and Nsp13. These, together with a mutation in the Spike protein (21,575, Codon 5), comprise the strongest putative regions under selection in our dataset.</p>
