  <p>Inspection of a major homoplastic site in Orf1ab of SARS-CoV-2 genome (position 11,083). Panel A shows a colour-coded schematic of the SARS-CoV-2 genome annotated as per NC_045512.2 and a plot of all potential homoplastic sites in Orf1ab measured as minimal number of character-state changes on a Maximum Parsimony tree (see Methods). Exemplar homoplasy (denoted with *) has been shown on the radial ML phylogenetic tree in panel B. Panel C shows the distribution of cophenetic distances between isolates carrying the identified homoplasy (red) and the distribution for all isolates (grey), showing that isolates with the homoplasy tend to cluster in the phylogeny. Equivalent figures for other filtered homoplasies are generated as part of the filtering method (see Methods). (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)</p>
