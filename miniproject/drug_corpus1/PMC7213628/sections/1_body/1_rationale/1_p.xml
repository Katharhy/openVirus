<p>ECMO use has been increasing in severe respiratory and/or cardiac failure despite implementation of conventional care. This technology has been proven valuable in treating viral pneumonia during the pandemic influenza A H1N1 in 2009.

 </sup> The epidemics caused by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 led to a fatality rate of up to 34.4%.

 </sup> The therapeutic effect of ECMO should be considered in Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), whose causes of death during the epidemics were predominantly refractory hypoxemia and multi-organ failure, similar to COVID-19. Alshahrani

 </sup> reported 35 MERS-CoV infected patients who were critically ill with refractory hypoxemia (partial pressure of arterial oxygen [PaO
 <sub>2</sub>]/fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO
 <sub>2</sub>] &lt;100â€ŠmmHg), of which 17 had received veno-venous ECMO (VV-ECMO). Compared with that in patients receiving only conventional respiratory care, the fatality of those who had received ECMO was significantly lower (65%
