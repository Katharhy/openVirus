<p>Recognized as a highly skilled and high-risk operation, ECMO is frequently demanded in the rescue of COVID-19 patients. We call for an action to establish more ECMO centers in affected cities with numerous COVID-19 cases, especially in Hubei province. Expert ECMO teams should be organized for immediate and professional rescue. A standard ICU single room is recommended, and daily care by ICU-specialized nursing teams should be established to avoid lethal complications. All ECMO-related equipment and consumables should be distributed or deployed by a centralized department.</p>
