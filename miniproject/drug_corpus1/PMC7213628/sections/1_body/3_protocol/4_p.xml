<p>Key knowledge gaps about ECMO include the need for more actionable data linking to the novel disease. More information is needed on the pathophysiology and effective treatment of COVID-19 patients. Each ECMO team will face new serious challenges in this battle. Information collected from the practice of ECMO for severe COVID-19 must be compiled and shared. We call for the creation of recommendable ECMO procedures and the rescue of severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients.</p>
