<p>Autopsy findings of deaths due to infection with the new virus (COVID-19) revealed that mortality was lower in pulmonary patients compared to cardiac patients or patients with diabetes, and mortality of hypertensive patients was similar to that in lung patients. Doctors quickly looked to see if any of the existing medicines were leading to an improvement in their condition. First, Chinese experts have shown that the antimalarial drug (chloroquine) is effective in patients. Then, a few days ago, French researchers showed in a very small group of patients that the concomitant administration of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (Sumamed) had an even better effect in COVID-19 patients. Although these studies are insufficient (due to small sample size and poor clinical experimental design), they indicate that, despite the adverse effects of Azithromycin (severe diarrhea due to Clostridium difficile and prolonged QT interval on ECG), mortality due to infection with a new virus. It should be noted that in 1980, researchers at the PLIVA drug factory found a macrolide antibiotic, Azithromycin, but sold all distribution rights to the European Community and the US in 1986 to Pfizer (
