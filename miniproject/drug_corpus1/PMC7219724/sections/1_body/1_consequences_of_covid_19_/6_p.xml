<p>Some pharmacologists believe that because certain growth-inhibiting agents, such as Cepharanthin, Selamectin or Mefloquine hydrochloride, affect replication of coronaviruses in vitro, these agents might be used to treat COVID-19 infection in vivo, but it will first be necessary to check their clinical efficacy of Cepharanthin (an ingredient in the local plant Stephania cephalantha) has been used in Japan since almost 70 years ago for a number of acute and chronic diseases because it has various pharmacological effect including anti-inflamatory, anticancer, and antiviral effects (

There is a considerable debate among biomedical scientists and physicians as to whether patients should stop taking ACE inhibitors (ACEI: Enalapril, Lisinopril, Ramipril and others) and angiotensin receptor blocking drugs (ARB: Losartan, Eprosartan, Valsartan and others) due to their increase of ACE-2 activity and rise of the ACE-2 receptors (

Controlled clinical trials will establish whether these drugs should be temporarily discontinued (and in which patients) or whether they should even be given to individuals infected with COVID-19. For now, no one should omit taking any of these medicines.
