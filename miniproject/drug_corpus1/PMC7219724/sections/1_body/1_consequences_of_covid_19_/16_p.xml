<p>During the SARS epidemics in 2003 and the MERS epidemic in 2012 caused by the SARS COV-1 virus, the course of the disease responded to acute respiratory viral infections, but a large number of patients had more severe forms of the disease followed by fatal outcome (

Impairment in the immune response to the virus led to severe respiratory failure, which was accompanied by alveo-capillary block due to the diffuse inflammation of the alveolar and vascular structures of the lung, as the bodyâ€™s immune system activates proinflammatory mediators (cytokines and others) that cause block of the alveolar activation and surfactant inactivation. This condition is known as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and requires the respirator application (
