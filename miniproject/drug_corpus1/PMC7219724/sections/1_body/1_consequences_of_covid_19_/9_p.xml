<p>The EMA highlighted that most ibuprofen-containing medicines in the EU are authorised at national level, as a painkiller and in some countries also as an antipyretic (fever treatment medicine). They are widely available over the counter and on prescription. Oral Ibuprofen (over the counter or with a prescription) is used, depending on the presentation, in adults, children and infants from the age of three months, for the short-term treatment of fever and/or pain such as headaches, flu, dental pain and dysmenorrhoea (period pain).

Ibuprofen has also been authorised centrally as Pedea to treat ‘patent ductus arteriosus’ in newborn premature babies (
