<p>In late 2019, a cohort of patients presenting with pneumonia of varying acuity and unknown aetiology in Wuhan, China, heralded the outset of COVID-19. As of 30.03.2020, total of 770,165 confirmed cases (including 36,938 deaths in 152 geographical territories) have been reported to the WHO, and this number is still increasing. Although COVID-19 appears to have greater infectivity and lower mortality than SARS and MERS, many uncertainties (including route of infection, viral evolution, epidemic dynamics, appropriate anti-viral treatment, and strategies for disease control) remain.

Some believe that a later evaluation of all the more modern epidemiological measures will show whether all of them are justified, as experts point to procedures that curb a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) caused by another type of virus Corona.
