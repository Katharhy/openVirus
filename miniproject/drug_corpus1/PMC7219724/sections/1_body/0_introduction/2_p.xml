<p>COVID-19 is the disease caused by an infection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, first identified in the city of Wuhan, in Chinaâ€ºs Hubei province in December 2019. COVID-19 was previously known as 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) respiratory disease before the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the official name as COVID-19 in February 2020. A new respiratory disease - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) - is spreading globally and there have been instances of COVID-19 community spread in the United States. COVID-19 spreads by contact with respiratory droplets that spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Respiratory virus infection is a major source of global pandemics as a consequence of swift human-to-human respiratory tract transmission. Within the past two decades, coronaviruses and influenza viruses have hit the world several times, causing significant mortality, economic loss, and global panic. The SARS outbreak in 2002 triggered 916 deaths among more than 8000 patients in 29 countries, followed by the emergence of MERS in 2012, which resulted in at least 800 deaths among 2254 patients in 27 countries (
