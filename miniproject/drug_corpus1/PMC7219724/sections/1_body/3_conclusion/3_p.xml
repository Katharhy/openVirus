<p>If they are infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, highest risk population are at increased risk of serious illness. Ill visitors and healthcare personnel (Epidemilogists, Family phisycians, Patronage nurses, Health care staff for testing risk population, Emergency health care medical professionals, Red Cross staff, etc) are the most likely sources of introduction of COVID-19 into a facility. WHO recommends aggressive visitor restrictions and enforcing sick leave policies for ill HCP, even before COVID-19 is identified in a community or facility.

Unfortunately, publich health sector in our country is still limited to be effective like it was in previously organized Health Care System in former Yugoslavia with centralized „red and green“ lines of making decissions for every prevention tasks and measures from local communities to higest (national) level.

Probaly we will stay on main goals for everybody: 
 <italic>„stay at home and keep yourself“</italic> and follow instructions how to use proposed and recommended preventive measures from public health experts, besides main act till now - testing of risk people and stay at home and improve your immunity system. Especially patients registered with CVD, Diabetes mellitus, cancers, and respiratory diseases.
