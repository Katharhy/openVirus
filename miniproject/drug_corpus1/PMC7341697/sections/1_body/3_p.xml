<p>Pandemic is not pandemic. Avian influenza and the most recent outbreak of Ebola, which took place in Africa represent the main background for current ethical guidance documents. Since then, many topics have dramatically changed and we are confronted with completely new and expanding issues, which increase with time and location of the worldwide spread of the coronavirus. One can predict that key issues and ethical guidelines will look much different after the end of the coronavirus pandemic; however, we do need an ethical decision-making framework which guides us in providing systematic and practical answers to ethical questions.</p>
