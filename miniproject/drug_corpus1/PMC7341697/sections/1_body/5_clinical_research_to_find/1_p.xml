<p>The uniqueness of COVID-19 is that it is new and unknown in its properties, highly contagious, and there are no specific drugs nor vaccines to treat the patients or prevent infection. All the identified potential drugs and antivirals have to be screened to find out if they are an option; however, they are not made specifically for the coronavirus, many are not licensed treatments yet. That means they have to undergo a standard clinical trial research program to expand the indications or to get the market authorization. Even in a desperate situation and the given pressure of public and governments for speed as with COVID-19, it is necessary to compare the identified options with the local standard of care in large randomized controlled clinical trials in as many countries as possible to generate valid results quickly and as scientifically sound as possible. Small trials or compassionate use programs will not be able to provide robust data in a comparable time and are thus not giving proper scientific evaluation, which is ethically unacceptable. Bad science is unethical and dangerous since it might be harmful for patients. Drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine have well-documented risks; administering the drug outside of any adequate clinical trial for COVID-19 would be unjustifiable without any clear clinical benefit [
