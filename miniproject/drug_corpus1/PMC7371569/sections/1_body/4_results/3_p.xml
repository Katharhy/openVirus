 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the patient and treatment characteristics assumptions used in the model to inform critical drug requirements. The ICU population uptake (%) and average treatment length (days) for each therapeutic group was derived from the original suggested uptake data (Borthwick, Barton and Graham-Clarke, 2020) and further adjusted according to real-world usage data from both local and national sources. The ICU population uptake allows for differentiation between levels of ICU patient and the differing treatment requirements of patients. The average length of treatment with a particular drug can help project critical drug requirements per patient based on predicted average length of ICU stay. This considers the fact that patients may not require treatment with a particular drug for the full length of their ICU admission. For example, using the data in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>, it is estimated that only 50% of patients will require treatment with a vasopressor for 5 days based on a typical COVID-related ICU stay of 12.4 days. Changing any one of the variables in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref> automatically alters the requirement output of critical care drugs and can be adjusted as necessary in response to the COVID-19 population requirements.
