Introduction</div> <p>The COVID-19 pandemic is the single greatest challenge to face healthcare, worldwide, since the Asian Flu in 1957. In the UK, more than 21 000 deaths in hospital have now been associated with the virus.<a href="#R1">1</a></p> <p>Widespread social and healthcare-related interventions and measures have been introduced by the UK government to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with this infection. Social measures imposed include social distancing, self-isolation and lockdown; healthcare measures incorporate escalating resources and capacity within the National Health Service and other services to meet demand and the anticipated surge. These interventions are on a scale never before witnessed.</p> <p>Pharmaceutical interventions and medicines optimisation are essential components of the healthcare response to COVID-19. Medicines are a clinical priority and are required to support both patients and front-line clinical staff in their efforts to deal with the virus and to optimise patient care. As a result, there has been an unprecedented global demand on supportive medicines, particularly in critical care.</p> <p>Assuring the availability of critical medicines at the point of need during a pandemic is particularly complex. The balance between â€˜normalâ€™ supply and demand is eroded as demand escalates and organisations may order excess stock to maintain continuity of supply, placing further pressure on already constrained medicines and the supply chain. Fair and equitable distribution of available stock is also a challenge.</p> <p>A collaborative approach to planning is required, between manufacturers, wholesalers/suppliers, health departments, Trusts and medicines procurement specialists. A key component of this is to estimate critical drug requirements to meet demand both currently and for the anticipated surge.</p> </div> <div class="aim" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Aim</div> <p>To develop a process to estimate critical care drug requirements to robustly inform procurement planning and preparedness in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p> </div> <div class="objectives" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Objectives</div> <ul> <li> <p>Identify critical care drugs required regionally in the COVID-19 pandemic.</p> </li> <li> <p>Obtain regional usage data for these drugs and consider current regional practice to establish requirement.</p> </li> </ul> </div> <div class="methodology" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Methodology</div> <p>Health and Social Care (HSC) Trusts across Northern Ireland (NI) identified critical care drugs required in the pandemic and provided an estimation of average daily usage data for these drugs per patient. A Microsoft Excel database was constructed to compile the Trust data and to establish the regional requirement for critical care drugs. Any gaps in dosage data were populated with typical <i>British National Formulary</i> daily doses for an 80 kg adult requiring ventilation in intensive care.<a href="#R2">2</a></p> <p>The database was refined further according to real-world data from NI HSC Trusts, the 17 April 2020 Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre report on COVID-19 in critical care (including data from England, Wales and NI), daily regional COVID-19 figures published by the NI Department of Health and other National data available at the time.<a href="#R3">3 4</a></p> <p>An unpublished tool originally developed to assist in predicting critical care medicine requirements for the H1N1 swine influenza 2009 pandemic and subsequently updated for COVID-19 using published data from China (Borthwick, Barton and Graham-Clarke, 2020), was considered for use as an aid to inform critical care drug requirements in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The following components of the tool were used in the regional database:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Patient and treatment characteristics assumptions, that is, percentage uptake of drug group, treatment duration for each drug and typical length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay.</p> </li> <li> <p>Local practice adjustments, that is, drug dosages and percentage usage within a drug group, which were subsequently adapted to reflect the NI context.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The tool also included other elements in relation to prediction of surge population and output costs associated with medicine requirements, however these features were not used.</p> <p>The regional database was clinically reviewed by the Critical Care Network Northern Ireland and HSC Trusts (ICU pharmacists and pharmacy procurement leads) to ensure that data closely mirrored current regional practice, given the evolving nature of the pandemic. Subsequent feedback and updated real-world data were incorporated to further refine the database.</p> </div> <div class="results" title="results"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Results</div> <p>The regional database, including the elements derived from the Borthwick, Barton and Graham-Clarke 2020 tool, was developed to produce a model for calculating approximate critical care drug requirements, which underwent regional consultation. The current model considers the whole ICU population, that is, level 1, level 2 and level 3 patients.<a href="#R5">5</a> This was the preferred approach as the length of drug treatment and ICU stay consider both patient transition between levels of care and any overlap of individual drug treatments. In addition to average dosages of critical care drugs, the current model formulae consider four different elements:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Percentage uptake of drug class.</p> </li> <li> <p>Percentage usage within drug class</p> </li> <li> <p>Average length of ICU stay (days).</p> </li> <li> <p>Average treatment duration for each drug (days).</p> </li> </ul> <p><a href="#T1">Table 1</a> shows the patient and treatment characteristics assumptions used in the model to inform critical drug requirements. The ICU population uptake (%) and average treatment length (days) for each therapeutic group was derived from the original suggested uptake data (Borthwick, Barton and Graham-Clarke, 2020) and further adjusted according to real-world usage data from both local and national sources. The ICU population uptake allows for differentiation between levels of ICU patient and the differing treatment requirements of patients. The average length of treatment with a particular drug can help project critical drug requirements per patient based on predicted average length of ICU stay. This considers the fact that patients may not require treatment with a particular drug for the full length of their ICU admission.

The % usage split data can inform discussions and support Trust pharmacy procurement leads to plan first-line product selection and use within individual Trusts, based on requirements and stock availability. For example, when a drug turns amber according to the RAG rating (ie, 7â€"14 stock days of that agent are available), the % usage split of that drug is adjusted to zero or reduced to conserve and the % usage split for the other drug options in the therapeutic class are increased according to available stock, to achieve a green RAG rating. Agreement can then be reached on first-line and second-line choices for individual Trusts. This approach facilitates the consistent use of a particular agent first line in individual Trusts, and minimises the risk of using various alternative agents at short notice as a consequence of supply constraints. In addition, it achieves an effective regional approach to manage key drugs in times of constraint based on patient need.</p> </div> <div class="discussion" title="discussion"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Discussion</div> <p>COVID-19 is an emerging pandemic and widespread and unprecedented efforts to optimise patient care are ongoing and are being delivered at pace. The process developed to estimate critical care drug requirements represents a robust and agile starting point in the journey to inform regional procurement planning and preparedness in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Given that this is a new virus, the existing evidence base to inform and predict critical care drug requirements is limited. Other than the unpublished tool developed in response to the H1N1 swine influenza pandemic in 2009, updated for COVID-19 (Borthwick, Barton and Graham-Clarke, 2020), the authors are not aware of any other published tools to estimate critical care drug requirements to inform procurement planning and preparedness in a pandemic. The process developed will evolve and be refined based on real-world data as they become available. Measures are currently being introduced to gather further real-world data. The current model assumptions were formulated to reflect the initial surge of the COVID-19 pandemic in NI. However the evolving course of the pandemic will be monitored and the assumptions can be adapted, as necessary, to reflect changing requirements.</p> <p>The focus of the current model was key critical care drugs required in the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the model is transferrable to other therapeutic classes and settings and has the potential to assist in informing medicine planning and preparedness in future epidemics/pandemics. For example, the model is currently being used in palliative care and drugs, doses, % uptake, % usage split and typical duration of treatment have been reviewed and agreed by the Regional Palliative Medicine Group and NI Specialist Palliative Care Pharmacist Group.</p> <p>The process developed has been recognised by Cathy Harrison, Chief Pharmaceutical Officer at the Department of Health, commenting <i>â€˜I very much welcome the development of the supply and demand model for critical care medicines and I support its use for managing and monitoring other groups of essential medicines and healthcare supplies at risk of potential shortages. The model provided essential information and assurance during the response to COVID-19 and I commend all those involved in its developmentâ€™</i>.</p> </div> <div class="conclusions" title="conclusions"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Conclusion</div> <p>The process developed represents a collaborative and robust approach to assist in informing regional critical care drug requirements in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further application has been demonstrated in regional procurement planning and preparedness. It is anticipated that the complexity and robustness of the model will increase and will be further refined based on evolving real-world data.</p> <div class="limitations" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
