<p>In conclusion, the precision and accuracy of the 4 commercial kits indicated that the properties expected of an effective diagnostic device have been met. IC system of Allplex was the most sensitive in monitoring PCR efficiency. High efficiency of PCR and log linear relationship between Ct and viral load in Allplex and PowerChek suggested the use for quantification of viral load and follow-up testing of COVID-19 as an indicator of quarantine release. Therefore, all four kits can be used to diagnose and follow up COVID-19 for treatment and discharge planning, as well as to estimate viral load if there is a reliable standard. It is expected that the laboratory doctors will possess a good understanding of the quality control parameters needed for interpreting results and troubleshooting issues, when using EUA kits in clinical laboratory settings.</p>
