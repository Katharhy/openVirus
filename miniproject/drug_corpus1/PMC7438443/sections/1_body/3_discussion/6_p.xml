<p>This study was beset with some limitations. Firstly, analytical sensitivity of all 4 kits and all target genes was not validated due to lack of appropriate standards. Although only the LOD of 
 <italic>E</italic> was analyzed, other target genes also showed comparable Cts in the precision analysis of positive control and equivalent sensitivity in clinical sample analyses. It is important to establish reliable standards for further validation of EUA-approved kits. Secondly, all clinical samples were consecutively collected from 2 patients, and thus did not represent clinical samples from initial diagnoses. This study was intended to enrich low viral load samples with a Ct close to a value to that of a follow-up test, especially for interpretation of results when multiple target genes were used in combination. Thirdly, the range of negative samples used was relatively small and failed to include all common respiratory pathogens and all human coronaviruses in specificity testing.
