<p>The precision of these 4 kits for qualitative testing was 100% in 5 replicates of positive and negative controls. Although standard assessments require 10 replicates, testing positive and negative controls twice a day for 5 days, precision could be more confident by that Cts of target genes for five replicates were also highly consistent for each gene and comparable between the genes in the kits. Reproducibility of clinical test results was excellent for Cts â‰¤33. This reproducibility may be due to the high-efficacy of PCR which ensured excellent precision (

PowerChek exhibited the most negative results, 7, with 1 inconclusive, showing the beneficial effect of reduced uncertainty, which however, may need further study. This finding is associated with PowerChek setting the cutoff higher than the LOD, while Allplex set it lower than the LOD. These cutoff settings raise a query as to whether negative or inconclusive results, obtained by including out-of-cutoff positives for one of the multiple target genes, are truly negative and indicate lack of infectiousness. In the current study, follow-up samples of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients often showed inconclusive results. However, these should not be interpreted as true negative, as they may be accompanied by or followed by other positive results, and thus may be in the very early or late stages of COVID-19. If the sample showing out-of-cutoff positivity is the first from a new patient, SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR should be retested with a resample to confirm COVID-19. One of the advantages of diagnostic kits based on multiple target genes is that results can be interpreted as those of a combination of target genes, which complements both sensitivity and specificity.
