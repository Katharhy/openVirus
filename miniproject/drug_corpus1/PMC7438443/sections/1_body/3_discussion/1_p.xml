<p>The 95% confidence intervals estimated for Allplex, PowerChek and Real-Q overlapped, indicating that there was no significant difference in LODs between test kits. However, the LODs for those kits were more than 10-fold less sensitive compared to the previously reported 5.2 copies/reaction (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Nevertheless, this LOD was consistent with the 295 copies/reaction stated by another study that validated a diagnostic kit using the Cobas 6800 (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The two previous studies used standard materials and methods in accordance with WHO guideline, and were therefore similar to those used in this study (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Compared with that the LOD of the commercial kits assayed using culture viral RNA varied from 3.3 to 330 copies/reaction in the evaluation of 11 commercial kits including PowerChek (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), all three kits had similar sensitivity and LODs in viral concentrations were alsp in the range of 4.03 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> to 4.81 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> copies/mL of samples. Log linearity between the Cts and viral loads showed that the best fit slopes of Allplex and PowerChek was closed to the ideal value of −3.3219 (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). PCR efficiency of Allplex has recently been published similarly high as 105% for E gene (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). This high PCR efficiency was suggesting the possibility of quantifying SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations higher than the LOD.
