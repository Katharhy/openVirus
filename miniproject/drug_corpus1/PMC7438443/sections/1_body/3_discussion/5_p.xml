<p>A major challenge encountered in standard real-time PCR analysis is the elimination of false negative signals, caused by inhibitors or inefficient PCR conditions (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Internal controls are used to address reliability, via the addition of extra primer-probe sets targeted to other endogenous DNA sequences or exogenous targets (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The Cts of ICs in sputum samples was consistently longer than that of NPS when tested by Allplex, where these sputum samples were subjected to more inefficient PCR conditions. This finding was consistent with that of a previous study (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). While PowerChek and StandardM showed invariable Cts for ICs, regardless of individual samples or sample types, the ICs of Allplex were more sensitive indicators of PCR efficiency than those of other kits. The ICs of Real-Q showed longer Cts or even failed to amplify, as seen in urine and stool samples, suggesting that the intrinsic IC system of Real-Q may not be compatible with samples other than respiratory samples. In pandemic situations, such as that of COVID-19, quality control of ICs is essential, especially for introducing an EUA-approved rRT-PCR kit to the diagnostic equipment market.
