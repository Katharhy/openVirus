<p>Although a corresponding LOD was not measured, StandardM exhibited the highest clinical sensitivity among the 4 kits. This difference in sensitivity was due to intentional enrichment of samples with very low viral loads, where all kits showed 100% reproducible results for samples with a Ct â‰¤33. In the recent evaluation with low viral concentration samples with Ct &gt;34.5 in E gene of in-house PCR, Allplex sensitively detected those as 12 out of 13 (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Therefore, all kits were sufficiently sensitive for initial diagnostic testing. In addition, there was no risk of misinterpreting positive to truly negative readings, even when one or more multiple target genes were either positive or out-of-cutoff positive. Considered together, these findings point to excellent PCR efficiency which also enabled quantitative measurements, and thus these tests may be used to monitor viral loads in follow-up samples. The Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) stipulated that the criterion for releasing COVID-19 patients from quarantine isolation was receipt of 2 consecutive negative test results at 24 h-intervals (

By May 15, 2020, 9,821 confirmed cases had been released from quarantine, in accordance with KCDC criteria, and reportedly, no new infections had been transmitted by those who were released, although retesting showed that a total of 447 of those released had turned positive later (

This may be possible because Korean COVID-19 laboratory response task force defines the quality parameters of COVID-19 diagnostic kits and validate the performance of all EUA kits (
