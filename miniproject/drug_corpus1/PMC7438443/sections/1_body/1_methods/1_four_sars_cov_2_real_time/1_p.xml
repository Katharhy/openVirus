<p>PowerChek 2019-nCoV Real-time PCR (PowerChek; KogeneBiotech, Seoul, Korea), Real-Q 2019-nCoV Detection (Real-Q; BioSewoom, Seoul, Korea), and StandardM nCoV Real-Time Detection (StandardM; SD BIOSENSOR, Osong, Korea) target regions of 
 <italic>envelope (E)</italic> and 
 <italic>RNA dependent RNA polymerase</italic> (
 <italic>RdRp</italic>) (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), while Allplex 2019-nCoV (Allplex; Seegene, Seoul, Korea) has 3 targets, 
 <italic>E, RdRp</italic> and 
 <italic>nucleocapsid protein (N)</italic>. In accordance with WHO guidelines (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), the test is interpreted as positive when all target genes are detected together. If one target gene is positive, but the other is negative, the test is considered inconclusive. All kits performed reverse transcription and multiplex PCR in a single tube at one time, except PowerChek, which used 2 tubes per target gene. PowerChek and StandardM used exogenous internal controls in the rRT-PCR mixture, while Allplex used internal controls, spiking them directly into the sample prior to RNA extraction. Real-Q uses 
 <italic>human RNase P</italic> intrinsic to human cells as an internal control. Specifications and PCR conditions of each kit are detailed (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This study was reviewed and approved by the Asan Medical Center Institutional Review Board and was deemed to be exempt from ethics and consent approval (2020-0487).
