<p>A total of 27 samples were collected from 2 patients between February 29 and March 10 as follows: 10 sputum, 9 nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), 1 urine, and 1 stool sample consecutively from one COVID-19 patient with prolonged viral shedding (A) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). RNA was extracted using eMAG (bioMérieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France) to the extent of 0.05 mL of eluent per 0.2 mL sample and routinely tested via an Allplex 2019-nCoV (Seegene) using a Bio-Rad CFX96 instrument (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Remaining samples were stored at −70°C, thawed once, and used on the same day to test the 4 commercial kits. A total of 12 samples, including 7 of the 13 sputum samples and 5 of the 12 NPS samples, were diluted 10-fold to enrich weak positive samples. The other 3 kits were tested using an ABI7500 instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Interpretation of results and Ct values of the target genes and internal controls of the 4 kits were compared. The test results of each kit were interpreted following the manufacturer's recommendations as follows: positive only if both the Ct value of the target gene and the internal control were within the cutoff. If a sample was positive for 1 or more kits, it was considered truly positive for sensitivity purposes, because it was a serial sample obtained from a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case. Two NPS samples and 1 sputum sample were not subjected to PowerChek testing, due to insufficient sample volume.
