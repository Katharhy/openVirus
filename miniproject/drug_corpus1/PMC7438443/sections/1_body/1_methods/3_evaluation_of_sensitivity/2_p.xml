<p>In order to assess the specificity of each kit, 24 respiratory virus-positive samples including 21 NPS samples, and 3 sputum samples were tested for cross-reactivity with human RNA or other respiratory viruses. Samples were determined as positive for a respiratory virus using an Allplex Respiratory Panel 1/2/3 (Seegene). The 24 samples consisted of the human rhinovirus (
