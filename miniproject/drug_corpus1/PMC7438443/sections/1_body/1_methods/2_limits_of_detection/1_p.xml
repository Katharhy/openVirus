<p>The limit of detection (LOD) was determined using SARS coronavirus Frankfurt1 RNA (SARS-RNA) and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed RNA of 
 <italic>SARS-CoV-2 E</italic> (
 <italic>E-tRNA</italic>) supplied by European Virus Archive-Global (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.european-virus-archive.com/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.european-virus-archive.com/</ext-link>) as published (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). 
 <italic>E-tRNAs</italic> were serially diluted to obtain 5 concentrations as follows: 8, 80, 800, 8,000, and 80,000 copies/reaction for Allplex and 5, 50, 500, 5,000, and 50,000 copies/reaction for PowerChek, respectively. Twenty replicates of each sample were tested per concentration. Since Real-Q detected only SARS-RNAs of 
 <italic>E</italic>, it was serially diluted to obtain 4 concentrations (5, 50, 500, and 5,000 copies/reaction), where each concentration was replicated 10 times. A response was not observed for both RNAs in 
 <italic>E</italic> PCR using StandardM. LOD was calculated via probit regression analysis using MedCalc (version 19.2; MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium). Correlation between each concentration and cycle threshold (Ct) was calibrated via linear regression to calculate Ct matching the LOD using MedCalc.
