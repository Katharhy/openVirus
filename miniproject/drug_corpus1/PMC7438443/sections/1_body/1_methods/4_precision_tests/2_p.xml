<p>To evaluate the reproducibility of the clinical sample test, using Allplex, 21 samples were freeze-thawed once and tested a second time in a single run, while 14 samples were tested in pairs with 10-fold-diluted samples. Evaluation of the reproducibility of the repeat test was based on the consistency of positive and negative results. Delta Ct values between the initial and repeated tests of the same sample and between original and 10-fold-diluted samples were also calculated.</p>
