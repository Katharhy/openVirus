<p>At the concentration ranges defined for LOD experiments, the degrees of association between Ct values and log viral concentrations, indicated by Allplex and PowerChek, were expressed by the log linear equations, y = −3.319 log (x) + 42.039 (R = 0.96) and y = −3.392 log(x) + 43.113 (R = 0.98), respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The average Ct values of Real-Q at 5, 50, and 500 copies per reaction were 37.1 ± 0.51, 36.4 ± 0.91, and 31.9 ± 0.26, respectively, and, as shown (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), there was a lack of linear relationship (y = −2.940x + 40.341 within this range (R = 0.90). Ct values corresponding to LOD that were estimated using these equations were 34.8 for Allplex and 36.6 for PowerChek.
