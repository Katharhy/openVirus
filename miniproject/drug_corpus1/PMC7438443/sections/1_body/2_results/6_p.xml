<p>Internal control (IC) was exogenous in 3 kits and endogenous in Real-Q (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In sensitivity assessment testing, the average Ct values of the ICs were 29.3 ± 3.9 for Allplex, 18.3 ± 0.2 for PowerChek, 27.7 ± 2.9 for Real-Q, and 19.3 ± 0.2 for StandardM (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The Cts for IC were missed in 2 sputum samples, when tested using Allplex, and in 1 stool sample, when tested using Real-Q. In addition, one urine sample showed the longest Ct value of 34.2 for ICs when tested via Real-Q. When comparing the 7 pairs of sputum and NPS tested simultaneously via Allplex, Ct values for ICs were consistently longer for sputum samples than those for NPS (28.8 ± 2.7 vs. 26.2 ± 2.1), although those of the other kits were not (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Real-Q and StandardM indicated that the Cts for ICs were &lt;35 and &lt;32, respectively, and that all Ct values for the ICs of the NPS and sputum samples tested were &lt;32 and &lt;20, respectively.
