<p>Initial interpretation of the Allplex test results indicated that the 27 clinical samples consisted of 19 positive, 6 inconclusive, and 2 negative samples. Allplex readings showed that the 20 
 <italic>E</italic>-positive samples comprised 7, 4, 5, and 4 samples with 
 <italic>E</italic> Ct values larger than 33 (E33), 30–33, 25–30, and &lt;25, respectively, and 7 
 <italic>E</italic>-negative samples (E0) (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Ct readings for both target genes provided by PowerChek or Real-Q were found to lie outside the cutoff values for one or more target genes, in 4 and 5 samples, respectively. Allplex. PowerChek, Real-Q, and StandardM detected 18, 14, 15, and 20 positive samples and 4, 1, 6 and 5 inconclusive samples, respectively. One stool sample and 1 urine sample were positive for only 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> via StandardM and only 1 
 <italic>N</italic> by Allplex, respectively, and were therefore excluded from sensitivity calculations. Thus, according to the combined results of all kits, a total of 25 samples comprising 20 positives and 5 inconclusive ones were obtained and used to calculate sensitivity. All 4 kits were 100% sensitive for 
 <italic>E</italic> Ct value ≤33, regardless of sample type. By contrast, 4 E33 and 1 E0 positive and 4 E0 and 1 E33 inconclusive samples showed discrepancies between the 4 kits as follows: 2 positives to inconclusive and 4 inconclusive ones to negative in Allplex; 1 E33 positives to inconclusive and 2 positives and all 5 inconclusive ones to negative in PowerChek; and all 4 positives to inconclusive and 3 inconclusive ones to negative in Real-Q. StandardM correctly detected all positive and one inconclusive to negative. Therefore, the sensitivity for detecting positive samples in Allplex, PowerChek, Real-Q, and StandardM was 90.0% (18/20), 82.3% (14/17), 75.0% (15/20), and 100.0% (20/20), respectively. Because out-of-cutoff Ct values were present only in PowerChek and Real-Q, their sensitivities were increased to 100%, if the samples were considered positive when both target genes were detected via out-of-cutoff Ct values. When analyzing consecutive samples obtained from patient A, all inconclusive results were accompanied by other samples that were positive, or followed by samples that became positive the next day.
