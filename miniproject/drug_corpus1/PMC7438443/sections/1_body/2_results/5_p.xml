<p>Since all positive and negative controls consistently showed expected results, indicating that the precision of qualitative tests was 100% (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Mean Ct values for 
 <italic>E</italic> of the positive controls in Allplex, PowerChek, Real-Q, and StandardM were 20.0 ± 0.23, 23.1 ± 0.16, 27.2 ±.13, and 26.2 ± 0.22, respectively. Among the 4 kits, the smallest coefficient of variation of Ct values was observed for Real-Q. 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> showed wider variation than other target genes in PowerChek (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). When Ct values were compared between 
 <italic>E</italic> and 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> within the kits, there was no significant difference in Allplex and PowerChek, while 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> was consistently longer by 1.54 in average than 
 <italic>E</italic> in Real-Q and vice versa by 0.72 in StandardM. 
 <italic>N</italic> showed the shortest Ct in Allplex (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In the reproducibility test, conducted using clinical samples, 8 samples, including 1 stool, 3 NPS, and 4 sputum samples, all of which were E33 or negative for 
 <italic>E</italic>, displayed discrepancies in interpretation of results. Thirteen pairs of samples were available for the comparison of Ct values of 
 <italic>E</italic>, and delta Ct values were 1.0 or less, except for 2 samples, with Cts of 32.4 and 34.4, respectively. Thus, if the Ct was not longer than 33, both the interpretation and Ct values of the target gene derived via Allplex were consistently reproducible. When 14 pairs of original (undiluted) and 10-fold-diluted samples were tested, one sample with a Ct for 
 <italic>E</italic> of 34.6 was converted from positive to inconclusive, after dilution. For the remaining 13 pairs of original samples with Ct values for 
 <italic>E</italic> ranging from 17.6 to 32.5, interpretation was consistently positive and when tested via 10-fold-dilutions, the average delta Ct for these pairs was 3.7 ± 1.2 (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).
