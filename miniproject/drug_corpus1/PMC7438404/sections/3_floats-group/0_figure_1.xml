  <p>Schematic structure of SARS-CoV-2. The viral structure is primarily formed by the structural proteins such as spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The S, M, and E proteins are all embedded in the viral envelope, a lipid bilayer derived from the host cell membrane. The N protein interacts with the viral RNA in to the core of the virion.</p>
