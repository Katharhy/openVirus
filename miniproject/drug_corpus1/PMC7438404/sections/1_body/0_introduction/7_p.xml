<p>Considering the particularities of SARS-CoV-2 and the emergency caused by its outbreak, several strategies have been adopted to develop therapeutics and prophylactic measures against this virus. The strategies employed in these developments include: (i) utilization of bioinformatics for the prediction and investigation of potential ligands toward target molecules in the viral structure and/or replication (

 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2020</xref>), associated with pseudo particles, subgenomic replicons and/or full-length CoVs, seeking to assess cellular response or the effects of the compounds on the viral replicative cycle (
