<p>It is important to emphasize that SARS-CoV-2 shows different epidemiological and clinical features from the epidemics of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (

 <xref rid="B209" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). Although both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein S attach to ACE2 to enter the host cells, the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 is higher, thus enhancing its infectivity (

 <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">Lusvarghi and Bewley, 2016</xref>) of S2 protein in SARS-CoV-2 may be related to its higher infectiveness, contributing to a 10- to 20-fold higher kinetic affinity of SARS-CoV-2 ectodomain, as evidenced by Wrapp and co-workers, employing surface plasmon resonance measurements (
