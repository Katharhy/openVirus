<p>Another point to be considered in CoV treatment is that RNA viruses are known to have high levels of mutations (error rate) in the replication process (

 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">Karamitros et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, previous studies demonstrated that the use of Chloroquine analogs for decades against malaria has established chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium strains (

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Aguiar et al., 2018</xref>). Due to the beneficial immunomodulatory effects of analogs on the severe inflammatory complications of several viral diseases, such as HIV and SARS-CoV infections, these drugs have been tested indiscriminately (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Al-Bari, 2017</xref>). However, there is a possibility that prophylactic exposure to pro-apoptotic chloroquine drugs caused natural selection for strains of viruses and other parasites that have enhanced anti-apoptotic abilities (
 <xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr">Parris, 2004</xref>). Despite the side effects, the wide use of some drugs during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic might raise concerns regarding the emergence of resistant viral strains in the future, and we emphasize the lack of information on the resistance associated with these drugs in the treatment of viral infections.
