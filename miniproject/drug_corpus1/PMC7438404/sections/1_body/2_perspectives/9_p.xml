<p>Despite the finding regarding these drugs, it is important to take some aspects into consideration: i) the trials were generally conducted with a significant number of patients in each study, but potentially not enough to expand the results to public healthcare; ii) some of the studies were observational, which means they were based on public data that may not be well documented, leaving information gaps about particular health issues; additionally, the outcomes in patients are defined by their own circumstances, and not by an investigator; iii) some studies were not placebo-controlled and double-blind, so the placebo effect cannot be discarded (

For that matter, it is also important to consider that SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus and that we currently have limited knowledge about its physiopathology. Finally, the development of new treatment options is critical, and efforts have been focused on targeting therapies that aim to improve patient outcome by increasing antiviral activity associated with minimal toxicity.
