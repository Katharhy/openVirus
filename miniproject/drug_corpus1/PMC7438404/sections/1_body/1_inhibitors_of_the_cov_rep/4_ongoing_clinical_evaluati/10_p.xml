<p>Recent studies have been contradicting the safety of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine use, as these drugs presented severe side effects that interfered with their clinical use, even during short-course therapies (

 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Apart from the mild adverse effects, such as pruritus, nausea, and headache, these drugs can predispose patients to life-threatening arrhythmias, an effect that may be enhanced by concomitant use of azithromycin (

Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine interfere with ventricular repolarization, leading to prolongation of the cardiac QT interval and an increased risk of torsades de pointes (TdP), which is a risk especially for patients with cardiac disease, for children, or for those taking other drugs that delay repolarization (

 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">El-Solia et al., 2018</xref>); neuropsychiatric effects, including agitation, insomnia, confusion, paranoia, depression, psychosis, and suicidal ideation (
 <xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">Mohan et al., 1981</xref>); hypersensitivity reactions, such as severe cutaneous adverse reactions (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Cameron et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Girijala et al., 2019</xref>); and drug–drug interactions, which are improved by genetic variability (genetic polymorphisms of hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme 2D6 (CYP2D6), responsible for chloroquine metabolization) (

 <xref rid="B205" ref-type="bibr">Smith, 2020</xref>). Recently, the WHO stopped the hydroxychloroquine arm of the Solidarity trial to treat COVID-19 based on an absence of effectiveness in reducing the mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients (
 <xref rid="B241" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2020c</xref>). Besides, the FDA also cautioned against the administration of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in COVID-19 patients, mainly due to the risk of heart rhythm issues (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">FDA, 2020</xref>). From these results, it is evident that the use of these drugs for COVID-19 requires further investigation.
