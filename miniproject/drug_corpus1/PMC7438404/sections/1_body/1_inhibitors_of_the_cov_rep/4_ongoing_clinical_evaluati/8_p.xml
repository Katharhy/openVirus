<p>According to Guan and colleagues, approximately 15.7% of Chinese patients with COVID-19 developed severe pneumonia and cytokine release syndrome (CRS), an important factor leading to rapid progression of the disease (

The treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 with Tocilizumab presented no complications in the 21 assisted patients, with an average age of 56.8 Â± 16.5 and no history of illness deterioration or death. Thus, it immediately improved the clinical outcome and appeared to be an effective treatment for reducing mortality (

The treatment was observed to cause an effective decrease in inflammatory markers, radiological improvement, and a reduction in ventilatory support requirements for these patients (

Additionally, Toniati and collaborators administered Tocilizumab in 100 patients in Italy (average age of 62 years old) who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS and required ventilatory support. Overall, at 10 days of follow-up, the respiratory condition was improved or stabilized in 77% of the patients, and, based on these data, the response to this drug in patients with severe COVID-19 was rapid, sustained, and associated with significant clinical improvement (
