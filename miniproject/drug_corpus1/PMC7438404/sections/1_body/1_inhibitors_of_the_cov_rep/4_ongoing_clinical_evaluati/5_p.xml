<p>COVID-19 patients with mild to severe symptoms can develop hyperinflammation and hypercytokinaemia, which can lead to multiple organ failure and death (

 <xref rid="B242" ref-type="bibr">Wilkinson et al., 1991</xref>). Such a capitalization was previously reported in SARS-CoV patients during the 2002â€“2003 epidemic (

 <xref rid="B253" ref-type="bibr">Zha et al., 2020</xref>). However, contrasting data concerning the efficacy of these drugs was described recently, showing that corticosteroids did not improve symptoms in COVID-19 patients (
 <xref rid="B253" ref-type="bibr">Zha et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, dexamethasone emerged as a potential drug for treating COVID-19 patients, as shown by the results of a randomized, controlled, open-lab, and multicenter trial that assessed the effects of dexamethasone in 454 patients, described to date in pre-print findings (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">Horby et al., 2020</xref>). Data suggested that dexamethasone reduced death in one-third of patients in invasive mechanical ventilation and one-fifth of patients in non-invasive oxygen mechanical ventilation. However, it did not impair mortality in patients with no respiratory support (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">Horby et al., 2020</xref>). Other trials have been conducted, such as NCT043274011, but considering the preliminary results, the WHO suggested that treatment with dexamethasone may be applied during the third phase of COVID-19, when the hyperinflammation is determined, and respiratory support is needed.
