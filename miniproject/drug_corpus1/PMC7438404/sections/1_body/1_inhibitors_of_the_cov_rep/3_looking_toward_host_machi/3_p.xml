<p>Moreover, Cyclosporin A (CsA), a peptide with activity on the cyclophilin family of host enzymes (isomerases that act as chaperones) (

 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Davis et al., 2010</xref>), inhibited SARS-CoV (100% inhibition at 16 μM), HCoV-229E (75% inhibition at 16 μM), and MHV (100% inhibition at 16 μM) in human and animal infected cell culture. CsA presented broad-spectrum antiviral activity against CoVs, and it seems to interfere with genome replication/transcription during CoV infections (
