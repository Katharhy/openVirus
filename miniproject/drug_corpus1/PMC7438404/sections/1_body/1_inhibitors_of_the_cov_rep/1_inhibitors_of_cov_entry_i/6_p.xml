<p>Other compounds also demonstrated to inhibit CoV entry, for example, emodin (6-methyl-1,3,8-trihydroxyanthraquinone), a component from 
 <italic>Rheum officinale</italic> roots, which at 50 Î¼M inhibited the infectivity of S protein-pseudotype retrovirus from SARS-CoV in Vero cells by about 80% (

The authors suggested that emodin might be impairing virus release by affecting 3a viral protein, which is related to ion channels in infected Vero cells (
