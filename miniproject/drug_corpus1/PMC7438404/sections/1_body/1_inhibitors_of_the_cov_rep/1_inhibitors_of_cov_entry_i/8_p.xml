<p>Antiviral activity by entry inhibition was also evaluated by employing antibacterial chemotherapeutics. Vancomycin, eremomycin, and teicoplanin glycopeptide compounds used to treat infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria (

Nonetheless, these compounds were not able to inhibit feline CoV (FIPV) and SARS-CoV in assays employing such cell lines. Conversely, the eremomycin derivative molecules labeled 27 and 39 showed the best inhibition profiles against FIPV (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 5.4 and 12 μM, respectively) and SARS-CoV (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 14 and 22 μM, respectively) (
