<p>The endossomal cathepsins are essential enzymes in viral entry into host cells (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2006</xref>), and cathepsin L has been pointed to as playing a crucial role in membrane fusion with the endosomes (

In this context, Shah and coworkers demonstrated the effective activity of tetrahydroquinoline oxocarbazate (CID 23631927), an oxocarbazate inhibitor of cathepsin L, against SARS-CoV. Employing a pseudovirus system with a luciferase reporter to infect 293T cells, the compound inhibited viral entry with an EC

 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 100 μM (

 </sub>) to cathepsin L, improving the compound/cathepsin L interaction. This might be related to its optimized structure, with stronger hydrophobic interactions and better hydrogen bonds between the compound and cathepsin L (
