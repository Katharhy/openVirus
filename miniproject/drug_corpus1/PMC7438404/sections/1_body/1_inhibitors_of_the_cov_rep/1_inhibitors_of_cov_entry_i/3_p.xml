<p>Ramos-Tovar and Muriel reported the antiviral activity of Glycyrrhizin (GL), a major constituent from licorice root (
 <xref rid="B177" ref-type="bibr">Ramos-Tovar and Muriel, 2019</xref>), which was able to inhibit SARS-CoV entry into Vero cells with an effective concentration of 50% (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) of 300 mg L
 <sup>–1</sup> and a cytotoxicity concentration of 50% (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) of &gt;20.000 mg L
 <sup>–1</sup>. GL was less effective when the administration occurred during the viral adsorption period than when it was administered after entry into host cells. Cumulative effects were observed when this compound was administered both during and after entry into host cells, which indicates a significantly potent inhibitor against the virus under the tested conditions (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Cinatl et al., 2003</xref>). Additionally, the antiviral activity of 15 GL derivates against SARS-CoV was assessed (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">Hoever et al., 2005</xref>). Conjugation on both acidic moieties of the GL disaccharide group with 2-acetamido-α-
 <sc>D</sc>-glucopyranosylamine, benzylcysteine, and Gly-Leu peptide generated compounds with an increase of 10- to 70-fold in anti-SARS-CoV activity when compared to GL itself (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">Hoever et al., 2005</xref>). For the case of 2-acetamido-α-
 <sc>D</sc>-glucopyranosylamine derivative, it was speculated that viral entry was inhibited through 
 <italic>N</italic>-acetylglycosamine binding onto S-protein carbohydrates. Other derivatives such as the introduction of heterocyclic amides such as 6-amine-thiouracil induced a higher cytotoxicity profile.
