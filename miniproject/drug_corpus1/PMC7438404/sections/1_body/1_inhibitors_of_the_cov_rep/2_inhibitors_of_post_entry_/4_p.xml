<p>The dipeptides GC373 (dipeptidyl aldehyde) and GC376 (dipeptidyl bisulfite adduct salt from GC373) were also designed and synthesized as protease inhibitors of the 3CLpro enzyme (

 <italic>in vitro</italic>, and the results showed that GC373 inhibited HCoV-229E (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.2 μM), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV, EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.3 μM), MHV (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 2 μM), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV, EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.3 μM), and bovine coronavirus (BCV, EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.7 μM) (

 <sub>50</sub> of 0.15 μM), FIPV (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.2 μM), MHV (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.1 μM), TGEV (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.15 μM), and BCV (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.6 μM). The 3CLpro activity of these compounds against SARS-CoV was also analyzed. GC373 and GC376 inhibited enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro, with inhibition constants of 50% of 3.48 and 4.35 μM, respectively (

 <sub>50</sub> values for GC373 and GC376 were 0.15 and 0.40 μM, respectively) (

Moreover, the authors described that concomitant treatment with these compounds can improve the antiviral effect against feline coronaviruses and noted that, since the 3CLpro is conserved among CoVs, it might present broad-spectrum activity (
