<p>Another example of a dipeptide-based compound that can act as a protease inhibitor is dipeptidyl EP128533 (
 <xref rid="B256" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>), which showed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV in Vero cells, with EC
 <sub>50</sub> and CC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 3.6 and &gt;100 μM, respectively (
 <xref rid="B256" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). In accordance with that study, it was also demonstrated that EP128533 inhibited SARS-CoV with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.4 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and CC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 100 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Day et al., 2009</xref>). However, the compound was not efficient in reducing the effects of viral replication in BALB/c mice (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Day et al., 2009</xref>). The authors proposed that EP128533 is relatively insoluble and that its lack of activity might be related to a low bioavailability in the animal models.
