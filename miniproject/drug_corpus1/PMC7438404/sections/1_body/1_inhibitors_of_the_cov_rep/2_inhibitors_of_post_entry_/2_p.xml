<p>Gan and coworkers used molecular docking methods to select the octapeptide Ala-Val-Leu-Gln-Ser-Gly-Phe-Arg as Mpro inhibitor of SARS-CoV and evaluated its antiviral activity in infected Vero cells. The octapeptide presented an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 2.7 × 10
 <sup>–2</sup> mg mL
 <sup>–1</sup> and a CC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 100 mg mL
 <sup>–1</sup>, resulting in a selectivity index of over 3,704 (

C analog (JMF1521) was obtained by the condensation of Phe-Phe dipeptide unsaturated ester with cinnamic acid and exhibited the highest activity, with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.18 μM and CC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 200 μM (

The authors also performed enzymatic assay to evaluate the activity of JMF1521 on 3CLpro and showed that the peptide inhibited the 3CLpro activity with an inhibition constant of 0.52 μM. The results suggested that this analog disposes a rather rigid coplanar structure in the N-terminal motif that results in more effective hydrogen bonds with the enzyme residues (
