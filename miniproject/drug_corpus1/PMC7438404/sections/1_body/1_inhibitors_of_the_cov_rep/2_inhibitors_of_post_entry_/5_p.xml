<p>RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) also figures as a promising target for antivirals. In viral replication, RdRp is responsible for catalyzing the replication of the viral RNA using a complementary RNA as a template. Therefore, compounds that interfere in this process are excellent drug candidates for treating viral infections (

NHC improved pulmonary function and decreased viral load in lung, and the authors proposed that NHC might be useful for emerging CoVs. Another pyrimidine analog with potential antiviral activity is 6-azauridine, which inhibited HCoV-NL63 replication in LLC-MK2 cells with an EC
