<p>In this context, this review describes drugs that might be overlooked for future analysis and could possibly become effective antiviral treatments. As a final remark, we conclude that, to date, there is no “one hundred percent” effective antiviral therapy against SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 and that further research is needed to achieve the best therapeutic protocol, which may not be based on a unique drug but rather on a combination of active antivirals.</p>
