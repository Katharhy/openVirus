Data on treatment are scare and parallels have been made between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. Remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral with efficient in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. Evidence of clinical improvement in patients with severe COVID-19 treated with remdesivir is controversial. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical outcomes and virological monitoring of the first five COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit of Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France, for severe pneumonia related to SARS-CoV-2 and treated with remdesivir. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR was used to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in blood plasma and the lower and upper respiratory tract. Among the five patients treated, two needed mechanical ventilation and one needed high-flow cannula oxygen. A significant decrease in SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the upper respiratory tract was observed in most cases, but two patients died with active SARS-CoV-2 replication in the lower respiratory tract. Plasma samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in only one patient. Remdesivir was interrupted before the initialy planned duration in four patients, two because of alanine aminotransferase elevations (3 to 5 normal range) and two because of renal failure requiring renal replacement. This case series of five COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care unit treatment for respiratory distress and treated with remdesivir, highlights the complexity of remdesivir use in such critically ill patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwd0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>SARS-CoV-2 viral load</kwd><kwd>Remdesivir</kwd><kwd>Antiviral therapy</kwd><kwd>Viral pneumonia</kwd><kwd>Case reports</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec0005"><title>Introduction</title><p id="par0025">In December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak that started in China (<xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>).

The indication criteria for compassionate-use remdesivir were defined by the French national regulatory authorities and French Ministry of Health: signs of severe illness at diagnosis or subsequent clinical worsening (respiratory symptoms or general signs). Since March 22, all patients requiring antiviral treatment have been enrolled in the Discovery Study (2020-000936-23).

He was immediately hospitalized with mild lymphopenia (1.00 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/l) and thrombocytopenia (1.46 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/l); there were no abnormalities on chest X-ray. RT-qPCR on nasopharyngeal samples was positive, with a SARS-CoV-2 viral load (VL) of 10.5 log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml. On day 10 of illness, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to worsening oxygen saturation (PO<sub>2</sub> = 58 mmHg; low-flow nasal cannula 4 l/min) and bilateral ground-glass and alveolar opacities on chest computed tomography (CT) scan with no increase in VL. Remdesivir was started on January 29, 2020 (day 11 of illness) and was stopped on day 15, due to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation (195 IU/l versus 46 IU/l before remdesivir administration) and the presence of a maculopapular rash. A rapid decline in VL from a cycle threshold (Ct) value of 27.6 to undetectability was observed on day 2 of remdesivir infusion. The skin and liver abnormalities improved within 3 days after discontinuing treatment. The patient was discharged on February 12.

A chest X-ray showed bilateral alveolar opacities, but he did not fulfil the COVID-19 case definition at that time. Airborne and contact precautions were observed and the diagnosis of COVID-19 was eventually made 3 days later. On January 26, acute respiratory failure with multiple organ failure triggered his admission to the ICU. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy was started and adapted for co-infection with a susceptible <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> (diagnosed by multiplex PCR and confirmed by tracheal aspirate culture) and <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> (tracheal aspirate culture). Remdesivir was started on January 29, but was discontinued on January 31, as the patient needed renal replacement therapy. The nasopharyngeal VL decreased from a Ct value of 21.0 before infusion to 28.9 on day 2 of infusion. A CT scan performed on January 31 showed bilateral alveolar condensations, ground-glass opacities, and pulmonary cysts. On February 5, because of the disease severity and the persistence of viral detection, remdesivir was re-initiated. Multiple organ failure persisted without any other co-infection identified.

He had had a cough and fever since February 21. He presented acute respiratory failure (PaO<sub>2</sub> = 74 mmHg; high-flow nasal cannula 40 l/min, 40%) and basal interstitial syndrome on chest X-ray. Remdesivir was started on February 27. Viral RNA levels increased slightly from a Ct value of 32.5 to 28.8 during the first 4 days of infusion, and started to decline on day 5 until undetectability. On March 1, he was referred to the infectious diseases ward, and he was weaned off oxygen on day 13 of illness. His VL was below the RT-qPCR limit of detection on day 14. Remdesivir was discontinued after eight administrations because of ALT elevation (116 IU/l versus 43 IU/l before remdesivir administration) and a maculopapular rash. These symptoms resolved 5 days after remdesivir discontinuation and the patient was discharged on day 20 of illness.</p></sec><sec id="sec0045"><title>Case 4</title><p id="par0065">A 76-year-old French male, with a history of chronic kidney injury (creatinine 115 &#x003bc;mol/l, normal range 50&#x02013;70 &#x003bc;mol/l), was admitted on February 22 due to a cough and fever of 24-h duration; he was transferred to our centre on February 26 after a diagnosis of COVID-19.

Remdesivir was started on March 4 (day 11 of illness) and discontinued on March 6 because of acute kidney injury (creatinine level up to 396 &#x003bc;mol/l) needing renal replacement therapy. The VL in nasopharyngeal samples decreased significantly from Ct 26 to undetectability on day 2 of remdesivir infusion. However, the SARS-CoV-2 VL was detectable in bronchoalveolar lavage on March 10. Cefotaxime was initiated because of a <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> respiratory co-infection.

They were weaned off oxygen between day 14 and day 19 of illness and were discharged between day 20 and day 26 of illness. Patients 2 and 5 died in the ICU on day 25 and day 31 of illness with multi-organ failure. While on remdesivir treatment, we observed a decrease in nasopharyngeal VL in all but patient 2, for whom the treatment was re-introduced after an early interruption, without any additional decrease in VL in the upper or lower respiratory tract. For patient 5, viral replication was still ongoing in the lower respiratory tract despite a concomitant undetectable VL in the nasopharyngeal area, highlighting the discrepancies between viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract among the most severe patients. Plasma samples were only positive for SARS-CoV-2 for patient 2.</p><p id="par0080">As described in previous case reports (<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">Grein et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Kujawski et al., 2020</xref>), four of the five patients experienced major side effects while on remdesivir treatment: two suffered acute renal injury and two had a maculopapular rash with cytolytic hepatitis. Both kidney failure events could have been related either to remdesivir or to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. None of these patients received immunomodulatory drugs. <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">Grein et al.

No virological data were available in that report. A recent randomized controlled study (<xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020b</xref>) did not show any clinical of benefit for remdesivir treatment, but probably lacked power.
