<p id="par0045">All patients received remdesivir via intravenous infusion with a loading dose of 200 mg and a maintenance daily dose of 100 mg for a maximum duration of 14 days. All nasopharyngeal and bronchoalveolar samples were collected in universal transport medium (Virocult, Sigma) and transported to the laboratory within 24 h. All quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) tests were performed according to the World Health Organization recommended procedure (
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Corman et al., 2020</xref>) after extraction on MagNA Pure (Total NA Large Volume Kit, Roche Diagnostics) from 200 μl of transport medium and amplification on an ABI 7500 instrument (Life Technologies). Quantification was done using a standardized RNA transcript control obtained from the European Virus Archive programme. Bacterial and mycological investigations were conducted on a separate sample without virological transport medium using the usual procedures for bacterial growth. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was also tested with an multiplex PCR assay (FilmArray Pneumonia assay; BioFire, BioMérieux) for virus and bacteria detection, and by fungal culture with mass spectrometry identification for 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> detection. All samples were processed in a biosafety level 3 laboratory (BSL3).
