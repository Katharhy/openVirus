<p id="par0040">All patients admitted to the Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France, between January 24 and March 1, 2020, diagnosed with COVID-19 and treated with remdesivir (Gilead Sciences), were enrolled. The indication criteria for compassionate-use remdesivir were defined by the French national regulatory authorities and French Ministry of Health: signs of severe illness at diagnosis or subsequent clinical worsening (respiratory symptoms or general signs). Since March 22, all patients requiring antiviral treatment have been enrolled in the Discovery Study (2020-000936-23). The Institutional Review Board of Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital approved this report and waived the need for informed consent from individual patients, due to the retrospective chart review design and absence of identifying images or personal/clinical details that could compromise anonymity.</p>
