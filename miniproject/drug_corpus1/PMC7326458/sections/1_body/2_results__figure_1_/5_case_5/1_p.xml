<p id="par0070">A 70-year-old male with a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was diagnosed with COVID-19 on March 1. He had had a cough and fever since February 23 while taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for renal lithiasis. He was admitted to the ICU on March 2 with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Remdesivir was started on March 4 (day 11 of illness) and discontinued on March 6 because of acute kidney injury (creatinine level up to 396 Î¼mol/l) needing renal replacement therapy. The VL in nasopharyngeal samples decreased significantly from Ct 26 to undetectability on day 2 of remdesivir infusion. However, the SARS-CoV-2 VL was detectable in bronchoalveolar lavage on March 10. Cefotaxime was initiated because of a 
 <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> respiratory co-infection. Nevertheless, he developed multiple organ failure and refractory acute respiratory distress syndrome despite prone positioning and adapted mechanical ventilation. Dexamethasone and lopinavir/ritonavir were started on March 12. He died on March 24 (day 31 of illness).
