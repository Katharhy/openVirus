<p id="par0060">A 39-year-old male airport worker, who was obese (body mass index = 33 kg/m
 <sup>2</sup>) and had obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, was diagnosed with severe COVID-19 and admitted to the ICU on February 26. He had had a cough and fever since February 21. He presented acute respiratory failure (PaO
 <sub>2</sub> = 74 mmHg; high-flow nasal cannula 40 l/min, 40%) and basal interstitial syndrome on chest X-ray. Remdesivir was started on February 27. Viral RNA levels increased slightly from a Ct value of 32.5 to 28.8 during the first 4 days of infusion, and started to decline on day 5 until undetectability. On March 1, he was referred to the infectious diseases ward, and he was weaned off oxygen on day 13 of illness. His VL was below the RT-qPCR limit of detection on day 14. Remdesivir was discontinued after eight administrations because of ALT elevation (116 IU/l versus 43 IU/l before remdesivir administration) and a maculopapular rash. These symptoms resolved 5 days after remdesivir discontinuation and the patient was discharged on day 20 of illness.
