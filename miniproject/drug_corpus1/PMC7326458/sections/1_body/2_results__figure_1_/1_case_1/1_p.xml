<p id="par0050">A 31-year-old Chinese male originating from Wuhan and reporting flu-like symptoms for 6 days was diagnosed with COVID-19 on January 24, 5 days after arriving in Paris. He was immediately hospitalized with mild lymphopenia (1.00 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/l) and thrombocytopenia (1.46 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/l); there were no abnormalities on chest X-ray. RT-qPCR on nasopharyngeal samples was positive, with a SARS-CoV-2 viral load (VL) of 10.5 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/ml. On day 10 of illness, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to worsening oxygen saturation (PO
 <sub>2</sub> = 58 mmHg; low-flow nasal cannula 4 l/min) and bilateral ground-glass and alveolar opacities on chest computed tomography (CT) scan with no increase in VL. Remdesivir was started on January 29, 2020 (day 11 of illness) and was stopped on day 15, due to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation (195 IU/l versus 46 IU/l before remdesivir administration) and the presence of a maculopapular rash. A rapid decline in VL from a cycle threshold (Ct) value of 27.6 to undetectability was observed on day 2 of remdesivir infusion. The skin and liver abnormalities improved within 3 days after discontinuing treatment. The patient was discharged on February 12.
