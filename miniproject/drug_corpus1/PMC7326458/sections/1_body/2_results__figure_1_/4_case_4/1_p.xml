<p id="par0065">A 76-year-old French male, with a history of chronic kidney injury (creatinine 115 μmol/l, normal range 50–70 μmol/l), was admitted on February 22 due to a cough and fever of 24-h duration; he was transferred to our centre on February 26 after a diagnosis of COVID-19. The patient presented an SpO
 <sub>2</sub> of 92% on room air and showed posterior pulmonary ground-glass opacities on chest CT scan. On day 11 of illness, he was transferred to the ICU due to worsening oxygen saturation (PO
 <sub>2</sub> = 69 mmHg; low-flow nasal cannula 3 l/min). The nasopharyngeal VL was already very low at Ct 38.5, but remdesivir was initiated on March 3 and discontinued on March 12, as the SARS-CoV-2 VL was constantly negative; there were no side effects. The patient was weaned off oxygen on day 19 of illness and he was discharged on day 23.
