<p id="par0075">Of this case series of five COVID-19 patients requiring ICU treatment for respiratory distress and treated with remdesivir, three (patients 1, 3, and 4) had a favourable outcome despite the initial respiratory severity. They were weaned off oxygen between day 14 and day 19 of illness and were discharged between day 20 and day 26 of illness. Patients 2 and 5 died in the ICU on day 25 and day 31 of illness with multi-organ failure. While on remdesivir treatment, we observed a decrease in nasopharyngeal VL in all but patient 2, for whom the treatment was re-introduced after an early interruption, without any additional decrease in VL in the upper or lower respiratory tract. For patient 5, viral replication was still ongoing in the lower respiratory tract despite a concomitant undetectable VL in the nasopharyngeal area, highlighting the discrepancies between viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract among the most severe patients. Plasma samples were only positive for SARS-CoV-2 for patient 2.</p>
