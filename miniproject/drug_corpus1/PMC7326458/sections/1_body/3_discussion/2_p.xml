<p id="par0080">As described in previous case reports (
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">Grein et al., 2020</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Kujawski et al., 2020</xref>), four of the five patients experienced major side effects while on remdesivir treatment: two suffered acute renal injury and two had a maculopapular rash with cytolytic hepatitis. Both kidney failure events could have been related either to remdesivir or to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. None of these patients received immunomodulatory drugs. 
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">Grein et al. (2020)</xref> described 53 COVID-19 patients treated with remdesivir, among whom 30 were on mechanical ventilation. After a median follow-up of 18 days after remdesivir initiation, a total of 25 (47%) were discharged; seven (13%) died and 10 were still on invasive mechanical ventilation. No virological data were available in that report. A recent randomized controlled study (
 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020b</xref>) did not show any clinical of benefit for remdesivir treatment, but probably lacked power. Of note, 12% of patients in the remdesivir group discontinued remdesivir due to adverse events (compared with 5% in the placebo group).
