  <p>Clinical and viral evolution of the case patients.</p>
  <p>For each patient, the type of hospital ward is indicated by the coloured rectangles, supplemental O
   <sub>2</sub> requirement by the dashed blue line, and remdesivir infusion by the red line. Viral load is shown with black diamonds, nasopharyngeal swabs with a black line, lower respiratory tract samples (when available) with green squares, and plasma samples with red circles. The viral load was estimated by cycle threshold (Ct) values; the lower the Ct value, the higher is the viral load. A sample is negative above a Ct value of 40.
