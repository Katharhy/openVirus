<p id="Par9">The first step in the diagnostic and therapeutic approach is the detection and distinction of nCoV from other CoV strains. Therefore, timely detection of nCoV infection cases is very important to stop the community spread. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) has been deployed in diagnostic virology as a powerful weapon. Conventionally, the preferred targets of coronavirus RT-PCR assays include the conserved and abundantly expressed genes such as the structural S, E, and N genes; the non-structural RdRP; and replicase open reading frame (ORF) 1a/b genes [
