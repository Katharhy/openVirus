<p id="Par18">A spike binding site, host cell receptor glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) which is specific to nCoV has been predicted using docking and bioinformatics analysis. Upon stress, GRP78 is known to act as a chaperone for the misfolded proteins and escape ER to translocate to the cell membrane. It can mediate virus recognitions and entry in the cell by its substrate-binding domain [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. GRP78 should bind to nCoV, as it does in the case of the MERS-CoV coronavirus. Four regions of the spike protein were predicted to be the binding site to GRP78, based on sequence and structural similarity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Inhibiting the interaction between GRP78 and nCoV spike protein would probably decrease the rate of viral infection and could be a strong target for therapeutic designs. Also, vaccine designed against the nCoV spike protein could be a potent preventive measure to bring down the mortality rate due to COVID-19.
