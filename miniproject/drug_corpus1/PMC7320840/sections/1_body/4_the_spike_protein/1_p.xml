<p id="Par16">The spike (S) protein from coronaviruses has been reported to be a crucial viral antigen which stimulates a strong humoral and cell-mediated immune response in humans. It is also known to mediate receptor binding and virus entry during host infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The role of S protein in receptor binding and membrane fusion marks it a perfect target for vaccine and therapeutic development. Previous studies on SARS-CoV reveal that vaccines based on the S protein can induce antibodies to block virus binding and fusion or neutralize virus infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Although to date, there are no certified vaccines available against prior coronaviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Since there is a similarity between S protein of MERS-CoV and nCoV, it would be great to target nCoV S protein for therapeutic research. Also, MERS-CoV relies on the binding between its RBD region and the hCD26 receptor to initiate infection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], interrupting this interaction could abrogate virus invasion and hence could be a great prospective site for drug design.
