<p id="Par20">Control measures for COVID-19 are majorly based on the understanding of previously existing coronaviruses, mode of their infections, and consideration of potential modes of transmission. Many labs are working hard in collaboration for the development of therapeutics and vaccines to put a full stop to thousands of deaths occurring worldwide every day. Few of them have cleared phase I trials and there is an anticipation of a potential vaccine by the end of the year 2020. Clinicians are advised to see the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), USA, website for changes in guidance for testing, treatment, and infection control. Response actions against the ferocious nCoV must be aggressive. Until a new vaccine against nCoV becomes available, avoidance of viral spreading is the most appropriate way to flatten the curve for the number of people getting infected and dying due to COVID-19.</p>
