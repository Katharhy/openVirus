<p id="Par17">Protein structure modeling studies have shown that (ACE2) is the receptor for the S protein of SARS-CoV. The complex structure of ACE2 with the RBD of S protein of SARS viruses has been resolved and it demonstrated tight interaction among them. Recent studies have confirmed that nCoV binds to ACE2. Structural analysis of potential interactions between RBD of S protein from the human SARS virus and ACE2 protein depicted several interaction points [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Interestingly, the interaction between RBD of 2019-nCoV and human ACE2 depicted only one potential hydrophobic interaction between ACE2 (L79, M82) and RBD (F486) and one cation-Ï€ interaction ACE2 (K353)/RBD (Y492) (N Dong - 2020 F1000). This gives definitive leads that ACE2 has a pivotal role in virus infectivity and pathogenicity and opens up doors for specific and targeted drug design for combating the pathogenicity and lethality of the nCoV which elicited worldwide pandemic.
