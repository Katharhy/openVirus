<p id="p0065">Our next step was to expose the mutant 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> produced above to a combination of 5-FU (2.5 µg ml
 <sup>−1</sup>) plus deoxyadenosine (100 µg ml
 <sup>−1</sup>). The culture was sensitive to this combination and we were able to isolate resistant colonies, likely to be mutants of either purine nucleoside phosphorylase or thymidine phosphorylase according to the reactions presented below. Analysis of resistant colonies showed that both class of mutants were present

 <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Our attempts to isolate mutants of uridine phosphorylase were based on the same principle, except that instead of deoxyadenosine we used adenosine in the selective medium
