<p id="p0060">Subsequently, we isolated bacterial colonies resistant to 2.5 µg ml
 <sup>−1</sup> of 5-FU and assumed that they had mutations of uracil phophoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.29). Next we exposed this mutant to10µg ml
 <sup>−1</sup> of 5-FU and from their sensitivity to this concentration we concluded that they retained purine nucleoside phosphorylase and thymidine phosphorylase activities. These enzymes are found in human cells too, and a deficiency of purine nucleoside phosphorylase can cause lymphospecific toxicity

 <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, and disorder of the immune system leading to neurologic symptoms and autoimmune disorders 
 <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Thymidine phosphorylase is also present in humans and its deficiency can lead to mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy
