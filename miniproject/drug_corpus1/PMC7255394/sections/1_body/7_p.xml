<p>Our data do not lend themselves to broad conclusions, though certain patterns do emerge. The fact that almost all cases studied were previously healthy children is logical, given that children are mostly a healthy population (
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) with substantially fewer comorbidities than adults. We attribute the relatively high number of PICU admissions (i.e., seven children in 45 d) to selection bias (
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In light of previously published reports, it appears that this rate of PICU admission is higher than in other countries with fewer hospital admissions. As we explained in the Introduction, in Madrid, there were only two active PICUs during the pandemic; so we received a higher number of children, including COVID-19 cases (
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). We also observed that only two cases required inotropic support, and four needed respiratory support beyond nasal cannula or HFNC. The patients described here presented with mild to severe illness and responded favorably to supportive management. In some cases, PICU admission may have been premature, driven by uncertainty as to the course of the disease in these children.
