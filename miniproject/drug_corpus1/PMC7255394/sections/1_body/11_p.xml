<p>This study has several limitations. It is based on data from a single center and as such must be interpreted with caution. Also, this article shows preliminary data. The pandemic is not ended, and we may observe new PICU admissions. An external validation of our results or management approaches should be undertaken for purposes of reproducibility. We applied pharmacologic therapy that is not evidence based, thus preventing us from drawing conclusions as to their utility.</p>
