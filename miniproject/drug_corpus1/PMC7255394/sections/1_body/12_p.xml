<p>In conclusion, this manuscript presents a series of children requiring critical care due to COVID-19. All were treated in a tertiary PICU setting during the pandemic. The patients described were previously healthy for the most part and are over 1 year old. Respiratory symptoms were the leading cause of admission, and as a result, respiratory support was the principal therapy. Patients receiving MV showed deterioration on the first day of admission. It appears that close monitoring is needed to effectively treat these children. Multicenter studies are necessary for comparison and to contribute new knowledge about treating children critically ill with COVID-19.</p>
