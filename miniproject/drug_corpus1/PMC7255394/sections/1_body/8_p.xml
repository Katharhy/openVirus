<p>Previous series of studies have described that severe COVID-19 was more prevalent in infants. However, in our experience, older children developed more serious disease (
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). This finding should be confirmed by multicenter studies (
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). As for complimentary testing, not all cases presented with lymphopenia on admission, and in some cases, this outcome appeared later. Our patients showed elevated 
 <sc>d</sc>-dimer levels. Other markers (such as ferritin and interleukin-6) were not present in all patients. These indicators were elevated in patients with a more severe disease course.
