<p>Turning now to respiratory management, we observed that the use of nasal cannula was insufficient, even where no other instabilities were observed. Patients who received HFNC therapy were later moved to NIV. In cases where MV was needed, deterioration took place during the first day of admission, possibly indicating a need for close monitoring of children diagnosed with bilateral pneumonia and COVID-19. One child with an underlying condition suffered a bilateral pneumothorax after 4 weeks of MV. After this complication, he developed refractory hypoxemia and hypercapnia. It was impossible to successfully modify the ventilator settings without increasing air leak. Because of the clinical deterioration and after discussion with the oncologist, we decided to initiate extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). He currently remains on ECMO support.</p>
