    "Highlights • Viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), influenza, RSV, and many others are usually associated with increased oxidative stress leading to oxidative cellular and tissue damage resulting in multi-organ failure.• Vitamin C has demonstrated favorable therapeutic properties safety profile throughout a wide range of clinical application.• Administration of high dose of vitamin C as therapeutic agent can favorably impact patient with viral pneumonia and ARDS in severe SAR-CoV-2 infected patients by decreasing inflammation, pathogens infectiveness and virulence, optimizing immune defense, reducing tissues and organs injuries and improving the overall outcome of the disease.• Other nutraceutical antioxidants that widely available as OTC drugs or food supplements can be used to improve redox balance and reduce the tissue damages in patients with viral pneumonia and ARDS• Further clinical trials are needed to validate the effectiveness and develop an optimal therapeutic protocol for high dose of vitamin C treatment for pneumonia and ARDS in patients with viral infection. Coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses increase oxidative stress in the body leading to cellular and tissue damage. To combat this, administration of high dose vitamin C (ascorbic acid or ascorbate), in addition to the standard conventional supportive treatments, has been shown in literature as a safe and effective therapy for severe cases of respiratory viral infections. Morbidity, mortality, infectiveness, and spread of infectious diseases are dependent on the host-pathogen relationship. Given the lack of effective and safe anti-viral drugs for coronaviruses, there should be more attention in supporting host immune defense, cytoprotection, and immunoregulation. The implementation of a high dose of vitamin C therapy could dramatically reduce the need for high doses of corticosteroids, antibacterial and anti-viral drugs that may be immunosuppressive, adrenal depressive, and toxic, complicating the disease course. In order to effectively fight the novel virus, medical professionals should explore readily available pharmaceutical and nutritional therapeutic agents with proven antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immune-supportive properties. Supplemental Vitamin C may also provide additional benefits for the prevention of viral infections, shorten the course, and lessen the complication of the disease."
