<p id="p0670">Given the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become indispensable to work as fast as possible to develop vaccines for global distribution. However, protocols are necessary to safekeep the population’s health. Hence, before allowing human testing of COVID-19 vaccines, regulatory organizations must evaluate their safety against a series of virus strains and more than one animal model. They also must demand preclinical evidences that experimental vaccines prevent infection – even if it means waiting weeks or months for models to become available. This is time well-spent, once testing vaccines without investing the due amount of time to completely understand the risks can lead to setbacks for current and future pandemics.
