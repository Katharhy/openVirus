 </xref> reported that five patients with extreme symptoms of COVID-19 received blood transfusion containing convalescent plasma with specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. After a series of blood transfusions, the improvement in clinical status of patients was observed. Viral loads also decreased and became negative within 12 days after the transfusion, and SARS-CoV-2–specific ELISA and nAbs titers increased following the transfusion. In spite of the limited sample, the authors concluded that convalescent plasma transfusion benefited patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, testing safety and efficacy of transfusing convalescent plasma in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 can be of value.
