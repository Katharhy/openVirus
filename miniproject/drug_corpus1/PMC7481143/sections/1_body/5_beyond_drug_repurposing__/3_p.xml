<p id="p0650">Development of either monoclonal (mAbs) or polyclonal (pAbs) neutralizing antibodies is a commonly adopted immunotherapeutic alternative due to its specificity, purity, low contamination by blood-transmitted pathogens and relative safety. However, there are limitations to the use of nAbs once its development and large-scale production for clinical use are a complex, expensive and slow process.
