 </xref> to elucidate the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 at a higher resolution. In spite of different interactions with ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD /ACE2 and SARS-CoV RBD /ACE2 interfaces share a substantial similarity regarding the surface area, the number of interacting residues and the networks of hydrophilic interactions. Such similarity strongly points to a convergent evolution of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBD structure which improves the binding affinity for the same receptor, the ACE2. The non-conserved RBD regions in S protein, such as subunit S2, could be potential targets for cross-reactive antibodies. Considering RBD as a critical region for receptor binding, antibodies that target the conserved epitopes in the RBD are also good candidates for the development of highly potent cross-reactive therapeutic agents against several species of CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2.
