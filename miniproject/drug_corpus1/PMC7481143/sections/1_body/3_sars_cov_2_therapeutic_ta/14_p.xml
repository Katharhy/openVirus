 <sup>pro</sup> is key enzyme for CoVs, also called Main protease (M
 <sup>pro</sup>), that plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, making it an attractive target for anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs. Such claim is reinforced by studies by Jin et al.

 <bold>(1)</bold> is a time-dependent irreversible inhibitor of this enzyme and that a stable covalent bond is formed between N3 and 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. High-throughput screening (HTS) was applied to 10,000 drugs and drug candidates, demonstrating that Ebselen 
 <bold>(2)</bold>, PX-12 
 <bold>(3)</bold> and Carmofur 
 <bold>(4)</bold> are all able to covalently bind to 3CL

 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> ). It is likely that a part of the hits identified by HTS are bonded to the catalytic cysteine of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> through their sulfhydryl groups. 
 <italic>In-vitro</italic> studies on antiviral activity were performed to corroborate the results. Real Time Quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) demonstrated that Ebselen and N3 had the strongest antiviral effects at a concentration of 10 μM treatment in SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells. After plaque-reduction assay, the dose-response curves suggested that both could penetrate cellular membrane to access their targets. This result strongly supports the hypothesis that developing a single antiviral agent targeting 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> or in combination with other therapies could provide an effective first line of defence against all CoVs related diseases.
