 </xref> through bioinformatics, analysed possible SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic targets. The proteins coded by this virus were verified and compared to proteins coded by other CoVs. The results enabled the detection of structural similarities to SARS-CoV, from which it was possible to conduct homology modelling to build 19 proteins for SARS-CoV-2. Among the targets were spike (S) glycoprotein, Nsp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase - RdRp), enzyme helicase, 3CL
