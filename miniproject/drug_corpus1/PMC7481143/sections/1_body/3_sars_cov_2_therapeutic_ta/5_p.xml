<p id="p0135">The moment when the virus approximates the target cell prompts the recognition by the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S glycoprotein of its receptor, which leads to the binding to subunit S1. Next, the subunit S2 allows fusion of viral and cellular membranes, which enables entry in the cell and the release of viral RNA genome.

 <xref rid="b0330" ref-type="bibr">66</xref> Some investigations suggest that the strong binding affinity between S protein and ACE2 is essential for viral entry, hence, ACE2 is also relevant for the development of drugs.
