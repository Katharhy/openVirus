<p id="p0150">Investigations on ligands obtained from DrugBank 5.1 used molecular Docking to identify target regions in the pockets of the quaternary structure of SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein (from Protein Data Bank-PDB). Six pockets present in S glycoprotein deserve further investigation in medicinal chemistry due to suitable features for small molecule binding. Among the six pockets, the eight best ligand candidates from DrugBank were all binding pocket #1, which contained residues of amino acids Proline, Leucine, Lysine, Asparagine, Phenylalanine, Glycine, Threonine, Glutamine, Alanine, Methionine and Tyrosine. One of the best ligands was the drug Saquinavir, an antiviral from the class of protease inhibitors, used in anti-HIV therapy.
