<p id="p0120">During the development of drugs to fight microorganisms, the adoption of strategies that allow the design of molecules to act against specific biological targets of bacteria, parasites or viruses is preferred. Therapies for CoVs can be divided into several categories, based on specific paths: (1) CoVs proteins or functional enzymes that are essential for viral replication; (2) structural proteins of the virus that prevent its binding to the respective receptors in human cells or its assembly process; (3) some viral factor that restores the hostâ€™s inherent immunity and; (4) host-specific enzymes or receptors, that prevent the entry of the virus in the host cells.
