 </xref> A viral infection is successful when the virus crosses the host cell membrane through binding and fusions with the cellular membrane, a process mediated by specialized viral proteins.

 </xref> In relation to SARS-CoV-2, its life cycle starts with the activation of protein S by the cellular serine protease (TMPRSS2) and trypsin-like protease from airways (TMPRSS11D), to link to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor.

 <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The ACE2 is a counterbalance enzyme responsible for controlling the extracellular liquid volume and arterial pressure of the human body. It is largely expressed in fifteen human tissues, including ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes form pulmonary alveoli, the main location of lesions caused by SARS-CoV-2.
