<p id="p0070">After ACE2 receptor-binding, a conformational alteration occurs in protein S allowing the fusion between the viral envelope and the host cell membrane via endosomal. Then, SARS-CoV-2 releases the RNA into the cytoplasm to be translated into viral replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, which are processed by 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> and PL
 <sup>pro</sup> proteases, respectively. The cleavage products are 16 Nsps that form the transcription and replication complex.

 </xref> Next, the positive RNA strand is translated into a template of negative strand that allows the synthesis of new genomics and sub genomics mRNAs. These mRNAs are translated and transcribed producing structural and accessory proteins. Viral proteins and RNA genomic are put together in virions at endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex, finally transported through vesicles and released from the cell host for infecting new cells.
