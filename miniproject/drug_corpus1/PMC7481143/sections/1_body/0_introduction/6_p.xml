<p id="p0025">Identifying drugs that can be repurposed has its starting point in the techniques of virtual triage and molecular modelling to verify possible interactions between the selected viral targets and the drug structures present in their molecular libraries.

 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Such approaches have enabled the identification of molecules with promising results against SARS-CoV-2. In addition to advanced clinical assays for more conclusive information, a number of 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> investigations have also provided data on drugs to be repurposed against COVID-19. It is important to highlight that, if one compound is active against a viral disease such as COVID-19, there can be a mechanism of action that explains its efficacy and supports its use. Hence, the present article highlights the already known or proposed mechanisms of action of molecules or drugs pointed out as promising, or even tested, in patients with COVID-19. In our opinion, the key for a chemical molecule with antiviral activity might be found on its biological basis or in one of the stages of infection. Thus, before discussing the therapeutic alternatives and its pharmacological characteristics, that include probable antiviral mechanisms, this article presents general information on the SARS-CoV-2 biology, the pathophysiology and symptoms of COVID-19 as well as the features that are indispensable to understand this challenging disease.
