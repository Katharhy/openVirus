<p id="p0685">Hence, the currently available data on the classes of drugs investigated here revealed that drugs were considered promising mainly after 
 <italic>in-silico</italic> tests only. In fact, the inefficacy of some of these drugs became evident after 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> or 
 <italic>in-vivo</italic> tests, as CQ and HCQ, whose clinical trials failed to confirm the so-expected anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. It is necessary to highlight the importance of clinical trials with drugs considered promising in theoretical studies, with due calm and openness to question and refute hypotheses, in the absence of scientific evidence to support their use to treat COVID-19. Similarly, the careful analysis of practices involving patients with the extreme form of the disease is also important to identify new alternatives, such as the results recently published by RECOVERY on dexamethasone. It is also expected that detailed clinical trials are conducted with some of the drugs described in this article as potential anti-SARS-CoV-2, for instance Sofosbuvir, Remdesivir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir plus interferon beta-1b and ribavirin, Ivermectin and Arbidol. These studies could establish new therapeutic alternatives that are safer and capable of effectively fighting COVID-19, which already infected millions of people in the world. Moreover, it is fundamentally relevant to develop a broader spectrum of effective and safe antivirals, beyond other pharmacological classes that might be useful for combating HCoVs diseases. Otherwise, likely the feeling of déjà vu, due to the lack of antivirals to treat disease as previous and the current pandemic,
