<p id="p0680">Quinoline derivatives, HCQ and CQ, were some of the first drugs investigated. After several 
 <italic>in-silico</italic>, 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in-vivo</italic> assays, based on results presented by RECOVERY to the present date, unfortunately, these drugs were proven ineffective in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Ivermectin represents macrolide derivatives and is suggested as promising due to both immunomodulatory activity and inhibitory activity on nuclear transport when administered at the early stages of the disease. Among indole derivatives, Arbidol was pointed out as useful for reducing viral binding and releasing of intracellular vacuoles that contain the virus. Nonetheless, clinical trials are still necessary after dose adjustment for better outcomes. Both indole derivatives (emetine and HHT), in spite of promising results, were only submitted to 
 <italic>in-silico</italic> and 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> tests, thus demanding further investigation on their toxicity and mechanism of control.
