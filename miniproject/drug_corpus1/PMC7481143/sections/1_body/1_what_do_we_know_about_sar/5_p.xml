<p id="p0045">Since the announcement of the pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), due to the worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2, scientists have begun fast and detailed investigations on this coronavirus. The results achieved thus far show that SARS-CoV-2 displays a typical HCoVs structure, once its overall genome sequence, from samples of five patients, presented homology of about 79.5% to sequence of SARS-CoV
