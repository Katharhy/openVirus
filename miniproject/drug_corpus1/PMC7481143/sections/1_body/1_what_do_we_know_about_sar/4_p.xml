 </xref> The genome is enclosed by a helical capsid and an envelope with glycoproteins spike (S) forming saliences like a crown, which is responsible for the virus “

 <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> For all CoVs, about two-thirds of the genome are open reading frames (ORFs). In a typical CoV, there are at least six ORFs responsible for the codification of structural and non-structural virus proteins.

 </xref> Among these ORFs of SARS-CoV-2, two of them identified as ORF1a and ORF1b encode the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, respectively. Afterwards, these polyproteins are cleaved by two viral proteases, the papain-like protease (PL
 <sup>pro</sup>) and the 3 chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>), yielding 16 non-structural proteins (Nsps) encompassed in genome transcription and replication.

 <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Other ORFs of the virus genome encode structural proteins, including those related to physical structure of viral particles (capsid, envelope), such as the glycoproteins spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The N protein has the RNA genome and the S, E and M proteins constitute the viral envelope.
