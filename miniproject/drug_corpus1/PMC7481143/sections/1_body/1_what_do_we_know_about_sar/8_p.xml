<p id="p0060">The diagnosis of COVID-19 was rapidly implemented through the identification of the virus in human samples due to prior understanding of its molecular biology as well as available advances and technology. SARS-CoV-2 infection is generally detected by reverse transcriptaseâ€“polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique or by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that enable identification of IgM and IgG immunoglobulins, nucleocapsid (NC) antigens and receptor-binding domain of S (RBD-S).

 </xref> There is no evidence that the antibodies produced will protect from a new SARS-CoV-2 infection, and people infected respond differently from asymptomatic infection, moving from mild to severe infections. We suppose that explanations for the various presentations of COVID-19 rely on the virus inherent pathogenicity and on the host susceptibility, both of which are described on the next topic.
