 <bold>(33)</bold> (
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) is a benzene derivative that has been evaluated for repurposing against COVID-19. This drug is an antiviral used in the treatment of HIV-1 infections. It provides a great genetic barrier to resistance and is highly active against resistant strains of HIV-1 that are not susceptible to other protease inhibitors.

 </xref> Darunavir is administered orally as pills or suspension and is often used with low doses of ritonavir as part of a combined ART protocol.

 </xref> Its mechanism of actions works by protease inhibition. Darunavir establishes high affinity bonds to HIV-1 protease forming a stable complex, thereby selectively inhibiting polyprotein gag-pol coded by the virus. This prevents the formation of mature viral particles.
