 <italic>in-vivo</italic> analysis of the effects of lopinavir/ritonavir on MERS-CoV in common marmoset. Four groups were established: control, lopinavir/ritonavir treatment, Interferon-Beta-1b and; mycophenolate mofetil. The lopinavir/ritonavir group achieved better clinical results than the control group, such as limited weight loss, stabilization of temperature, little pulmonary infiltration and smaller viral load. The outcomes are corroborated by a Korean case study with an individual of 64 years of age, positive for MERS-CoV and treated with LPV/ritonavir by mouth (lopinavir 400 mg/ritonavir 10 mg 2*day), ribavirin and IFN-2a.
