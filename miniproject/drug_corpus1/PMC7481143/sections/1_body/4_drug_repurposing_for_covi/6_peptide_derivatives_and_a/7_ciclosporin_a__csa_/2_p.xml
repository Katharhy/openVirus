 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) is isolated from the fungus 
 <italic>Beauveria nivea</italic> and was approved for use by the FDA in 1983. This drug has been used for decades to prevent organ rejection and to treat T cell-associated autoimmune diseases such as Behcetâ€™s disease, psoriatic arthritis, lupus nephritis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus or interstitial lung disease. Such drug exerts its immunosuppressive function and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the transcription of genes required for T cell proliferation, notably interleukin-2.
