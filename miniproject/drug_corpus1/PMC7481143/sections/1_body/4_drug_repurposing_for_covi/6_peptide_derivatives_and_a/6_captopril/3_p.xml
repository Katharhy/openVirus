 </xref> Two drugs were identified as ligands for the enzyme active site: captopril and disulfiram. The former binds to the active site at the same position of N3 inhibitor (a standard inhibitor that reacts irreversibly in the same site with 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> Cys145). It is, thus, suggested that captopril binds to the same site of N3, obstructing the function of Cys145–His41 catalytic dyad. Captopril probably inhibits the enzyme in two stages. Initially, it establishes non-covalent bonds to sites in the enzyme targets, then, a reaction takes place between the critic groups, which results in a more stable inhibitor complex. The hypothesis is that captopril can bind covalently to 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> Cys145. Although the potential of captopril on the enzyme has been demonstrated, therapeutic use against COVID-19 is controversial, once the drug induces overexpression of ACE2 – the main receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to entry the cells. Therefore, combination with other drugs, such as angiotensin-II receptor blockers, needs analysis to clarify the effects of captopril in COVID-19 treatment.
