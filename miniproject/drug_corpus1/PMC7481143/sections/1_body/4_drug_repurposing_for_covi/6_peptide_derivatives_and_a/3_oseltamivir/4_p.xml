<p id="p0375">An 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> study using molecular docking focused on the binding properties of SARS-CoV-2 protein structures to 61 antiviral agents, including oseltamivir. The study showed that 37 molecules form bonds to SARS-CoV-2 crystal proteins. However, data did not show oseltamivir as the best structure because Lopinavir, Asunaprevir and Remdesivir interacted with more than two protein structures in the virus. Hence, they are likely more promising than oseltamivir.

 </xref> Notwithstanding, we suggest further look into oseltamivir against other enzyme targets since different studies achieved positive results regarding its use as anti-SARS-CoV-2.
