The main researchers in RECOVERY have released a statement on June 5th 2020 to interrupt ongoing investigations on HCQ since there was no clinical benefit in using the drug to treat patients admitted with COVID-19 and no relevant change in mortality at 28 days of the study and no improvements on the time of admission. The data was obtained from comparing 1.542 random HCQ patients to 3.132 random patients under the usual care. Based on the RECOVERY data, it was concluded that HCQ is not effective in patients admitted with COVID-19. This highlights the importance of randomized clinical trials and the collection of clear data on the efficacy and safety of medications.
