<p id="p0525">A factor that facilitates viral replication is the acidic pH of endosomes, lysosomes and Golgi complex of the host. Thus, CQ is promising because it increases the pH of intracellular vacuoles, binds to the cellular receptors, changes the glycosylation and because of its selective and reversible immunomodulator effect on human CD4+T cells. HCQ exerts similar mechanism of action: a) increases the pH; b) modulation of activated immune cells; c) reduces the number of pro-inflammatory cytokine and other mediators to control inflammation.
