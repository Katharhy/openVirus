 </xref> used the docking methodology to better understand the mechanism of inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein with 34 antiviral compounds. Based on this study results, imatinib was one of the highly binding affinities performed against the aforementioned target, with the lowest micromolar Ki values among the compounds evaluated. In line with this study, an

 </xref> found 17 FDA approved drugs that inhibited SARS-CoV-2 at non-cytotoxic concentrations. The authors indicate imatinib as one of the hits, since it exhibited IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 3.24 μM. They subsequently determined the mechanism of action, demonstrating this drug inhibits fusion of CoVs with cellular membranes, precluding their entry. This result indicates imatinib use against SARS-CoV-2. However, its efficacy and safety need to be better confirmed in further preclinical and clinical trials in order to elect him as candidate drug in the treatment of COVID-19.
