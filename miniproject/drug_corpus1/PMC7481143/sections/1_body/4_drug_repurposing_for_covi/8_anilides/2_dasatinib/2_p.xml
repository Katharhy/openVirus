Nevertheless, the authors reported that dasatinib may be valuable against coronaviruses infections if a dosing regimen that minimizes immunotoxicity while still blocking viral replication can be defined. Results indicated this drug as a likely therapeutic alternative against SARS-CoV-2 infection. An
