<p id="p0200">Regarding antiviral activity, there are several approved drugs that are classified as pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis inhibitors (PNBI) because, after phosphorylation, they are incorporated either into the DNA or into the RNA and inhibit hosts or pathogenic enzymes, such as polymerases.

 </xref> Therefore, the likely mechanism of action of some pyrimidine derivative drugs has been considered for repurposing. Some pyrimidine derivatives with antiviral activity are often formulated as prodrugs. This format solves issues of high polarity in its final structure prompted by the phosphonic acid, which interferes with pharmacological properties and causes low cellular permeability and low oral bioavailability.
