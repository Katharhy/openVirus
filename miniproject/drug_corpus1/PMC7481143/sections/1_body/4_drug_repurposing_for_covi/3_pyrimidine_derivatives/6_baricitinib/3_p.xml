Regarding these two antitumor drugs, it is known that sunitinib is an oral oxindole multitargeted kinase inhibitor that inhibits certain tyrosine kinases including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR types 1 and 2), platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR-α and PDGFR-β), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET) and the receptor of macrophage-colony stimulating factor (CSF1R).

 </xref> Concerning erlotinib, it was developed as reversible and highly specific small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that competitively blocks the binding of adenosine triphosphate to its binding site in the tyrosine kinase domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), thereby inhibiting autophosphorylation and blocking downstream signalling.
