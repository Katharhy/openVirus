 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) is a thymidine nucleoside analogue used with specific activity against the hepatitis B virus (HBV). It starts acting after phosphorylation by cellular kinases, which results in the active metabolite, Telbivudine 5′–triphosphate, enabling DNA polymerase and inhibiting viral replication. The hydroxyl at 3-position in the sugar β-L-2′-desoxirribose provides specificity to HBV polymerase.

 </xref> Suggesting repurposing TBV to fight COVID-19 was prompted by virtual screening to find drugs that act on viral M
 <sup>pro</sup>. Among other results were Ribavirin, TBV and two vitamins, cyanocobalamin (B12) and nicotinamide (B3). Researchers suggest that these four drugs can be combined and used against COVID-19, once they are safe, marketed and approved by the authorities.

 </xref> Notwithstanding, the suggestion of repurposing these drugs requires more information, including on drug interaction parameters. In spite of well-tolerated and safe for monotherapy, associating TBV and ribavirin, another antiviral drug, can increase hepatotoxic activities of TBV.
