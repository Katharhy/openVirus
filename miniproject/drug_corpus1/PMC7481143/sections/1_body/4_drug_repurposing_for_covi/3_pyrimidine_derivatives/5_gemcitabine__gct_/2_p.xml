 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), an analogue of deoxycytidine whose pharmacological action is triggered after the intracellular transformation into triphosphate gemcitabine. The latter competes with endogenous nucleoside triphosphates by incorporation into the genetic material, thus inhibiting DNA synthesis.

 </xref> Initially, GCT was developed for antiviral activity, however, initial results caused it to be redirected for anticancer therapy. It became, then, widely used against non-small cell lung cancer, pancreas, bladder and breast cancers as well.

 <italic>In-vitro</italic> analyses of gemcitabine hydrochloride inhibited MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, with a CE

 <xref rid="b0495" ref-type="bibr">99</xref> These data are indicative of a possible activity against SARS-CoV-2, but complementary preclinical investigations are necessary before clinical trials. Albeit considered a safe drug under predetermined doses, GCT adverse effects are noteworthy and include myelosuppression and disruption of liver functions.
