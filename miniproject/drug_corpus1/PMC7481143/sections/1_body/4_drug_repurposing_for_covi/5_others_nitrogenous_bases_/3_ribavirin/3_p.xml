 </xref> investigated the effects of Interferon-α2b and ribavirin in the replication of nCoV isolate hCoV-EMC/2012 replication in Vero and LLC-MK2 cells. IFN-α2b displayed complete cytopathogenic effect (CPE) at 1000 U/ml and above, whereas ribavirin presented complete CPE at 200 μg/ml and above. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> of IFN-α2b and ribavirin was subsequently determined to be 58.08 U/ml and 41.45 μg/ml, respectively. Tests against LLC-MK2 cells were also conducted. IFN-α2b, at the maximum concentration tested (2000 U/ml), reduced infectious titers by 3.97-log. On the other hand, ribavirin treatment, at 200 μg/ml or higher, reduced infectious virus below the detection threshold of 13.7 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml. Next, these drugs were tested in combination to determine whether one compound would augment the activity of the other. 
 <italic>In-vitro</italic> cell combined treatment lowered the threshold at which a decrease in CPE was noted. For Vero cells, the absence of CPE was verified at and above 125 U/ml IFN-α2b and 25 μg/ml ribavirin. This represents an 8-fold decrease of IFN-α2b and 16-fold decrease of ribavirin. These data suggest that combining IFN-α2b and ribavirin is a likely an alternative treatment.
