 <bold>(22)</bold> (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) is a powerful triazole-based antiviral analogue to guanosine. It presents a wide range of pharmacological activities related to several viruses, for instance: herpes simplex virus, human immunodeficiency (HVI-1), influenza, respiratory syncytial (RSV) and hepatitis C.

 <xref rid="b0775" ref-type="bibr">155</xref> The drug was initially used in 1980 to treat syncytial virus in children, generally combined with Interferon (INF). However, ribavirin treatment presents undesirable adverse effects, like lowering of haemoglobin, which limit clinical use.

 </xref> Its action mechanism relies on the inhibition of enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, necessary in the synthesis of guanosine triphosphate, which prevents viral DNA and, mainly, RNA replication. The necessary concentration for 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> inhibition of RSV and influenza ranges from 3 to 10 μg/mL.

 </xref> Because of the range of antiviral actions, ribavirin has been thoroughly investigated as an alternative for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and, most recently, SARS-CoV-2 treatment.
