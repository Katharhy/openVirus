 </xref> The promising results showed reduction in mortality for cases with severe respiratory complications and no significant results for cases that dispensed oxygen support. Dexamethasone reduced death for ventilated patients by one-third and for patients receiving oxygen only deaths were reduced by one fifth. The announcement highlights that high quality and robust clinical trials, such as RECOVERY, that elucidated the utility and efficacy of dexamethasone, must be conducted to collect data that subsidize the repurposing of drugs for COVID-19 therapy.
