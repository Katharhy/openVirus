 <xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>), date back to 1881. However, only in the 1940s that DSF would become popular when it was discovered that it could form copper chelates which favoured the death of micro-organisms and enabled treatment of intestinal parasites.

 <xref rid="b1535" ref-type="bibr">307</xref> In 1945, DSF alcohol sensitivity was discovered accidentally and it was soon used in the clinical treatment of alcohol dependence.
 <xref rid="b1540" ref-type="bibr">308</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b1545" ref-type="bibr">309</xref> DSF is used to treat alcohol dependence because it irreversibly inhibits the acetaldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme and modifies cysteine residues in its active site. This change prompts the formation of a disulphide bond between two cysteine residues in the active site.

 </xref> Adding to the list of drugs to be repurposed against SARS-CoV-2, recent studies indicate that DSF is able to inhibit other enzymes, such as methyltransferase, urease and kinase, all by reacting with important cysteine residues that suppress the natural cycle of the enzymes, suggesting broad-spectrum characteristics.
