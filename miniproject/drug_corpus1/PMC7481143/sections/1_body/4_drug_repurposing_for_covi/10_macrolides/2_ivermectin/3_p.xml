<p id="p0565">Based on the fact that SARS-CoV-2 is a RNA virus deeply related to SARS-CoV, studies on SARS-CoV proteins have revealed a potential role for IMP α/β1 during infection in signal-dependent nucleocytoplasmic shutting of the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein.

 </xref> Furthermore, the SARS-CoV accessory protein ORF6 has been shown to antagonize the antiviral activity of the STAT1 transcription factor by sequestering IMP α/β1 on the rough ER/Golgi membrane.
