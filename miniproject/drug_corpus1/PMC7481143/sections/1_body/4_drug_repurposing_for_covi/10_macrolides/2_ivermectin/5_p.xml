<p id="p0575">A different mechanism of action that consolidates the use of ivermectin against COVID-19 is its immunomodulatory property. The inflammatory response (proinflammatory cytokine) is exaggerated in patients with the extreme case of the disease, which is likely explained by the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α) that is activated by the virus when no inhibitory medication is administered. This understanding can be explained by the study conducted by Kosyna et al.

 </xref>, whose lab tests with and without ivermectin aimed to examine whether the properties of the bond between HIF-1α and IMP α/β1 and between HIF-1 and nuclear localization signals were affected by the hypoxia mechanism on the cellular level. The authors concluded that ivermectin inhibited both IMP α/β1 and HIF-1α.
