 <bold>(20)</bold> (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) is the antiviral prodrug of GCV taken by mouth. It is indicated for the same treatments as GCV (cytomegalovirus in people who have AIDS, gastrointestinal disorders related to AIDS). The drug has great bioavailability and is converted by hydrolysis into ganciclovir. Using valganciclovir in its oral form enables clinical treatment and makes patients more comfortable.

 </xref> The assay with the main proteins coded for SARS-CoV-2 allowed the determination of 21 possible binding targets, of which 19 were proteins and 2 host targets. Valganciclovir, one of the drugs used in the study, was presented as a possible anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic drug due to its high binding affinity to two well-established viral targets. The first target was PL
 <sup>pro</sup>, indispensable enzyme in viral replication; the second, RdRp, conserved Nsp12 in coronavirus, which is vital for its replication/transcription. Therefore, valganciclovir could be a significant antiviral drug to treat SARS-CoV-2. But there are no clinical reports on valganciclovir used to treat COVID-19 in addition to what has been reported about GCV.
