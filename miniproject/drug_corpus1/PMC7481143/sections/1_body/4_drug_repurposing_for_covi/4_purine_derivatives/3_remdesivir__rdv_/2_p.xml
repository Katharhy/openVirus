RDV is an antiviral agent developed by Gilead Sciences in 2017 under the name of GS-5734. It is an adenosine analogue prodrug first developed to treat Ebola (EBOV), but it presents a broad antiviral spectrum including diverse RNA viruses such as human respiratory syncytial virus (HSRV), MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and Nipah virus.

The latter works as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) analogue, which means it competes with the natural ATP substrate and inhibits RdRp causing premature termination of RNA chains during replication.
