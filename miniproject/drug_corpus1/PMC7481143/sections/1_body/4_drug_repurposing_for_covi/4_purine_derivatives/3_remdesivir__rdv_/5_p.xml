<p id="p0280">Regarding COVID-19, RDV was used to treat the first US case. The patient was 35 years old, had slight cough, low fever and no evidence of pneumonia at day 4 of the disease. When the clinical symptoms became worse, the patient was given vancomycin and cefepime. As the symptoms worsened, intravenous treatment with RDV was administered at day 7, and vancomycin and cefepime were no longer administered. At day 8, the patient displayed clinical improvement, unfortunately details on the doses and duration of treatment were not provided.

 </xref> This study of efficacy involved 53 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who displayed saturation equal or inferior to 94% while they were breathing ambient air or receiving oxygen support. The treatment lasted 10 days, patients were given 200 mg intravenously on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for the remaining 9 days of treatment. Follow up of patients treated for 18 days indicated that, after the first dose of RDV, 68% improved oxygen support whereas 15% of patients got sicker, 47% were discharged and mortality rate was 13%. The most common adverse events (60% of patients) were increased hepatic enzymes, diarrhoea, rash, renal impairment, and hypotension. Some limitations were noted in the study, such as the small size of the cohort, the short duration of follow-up and the lack of information on the patients. Hence, the efficacy of RDV requires validation by the ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled trials.
