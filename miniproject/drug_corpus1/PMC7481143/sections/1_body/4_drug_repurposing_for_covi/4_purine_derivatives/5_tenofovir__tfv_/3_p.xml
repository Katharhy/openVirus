 </xref> In addition to the efficacy of treatment, clinical trials can validate the prevalence of adverse effects related to the toxicity of TFV in patients. TFV is also a powerful nephrotoxic drug causing damage to proximal tubular cells. In spite of that, interrupting the treatment is sufficient to improve adverse effects, which makes monitoring of patients essential.
