 </xref> TFV is an analogue reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI). Inside cells, TFV is phosphorylated and competes with deoxyadenosine 5′-monophosphate (d-AMP), thus preventing the formation of DNA. Once incorporated into a growing DNA strand, it causes premature termination of DNA transcription and prevents viral replication.
