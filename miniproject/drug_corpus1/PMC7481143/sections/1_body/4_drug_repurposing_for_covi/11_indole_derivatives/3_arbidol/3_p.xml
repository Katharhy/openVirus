<p id="p0595">Arbidol displayed effective inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 after 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> assay on Vero E6 (ATCC-1586) with EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 4.11 μM. The outcome was superior than drugs like baloxavir, which partially inhibited the virus at elevated concentrations (50 μM), or drugs like laninamivir, oseltamivir, peramivir and zanamivir were ineffective for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Data also show that Arbidol not only mitigates viral infection but also interferes with the release of intracellular vesicles that contain the virus.

 </xref> In addition to the promising 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> results, one of the first clinical trials concluded that Arbidol plus LPV/RTV delayed the progression of pulmonary injuries, compared to LPV/RTV in isolation; decreased the possibility of respiratory and faecal transmission by reaching elevated faecal concentrations that interrupts viral replication in the gastrointestinal system – where there is high expression of ACE2, identified as human receptor for virus entry.

 </xref> Despite the results, both investigations recognize their own limitations due to small cohort size and lack of placebo-control group. According to the authors, these limitations are inherent to pandemic times when placebo-control groups are difficult to conduct due to life-threatening conditions.
