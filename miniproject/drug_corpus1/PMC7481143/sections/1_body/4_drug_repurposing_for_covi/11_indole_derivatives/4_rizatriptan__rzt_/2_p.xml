 </xref> Its structure is based on an indole ring replaced with methyltriazole at 5-position and unsubstituted ethanamine replaced with methyl at 3-position, the substitution sites are the same of melatonin (MLT). After virtual triage through molecular dock at spike-ACE2 interface, ligations π-cation, interactions π-π and hydrogen bonds were identified between RZT and the SARS-CoV-2 protein complex. As one of the outstanding compounds in the analysis, 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> tests are still necessary.

 </xref> It is noteworthy that overdosing of the drug can trigger dizziness, fainting, cardiac issues, hypertension, bradycardia and vomiting. Despite the safety of the drug in regular doses, there are no reports on either 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> or 
 <italic>in-vivo</italic> tests to support the theoretical data and the antiviral action thus far.
