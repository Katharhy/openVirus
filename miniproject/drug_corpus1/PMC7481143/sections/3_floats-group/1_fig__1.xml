  <p>SARS-CoV-2 life cycle and putative therapeutic targets. SARS-CoV-2 life cycle starts with the activation of protein S and link to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. After host cell entrance by via endosomal, SARS-CoV-2 releases the RNA into the cytoplasm to be translated into viral replicase polyproteins including proteases (3CLpro and PLpro), which cleavage products (nonstructural proteins- Nsps) form the transcription and replication complex. The positive RNA strand is translated into a template of negative strand that allows the synthesis of new genomics and sub genomics mRNAs. These mRNAs are translated and transcribed producing structural and accessory proteins. Next, the virions are prepared at endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex, transported through vesicles and finally released by exocytosis. The structures of some promising therapeutic targets available on Protein Data Bank are: (a) SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (PDB ID 6VXX); (b) SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain bound with ACE2 (PDB ID 6M0J); (c) Native Human ACE2 (PDB ID 1R42); (d) papain-like protease (PL
   <sup>pro</sup>) of SARS CoV-2 (PDB ID 6W9C); (e) structure of COVID-19 main protease (M
   <sup>pro</sup>) in complex with an inhibitor N3 (PDB ID 6LU7); (f) SARS-Cov-2 RdRp in complex with cofactors (PDB ID 6â€¯M71). Figure created with biorender.com.
