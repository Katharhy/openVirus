<p>Since its publication, prescriptions for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have dramatically increased, standard operating procedures have incorporated hydroxychloroquine as a standard of care, lethal overdoses have occurred, and there are rising concerns that shortages may affect availability for U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved uses of these medications. Premature acceptance of efficacy is not new (swine flu vaccination [

 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]), but it is these prior experiences that influence current standards to require high quality and often multiple randomized control trials to change practice. This high bar contributes to the estimated 17 years it can take for best practices to be translated into medical practice (

Lowering the bar and maintaining scientific rigor is possible when the scientific community harmoniously pivots toward a single target. Remarkably, we have succeeded in this movement by coming together as an international community. Unfortunately, unless we maintain the narrative from our scientific surge, the “bar” we have meticulously repositioned may fall quickly to the floor.
