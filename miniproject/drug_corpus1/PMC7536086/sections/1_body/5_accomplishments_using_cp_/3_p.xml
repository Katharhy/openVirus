<p>One study included 10 severely affected patients who were confirmed positive in a real-time viral RNA test. The patients were administered with a single dose of 200 ml CP, which was extracted from recently recuperated individuals. The virus-neutralizing antibody titres in the extracted CP were above 1:640 and were delivered to the patients as additional support along with other antiviral agents. Within 3 days of administration of CP in the patients, oxyhaemoglobin saturation was enhanced, and clinical symptoms remarkably improved. The lymphocyte count, which was 0.65 × 10
 <sup>9</sup> per litre prior to CP administration, escalated to 0.76 × 10
 <sup>9</sup> per litre. A reduction in the concentration of C-reactive protein from 55.98 to 18.3 mg l
 <sup>−1</sup> was also observed along with the chest computerized tomography (CT) scans revealing a reduction in the pulmonary lesions. The study reported no severe unpropitious effects, and suggested that CP therapy could possibly ameliorate the clinical outcomes by neutralizing viraemia in patients with critical SARS-CoV-2 infection and can serve as a promising rescue option for severe cases of COVID-19 [
