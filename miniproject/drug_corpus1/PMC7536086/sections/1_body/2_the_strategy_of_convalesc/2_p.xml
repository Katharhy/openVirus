<p>CP therapy has been used to prevent and treat several infectious diseases for more than one century and is one of the classic adaptive immunotherapies [

 <xref rid="RSOB200174C59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Results obtained from the meta-analysis of 32 different studies focusing on severe influenza infections and SARS-CoV infections statistically suggested that a significant reduction was observed in the chances of fatalities and rates of mortality due to CP therapy [

To enhance the efficiency of antibody therapies to neutralize the virus, collection and utilization of hyperimmune IgG antibodies from individuals (subjects) who were previously infected by SARS-CoV-2, but now have recovered from COVID-19, is preferred as they have enhanced production and hence an increased amount of the antibodies [

As several strains of the virus exist, and their spread is non-uniform (i.e. the pattern of spread varies in different cities and countries), the potential plasma donors should belong to the same geographical area as the recipients. Cytotoxicity and phagocytosis can be modulated via passive antibody therapy, and in combination with antiviral drugs, viral neutralization can be achieved [

 <xref rid="RSOB200174C62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. For treating or preventing the initial symptoms of COVID-19, virus-neutralizing antibodies in small amounts are considered to be effective. Individuals having chronic underlying diseases, healthy individuals who have been in contact with infected patients and healthcare workers are administered with the serum, and hence, induced passive immunity may last for a few weeks or months [
