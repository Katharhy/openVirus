<p>In various studies, it has been shown that viral infections in the blood, such as SARS-CoV infection, are at their maximum during the first week of the infection [

 <xref rid="RSOB200174C55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The risks associated with the administration of CP have been categorized as known and theoretical risks [
 <xref rid="RSOB200174C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The known risks include reactions against the plasma constituents and unintended infections induced by several infectious agents that might be present in the serum [

During transfusion-related events, the most prevalent adverse effects of CP therapy can be observed, including fevers, anaphylactic reactions, chills, transfusion-associated circulatory overload, haemolysis and transfusion-related acute lung injuries (TRALIs) [
 <xref rid="RSOB200174C79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. At the same time, HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B and C, and various other transfusion-mediated infections should also not be neglected [

 <xref rid="RSOB200174C82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. In the case of developing and populous countries like India, if the disease spreads at a rapid rate and the infected persons exceed the recovered patients, there could be a shortage of available plasma for CP therapy. Besides, another potential challenge to this therapy could be the availability of plasma for the rare blood group-type patients [
