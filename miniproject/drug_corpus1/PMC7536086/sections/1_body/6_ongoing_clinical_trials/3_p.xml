<p>Moreover, a report titled ‘Convalescent Plasma Trial in COVID -19 Patients' (clinical trial no. NCT04356534) is also a randomized trial with an objective to compare plasma therapy using CP with an antibody against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients with pneumonia and hypoxia and to find out whether there is any improvement in the clinical course. Another study called ‘Efficacy of Convalescent Plasma Therapy in Severely Sick COVID-19 Patients’ (clinical trial no. NCT04346446) is a randomized controlled trial, which focuses on assessing the efficacy of CP in COVID-19 patients. It aims to collect 500 ml CP from COVID-19-infected recuperated patients after 14 days of radiological and clinical recovery, with two subsequent negative PCR tests of COVID-19. It further aims to analyse the plasma sample for COVID-19-specific antibodies and their titres. Additionally, a study titled ‘Convalescent Plasma for Treatment of COVID-19: An Exploratory Dose Identifying Study’ (clinical trial no. NCT04384497) aims to treat a high-risk population that has viraemia before they develop any pulmonary infection/injury and start relying on supplementary oxygen therapy.</p>
