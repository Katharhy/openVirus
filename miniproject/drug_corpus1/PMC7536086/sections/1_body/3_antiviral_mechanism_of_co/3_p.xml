<p>After SARS-CoV infection, IgG antibodies are produced in response to the nucleoprotein of the virus, which is generally detected on the seroconversion on the 14th day or on the 4th day after the beginning of disease [

A study conducted using biolayer interferometry binding and ELISA suggested that a CR3022, which is a SARS-CoV-specific antibody, binds with the RBD of S protein of SARS-CoV-2, without competing with the hACE2. The RBD of S protein of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV shows a high variation in the amino acid at their C-terminal region. However, such variations did not affect the capability to engage the hACE2 receptor but had a crucial impact on the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies [

Apart from the neutralizing antibodies in the plasma, other safeguarding antibodies like IgM, IgG and some non-neutralizing antibodies were found to interact with the virus by binding to it, which may contribute towards an enhanced recovery rate or may promote prophylaxis [
