<p>The basic principle involved in passive antibody therapy is that it is more worthwhile when used for prevention or prophylaxis rather than for the cure or treatment of the disease. When the antibodies are used for therapy, they need to be administered soon after the commencement of the symptoms so that their efficacy is maintained [

The reason for time-related variation in the efficiency of passive antibodies is yet to be discovered, but this could mean that the passive antibodies neutralize the initial inoculum, which is expected to be very much smaller than that of the prevailing disease [

The expected mechanism of action through which the passive antibody therapy would regulate protection in the case of SARS-CoV-2 involves the neutralization of the virus, though several other mechanisms may also be possible, including antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity or phagocytosis [
 <xref rid="RSOB200174C41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The potential antibody sources for SARS-CoV-2 are human convalescent sera from the individuals who have recuperated from COVID-19, and preparations made in certain animal hosts like genetically engineered cows producing human antibodies or mAbs (monoclonal antibodies) [
