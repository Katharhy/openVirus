  <p>Replication of Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‐COV‐2) in a competent cell. The envelope spoke glycoprotein of SARS‐CoV‐2 binds its cellular receptor angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). After membrane fusion, the viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm. The RNA is uncoated to tlans‐locate into endoplasmic reticulum. The viral genome is then replicated by RNA dependent RNA polymerase. Remdesivir and Fabipiravor inhibit this process. Viral proteins are independently synthesized from RNA genome and assembled in cytoplasm, Virions are then released. Ritonavir+Lopinavir, proteinase inhibitors act this stage.</p>
