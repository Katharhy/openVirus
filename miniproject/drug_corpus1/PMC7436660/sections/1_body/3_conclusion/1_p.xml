 </xref> The COVID‐19 pandemic is the first pandemic in 100 years, since the Spanish influenza pandemic of 1918. However, in the last 100 years, we have developed new weapons against infection based on microbiology, immunology and molecular biology. With these weapons, we can fight new enemies in the clinical arenas of obstetrics and infectious disease control with a speed and precision that are incomparable to those of the early 20th century. We believe that victory can be achieved by using human wisdom and abandoning conspiracy theories, such as biological weapons and the economic, ideological and religious positions of each country, to fight the true enemy.
