<p>Early reports from China have shown two major SARS‐CoV‐2 genome types (L and S).

 </xref> Although the S type has been suggested to be the ancestral type, the most prevalent type in Wuhan was the L type. The evolutionarily older but less aggressive S types have relatively weak selection pressures, so their numbers have been decreased.

 </xref> On the other hand, the S type spread to other cities in China as well as Japan during the urban blockade of Wuhan. However, after global spread, both the S and L types were detected in Japan. Phylogenetic analyses are being performed to obtain real‐time information on molecular epidemiology. On Apr 18, a molecular epidemiological report was published from Iceland, where viral subtypes could be determined in every patient. Based on this article, each country has a slightly different type of virus that is prevalent. East Asia has mainly the A and B types, the west coast of the United States has B1a types, Europe has mostly A2a types, and Iceland seems to have additional types, such as A2a3a, which branched off from Europe (all of these types appear to have originated in China). These data suggest that certain viral variants tend to favor certain ethnicities (i.e., viruses with certain variants are more prevalent in certain ethnicities).
