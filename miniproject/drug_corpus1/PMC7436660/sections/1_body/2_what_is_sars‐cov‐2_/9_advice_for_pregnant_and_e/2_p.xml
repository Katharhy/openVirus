<p>If patients suspect that they have COVID‚Äê19 and wish to be examined, they should first consult the Consultation Center for Returnees and Contact Persons to prevent the spread of infection. They are not recommended to visit medical institutions except for emergencies because infection among patients in some institutions could trigger local outbreaks. The best way to protect them is to ensure satisfactory communication with their primary care physicians by telephone or email for online treatment, prescriptions and appropriate advice. We have published guidelines for pregnant women on the website of the Japanese Society of Infectious Diseases in Obstetrics and Gynecology.
