<p>Both obstetricians and general practitioners as well as health care professionals are requested to advise pregnant women on how to avoid SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and that if they do become infected, these women need not be afraid because we have a general understanding of the emerging infection and disease. First, pneumonia might be more severe in pregnant women, regardless of COVID‐19, because the enlarged uterus lifts the diaphragm and compresses the lungs, inhibiting ventilation and making the lungs more prone to congestion. Thus, pregnant women need to avoid any chance of infection as much as possible. To prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, they are recommended to not leave their house unnecessarily, avoid crowds and wash their hands frequently. They can consult with their employer regarding the type of work they perform and their work environment. Although it is desirable to wear a mask when going out to prevent droplet infection, the WHO does not regard wearing a mask as being effective against preventing droplet infection in healthy people but a mask is effective only in preventing people with symptoms from spreading droplets around them. As the virus is excreted in the feces, women must be sure to wash their hands with soap after toilet use and before eating. Frequent hand washing and disinfection with alcohol after touching a touch panel, such as an ATM, in a public place or after touching a train strap or handrail is recommended.</p>
