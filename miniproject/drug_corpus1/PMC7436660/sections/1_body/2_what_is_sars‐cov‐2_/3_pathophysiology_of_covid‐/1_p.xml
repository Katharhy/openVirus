<p>SARS‐CoV‐2 enters susceptible host cells via the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE)2 protein as its receptor. ACE2 is abundantly expressed in the type II alveolar epithelium of the lower respiratory tract but is also expressed in the upper respiratory tract, pharynx and gastrointestinal tract, especially the small intestine.

 </xref> Viruses reach mucous membranes through droplets or via fingers that touch the surfaces of contaminated objects and infect susceptible cells. An ACE2‐independent pathway of infection via dipipetidyl peptidase 4(DPP4) and or glucose‐regulated protein 78(GPR78) also may exists in various cells including lymphocytes, which induces transient immunodeficiency; however, the details of this process are unknown.
