 </xref> The importance of the proper definition of vertical transmission is critical for understanding the risks associated with fetal development and maternal mortality. Although a few studies have shown the presence of the virus at the placenta, these findings cannot be considered as vertical transmission. We define vertical transmission when the virus is able to reach fetal organs and they can be detected in fetal organs. Presence of the virus at the placenta cannot be considered as vertical transmission. The function of the placenta as an immunological barrier includes the fact that can be infected but prevents the crossing of the virus from the maternal side into the fetal side.
