<p>Two major concerns of pregnant individuals with COVID‐19 are their prognoses and the possibility of vertical transmission and subsequent miscarriage, malformations, fetal growth restriction and/or stillbirth. The worldwide common misunderstanding is that “pregnancy is an immunosuppressed condition, and pregnant subjects become susceptible to infectious disorders”. This is not true because pregnant subjects reject allograft transplants and produce an effective immune response against infectious pathogens. As reported by our group,

 </xref> and others, in contrast to organ transplantation, which requires constant immunosuppression, a successful pregnancy requires a robust, dynamic and responsive immune system. In general, pregnant mothers become tolerant to fetoplacental semi‐allografts but maintain an adequate immune response to pathogens. Enhanced induction of interferon (IFN)‐β is crucial to protecting the fetus against viral infections at the maternal–fetal interface; thus, placental viral infections might threaten fetal survival even if they do not enter fetal tissues. One immunological concern is the suppressive activity of SARS‐CoV‐2 on IFN responses for its escape from the immune system.

 </xref> The first case report from Wuhan described nine cases of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID‐19 in late pregnancy.
 <xref rid="jog14384-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">
  <sup>21</sup>
 </xref> Their clinical courses and disease severities were not different from those of nonpregnant women, and no cases of intrauterine infection of their fetuses were observed. In another report from Wuhan, of 13 pregnant women who developed COVID‐19 during pregnancy, one woman delivered a dead fetus at 34 weeks of gestation, but the cause of fetal death was speculated to be severe maternal pneumonia and multiple organ failure rather than viral infection of the fetus.
 <xref rid="jog14384-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">
  <sup>22</sup>
 </xref> Another report showed that 3 of 33 pregnant women who developed COVID‐19 during pregnancy in Wuhan showed evidence of intrauterine infection by cord blood PCR test.

  <sup>23</sup>
 </xref> Two of three suspected intrauterine infections were asymptomatic, but one neonate who was delivered at 31 weeks of gestation by emergency cesarean section due to maternal pneumonia had complications including severe pneumonia and sepsis, though the neonate was ultimately rescued.

 </xref> Another report from Wuhan showed a relatively high incidence of intrauterine infection of up to 33% (two of six cases of late cesarean section) by cord blood IgM test.
 <xref rid="jog14384-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">
  <sup>24</sup>
 </xref> On the other hand, no cases of intrauterine infection were observed from 106 deliveries at 25 hospitals in various cities in China from January to March, although 8% of 116 cases had serious pneumonia.
 <xref rid="jog14384-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">

 </xref> In every case, the mothers and neonates survived without serious sequelae. Only one woman had early spontaneous miscarriage, but no causal relationship was identified.

 </xref> This discrepancy might reflect the difficulty of serum IgG and IgM testing because most studies employed less sensitive immunoblot detection systems. A systematic review by Zaigham
 <xref rid="jog14384-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">
  <sup>26</sup>
 </xref> evaluated the risk of serious maternal outcomes in 2.4% (3 of 108 cases) and 1.8% of neonates (one neonatal death and one intrauterine fetal death). Although the total death rate in Italy is higher than that in China, the prognoses of pregnant women in Italy are almost comparable to those in China.

Seven of the 42 pregnant patients became seriously ill and were admitted to the ICU, and all recovered quickly. No fetal or neonatal death was observed. However, a case report from Texas presented severe neonatal pneumonia caused by intrauterine COVID‐19 infection,

 </xref> The death rates can be influenced by local factors, including medical accessibility, economic and political conditions and social hygiene. We need to collect and analyze possible risk factors for maternal and neonatal outcomes to reduce the mortality rates of both mothers and infants.
