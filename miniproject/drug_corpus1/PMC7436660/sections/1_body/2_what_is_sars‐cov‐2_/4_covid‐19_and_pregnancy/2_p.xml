<p>The experience in the US has been more complex; the initial cases followed similar prognosis as those reported in Wuhan; unfortunately the US has been experienced a significant higher number of cases, including pregnant women. The most recent report from 12 US institutions evaluated 64 pregnant women hospitalized with COVID‐19, 69% had severe and 31% critical disease. Some of these patients had pre‐existing comorbidities including 25% with pulmonary condition and cardiac disease. Gestational age at symptom onset was at a mean of 29 weeks and hospital admission at 30 weeks. Eighty eight percent of pregnant women with critical COVID‐19 who delivered during their disease course were delivered preterm, 94% of them via cesarean. In all 75% of critically ill woman delivered preterm. There were no reports of still births or neonatal deaths or cases of vertical transmission.
