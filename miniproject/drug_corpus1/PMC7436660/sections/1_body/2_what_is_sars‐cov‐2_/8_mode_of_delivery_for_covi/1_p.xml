<p>Based on initial reports from China, every term or premature case with COVID‐19 with acute distress and/or severe maternal conditions was delivered by cesarean section. However, in an Italian study, among 42 deliveries, 24 (57%) women delivered vaginally, with three cases undergoing induction of labor for obstetric reasons, while elective cesarean section was performed in 18 (43%) cases: in 8 cases, the indication was unrelated to COVID‐19 infection, but in 10 cases, the indications were worsening dyspnea or other COVID‐19‐related symptoms.

 </xref> A systematic review showed that overall, 90.1% of deliveries were cesarean sections. It is reasonable to choose cesarean section to reduce the opportunity for viral transmission from pregnant subjects with COVID‐19 to other patients and medical staff, but vaginal delivery must be chosen if the woman is multiparous and the uterine cervix has been fully open to complete the delivery sooner. Guidelines from various countries are controversial in terms of the choice of delivery mode. This is because it depends on the availability of medical assets as well as human resources.
