<p>The unique governmental policy in Japan has been effective in preventing explosive infection. As of May 17, there was no urban lockdown, only relatively moderate furlough control, cluster control and PCR testing that is limited to those who need it; however, the numbers of new patients and COVID‐19 deaths remain among the lowest in the world. Some argue that PCR‐based testing should be performed on the entire population, even if they are asymptomatic, but the financial cost, low positivity rate and limited medical resources and manpower make this approach impractical. The epidemic in Guangdong, far from Wuhan, occurred when the virus was imported from outside the city and was largely controlled by traffic blocks. Overall, out of approximately 1.6 million people tested by PCR, only 1300 were infected, or less than one in 1000 people in Guangdong. Thus, contact restrictions rather than increasing PCR‐based testing is more effective in preventing the spread of infection.
