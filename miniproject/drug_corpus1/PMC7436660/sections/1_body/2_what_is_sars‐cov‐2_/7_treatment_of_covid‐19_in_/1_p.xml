 <xref rid="jog14384-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>. A cocktail of protease inhibitors (Kaletra [lopinavir/ritonavir]) was tested in the first clinical trials in China. Lopinavir and ritonavir were originally used against HIV‐1 and are effective. Based on their efficacy against MERS in vitro and in animal models, they have been expected to be effective against COVID‐19; however, they were not effective against COVID‐19 in 199 patients with severe disease in China. A randomized trial showed no significant difference in either clinical improvement or 28‐day mortality.
