<p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) possess an enveloped, single, positive‐stranded RNA genome, which encodes four membrane proteins, namely, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins 3–5. S proteins are essential for viral entry into host cells and determine viral pathogenicity.

 </xref> In addition to the four types of coronaviruses that cause the common cold, two other types of coronaviruses were reported in the 21st century: SARS‐CoV, the pathogen underlying the SARS epidemic in 2003, and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS)‐CoV, the pathogen underlying the MERS epidemic in 2012. SARS‐CoV‐2 has higher genetic homology with SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV than with the other four coronaviruses and has conserved sequences responsible for immunomodulation. To date, numerous coronaviruses have been identified in various wild and domestic animals. However, humans are not susceptible to these coronaviruses. From genetic analysis, SARS‐CoV‐2 developed zoonotic infectivity in animals such as bats and curlews toward human‐to‐human infection in a short period of time. This fact completely matches the theoretical prediction of most emerging human infections derived from zoonotic ones.
