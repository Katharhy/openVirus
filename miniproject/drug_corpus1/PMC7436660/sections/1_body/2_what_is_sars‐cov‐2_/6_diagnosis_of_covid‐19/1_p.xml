<p>Currently, there are four methods used to diagnose COVID‐19: (i) Detection of viral RNA, (ii) Detection of specific antibodies in the blood, and (iii) Detection of ground‐glass opacities in the lungs by CT scanning, (iv) Detection of viral antigens. To detect viral nucleic acids, real‐time PCR or loop‐mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) are the most common and sensitive methods for clinical specimens, but both methods are time‐consuming, require extensive effort and have a high false‐negative rate. Blood antibodies are not currently recommended due to reliability issues, such as the fact that it takes more than 1 week for antibody conversion even after infection; additionally, IgM antibodies are not detected in the early stages.

 </xref> The sensitivity and specificity of CT are good, but CT is not recommended for pregnant women due to radiation exposure; furthermore, CT cannot distinguish COVID‐19 from other viral pneumonias. Very recently, detection of viral antigens by the Immunoblot with saliva have been reported as a novel method. However, its sensitivity is still low compared to PCR and needs to be improved to make it as a routine examination.
