<p>Later, the WHO decided to name the emerging viral disease COVID‐19, and the name of the virus was designated Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) by the International Virus Naming Committee due to its high homology with SARS‐CoV. It spread from China to the whole world, and the WHO declared a pandemic on March 11. On April 8, the government of Japan declared a state of emergency for seven prefectures (Tokyo, Saitama, Chiba, Kanagawa, Osaka, Hyogo and Fukuoka), and the state of emergency was expanded throughout Japan on April 16. In a very short period of time, COVID‐19 had spread throughout the world, and as of May 16, a total of 4 660 611 patients and 309 710 deaths have been confirmed in 215 countries, areas or territories.

 </xref> The number of new cases has already declined in China, where the epidemic first began. In regions of the Middle East and Europe, including Iran, Italy, Spain and France, where it had subsequently spread, the number of cases is also on the decline. Although the U.S. and UK are past their peaks on the infection curve, a large number of cases are still being reported.

 </xref> Furthermore, although the disease spread to Japan early in the pandemic, the number of patients and deaths is still low.

 </xref> Thus, it is unique and puzzling that no spike in the infection rate took place in Japan, even though the country did not implement strict urban blockades. To date, no one can adequately explain why the infection and mortality rates are low in Japan.
