<p>Beyond day-to-day OUD treatment, COVID-19 threatens to grind essential clinical research to a halt unless proactive steps are taken. During the past 2 years, Congress authorized approximately $1 billion in the HEAL (Helping to End Addiction Long-term) initiative. Much of this work is just starting. In 2019, HEAL funded approximately 375 projects in 41 states, including 4 states as part of the HEALing Communities Study testing a “community-engaged intervention designed to increase the adoption of an integrated set of evidence-based practices delivered across health care, behavioral health, justice, and other community-based settings” (

At a minimum, the federal government will need to devise a mechanism to provide ongoing funding for all persons supported to conduct laboratory and clinical research, including those working on opioid-related projects, while projects' safety and scientific validity are considered.
