<p>We recommend several additional steps to ensure access to buprenorphine in preparation for shifts in prescribers' work duties or sick leave due to COVID-19 and potential treatment disruptions as patients move in and out of hospitals. The federal government should temporarily remove limits on the number of patients an individual prescriber may treat concurrently. At present, clinicians are limited in the number of patients for whom they can treat concurrently in their first year. For the near future, these limits should be removed. In addition, we recommend that federal, state, and local governments be funded to form and support networks of experienced buprenorphine prescribers to address the needs of local patients and providers. For instance, the mentors from the federally funded Prescriber Clinical Support System, and those identified through primary care, addiction medicine, and addiction psychiatry societies, could be rapidly expanded and authorized to temporarily support clinicians and potentially prescribe for patients in their region if usual prescribers are unavailable. As more patients with OUD are admitted to hospitals, these networks would be available to provide remote consultative services to help reduce length of stay. To help reduce emergency department and hospital crowding, federal training requirements for buprenorphine should be eliminated to allow emergency medicine and hospitalist clinicians without waivers to write buprenorphine prescriptions at discharge to provide enough medication for patients to become engaged in outpatient treatment. Federal and state agencies should ensure that skilled nursing facilities do not refuse patients receiving methadone or buprenorphine.</p>
