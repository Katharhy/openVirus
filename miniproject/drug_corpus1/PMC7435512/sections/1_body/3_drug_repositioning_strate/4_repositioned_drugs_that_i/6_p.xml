<p>Finally, oseltamivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor that prevents influenza viral particle release, is also investigated.

 </xref> Like for ritonavir/lopinavir, there is no molecular basis to support these trials because to the best of our knowledge, CoVs (unlike influenza viruses) do not rely on neuraminidases during their life cycle. If antiviral effect are observed, the off‚Äêtarget mechanisms will have to be elucidated.
