<p>The fastest option for the treatment of Covid‐19 is the identification of already approved drugs that were developed for other diseases, but that show inhibitory activity against SARS‐CoV‐2 in infected cells. The main advantages of this strategy are that these drugs are available on the market, and their safety and toxicity profiles are already documented. However, their MoA against the virus is often speculative, and the efficacy and clinical doses required for treatment in patients with Covid‐19 are unknown, due to the absence of large‐scale clinical studies. Moreover, it is important to consider the risk of overdose and of unexpected increase of viral load or symptoms. Several teams have already set up platforms to screen FDA‐approved libraries using SARS‐CoV‐2 infected cells.

 </xref> Although the chemical libraries and experimental conditions used in these studies are quite different, a comparative analysis of their results reveals that some compounds, such as chloroquine derivatives, have been identified in different experimental conditions. Moreover, several groups reported the antiviral activity of FDA‐approved compounds, and some of them are already tested in clinical trials.

 </xref> In this review, we cannot discuss all drugs identified by this strategy. Therefore, we selected the key compounds that are already in clinical trials and the most interesting classes of compounds, based on their potential MoA on CoV life cycle inferred from their known activity.
