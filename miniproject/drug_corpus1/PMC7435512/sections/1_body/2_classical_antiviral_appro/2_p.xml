 </xref> To limit virus proliferation in the early disease stages and reduce its severity, one important strategy is to develop treatments based on existing antiviral compounds. Following the rapid emergence and spread of SARS‐CoV in 2003 and MERS‐CoV in 2012, important efforts were made to identify drugs that target specific steps of the coronavirus life cycle (Figure 
 <xref rid="rmv2143-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) including (a) the interaction with ACE2 receptors, (b) enzymes that catalyze S protein cleavage, (c) viral entry, (d) polyprotein processing, and (e) replication/transcription complex. These compounds have been rapidly screened in SARS‐COV‐2‐infected cells, and many of them are now assessed in small animal models and/or clinical trials.
