<p>The cytidine analog β‐d‐
 <italic>N</italic>4‐hydroxycytidine (NHC) also is a potential anti‐CoV compound. NHC inhibits MERS‐CoV, SARS‐CoV, and SARS‐CoV‐2 replication in vitro in the micromolar range (0.09‐0.3 μM), without apparent interference from the viral proofreading activity of nsp14.

 </xref> In infected cells, decreased viral replication was associated with increased mutation frequency, supporting a mechanism of lethal mutagenesis. Moreover, the orally bioavailable β‐D‐N4‐hydroxycytidine‐5′‐isopropyl ester improved pulmonary function and reduced virus titer and body weight loss in mice infected with SARS‐ and MERS‐CoV. These promising results suggest that NHC molecules might be considered for Covid‐19 treatment,
