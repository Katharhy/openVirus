<p>Historically, the most attractive antiviral compounds are those that block virus replication by inhibiting RdRp activity. Nucleotide and nucleoside analogs are among the most promising groups of RdRp inhibitors. Their antiviral effect can be attributed to three nonmutually exclusive mechanisms. First, incorporation of nucleotide analogs (NAs) in the viral RNA by the error‐prone polymerase can induce early chain termination in an obligate (immediate) or nonobligate fashion, resulting in incomplete, noninfectious viral RNA. The second mechanism, named error catastrophe, is associated with the insertion and extension of NAs throughout the viral RNA that result in many errors during RNA synthesis.

 </xref> Third, several NAs deplete the cytoplasmic levels of their equivalent native nucleotides, causing nucleotide pool imbalances that affect RdRp fidelity.

 </xref> While nucleoside analogs have been successfully used for the treatment of other viral diseases, the situation is complicated in CoVs due to the presence of a viral exonuclease (nsp14 ExoN) with proof‐reading activity that can reduce NA antiviral effect.

 </xref> Indeed, in vitro studies show that SARS‐CoV polymerase can incorporate ribavirin triphosphate during replication, but this purine NA is detected by nsp14 ExoN and eliminated by the repair mechanism.

The first results of these compassionate‐use studies showed clinical improvement in 68% of patients treated with remdesivir in a small cohort (n = 53). Notably however, these studies were not randomized and furthermore did not report the change in viral load following treatment.
