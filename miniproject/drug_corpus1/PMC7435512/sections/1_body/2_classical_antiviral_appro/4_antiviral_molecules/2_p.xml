<p>Although SARS‐CoV‐2 has spread very recently, several antiviral compounds previously tested against other pathogenic CoVs have been already tried patients with Covid‐19 (Table 
 <xref rid="rmv2143-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The first strategy is to interfere with virus entry using molecules that block virus‐cell fusion. This includes umifenovir (Arbidol), an antiviral molecule initially developed for the treatment of influenza infection.

 </xref> Although not yet approved by the FDA, this broad‐spectrum antiviral molecule is used in China and Russia for influenza treatment, and therefore was rapidly included in several clinical trials alone or in combination with other compounds. The first comparative study performed in a small group of patients showed a significant decrease of the viral load in the arm treated with umifenovir in combination with the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir (n = 16) compared with the arm treated with lopinavir/ritonavir alone (n = 17).

 </xref> Nevertheless, one of the limitations of this study is the small‐sample size and investigation including large cohort need to be performed.
