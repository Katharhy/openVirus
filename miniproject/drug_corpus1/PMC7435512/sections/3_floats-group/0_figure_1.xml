  <p>SARS‐CoV‐2 life cycle and potential mechanisms of action of currently evaluated therapeutics. SARS‐CoV‐2 life cycle and the presumed mechanisms of action (MoA) of the main SARS‐CoV‐2 replication inhibitors. Different compounds are assessed to find compounds targeting the different steps of SARS‐CoV‐2 life cycle. Molecules currently in clinical trials are indicated by a gray star. Therapeutic strategies based on antiviral compounds are indicated in red, and approved drugs used for other diseases or selected by virtual screening are indicated in yellow. The black question marks indicate unknown or elusive MoA in the context of CoV infection. *Corresponding to antibody (Ab) strategies including monoclonal antibodies and plasma from convalescent patient. The Biorender website was used to generate this figure</p>
