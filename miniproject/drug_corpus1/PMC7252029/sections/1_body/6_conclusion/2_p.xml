<p id="para0041">In the absence of FDA- and European Medicines Agency–approved treatments for COVID-19, management currently relies on supportive care. Ongoing reports of clinical and laboratory features of COVID-19 show significant overlap with hyperinflammatory conditions such as CRS, sHLH and IRIS. Early recognition and treatment of hosts who display the hallmarks of CRS, sHLH and SIRS is of utmost importance to reduce morbidity and mortality. A number of therapeutics approved for other indications as well as investigational agents are currently being evaluated in several hundred clinical trials globally. Experiences derived from therapeutics employed for the treatment of complications secondary to immunotherapies, such as CAR-T, bispecific monoclonal antibodies and HCT, may provide a safe framework for the classification and early intervention of patients who are at the highest risk of dying from COVID-19–related complications. Despite the urgency of the pandemic, extreme caution must be exercised to avoid the use of unproven therapeutics based on limited data from poorly conducted clinical trials and/or observational data [
