<p id="para0005">Early clinical reports of malaise, high fever, chills, anosmia, dysgeusia and hypoxia combined with biochemical markers associated with inflammation and hypercoagulable state seem to be prevalent. Laboratory anomalies such as lymphopenia, high ferritin, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, interleukin (IL)-6, high C-reactive protein and soluble CD25 suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may trigger cytokine storm syndrome. This hyper-reactive cytokine release may represent one of the most important negative prognostic factors in patients infected with COVID-19. Interestingly, these responses resemble inflammatory conditions not infrequently seen after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) and cellular therapies: cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), and secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH).</p>
