<p id="para0027">Currently, there are no approved immunizations for COVID-19. A National Institutes of Healthâ€“sponsored phase 1 study is currently evaluating the experimental vaccine mRNA-1273 (Moderna, Inc., Cambridge, Ma, USA) in healthy subjects aged 18 to 55 years. This is a novel lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated mRNA vaccine that encodes for a prefusion stabilized form of the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a 2-dose vaccination schedule of mRNA-1273, given 28 days apart, across three dosages (three different doses being tested, each given twice. E.g. (hypothetically) 50 mg on day 0, 50 mg on day 5; 100 mg on day 0, 100 mg on day 5; 500 mg on day 0, 500 mg on day 5) (
