 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref> have been tested in patients, with a strong safety profile and many demonstrating promising clinical responses worthy of further clinical evaluation 
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. To broaden access to these cell therapies, several investigators and companies have extended this technology to off-the-shelf allogeneic T cells, where the patient and product are partially human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched. This could present an appealing opportunity for SARS-CoV2-specific T cells. A bank of SARS-CoV2â€“specific T cells could be created from a diverse range of donors covering diverse HLA alleles, and a personalized product would be selected for each patient based on the degree of HLA match 
 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. This would allow for rapid shipment and treatment of patients, albeit in hospitals with existing cell therapy expertise and resources.
