<p id="para0032">Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes that recognize targets via the absence of ligands such as HLA and a complex array of activating and inhibitory receptors. Unlike T cells, NK cells do not rely on peptides presented in the presence of HLA, which makes NK cells an ideal cell therapy for allogeneic, off-the-shelf use. A role for NK cells in the prevention of relapse after HCT has been postulated previously, and recently, CAR NK cells have shown promise in a study of patients with CD19-positive nonâ€“Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Recently, the FDA granted investigators from the biotechnology company Celularity clearance to test whether cryopreserved, allogeneic NK cells derived from placental hematopoietic stem cells are capable of lysing virus-infected cells and control the resulting immune response. However, aside from clinical data of the NK cell product CYNK-001, there is limited public information about the efficacy of CYNK-001 or other NK cells against COVID-19
