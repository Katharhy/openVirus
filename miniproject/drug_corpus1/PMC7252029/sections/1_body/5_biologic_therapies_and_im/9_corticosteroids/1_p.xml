<p id="para0034">Evidence in patients with SARS and MERS suggests that administration of corticosteroids did not influence mortality but rather delayed viral clearance 
 <xref rid="bib0042" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Moreover, current interim guidance from the World Health Organization on clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when novel coronavirus infection is suspected advises against the use of corticosteroids unless indicated for another reason

Lancet 2020) and may be worth trying for critically ill COVID-19 patients. Further well-designed clinical trials are urgently needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of steroid therapy in COVID-19.
