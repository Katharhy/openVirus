<p id="para0015">Tocilizumab is indicated for adult patients with autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2017 for severe, life-threatening, CAR-T-cell–induced CRS in adults and children. The optimal dose and schedule of tocilizumab for treatment of CAR-T-cell–induced CRS is not known, but dosing instructions in tocilizumab labeling provide general recommendations for safe dosing. The FDA-recommended dose of tocilizumab in CAR-T induced CRS is 8 mg/kg intravenously (12 mg/k for patients &lt;30 kg body weight) alone or in combination with corticosteroids.</p>
