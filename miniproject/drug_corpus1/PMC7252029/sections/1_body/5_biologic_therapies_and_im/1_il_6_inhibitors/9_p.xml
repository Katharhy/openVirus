<p id="para0021">Siltuximab (Sylvant
 <sup>TM</sup>) is a human murine chimeric monoclonal antibody that binds IL-6 directly, in contrast to tocilizumab that binds to the IL-6 receptor. Siltuximab has a higher affinity for IL-6 than tocilizumab has for the IL-6R making it an attractive consideration in managing CRS. There is some concern that circulating IL-6 levels increase after administration of tocilizumab, contributing to an increased incidence of neurotoxicity [

 <xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This does not seem to be a concern with siltuximab, which is the rationale for its proposed benefit in tocilizumab-refractory cases, although no data are currently available on its efficacy. Siltuximab has not been sufficiently studied as a treatment for CRS and its use remains investigational; therefore, it should be considered only as second line agent in cases of COVID-19.
