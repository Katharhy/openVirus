<p id="para0036">Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are drugs that interfere with digestive vacuole function within sensitive malarial parasites by increasing the pH and inhibiting lysosomal degradation of hemoglobin; inhibit locomotion of neutrophils and chemotaxis of eosinophils and; impair complement-dependent antigen-antibody reactions. Chloroquine has been used for malaria treatment and chemoprophylaxis and hydroxychloroquine is used for treatment of several autoimmune conditions including rheumatoid arthritis. Both drugs have
