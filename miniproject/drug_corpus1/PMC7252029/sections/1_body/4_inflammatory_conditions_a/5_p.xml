<p id="para0011">Multiple pathogens cause IRIS, which can manifest systemically or localize to the lung. The mechanisms involved in its immunopathogenesis are complex and not entirely understood 
 <xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The harmful effect of immune response to viral triggers on immunosuppressed patients who experience IRIS with immune recovery (followed by worsening various infections) has also been well described in the allogeneic HCT literature 
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Respiratory viruses have been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of alloimmune-mediated lung syndromes 
 <xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. It remains to be ascertained whether treatment of COVID-19 in susceptible immunocompromised hosts may trigger IRIS.
