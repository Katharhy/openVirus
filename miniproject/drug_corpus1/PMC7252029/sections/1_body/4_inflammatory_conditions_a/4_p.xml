<p id="para0010">Another condition in which antimicrobial treatment may trigger IRIS is Whipple's disease, a chronic infection due to 
 <italic>Tropheryma whipplei</italic> that develops in immunologically susceptible individuals 
 <xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Here, the initial reduction in CD4
 <sup>+</sup> cell counts and their reconstitution on treatment is more pronounced in those patients who developed IRIS than in those without IRIS 
 <xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Moreover, an imbalance between activated CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells and regulatory T cells seem to play a crucial role in triggering the cytokine storm. Notably, 
 <italic>T. whipplei</italic>â€“specific T-helper 1 reactivity remained suppressed before and after emergence of IRIS, thus indicating that flare-up of pathogen-specific immunoreactivity is not instrumental in the pathogenesis of IRIS. This implies that independent of the causal infectious agent, IRIS may possibly emerge in those carrying a specific immunological status and that the therapeutic approach may be the same. Therefore, efforts should be undertaken to identify the predisposing dysfunctional immune condition.
