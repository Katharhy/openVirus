<p>Finally, to make sure that our findings cannot be simply explained by a larger number of sequences in 
 <italic>Odessa</italic> dataset compared to 
 <italic>Kyiv</italic> dataset (
 <italic>n</italic> = 275 vs. 
 <italic>n</italic> = 92), we have rerun the BDSKY analysis with 92 randomly selected sequences from the 
 <italic>Odessa</italic> dataset. The mean estimates and 95% HPD obtained from this analysis did not substantially differ from the estimates obtained in the analysis of the full dataset (
