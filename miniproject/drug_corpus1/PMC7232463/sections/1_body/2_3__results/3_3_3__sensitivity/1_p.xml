<p>We performed several sensitivity analyses to explore the robustness of our estimates. First, we used a less strict definition of clusters for ClusterPicker analysis (bootstrap &gt;80%, using the same tree and number of bootstrap replicates as for the analysis with higher bootstrap cut-off value), but this resulted in only one additional cluster. Second, we removed 65 PTS sequences generated by network-based recruitment in TRIP from the 
 <italic>Odessa</italic> dataset, keeping the 65 NPTS sequences and 20 PTS sequences obtained from recently infected individuals at screening (thus, not obtained through network recruitment) in the analysis. This resulted in a dataset of 
 <italic>n</italic> = 210. The ML phylogenetic tree reconstructed from this dataset can be found in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00469">Figure S3</xref>. After the network-derived sequences were eliminated, only 4 phylogenetic clusters were left on the Odessa phylogenetic tree, which presented a more similar figure to that in Kyiv, where no transmission clusters were identified. We then reran the BDSKY analysis with this dataset to make sure that no bias was introduced by these potentially-correlated samples (
