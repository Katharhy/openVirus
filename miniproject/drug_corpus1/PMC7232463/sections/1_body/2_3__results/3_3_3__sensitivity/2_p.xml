  <sub>e</sub>
 </italic> estimates in Odessa since the initiation of TRIP in 2013 remained substantially lower than the corresponding estimates for Kyiv, though the difference between the two estimates was no longer significant in 2016–2019. For the becoming uninfectious rate in this analysis, the estimate was the same for the duration of TRIP as when the full dataset was analysed. For the years after the intervention (2016–2019), the becoming uninfectious rate was lower, at 0.4, corresponding to an average infectious period of 2.4 years for Odessa, which was only a little higher than our estimates in Kyiv of 0.33, corresponding to an average infectious period of 3 years.
