<p>Based on the ML phylogenetic tree reconstructed from the 
 <italic>Odessa</italic> dataset (See 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00469">Figure S1</xref>), we identified 12 probable transmission clusters: 10 pairs and 2 clusters of three sequences. These clusters also had high posterior probability (&gt;0.9) support on the maximum clade credibility tree reconstructed in the BSP analysis (
