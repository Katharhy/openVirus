<p>Clusters 1 and 10 consisted of sequences isolated from AIDS Centre patients, thus no additional information was available for these sequences (e.g., age and HCV status). The sequences in the remaining ten clusters came from TRIP. The individuals from whom these sequences were obtained were younger on average than their unclustered counterparts (t-test 
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.05, H
 <sub>0</sub> = both groups have the same average age) and had approximately twice their viral load (

 <sub>0</sub> = both groups have the same average viral load) (
