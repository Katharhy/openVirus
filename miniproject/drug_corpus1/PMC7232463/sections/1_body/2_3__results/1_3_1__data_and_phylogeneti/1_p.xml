<p>Between 2013–2016, 1252 participants were screened for recent HIV infection as part of the TRIP project in Odessa, Ukraine. For 67 non-recently infected participants screened at TRIP an HIV sequence was generated (NPTS sequences). Forty individuals were identified as recently infected according to the TRIP definition of “recency” [
