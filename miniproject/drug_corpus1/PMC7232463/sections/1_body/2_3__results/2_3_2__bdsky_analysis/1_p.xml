<p>The BDSKY analysis of the 
 <italic>Odessa</italic> dataset showed that from the beginning of the epidemic and until early 2016 the 
 <italic>R
  <sub>e</sub>
 </italic> in Odessa remained consistently above 1 with the exception of 2001–2002 when it dropped to 
 <italic>R
  <sub>e</sub>
 </italic> = 0.27 (95% Highest Posterior Density (HPD) 0.04–0.52, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00469-f003">Figure 3</xref>). With the exception of 2001–2002, there was little difference in 
 <italic>R
  <sub>e</sub>
 </italic> in Odessa and Kyiv before the TRIP intervention: in 2011–2012 the 
 <italic>R
  <sub>e</sub>
 </italic> was estimated to be 1.19 (95% HPD 0.03–3.07) in Odessa and 1.66 (95% HPD 0.04–4.7) in Kyiv (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00469-f003">Figure 3</xref>). In 2013–early 2016, during the implementation of TRIP 
 <italic>R
  <sub>e</sub>
 </italic> was estimated to be 1.66 (95% HPD 1.19–2.2) in Odessa and 
 <italic>R
  <sub>e</sub>
 </italic> = 3.7 (95% HPD 1.32–7.5) in Kyiv. After TRIP, in 2016–2019, it declined to below the epidemiological threshold of 1 necessary to maintain growth of the epidemic in Odessa (
 <italic>R
  <sub>e</sub>
 </italic> =0.4, 95% HPD 0.06–0.75). During the same time 
 <italic>R
  <sub>e</sub>
 </italic> has likely remained high in Kyiv, estimated to be 2.32 (95% HPD 0.2–5.4).
