<p>The becoming-uninfectious rate for Odessa grew between the mid-1980s and 2000 from 0.7 before 1994 (corresponding to an infectious period of 1.4 years) to 2.65 in 2001–2002 (corresponding to infectious period of 5 months (

This rate then dropped substantially to 0.2 in 2003–2004 (corresponding to an infectious period of 5 years) and remained low until the beginning of the TRIP project in 2013. In 2013–early 2016 the becoming-uninfectious rate was estimated to be 0.72 (corresponding to an average infectious period of 1.4 years) and it continued to grow after the end of TRIP to be 0.94 (corresponding to an average infectious period of 1.1 years) in 2016–2019. Analysis of the 
 <italic>Kyiv</italic> dataset revealed that the becoming-uninfectious rate has gradually decreased over time, from 0.97 (corresponding to an average infectious period of 1 year) before 1994 to 0.33 (an average infectious period of 3 years) in 2016–2019 (
