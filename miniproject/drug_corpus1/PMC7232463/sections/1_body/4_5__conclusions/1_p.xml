<p>The use of HIV genetic sequences allowed us to investigate the impact that an intervention might have had on a specific community and epidemic dynamics, during and after the years it was implemented. While there might have been other factors that have contributed to the reduction in

Importantly, molecular epidemiology methods are a useful tool when investigating the effect of certain prevention strategies and should be widely applied in public health settings.
