<p>Our data set comprises HIV-1 subtype A 
 <italic>pol</italic> genetic sequences (corresponding to HXB2 positions 2568–3256) compiled from three sources: (i) the TRIP intervention, (ii) AIDS Centres in Odessa and Kyiv and (iii) the Los Alamos National Laboratory HIV sequence database, LANL (
 <uri xlink:href="https://www.hiv.lanl.gov" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.hiv.lanl.gov</uri>). This includes 161 newly generated sequences from the TRIP intervention conducted in Odessa in 2013–2016. In TRIP, people were screened for HIV and, if positive, further tested to determine whether the infection was recent (defined by a Limiting Antigen avidity test or by a negative HIV test result within the previous 6 months). Those with recent HIV infection were invited to participate in TRIP and were given coupons to invite their sexual and injecting partners into the intervention. Coupons were also given to their partners, but then the recruitment stopped unless another recently HIV infected person was found in their network. Thus, within the TRIP data, we differentiated between samples that (a) came from people screened for recent infection who were not recently infected, and thus were not invited to further participate in the network intervention component of TRIP (Non-participant TRIP samples, NPTS) and samples which (b) came from TRIP participants—either recently infected people or their 1st or 2nd degree network contacts (participant TRIP samples, PTS). Further details on the TRIP data collection and genetic sequencing procedures can be found in the original publications [

 <xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00469" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We obtained 197 sequences of the subtype A 
 <italic>pol</italic> gene (84 newly generated) from patients of AIDS Centres (HIV treatment clinics) in Odessa (
 <italic>n</italic> = 105) and Kyiv (
 <italic>n</italic> = 84) collected in 2012–2019. These samples were sequenced at the L.V.Gromashevskij Institute of Epidemiology and Infectious Diseases in Kyiv using ViroSeq
 <sup>®</sup> HIV-1 Genotyping System v2.0 Kit (Celera Corporation, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA) [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00469" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Finally, we downloaded from the LANL database all publicly available HIV-1 subtype A 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences that (i) corresponded to the same genomic region, (ii) were sampled from Odessa (
 <italic>n</italic> = 25) and Kyiv (
 <italic>n</italic> = 12) and had available sampling year and city information. See the 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00469">Table S1</xref> for accession numbers of the sequences used in the analysis. Accession numbers for TRIP sequences are MT348782–MT348931.
