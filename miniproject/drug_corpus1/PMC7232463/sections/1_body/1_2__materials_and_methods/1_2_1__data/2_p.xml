<p>We further grouped the sequences into the following datasets: 
 <italic>Odessa</italic> and 
 <italic>Kyiv</italic> datasets comprised sequences from Odessa and Kyiv from LANL and AIDS Centres; sequences from TRIP were added to the 
 <italic>Odessa</italic> dataset. Duplicates in both datasets were removed using the ElimDupes tool from the LANL website (
 <uri xlink:href="https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/</uri>). Additionally, most PTS sequences had information about the participantâ€™s transmission risk group, HIV viral load, HIV recency status (as defined by the TRIP intervention protocol) and information on co-infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and syphilis (co-infections determined by a rapid multi-test).
