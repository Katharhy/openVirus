<p>We used the REGAv3 [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00469" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and COMET [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00469" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] subtyping tools to confirm that the sequences’ subtypes were correctly labelled. We estimated maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees for both datasets using RAxML [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00469" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In all of the ML analyses we used an HKY nucleotide substitution model with gamma-distributed rate variation among sites and ran a bootstrap analysis with 100 replicates. We identified potential transmission clusters in the Odessa phylogenetic tree with ClusterPicker [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00469" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Any clade with two or more sequences, within-cluster genetic distance &lt;1.5%, and bootstrap statistical support &gt;90% was defined as a possible transmission cluster, in accordance with the literature [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00469" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. To study differences between those individuals who were placed in clusters and those who were not, we used t-tests (for continuous variables) and Fisher’s exact test (for categorical variables) to compare socio-demographic characteristics.
