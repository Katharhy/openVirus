<p>The BDSKY model assumes individuals become non-infectious upon sampling (i.e., they cannot transmit HIV further) as they are provided treatment and reach viral suppression. The prior distributions for the BDSKY model consisted of: (a) a uniform distribution for the date of origin, which is the duration of the epidemic represented by the sequences in the analysis, with an upper bound of 60 and lower bound 19 (the age of the oldest sequence in the analysis); (b) a lognormal distribution for

 </italic> (mean = 1.0, standard deviation = 1.25) with an upper bound of 10; (c) a lognormal distribution for 
 <italic>δ</italic> (mean = 0.0, standard deviation = 1.0) constrained to take values between 0.05 - 6, corresponding to the plausible values of the duration of infectious period (20 years–2 months); and (d) a beta prior for the sampling proportion (α = 1.0, β = 10.0, constrained to values between 0 and 0.01) for time intervals (3)–(10) as defined above; the sampling proportion was set to 0 before the first sampling date (time intervals (1) and (2) as defined above). We ran 4 independent MCMC chains for 300 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> generations (with the initial 3% removed as burn-in) for the 
 <italic>Odessa</italic> dataset. For the analysis of the 
 <italic>Kyiv</italic> dataset we used the same analyses specifications and ran 2 independent MCMC analyses for 300 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> generations (10% burn-in). We also used the same BEAST specifications in our consequent sensitivity analyses. We used LogCombiner [
