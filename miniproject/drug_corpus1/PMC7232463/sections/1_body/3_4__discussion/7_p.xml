<p>We want to emphasise that currently there is no way to account for non-random sampling approaches in a phylodynamic context and we do not know how network-based sampling might be affecting estimates obtained in phylodynamic analyses of sequence data, which presents a particular theoretical challenge for the molecular epidemiology field [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00469" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In the context of HIV transmission, as well as many other infectious diseases, including viral hepatitises, a random sample of an infected population is often unrealistic and epidemiologists proceed with non-probability sampling methods. Consequently, more research is needed to develop phylodynamic frameworks that would be able to account for and accommodate these sampling techniques. Indeed, the sampling approach employed in this work might have biased some of our estimates. The fact that TRIP was a social network-based intervention, with an active contact recruitment approach means that some potential transmission events might be captured in our tree, that otherwise would not be captured under random population sampling. Specifically, the tree may be enriched for infection events among individuals with close or direct epidemiological linkage. It is possible that this would only bias our estimates towards a higher

This would particularly strongly affect any analyses carried out in a coalescent framework, while birth-death models implemented here provide slightly more control through the sampling parameter. Nevertheless, we undertook a sensitivity analysis to investigate this concern. Removing any network-derived TRIP sequences, we still found a reduction in
