<p>Importantly, we analysed sequences from Kyiv and Odessa separately as two unrelated epidemics, even though they do not form two independent clades on the Ukrainian HIV phylogenetic tree. Given that the two epidemics share the same ancestry and, thus, parts of the phylogenetic tree, we might have introduced bias for our estimates that go further in the past. In this analysis, apart from 2001–2003, our estimates for both
