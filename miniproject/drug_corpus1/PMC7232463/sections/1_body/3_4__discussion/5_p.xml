<p>Our estimates of 
 <italic>R
  <sub>e</sub>
 </italic> both in Odessa and Kyiv prior to the initiation of TRIP are different from previously reported estimates [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00469" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B51-viruses-12-00469" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. For the mid-90s, our BDSKY estimates (
 <italic>R
  <sub>e</sub>
 </italic> = 2.08, 95%HPD 0.21–4.41, for Kyiv and 
 <italic>R
  <sub>e</sub>
 </italic> = 2.17, 95%HPD 1.11–4.07, for Odessa) are much lower than the estimates of the basic reproductive number that we have previously obtained through a coalescent-based analysis of HIV-1 subtype A 
 <italic>env</italic> sequences from Russia and Ukraine (
 <italic>R
  <sub>e</sub>
 </italic> = 7) [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00469" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Even higher 
 <italic>R
  <sub>e</sub>
 </italic> estimates were obtained through other birth-death models applied to the same 
 <italic>env</italic> sequences (sampled in 1996–2011) by Magee et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-viruses-12-00469" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. For the mid-2000s our estimates are relatively high, though this is accompanied by a large degree of uncertainty, i.e., large HPD intervals, which means that the true value might be included in the broad confidence intervals and is not very different from the previous reports that suggest that 
 <italic>R
  <sub>e</sub>
 </italic> in Ukraine was below 1 after 2000 [
 <xref rid="B51-viruses-12-00469" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. However, we believe that these discrepancies are largely due to the different number and sampling dates of sequences in the analysis. As suggested by Magee et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-viruses-12-00469" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], when no birth events (i.e., “infection events”) were observed in the tree during the 2000s, a very low 
 <italic>R
  <sub>e</sub>
 </italic> was inferred. Similarly, in our analysis the 
 <italic>R
  <sub>e</sub>
 </italic> in Odessa was estimated to be very low in 2001–2002, probably attributed to the absence of sampled sequences and birth events in the years after (2003–2009). In our analysis, the majority of sequences were sampled after 2011 and multiple birth events were observed in the tree during mid-2000s, which resulted in higher 
 <italic>R
  <sub>e</sub>
 </italic> estimates after 2002. The broad confidence intervals in our analysis are not surprising, as it has been reported before that the BDSKY approach returns particularly imprecise estimates if the analysis goes further into the past than the oldest sampling date in the analysis [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00469" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-viruses-12-00469" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. However, as we are primarily interested in the dynamics about the time of the TRIP intervention, the broad HPDs at different time periods are of lesser concern. In the recent years, the HPDs were wider in Kyiv compared to Odessa, however our sensitivity analysis showed that it is unlikely to be attributed solely to the lower number of sequences from Kyiv, as our reduced 
 <italic>Odessa</italic> dataset resulted in the values and HPDs comparable to those obtained from the full 
 <italic>Odessa</italic> dataset.
