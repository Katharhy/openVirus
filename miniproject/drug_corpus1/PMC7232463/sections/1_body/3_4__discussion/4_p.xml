<p>Our analysis of changes in transmission dynamics in Odessa following the TRIP intervention suggested that epidemic growth rate was reduced relative to that in Kyiv during the same period and that the beginning of the TRIP intervention in Odessa coincides with the slowing down of HIV transmission in that city. We observe that estimates of the reproductive number decreased and estimates of the rate with which people become diagnosed (and within the assumption of our model, treated) increase. Crucially, no such trend was observed in Kyiv during the same time. This difference might be attributed to the fact that TRIP incorporated active network recruitment as part of its procedures and was able to reach to comparatively high number of people with undiagnosed HIV infection [
