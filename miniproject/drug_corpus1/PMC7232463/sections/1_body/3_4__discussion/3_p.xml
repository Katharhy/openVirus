<p>The additional meta-data associated with the sequences in our study helped us to question some of the more obvious clustering patterns. For example, a co-infection with syphilis might suggest a possible sexual route for HIV transmission, or if clustered sequences came from PWID then a parenteral route of transmission might be suspected, as in cluster 6 in our analysis. In some cases, combining information about recent infection and estimates of TMRCA allowed us to rule out the potential for direct transmission between individuals whose sequences were clustered. For instance, a recently-infected individual in cluster 2 was recruited in 2016, which means that individual could not have been infected earlier than 2015, while the TMRCA of cluster 2 is much older (2008.0, 95% HPD 2003.1–2012.9) precluding direct transmission within this cluster. Similarly, in cluster 7, a recently infected individual was recruited in 2016 while the TMRCA of the cluster was estimated to be 2010.7 (95% HPD 2007.0–2014.0).</p>
