<p>In the last five years, the amount of virus genetic data available for phylogenetic and phylodynamic analysis has substantially increased; in Ukraine alone, the number of HIV genetic sequences has quadrupled since 2018. This presents new opportunities to apply phylogenetic and phylodynamic techniques to describe changes in virus populations and in HIV transmission dynamics in the country. Here, we examined factors associated with HIV phylogenetic clustering and applied a birth-death phylodynamic model to examine potential differences in HIV transmission dynamics between two cities (Odessa and Kyiv), following the introduction in one city (Odessa) of an HIV prevention intervention (TRIP). We found a reduction in the HIV effective reproduction number (i.e., reduced epidemic growth) in Odessa relative to Kyiv, where no TRIP intervention was enacted.</p>
