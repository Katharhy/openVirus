<p>The sensitive nature of the questions in the study precluded us from obtaining personal identification information at the point of recruitment. This could have led to individuals appearing multiple times in the dataset, which would introduce biases. ElimDupes was used in an attempt to ameliorate potential repeated recruitment. For example, cluster 3 includes 2 sequences isolated from individuals of the same gender, age, risk group and very similar viral load. Thus, we cannot fully rule out the possibility that cluster 3 includes 2 subsequently sampled strains from one individual, seen by different interviewers. Our sensitivity analyses suggest that if that was the case, and we removed cluster 3 from our analysis, we have found that no statistically significant difference in average viral load between clustered and unclustered individuals would be observed. However, using ElimDupes to ensure that no patient was represented twice in our sample might have reduced our power to detect phylogenetic clusters, as it might happen that two patients have identical sequences.</p>
