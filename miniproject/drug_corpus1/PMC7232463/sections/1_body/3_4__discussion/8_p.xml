<p>Crucially, if better surveillance data were available, it could be used to inform priors on some of the birth-death model parameters—particularly on the sampling proportion parameter—which could result in a significant reduction in the uncertainty of other parameters in the analysis. However, this could only be useful when reliable surveillance data are available and would need to be implemented with caution, as we have previously argued that if sampling assumptions of the model are violated, then discrepancy between the observed sampling times and the sampling priors can lead to biased
