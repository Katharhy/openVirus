<p>Over the last 10 years the scope of HIV prevention interventions has grown to incorporate new clinical insights and technological advances; it is now common for interventions to involve the collection of virus genetic sequences. Often these studies involve marginalised groups, such as people who inject drugs (PWID), men who have sex with men (MSM), female sex workers and undocumented migrants, as usually HIV prevalence is higher in these groups than in so-called “general population”. Importantly, it is often unrealistic to try to obtain a random sample from certain populations due to their hidden (and in some locations criminalized) nature, since a random sampling assumes that each individual is selected by chance and everyone has an equal chance to participate in the study. Social-network based approaches have proved to be an effective alternative to recruit participants for HIV research studies and to deliver HIV preventive measures in hard-to-reach populations [

TRIP aimed to evaluate a network-based approach to locating recently (within the last 6 months) HIV-infected people and to preventing ongoing transmission. Previously published results have shown that the TRIP intervention was more effective in finding recently HIV-infected people, those with high HIV viral load and those previously undiagnosed, than the standard of care options [
