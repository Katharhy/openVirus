<p>It has been proposed that the analysis of HIV gene sequences can be used to assess the impact of a specific preventive intervention in a specific location [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00469" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Here we aimed to assess the population-level impact of TRIP on HIV transmission in Odessa, Ukraine, and to compare it to the estimated HIV transmission dynamics in the capital of Ukraine, Kyiv. We used a data set of HIV sequences from Odessa and Kyiv, Ukraine from 2000—2019, compiled from several sources. We then describe the application of phylodynamic methods to estimate the effective reproductive number and the becoming-uninfectious rate from these data, along with an analysis of HIV transmission clusters. We find that following the TRIP implementation in Odessa, the HIV epidemic there is characterized by a lower
