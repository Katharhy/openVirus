<p>In recent years phylodynamic analyses have become increasingly widely applied in the field of HIV surveillance and prevention. Phylodynamics can estimate changes in viral population size over time and be used to explore how various factors (epidemiological, evolutionary, behavioural, etc.) affect these changes [

Such analyses are often performed on sets of HIV genetic sequences collected through national or regional HIV drug resistance surveillance efforts. They can be used for identifying and monitoring of HIV transmission clusters, identification of local HIV outbreaks and for targeting subsequent public health interventions [
