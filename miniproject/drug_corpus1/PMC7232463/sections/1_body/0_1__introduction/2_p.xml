<p>Phylodynamic models based on birth-death processes enable the estimation of three important epidemiological parameters: (i) the effective reproductive number, 
 <italic>R
  <sub>e</sub>
 </italic>, which is the average number of secondary infections arising from an infected individual at any given time during an epidemic, (ii) the proportion of the population that has been sampled and (iii) the rate of becoming uninfectious, 
 <italic>Î´,</italic> which is the rate with which individuals cease transmitting infections (i.e., due to behavioural change, treatment or death) [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00469" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00469" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00469" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The effective reproductive number is often used to describe transmission dynamics in a population; 
 <italic>R
  <sub>e</sub>
 </italic> &gt; 1 means the epidemic is growing, while 
 <italic>R
  <sub>e</sub>
 </italic> &lt; 1 means the epidemic is declining. The becoming-uninfectious rate is inversely related to the average duration of the infectious period, assuming that length of this period is exponentially distributed. The becoming-uninfectious rate is important, because it is known that Treatment as Prevention (TasP) is most effective if people are diagnosed and treated as soon as possible after they are infected [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00469" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Thus, increasing the rate at which individuals cease to be infectious can reduce onward transmission and is clinically beneficial for the infected individual.
