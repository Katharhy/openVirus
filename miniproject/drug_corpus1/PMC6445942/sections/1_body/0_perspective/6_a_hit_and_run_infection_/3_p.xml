<p>Although EV-D68 appears to be good at covering its tracks, the epidemiologic evidence that EV-D68 is a major cause of epidemic AFM, while circumstantial, is nonetheless strong. Since historically many or even most cases of nonpolio AFP/AFM have been caused by circulating NPEVs (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), it is logical to suspect that during explosive EV-D68 epidemicity, many or most AFM cases would be caused by EV-D68 as well, even as AFM cases associated with other NPEVs continue to occur at lower background rates.
