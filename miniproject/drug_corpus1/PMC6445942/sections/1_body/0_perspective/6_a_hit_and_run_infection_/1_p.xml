<p>There is an obvious paradox in temporal-geographic association between AFM and EV-D68, on the one hand, and difficulty detecting EV-D68 in AFM cases, on the other. In this regard, a precipitating EV-D68 infection, often with low-level viral replication (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), may well have run its course by the time of onset and diagnosis of AFM, several days to a week or more later. Early transient viremia during the respiratory prodrome might also have resolved by the time of AFM onset. Alternatively, local virus may cross the blood-brain barrier to extend proximally up nerve axons to the cord; this is believed to be the mechanism of ipsilateral trauma-associated “provocation poliomyelitis” (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In addition, some NPEVs that spread by the respiratory route, including EV-D68, have low gastrointestinal tropism, hindering stool isolation (the standard poliovirus diagnostic technique).
