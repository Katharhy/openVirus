<p>As it unfolds, the AFM story seems to be getting more complicated. Preliminary U.S. data show that not only was epidemic AFM associated with EV-D68 in 2018, but also with EV-A71 (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), a well-known cause of both hand-foot-and-mouth disease and AFM that has been problematic in other regions of the world, but historically less so in the United States. Could we be entering some kind of new epidemic era, in which fundamental but unappreciated determinants of enterovirus evolution and spread are changing? In this context, it is also appropriate to consider whether epidemic AFM results only from high-level epidemic circulation of viruses such as EV-D68 and EV-A71 or, as some data suggest, from rapid viral evolution via mutation and recombination that leads to increased viral pathogenicity (
