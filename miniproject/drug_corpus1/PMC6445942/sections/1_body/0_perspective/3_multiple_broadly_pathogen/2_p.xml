<p>Circulating NPEVs usually are replaced, in part or in whole, by other NPEVs in subsequent seasons (

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>); however, some NPEVs may reappear at intervals of 2 or more years (

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). For example, in Southeast Asia (but not in the rest of the world), EV-A71 has occurred in 2- to 3-year cycles (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>); in previous decades, 5-year cycles were noted for EVA9 and EVB5; and various other cyclic patterns have been noted for different NPEVs (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The cycles presumably reflect factors such as viral transmissibility, population immunity, and possibly NPEV elicitation of cross-reactive immunity to shared epitopes. Short-interval cyclicity is consistent with viral hypertransmissibility, which leads to high population herd immunity that prevents further spread until such time as new annual birth cohorts of susceptible persons can sufficiently dilute it. Such patterns were well described for measles and other childhood diseases in the prevaccine era.
