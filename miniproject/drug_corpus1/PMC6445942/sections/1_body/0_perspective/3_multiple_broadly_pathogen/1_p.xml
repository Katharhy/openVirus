<p>Poliovirus isolation techniques also led to discovery and characterization of a large, ubiquitous group of picornaviruses termed “enteroviruses,” containing not only the three polioviruses but also at least 110 “nonpolio enteroviruses” (NPEVs) (

NPEVs can cause a wide array of disease syndromes, including respiratory infections, conjunctivitis, myositis, pleurodynia, myocarditis, maculopapular and vesicular rashes, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, herpangina, meningitis, encephalitis, so-called “neonatal viral sepsis,” possibly type 1 diabetes, and—occasionally—sporadic AFM (
