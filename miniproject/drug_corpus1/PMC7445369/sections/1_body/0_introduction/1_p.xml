<p>An unexpected infection caused by a coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is devastating the health of the world population and, consequently, the global economy. Although the primary manifestation of COVID-19 infection is pneumonia, there is increasing evidence that suggests the spread to key organs other than the respiratory system, among them the central and peripheral nervous system. A growing body of evidence shows that neurotropism is one common feature of coronaviruses [

The involvement of the nervous system can be due to a direct action of these viruses on the nervous tissue and/or to an indirect action through the activation of immune-mediated mechanisms. While the first action can be verified during the acute phase of the disease, the second can be apparent only after days, weeks, or even months following the acute phase. Many viral infections can damage the structure and function of the nervous system, manifesting as encephalitis, toxic encephalopathy, and postinfectious demyelinating disease [

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and cause nerve damage through direct infection pathways (circulatory and neuronal), hypoxia, immune injury, attack to ACE2 enzymes, and other mechanisms [
