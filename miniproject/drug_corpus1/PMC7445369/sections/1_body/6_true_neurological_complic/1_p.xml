<p>The increased incidence of GBS after swine flu vaccination raised several claims that the vaccine was the cause of several other infectious or immune-mediated diseases, including postvaccinal encephalopathy, myelopathy, and peripheral nerve lesions [

Kurland, an eminent US neuroepidemiologist from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, USA, to provide reference data on the incidence of a number of infectious and immune-mediated inflammatory neurological diseases, including encephalitis and aseptic meningitis [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], acute transverse myelitis [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], brachial plexus neuropathy [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and GBS [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and calculate the excess number of individuals who could experience the same symptoms as a result of the adverse effects of the vaccine. This interesting experience provides the background for correct investigation of the measure of the risk in the presence of a possible association between an etiological agent (in our case, the COVID-19) and a neurological disease.
