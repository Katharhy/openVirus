The chaotic management of patients considered to be at risk of contagion or who presented with general or neurological manifestations of infection had perhaps a negative impact on the introduction of preventive and therapeutic measures. This includes, among others, the measurement of D-dimer at the onset of the infection to prevent thrombosis [
