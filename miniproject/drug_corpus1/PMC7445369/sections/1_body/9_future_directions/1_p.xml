<p>The information available on the frequency of neurological disorders in people with COVID-19 is entirely based on clinical series that, in the absence of controls and a population base, give us only a rough and perhaps biased picture of the purported association and do not provide clues on the direction. In addition, we cannot predict if this association ends with the resolution of the outbreak or, most likely, will be followed by a number of short-term and long-term complications. The picture is further complicated by the poor knowledge of the seasonal variation of the infection, the duration of immunity, the intensity of cross-immunity, and the effects of control measures [

As taught by the 1918 influenza pandemic and the more recent occurrence of postinfectious neurological complications of coronaviruses, present observations provide the basis to implement surveillance programs directed at the detection of selected neurological disorders as epidemiological markers of immune-mediated reactions to the virus. GBS might be selected as one of these disorders considering that the incidence of the disease has been calculated in several countries in all continents [
