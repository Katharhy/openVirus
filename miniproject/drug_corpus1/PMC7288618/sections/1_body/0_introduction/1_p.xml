<p id="Par3">The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. Human biological sex plays a fundamental role in heterogeneous COVID-19 outcomes. Sex, defined as male, female or intersex on the basis of sex chromosome complement, reproductive tissues (ovaries or testes) and sex steroid hormone (oestrogen, progesterone and testosterone) concentrations, is a multidimensional biological characteristic that shapes infectious disease pathogenesis. We discuss how sex differences in basic molecular and cellular mechanisms can be leveraged to define the immune response to infection with SARS-CoV-2.</p>
