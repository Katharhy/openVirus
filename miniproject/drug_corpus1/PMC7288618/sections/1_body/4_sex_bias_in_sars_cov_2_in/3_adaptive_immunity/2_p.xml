 <italic>G</italic> and 
 <italic>CXCR3</italic>, has been linked to incomplete X chromosome inactivation and T cell-specific epigenetic modifications of the X chromosome

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>
