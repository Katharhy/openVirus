 </sup>. It is still unknown whether sex has an impact on antibody generation in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Early studies suggest that titres of antibodies to some viral epitopes are higher in patients with severe COVID-19 and that seroconversion may not be tightly linked to declining virus titres

 </sup>. Ongoing studies evaluating the infusion of convalescent serum may provide answers as to the protective capacity of these antibodies

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>
 </sup>, but these studies are currently not considering biological sex. Generation of protective, neutralizing antibodies is a goal of vaccine development, with the cautionary note that in models of SARS-CoV vaccination some antibody responses induced potent inflammatory responses
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>
 </sup>. Persistence of antibodies, epitope targeting and non-neutralizing Fc-mediated antibody characteristics should be assessed with sex-stratified analyses. As vaccines are developed, the female bias towards both potent responses and adverse effects should be considered and sex-specific dosing should be tested, where appropriate
