 </sup>. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, where there is no pre-existing adaptive immune memory, the success of this early antiviral response may be a determinant of disease outcome. Innate sensing of viral RNA by the pattern-recognition receptor Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is sex biased, as

 </sup> but without consideration of biological sex. In SARS-CoV-2, emerging data suggest that there is aberrant activation of interferon responses but preserved chemokine signalling, which has been postulated to contribute to immunopathology

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>
 </sup>. Studies are needed to determine whether differences in the magnitude or kinetics of the interferon response may contribute to a sex bias in the early control or severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and may inform considerations of interferons as therapies for COVID-19 (ref.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>
