<p id="Par7">Although advancing age is associated with greater risk of death in both sexes, the male bias remains evident (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). An analysis of COVID-19 data from Italy, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium and Norway reveals that among all age groups older than 20 years, fatality rates are greater for males than females
