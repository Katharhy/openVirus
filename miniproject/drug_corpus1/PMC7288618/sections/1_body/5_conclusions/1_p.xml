<p id="Par15">Emerging data demonstrating more favourable outcomes for community-dwelling adult females across age strata offer an immediate opportunity for comparative biology experiments to define features of COVID-19 pathogenesis and the associated immune response. The research pipeline should integrate sex as a biological variable in all stages, from fundamental research to preclinical drug development, clinical trials and epidemiological analyses

 </sup>. Considering the role of intersecting factors — including, but not limited to, gender, age, race and other identifying characteristics — is critical to understanding the biological and sociocultural factors contributing to heterogeneous COVID-19 outcomes. Sex is a driver of discovery and innovation
