<p>In confirmed COVID‐19 cases, standard principles of communicable respiratory viral infection should be followed. In an early report, case fatality rates in non‐severe and severe COVID‐19 infections were 0.1% and 8.1%, respectively.

Patients should be closely monitored for superimposed bacterial infection and other common viral reactivation, such as cytomegalovirus or Epstein‐Barr virus. A multidisciplinary, team approach is essential in order to orchestrate the management of this patients and make adjustments based on new information as it is disseminated from early epidemic areas. Teams should make an effort to systemically documenting the outcomes and rapidly reporting it, in order to allow other centres to benefit from their findings. We urgently need a safe and effective treatment for COVID‐19. An adaptive, randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel therapeutic agents has been initiated by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) (NCT04280705). Remdesivir is the first antiviral agent being evaluated under this protocol which has previously shown antiviral activity against other single‐stranded RNA viruses.
