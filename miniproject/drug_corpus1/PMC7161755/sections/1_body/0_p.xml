<p>At the time of this writing, the World Health Organization has upgraded the global risk of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID‐19) outbreak to ‘very high’. Since the first reports less than 3 months ago, over 80,000 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with over 2,800 deaths attributed to COVID‐19.
 <xref rid="bjh16597-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> Many factors related to this pathogen remain unknown at this point, such as incubation period, rate of asymptomatic infection, quality of host immune response, etc., which makes it extremely difficult to model the potential spread of the infection or effective mitigation strategies. As with similar zoonotic‐origin viral epidemics in the recent past, such as Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)‐CoV and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)‐CoV, the current novel coronavirus strain appears to cause most severe infection with potentially‐fatal outcomes in the older patients and patients with underlying co‐morbidities.

 <xref rid="bjh16597-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> With over 50,000 hematopoietic cell transplantations (HCT) carried out annually, individuals who are actively undergoing HCT or who are HCT survivors with compromised immune systems make up a large population of susceptible patients in which COVID‐19 infection may lead to devastating consequences. It is still too early to forecast the risk of infection and disease severity of COVID‐19 in HCT patients, but it likely to follow the deleterious course previously reported by other community‐acquired respiratory viruses.
