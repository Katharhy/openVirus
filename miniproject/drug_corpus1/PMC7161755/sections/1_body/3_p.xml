<p>Only the future will tell what will be the long‐term impact of COVID‐19 on human health and the socioeconomic fabric of our society. This outbreak has once again exposed the shortcomings of our ability to respond and curtail novel pathogen outbreaks. We encourage the development of a robust, dynamic and widely‐applicable strategy at institutional, national and international level, in coordination with the Center for Disease Control (CDC), NMDP and WBMT, so we are better prepared to protect our most vulnerable patients from future viral epidemics.</p>
