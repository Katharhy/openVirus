<p>This infection is spread via respiratory droplets, so universal protective measures are key to safeguard patients as well as healthcare workers. Many centres are performing outpatient HCT, where a patient stays in proximity to the transplant centre. In areas with confirmed community spread of COVID‐19, HCT patients actively getting conditioning or in the pre‐engraftment period can be admitted pre‐emptively to the hospital. This planning needs to happen well in advance given the extra resources required to manage confirmed COVID‐19 cases during an epidemic. The Worldwide Network for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (WBMT) has recommended deferring non‐urgent HCT in areas with endemic or high‐frequency COVID‐19 infection.

In the absence of a vaccine or effective anti‐viral drug at the current stage, maximum emphasis should be placed on personal protection by avoiding unnecessary travel to high‐risk areas and exercising good hygiene for patients who are at home but still on immunosuppressive therapy. The other aspect of this equation is donor health and the potential impact on supply‐chain operation for delivering the cell therapy product. Taking into consideration the fact that this virus has not been shown to be transmitted by cell therapy or blood products, the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP)/Be The Match
 <sup>®</sup> has implemented a donor screening questionnaire and a similar advisory is in effect from WBMT.

At this stage, it is still too early to recommend an alternate donor option for patients in urgent need of an allogeneic HCT.
