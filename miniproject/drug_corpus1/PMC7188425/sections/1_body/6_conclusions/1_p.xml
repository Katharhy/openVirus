<p>Although viral pneumonia is common, the specific inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects it has on the host is still largely unknown. COVID-19 has brought viral pneumonia and subsequent host pathology to the forefront of medical care and research. SARS-CoV-2 spread worldwide in a matter of months to cause a pandemic not seen since influenza in 1918. Our highly interconnected global society creates ample opportunity for the rapid spread of novel viruses. Since these types of viral pandemics have occurred multiple times historically (e.g., influenza in 1918, Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2014, and SARS in 2004) and will continue to occur in the future, research into immunomodulative therapies for patients afflicted with viral pneumonia will be a key aspect to improving outcomes after viral pneumonia. A personalized approach, taking into account differences in the biology of individuals and the pathophysiology of different viruses, will also be required to make significant progress in the treatment of these patients.</p>
