<p>Influenza vaccines rely on conserved antigens such as ectodomain of influenza M2 protein, M2e, or hemagglutinin stalk domains. Hemagglutinin globular head specific antibodies confer immunity since it interferes with virus attachment to host cell receptors; however, they are also one of the most variable viral antigens (

 <xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). The need for adjuvants in vaccinations confers an additional important role for DAMPs and PAMPs in viral immunity. One recent study used PAMP TLR9 agonist and commonly used pharmaceutical additive to induce the release of DAMPs to improve immunogenic response to the seasonal influenza vaccine (
