<p>Natural infection with viral causes of pneumonia does not induce long-term protective immunity due to an evolutionary advantage allowing viruses to evade host immune defenses via antigenic shift and drift. Antigenic drift occurs with small point mutations in the viral genome leading to minor changes in key viral epitopes, while antigenic shift is a major change in a key gene leading to a complete exchange of a key epitope (

Antigenic shift is the molecular mechanism by which novel influenza strains emerge and is the cause of pandemics such as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (
