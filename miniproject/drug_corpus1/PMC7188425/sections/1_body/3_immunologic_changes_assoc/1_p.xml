<p>The host response to severe viral lung infection occurs secondary to immune dysregulation leading to lung injury and the systemic inflammatory response. There have been many studies on the immunologic changes associated with influenza A virus (IAV). However, little is known about other respiratory viral illnesses in adults. Therefore, much of our discussion on the immunology of viral pneumonia will focus on IAV studies.</p>
