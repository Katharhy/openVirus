<p>Although CAP remains a significant source of morbidity and mortality, very little work has been done establishing genomic, epigenetic, or transcriptomic changes specifically associated with viral pneumonia (
 <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). In particular, no clear polymorphism definitively raises the risk of viral pneumonia, limiting personalized medicine for predictive models. In one of the few studies of transcriptomics in viral pneumonia, microarray analysis and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen, Redwood City, CA) was performed on 19 critically ill patients with 2009 H1N1 influenza A pneumonia. The most severely ill group of 12 patients demonstrated impaired expression of numerous genes participating in adaptive immune responses (e.g., diminished antigen presentation, B-cell development, T-helper cell differentiation, and apoptosis), suggesting impaired adaptive immunity in severe viral pneumonia (
