<p>A pattern of dysregulated inflammation caused by viral respiratory infection leads to this increased susceptibility to secondary bacterial pneumonia or coinfection. Most research on viral-bacterial respiratory coinfection has been focused on elucidating the pathophysiology of influenza viruses given its high propensity to cause pandemics and higher mortality when compared with the other viruses (
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Influenza A causes a reduction in murine alveolar macrophages and dysregulation of remaining macrophages and neutrophils, one of the body’s primary defense mechanisms against bacterial pathogens (

 <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Additionally, prior infection with influenza virus attenuates bacterial induced release of IL-17 leading to decreased innate T cell-mediated bacterial clearance (

 <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Additionally, there is evidence of sustained desensitization of TLR ligands following viral infection, leading to decreased chemokine release and nuclear factor kappa B activation in macrophages (

 <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). This in turn results in attenuated neutrophil recruitment, further decreasing the ability to reduce bacterial load in secondary bacterial infection (
