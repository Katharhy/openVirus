<p>Although there seems to be a difference in cytokine response based on the cause of respiratory infection, there are mixed results in the utility of plasma cytokine levels for prediction of pneumonia etiology (
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In a recent single-center study, differences in admission plasma levels of IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, and INF-γ were observed between different etiologies of CAP, with INF-γ most elevated in viral CAP (
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Conversely, a similar study demonstrated, admission plasma cytokine levels were not statistically different based on etiology (bacterial vs viral vs mixed bacterial-viral vs unknown etiology) (
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Other studies noted that serum transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) levels predicted viral pneumonia, as opposed to other etiologies of CAP, where TGF-β had negative correlations with the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score in patients that progressed to sepsis (

 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Therefore, although the specific cytokine profile elicited by particular viruses is unknown, it is clear that, as with most etiologies of sepsis, an elevation of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines are responsible for the host septic and systemic inflammatory response syndrome response in all severe viral cases of pneumonia (

 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).
