<p>As with many other responses to infection, it is pertinent to recognize the role of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) in viral respiratory infection. Pattern recognition receptors on respiratory epithelial cells, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), detect evolutionarily conserved microbial ligands, or PAMPs (

 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Viral PAMPs are typically viral envelope proteins or nucleic acids motifs within the DNA or RNA genomes of the virus, which are critical for structure and function (

Additional recognition of host cell constituents from damaged or dying cells, recognized as DAMPs, are thought to control the magnitude of the immune response (
