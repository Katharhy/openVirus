<p>Until such time that effective therapies and vaccines become available, public health efforts should continue to focus on mitigating the spread of SARS-CoV-2 through well-established infection control strategies (
 <xref rid="R88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>). This can be aided in the hospital with admission of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients into negative pressure rooms with contact precaution protocols requiring personal protective equipment such as gowns, gloves, fit-tested N95 respirators, and face shields. Additionally, rules limiting the people entering the isolation room and requiring logging of healthcare workers involved in COVID-19 patient care should be followed to effectively monitor patient contact and limit spread. All equipment (monitors, etc.) in the isolation room should be designated for the case patient only. Physicians should limit potential spread by recognizing any necessary aerosol-generating procedures and preparing accordingly (e.g., for intubation using controlled measures including paralytics, video laryngoscopy, N95 masks). Although fomites are suspected as the main source of transmission, there is also possible fecal-oral transmission; therefore, hand washing is a mainstay of control/prevention (
