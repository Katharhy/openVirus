<p>Currently, there is no approved drug or vaccination for the treatment or prevention of SARS-CoV-2 viral pneumonia. There are many trials underway attempting to attenuate the disease with remdesivir, IL-6 receptor blockers, IL-7, and antiretrovirals such as lopinavir-ritonavir (

 <italic>New England Journal of Medicine</italic> recently published a randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of lopinavir-ritonavir versus standard care alone in the treatment of adult hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. There were no differences in hospital mortality, time to clinical improvement, or viral RNA levels. Although the median time to improvement was 1 day shorter with lopinavir-ritonavir on intention-to-treat analysis, 14% of patients had adverse events requiring treatment discontinuation. Therefore, it was concluded that there was no benefit observed with lopinavir-ritonavir treatment versus standard treatment of severe COVID-19 patients (

 <italic>n</italic> = 20 per group, nonrandomized), hydroxychloroquine was associated with reduced viral load and reduced duration of viral detection which was further attenuated by the addition of azithromycin (
