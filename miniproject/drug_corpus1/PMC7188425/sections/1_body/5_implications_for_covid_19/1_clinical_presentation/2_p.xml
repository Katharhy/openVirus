 <xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). The median age of confirmed COVID-19 cases is in the 6th decade of life with a slight male predominance. Twenty-five percent of patients have severe symptoms requiring intensive care treatment of which 10% develop respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Chest radiograph imaging of these patients reveals bilateral patchy infiltrates and CT imaging shows ground-glass infiltrates. Patients typically present with laboratory findings of prolonged prothrombin time, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and lymphopenia (70% of patients) (
