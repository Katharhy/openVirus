<p>The clinical presentation of viral pneumonia does not differentiate between the specific viral causes of respiratory infection. The common clinical presentation of acute viral respiratory infection includes cough, dyspnea, fever, and pleuritic chest pain. Viral etiologies of lower respiratory infection are less likely to cause sputum production, and if present, tends to be watery or scant. In contrast, sputum production tends to be mucopurulent when due to bacterial pneumonia (

 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Clinical signs of viral respiratory illness include fever, rales (crackles) on auscultation, hypoxemia, and tachycardia. These four signs together have a positive predictive value of 57.1%, with fever as the strongest clinically predictive sign of a viral respiratory infection versus that of bacterial etiology (
