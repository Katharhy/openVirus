<p>The biggest advantages of an antigen detection kit are short detection times and high detection sensitivity (as the detection of virus protein reaches pg levels), providing a simple and sensitive method for the early screening of viral infection (

 <xref rid="b65-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). Positive sample results only indicate the presence of coronavirus antigen and other conditions cannot be evaluated (
 <xref rid="b51-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Furthermore, the failure or success of treatment cannot be determined, as the antigen may persist following appropriate antiviral treatment (
 <xref rid="b65-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). It is also very difficult to achieve rapid detection of whole virus antigens as antigen detection usually requires high sensitivity and antigen contents in samples are generally low (
