<p>Protein detection technology is mainly divided into pathogen antigen detection and host antibody detection (
 <xref rid="b49-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Commonly used methodologies include colloidal gold (
 <xref rid="b50-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), immunofluorescence chromatography (
 <xref rid="b51-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), chemiluminescence (
 <xref rid="b52-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="b53-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>) and ELISA (
 <xref rid="b54-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). The colloidal gold method is easy to operate and can be directly visually interpreted (
 <xref rid="b55-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). The test can be completed in 15 min and, therefore, can be used for on-site material acquisition and on-site detection (
 <xref rid="b55-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Immunofluorescence chromatography is as easy to operate as colloidal gold and detection is fast; however, it requires instrument interpretation (
 <xref rid="b51-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="b56-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). The chemiluminescence method generally has high sensitivity and uses a full-automatic immunoanalyzer, which can complete detection without excessive manual operation (
 <xref rid="b52-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="b53-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). The detection time is generally ~30 min. ELISA can be interpreted using a conventional microplate reader (
 <xref rid="b57-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Generally, ELISA exhibits high sensitivity; however, the detection time is longer (â‰¥1.5 h) and there are numerous operating steps (
 <xref rid="b54-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>).
