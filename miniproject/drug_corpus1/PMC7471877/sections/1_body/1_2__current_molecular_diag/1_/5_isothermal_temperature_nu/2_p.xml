<p>Using RAA technology, the Institute of Viral Disease Control and Prevention of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Jiangsu Qitian Gene Biotechnology Co., Ltd. jointly developed a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) nucleic acid isothermal amplification rapid detection kit. After nucleic acid is extracted, it only takes 8-15 min to detect 2019-nCoV nucleic acid (

Following parallel comparison with commercial quantitative PCR (qPCR) kits approved by the China National Medical Product Administration (NMPA), the kits have a 100% positive compliance rate, a 100% negative compliance rate and a total compliance rate of 100%, which are equivalent (

The kit has been evaluated by the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine (92 clinical samples), Zhejiang Center for Disease Control and Prevention (104 clinical samples) and Jiangsu Province's Center for Disease Control and Prevention (100 samples) (

The kit is considered suitable for use in prefecture-level laboratories and is currently applying for a China NMPA approval number (
