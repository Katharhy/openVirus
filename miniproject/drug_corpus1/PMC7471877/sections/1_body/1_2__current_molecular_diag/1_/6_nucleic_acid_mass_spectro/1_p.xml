<p>Nucleic acid mass spectrometry is a novel type of soft ionized biological mass spectrometry technology that has been developed recently based on atrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time Of Flight technology and is very simple and efficient (
 <xref rid="b45-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). This procedure integrates the high-throughput of chip technology and the high sensitivity of mass spectrometry technology without the requirement for complex biological information analysis and is mainly used for the detection of known mutations (
