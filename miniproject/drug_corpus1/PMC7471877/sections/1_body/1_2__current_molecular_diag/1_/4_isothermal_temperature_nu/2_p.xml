<p>On February 25, 2020, the team of Dr Xiushan Yin, the director of the Institute of Applied Biology of Shenyang University of Chemical Technology and the team of Michael B Chancellor at Royal Oak Beaumont published an article about RT-LAMP on MedRxi. The article optimized a specific and accurate detection method for 2019-nCoV and provided multiple primer sequences directed at Orf1ab region (

Numerous domestic institutions have announced that they have developed a 2019-nCoV isothermal amplification kit, which requires only ‘one-time opening and one-step operation’, and can complete amplification reactions as fast as 15 min. Test results are fast and easy, and can be seen macroscopically (
