<p>Developed in 2000, LAMP is a fast and highly specific technology for gene amplification under constant temperature conditions (

 <xref rid="b37-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Based on this, by adding a fluorescence quenching probe (QProbe), fluorescence RT-LAMP technology be used for the detection of MERS-CoV (

In order to make the detection of LAMP amplification products more accurate, the combination of nucleic acid detection and immunogold labeling technology has resulted in an improved RT-LAMP-combined nucleic acid strip detection technology (RT-LAMP-NAD), which has been used for the detection of Ebola virus (
