<p>Viral infection in the human body stimulates the production of specific antibodies. The presence of antibodies can be detected by antigen levels, which indirectly confirm 2019-nCoV infection (
 <xref rid="b59-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). The applicable sample types for antibody detection kits are blood (including serum) plasma and whole blood. The detected antibodies are usually IgM and IgG (
 <xref rid="b67-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). Presently, to the best of our knowledge, no systematic studies on the production and duration of these antibodies for 2019-nCoV has been performed. In general, IgM antibodies are used as an indicator of early infection, while IgG antibodies are used as indicators of current and previous infection (
