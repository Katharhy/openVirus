<p>The China National Medical Products Administration has approved a gene sequencing system (ultra-high-throughput sequencer DNBSEQ-T7), supporting analysis software and nucleic acid detection kits (
 <xref rid="tIII-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="table">Table III</xref>), which can identify and diagnose coronaviruses, including 2019-nCoV and other infectious respiratory pathogens and enable rapid detection of viral sequences (
 <xref rid="b22-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The DNBSEQ-T7 sequencer can complete the entire 2019-nCoV detection process (from sample extraction to result reporting) in 20 h. The sample detection throughput is 50-200 per cycle and each sample can obtain an average data output of &gt;100 M, ensuring highly accurate results for 2019-nCoV detection (
 <xref rid="b29-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). However, mNGS has the limitations of high equipment and testing costs, long detection cycles, complicated procedures and a lack of standardization. Furthermore, the sequencing depth of certain samples is not always appropriate (
