 <xref rid="b31-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). However, nanopore sequencing has not yet been approved by the China National Medical Products Administration. Hangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention completed the first 2019-nCoV genome assembly using only nanopore data on February 12, 2020(
 <xref rid="b32-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Final assembly results were 100% consistent with the reference genome without the correction of other sequencing technologies. The development of a real-time and rapid viral genome sequencing solution through nanopore sequencing is expected to become a powerful technology and resource support for combating viral epidemics worldwide (
