In the early stage of the epidemic, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified and analyzed the genome of 2019-nCoV based on second-generation sequencing metagenomics technology (mNGS) within five days and reported that the similarity between the nucleotide sequence of 2019-nCoV and SARS or bat-derived strains were 79 and 96%, respectively (
