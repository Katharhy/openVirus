<p>2019-nCov will continue to mutate during the transmission process. An analysis of 103 2019-nCov genomic data collected from a public database (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data;

If a mutation is located in the primer or probe binding site, the sensitivity and accuracy of existing RT-PCR detection kits will be affected. High-throughput sequencing technology can compensate for the limitations of RT-PCR, effectively increase positive rates and monitor possible mutations (

Furthermore, sequencing could simultaneously providing a more comprehensive pathogen genome analysis of critical illness and patients with complex infections, provide more information about infectious pathogens and identify drug resistance genes to guide clinical medication (
