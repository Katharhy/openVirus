<p>At present, RT-PCR nucleic acid detection serves an irreplaceable role in the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV and is the most important molecular diagnostic method in the early stage of the epidemic (

Additionally, recent research on patients infected with 2019-nCoV demonstrated that the positive rates of early stage nucleic acid detections of oropharyngeal swabs, anal swabs and blood were 53.3, 26.7 and 40%, respectively, while the positive rate of anal swabs was even higher than oral swabs in the late stage of infection (
