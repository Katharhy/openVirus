<p>A recently published study reported the latest clinical practice results at RenMin Hospital of Wuhan University in the first-line diagnosis and treatment of 2019-nCoV (
 <xref rid="b72-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). In that study, 19 patients with negative nucleic acid tests but with clinical symptoms and CT imaging features of COVID-19 were serologically tested. The results reported that 16 patients (84.21%) were positive for 2019-nCoV IgM antibodies and 18 patients (94.74%) were positive for 2019-nCoV IgG antibodies. The majority of the 2019-nCoV IgM and IgG antibody detection assays have high clinical specificity and clinical detection rates, and they should be used to confirm the status of nucleic acid detection negative samples. Furthermore, in terms of treatment monitoring and disease progression, the decline and disappearance of 2019-nCoV IgM concentration and the rise of 2019-nCoV IgG concentration indicated that patients gradually recovered and produced immunity to pathogenic 2019-nCoV.
