<p>Results from a study from the Wuhan Clinical Frontier demonstrated that the titers of virus-specific IgM and IgG in serum were often low or lower than the detection limit (

Among them, IgM positive rates increased from 50% (8/16) to 81% (13/16) and IgG-positive rates increased from 81% (13/16) to 100% (16/16) (

This indicated that, in the context of epidemiological history or clinical manifestations that meet diagnostic criteria, addition of immunoassays based on specific antigen-antibody responses effectively compensate for the limitations of high false-negative rated of nucleic acid detection and reduce false diagnoses. Epidemic prevention and control have a great auxiliary role and immunoassays may therefore be useful (
