<p>The advantage of 2019-nCoV antibody tests is that the sample source is flexible and serum, plasma and whole blood can be obtained, avoiding the limitation of the current nucleic acid tests which collect upper respiratory tract samples and exposes medical personnel to a high exposure risk (

However, China's State Drug Administration previously stated that, given the characteristics and current status of antigen/antibody detection reagents, its sensitivity and specificity are currently limited and cannot be used as the sole basis for diagnosis or exclusion of 2019-nCoV. Furthermore, it is not suitable for general population screening and can only be used as a supplement to existing viral nucleic acid detection assays (

In the first six editions of the ‘Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia’ issued by the National Health Commission of China, the use of protein testing products is recommended to be limited to supplementary detection indicators for suspected cases of negative nucleic acid testing or used in conjunction with nucleic acid testing for the diagnosis of suspected cases (

 <sup>th</sup> version of the guidelines, which were released on March 3, 2020, positive antibody tests have been included as one of the diagnostic indicators alongside positive nucleic acid tests (

Briefly, the future application of multiple molecular diagnostic methods of nucleic acids, antigens and antibodies will shorten detection windows and increase positive detection rates. Furthermore, it will serve a crucial role in the molecular diagnosis of 2019-nCoV in laboratories.
