<p>Considering the detection of highly infectious pathogens, including 2019-nCoV, must be performed in biosafety laboratories ranked Class II or above, inspectors must be fully prepared and cautious to maintain work efficiency. In the multi-country effort to combat the 2019-nCoV epidemic, multiple inspectors have been infected. Therefore, the development of a fully-automated, fully-enclosed, integrated detection system from sample extraction to signal amplification and detection is crucial to avoid high-frequency contact between the inspector and infectious samples. This is a crucial step in improving the ability to detect highly infectious pathogens.</p>
