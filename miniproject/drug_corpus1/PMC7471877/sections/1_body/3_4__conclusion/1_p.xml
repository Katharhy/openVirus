<p>2019-nCoV has numerous methods of transmission and is highly contagious, resulting in a large number of infections within a short time frame. The most effective way to prevent and control disease is early detection, diagnosis, isolation and treatment. Therefore, how to efficiently screen for positive patients with 2019-nCoV has become the primary task for epidemic prevention. Isolating the virus strain and determining the genomic sequence provides the basis for the development of diagnostic methods and vaccines. Domestic scientific research institutes and biomedical companies in China have developed various rapid 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> molecular diagnostic kits; however, the sensitivity, detection speed, price, ease of operation and safety varies between detection kits and there is still potential for improvement. Optimistically, the continuous development of various molecular diagnostic technologies will complement each other and improve the ability to quickly and accurately diagnose pathogens in public health emergencies, including in the 2019-nCoV epidemic.
