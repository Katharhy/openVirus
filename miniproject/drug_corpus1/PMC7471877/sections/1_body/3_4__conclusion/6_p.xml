<p>In the future, novel epidemics or pandemics may be inevitable. It is crucial that pandemic prevention agencies perform further research on pathogen differential diagnosis technology to improve testing times, provide definitive diagnoses and to differentially diagnose diseases with similar clinical manifestations. There are various types of pneumonia-related pathogens, including 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, mycoplasma and chlamydia. Considering RT-PCR results are time-consuming and laborious, there is an urgent need for medium-throughput detection technology for the differential diagnosis of 2019-nCoV and non-2019-nCoV conditions. In the future, it is necessary to focus on the development of high-throughput and low-cost differential diagnostic technologies. Furthermore, the development of detection technologies and supporting reagents that can simultaneously rapidly detect dozens of pathogens will be beneficial.</p>
