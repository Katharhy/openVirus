<p>In the future, the application of genomic technology for the detection of clinically critical and complex infections, particularly during outbreaks, need to be improved. This will aid in the early detection of epidemic pathogens, and early warnings of emergencies and emerging infectious diseases. In countries or regions where conditions permit, metagenomics detection technology capabilities should be enhanced (

The basis for diagnosis and differential diagnosis is to determine pathogen loads, identify drug-resistant genes and guide clinical medication. However, metagenomics technology still needs to be optimized by enriching pathogen target genes, shortening testing times, simplifying the testing process and reducing the cost of testing. Thus, metagenomics technology is due to become one of the routine clinical testing technologies.
