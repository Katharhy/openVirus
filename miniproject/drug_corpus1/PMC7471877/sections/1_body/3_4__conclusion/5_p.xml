<p>During the 2019-nCoV pandemic, numerous suspected cases and medical observers were required to perform repeated nucleic acid tests. However, detection throughput, biosafety requirements and the amount of professional inspectors are limited for RT-PCR. Numerous grass-roots hospitals cannot perform this molecular diagnosis, resulting in a large number of patients being unable to receive timely diagnosis. Therefore, it is essential to research and develop POCT technology and equipment for nucleic acids or proteins. In particular, POCT technology that employs ‘sample-in result-out’ should be utilized as early as possible. This would solve the difficulty of numerous primary medical institutions being unable to perform rapid molecular diagnosis.</p>
