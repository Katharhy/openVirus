<p>2019-nCoV is a novel virus that emerged following the SARS, Ebola, Zika, bird flu and swine flu viruses, and critically endangers public health and safety. 2019-nCoV has become a global pandemic within a short time frame. The current review reported that successful virus isolation can lead to improved molecular diagnostics and effective vaccines. Currently, there is no specific treatment method for patients with 2019-nCoV and, therefore, early diagnosis and isolation control are crucial.
