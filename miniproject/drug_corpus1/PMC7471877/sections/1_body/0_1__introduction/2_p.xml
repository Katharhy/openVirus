<p>2019-nCoV is a single stranded RNA, positive chain enveloped Î²-coronavirus (
 <xref rid="b9-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The viral particles are round or oval, often polymorphous, with a diameter of 60-140 nm (
 <xref rid="b1-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Its genomic characteristics are significantly different from SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (

 <xref rid="b10-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Current research has demonstrated 2019-nCoV has &gt;85% homology with bat SARS-like coronavirus (bat-SL-CoVZC45) (

 <sup>th</sup>, 2020), the genomic sequence of 2019-nCoV (NC_045512.2) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA with 29903 bp. Wu 
 <italic>et al</italic> (
 <xref rid="b11-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) reported that it has 14 open reading frames (Orfs) and encodes 27 proteins. 
 <italic>Orf1ab</italic> and 
 <italic>orf1a</italic> genes located at the 5'end of the genome encode pp1ab and pp1a proteins, respectively. The 3'end of the genome contains four structural proteins: Spike glycoprotein (S), small envelope protein (E), membrane glycoprotein (M), nucleocapsid protein (N) and accessory proteins (

 <xref rid="f1-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). S protein serves a key role in the recognition and binding of host cell surface receptors and mediates the fusion of viral envelopes and cell membranes (
 <xref rid="b12-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). M protein is involved in the formation and budding of the viral envelope. E protein binds to cell envelopes (
 <xref rid="b13-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). These three proteins are located on the phospholipid membrane of virus, which envelops viral RNA, maintaining the stability of genome and resisting the degradation of RNA enzymes in the human body (
