<p>In December 2019, a novel viral pneumonia case due to unknown causes was reported in Wuhan, China, with evidence of human-to-human transmission (

Those researchers stated that 2019-nCoV is different from SARS coronavirus and, therefore, the name SARS-CoV-2 is misleading and should have a different name. On March 2, the CSG published a naming statement for the novel coronavirus in Nature Microbiology, describing the naming method and process of the novel coronavirus and introducing common problems in virus classification (
