<p>Since the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia, the efficient and accurate laboratory diagnosis of 2019-nCoV is crucial for the effective prevention and control of the epidemic. Since March 3, 2020, three methods have been used for the diagnosis of novel coronavirus pneumonia: i) Detection of positive 2019-nCoV nucleic acids by RT-PCR; ii) viral gene sequencing to detect known 2019-nCoV sequences; and iii) the identification of positive 2019-nCoV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies in serum (

This is due to variety of factors, including poor sample quality, such as throat swabs and other respiratory samples, samples being collected too early or too late, samples not being properly preserved, transported and/or processed, the technology itself, which would be affected by virus mutation and PCR inhibition. Furthermore, it takes 6-8 h to complete the entire process. The test results need to be rechecked when the results from different areas are inconsistent or when doctors determine whether the patient is cured or discharged. Additionally, repeated verification experiments double testing times. Approval for antibody detection kits would markedly ease the pressure and risk of nucleic acid detection.
