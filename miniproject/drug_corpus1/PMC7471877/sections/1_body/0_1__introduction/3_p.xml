<p>Novel coronavirus pneumonia is a new infectious disease that humans are not immune to. This means people are generally susceptible to infection. Presently, the main source of infection occurs in patients with viral infections; however, asymptomatic infected individuals may also become the source of infection (

Although respiratory droplets and contact transmission are the main transmission routes of 2019-nCoV, viral particles have been detected in the stool of confirmed patients in several places, such as Beijing and Washington, suggesting that there is a risk of fecal-oral transmission (
