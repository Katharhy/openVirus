<p>According to previous reports, Apexbio-designed primer probes for Orf1ab and N sequence conserved regions of 2019-nCoV and developed a highly sensitive digital PCR new crown virus detection kit (

 <xref rid="b84-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>). Compared to qPCR, digital PCR is used for the absolute quantification of nucleic acid molecules. It can directly detect the copy number of the target sequence and the detection limit can reach a single copy (

 <xref rid="b86-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>). Furthermore, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, resolution and tolerance is higher (

 <xref rid="b86-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>). However, due to the high cost of equipment and tremendous workload, it is challenging to apply digital PCR to the initial stage of epidemic prevention and control, particularly in under-developed areas, on a large scale (

However, digital PCR will still be extremely useful as it allows for absolute quantification and the detection of complex background samples, it can track the progress of disease and analyzes the viral load. Additionally, digital PCR will enable the evaluation of drug efficacy (
