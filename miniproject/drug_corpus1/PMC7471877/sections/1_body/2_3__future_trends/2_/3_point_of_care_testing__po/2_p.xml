<p>POCT has the advantages of rapid results, unrestricted test sites and low professional skill requirements for operators (
 <xref rid="b89-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>). Therefore, the research and development of POCT nucleic acid detection technology is likely to be the general direction of future development of testing. Operators only need to add samples, such as swabs or blood, into the slot on ‘sample in-result out’ requirement, which will significantly simplify the detection process (
