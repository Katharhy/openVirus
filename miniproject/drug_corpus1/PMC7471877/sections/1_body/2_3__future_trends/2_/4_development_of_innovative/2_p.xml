<p>In response to the 2019-nCoV epidemic, the McGovern Institute for Brain Research of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced on February 14, 2020, that the team of Professor Feng Zhang, the inventor of SHERLOCK technology, used synthetic COVID-19 RNA to design two crRNA recognition specific sequences for S and Orf1ab (
