<p>For RT-PCR technology, nucleic acid extraction and processing affect the yield of viral nucleic acid for analysis (
 <xref rid="b80-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>). This can be more difficult when certain sample types are used, as throat swabs and sputum often contain only trace amounts of virus (
 <xref rid="b81-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). Efficient and fully automatic nucleic acid extraction equipment will provide better protection in terms of detection sensitivity and personnel safety (

 <sup>â„¢</sup> high-performance nucleic acid release system developed by Gene Company Ltd. is processed by Adaptive Focused can completely inactivate the virus in a very short time without affecting the quality of RNA extraction (
 <xref rid="b82-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>). Furthermore, the full release of the viral nucleic acid has the advantages of fast processing, efficient recovery, stability and reliability, which enables subsequent nucleic acid purification to obtain sufficient and high-quality viral RNA (
 <xref rid="b82-etm-0-0-09142" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>). It is the basis for improving detection sensitivity under existing conditions and can reduce inconclusive or false-negative results (
