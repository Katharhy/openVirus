<p id="p0040">In Iran, like many Muslim majority countries (MMCs) where alcohol consumption is prohibited, a low prevalence of alcohol use has been reported (

Instead, strategies have predominantly focused on palliative care and treating alcohol poisoning secondary to the consumption of bootleg methanol at individual levels. For example, Iran developed a national program on alcohol use (2013–2017) and integrated alcohol treatment units into the current illicit drug treatment programs (
