<p id="p0035">Mass methanol-poisoning outbreaks have been previously reported in Iran (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Hassanian-Moghaddam et al., 2015</xref>). However, a key feature of the recent mass poisoning amid the COVID-19 epidemic is the involvement of many provinces at the same time. For example, as of March 18, 2020 in Khuzestan, a province in southwest Iran, the total number of methanol-poisoning cases (n = 647) was almost 2-fold higher than the total confirmed number of COVID-19 cases (n = 359), with a slightly lower CFR – 9.12% vs. 12.53%. The same pattern was also observed in Ardabil, a province in northwest Iran (methanol poisoning: n = 200, CFR = 9.5%; vs. COVID-19: n = 213, CFR = 12.68%). Fars, a province in southwest Iran, reported 383 cases of methanol poisoning with CFR = 15.93%, compared to 386 total confirmed cases of COVID-19, with CFR = 3.37%. Reports from a referral hospital for poisoning and drug intoxications in Tehran, the capital, show a rise in the number of methanol-poisoning cases following the start of the COVID-19 epidemic (no numerical data reported). While 26 out of 31 provinces reported methanol poisoning,
