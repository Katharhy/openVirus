Given difficulties in the implementation, policymakers in Iran could consider the development and support of alcohol use-related public health models to better support public education and increase awareness (

Education policies do represent a key harm reduction strategy in response to alcohol use issues, without which the increased risks of morbidity and mortality associated with alcohol poisoning will continue. The increasing number of methanol-poisoning cases that have maximized pressures to the health system while trying to contain the COVID-19 epidemic is an example of the reasons why Iran could benefit from more prevention and mitigation services for alcohol use disorders. However, in addition to the development of national guidelines in managing mass methanol-poisoning outbreaks (
