In response to the rapid surge of the COVID-19 pandemic, Iran has applied several mitigation strategies, including the broader use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers. In Iran, alcohol became more available to people and more accessible for them to buy from drugstores, as justified for sanitization for COVID-19. However, disinformation has circulated, including that gargling or drinking alcohol can prevent COVID-19. Recognizing that alcohol use is banned in Iran, people are more likely to consume bootleg alcohols that may include higher levels of methanol. Thus, in parallel with the increased number of COVID-19 cases, an alarming number of methanol-poisoning cases, secondary to drinking bootleg alcohol containing methanol, has also been reported in Iran.
