<p>Bin-Reza et al. conducted a systemic review published in 2011 that was conducted between November 2009 and January 2011.

 </sup> This meta-analysis included 17 studies, which included published randomized control trials, quasi-experimental, and observational studies.

 </sup> This meta-analysis was unable to establish a conclusive relationship between the use of face masks and protection against influenza or other respiratory infections.

 </sup> However, Jefferson et al. conducted a systemic review that investigated how physical barriers, including the use of face masks, would interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses.

 </sup> The meta-analysis of 6 case-control studies investigated by Jefferson et al. showed that surgical masks and N95 masks were highly effective in preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-1. The intervention effectiveness (odd ratio-1) for frequent handwashing (&gt;10 times daily), wearing a mask, wearing an N95 mask, wearing gloves, wearing a gown, and handwashing, mask, gloves, and gown combined was 55, 68, 91, 57, 77, and 91%, respectively.

 </sup> The study concluded that, while the implementation of physical barriers could be difficult, these barriers, including face masks, can be useful in reducing the spread of respiratory infections in the general population.
