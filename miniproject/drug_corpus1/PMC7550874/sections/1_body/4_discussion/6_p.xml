<p>While there is a debate about the evidence that face masks can provide adequate protection in the broad community, face masks are widely used in medical settings by health-care professionals during a wide range of medical procedures and practices, including as a precaution when providing care to patients with respiratory infections. As both N95 and surgical masks are used by health-care personnel for protection against airborne diseases such as SARS-CoV-1 and the influenza virus, it is reasonable to think that these masks would protect the general population worldwide. However, the public would need to be trained about the correct way of putting on, wearing, removing, and disposing of face masks for this to be effective. Social media may be useful in obtaining the level of knowledge for the general population. Face masks would have to be used in conjunction with other preventative measures such as social distancing and regular hand washing for it to be effective. However, as cloth masks can be used as a last resort, the use of cloth masks in the general population would provide an extra layer of protection while conserving the stocks of N95 and surgical masks for health-care workers and persons diagnosed with COVID-19.</p>
