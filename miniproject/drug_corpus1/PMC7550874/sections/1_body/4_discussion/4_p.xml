<p>Davies et al. conducted a study that examined homemade masks as an alternative to commercial face masks. In this study, the researchers used 21 healthy volunteers to compare the efficacy of homemade masks made from cotton, surgical masks, and no masks on their capacity to block bacterial and viral aerosols.

 </sup> Results showed that surgical masks were 3 times more effective in preventing microorganisms than homemade masks and that 100% of the cotton was the best material to use for homemade masks. The study concluded that homemade cloth masks should only be considered as a last resort to prevent droplet transmission from infected individuals. Still, homemade cloth masks were better than no protection. Davies et. al recommended the use of medical masks rather than homemade cloth masks as a method of reducing transmission of infection from aerosols.
