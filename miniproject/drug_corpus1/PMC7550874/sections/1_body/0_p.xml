 </sup> Over the past 20 years, there have been several viral epidemics, including severe acute respiratory syndrome - coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 to 2003, H1N1 influenza in 2009, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012.

 </sup> In December 2019, an unknown disease characterized by pneumonia occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. On January 7, 2020, a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the causative agent for the cluster of respiratory illnesses (coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19), which were present in Wuhan.

 </sup> Face masks have been commonly seen, especially in Asian countries, during the outbreaks of other viral epidemics. In China, some provinces and municipalities have enforced compulsory mask-wearing in public. However, Chinaâ€™s national guidelines have recommended a risk-based approach for mask-wearing among health-care workers and the general public.
