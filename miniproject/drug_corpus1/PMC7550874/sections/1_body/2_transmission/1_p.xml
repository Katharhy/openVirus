<p>The primary source of infection remains unknown, but human to human transmission was observed early after the emergence of COVID-19. Genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 showed a phylogenetical relationship to several severe acute respiratory syndrome-like (SARS-like) viruses. These data suggest that bats could be the possible primary reservoir, while the intermediate host and method of transfer to humans remain unknown. The transmission of COVID-19 is human to human, and symptomatic people are the most frequent source of spread. The most common symptoms at the onset of COVID-19 are fever, cough, and fatigue.
