<p>Data suggest that presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals can also spread the virus. Like other respiratory pathogens, the transmission of COVID-19 occurs through aerosol droplets from coughing and sneezing.

 </sup> The incubation period for the virus is generally within 3 to 7 days but could be as long as 14 days.

 </sup> Also, the R
 <sub>0</sub> seems now to be quite different from what it has been calculated originally (2.2-2.7). The primary reproductive number, R
 <sub>0</sub>, relies on the exponential growth rate of an outbreak, as well as additional factors, such as the latent period and the infectious period. Most recently, Sanche et al. found R
 <sub>0</sub> is likely to be 5.7 with a broad 95% CI (3.8-8.9).

 </sup> This value may better explain the pandemic spread than a R
 <sub>0</sub> of approximately 2.5.
