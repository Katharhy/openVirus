<p>Preventative measures in the community are essential to stopping the spread of COVID-19. The most effective preventive measures are washing hands with soap and water. Also, the preventive measures include the use of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, avoidance of touching eyes, nose, or mouth, proper coughing or sneezing into a tissue or a bent elbow, wearing a mask with respiratory symptoms, and maintaining social distancing of at least 6 feet (2 meters).

 </sup> The initial recommendation by the WHO was that only people who are sick and show symptoms and persons who are caring for people who are suspected of having COVID-19 should wear masks.

 </sup> However, the recommendations about the use of a face mask for the public varies among countries. Masks used by the general public include cloth masks, dust masks, surgical masks, and N95 masks. In reviewing the chronologic deployment of the COVID-19 pandemic, there seems to be a certain degree of ambiguities in statements. In economics, uncertainty, and a decision-maker response to it, can be modeled formally in the context of a general decision model.

 </sup> Both ambiguity and ambiguity attitudes may harbor a very detrimental effect on several countries with delays of prompt action. The most recent recommendations by the CDC is that cloth face coverings should be used in public settings where social distancing measures are challenging to maintain.

 </sup> The CDC advises that the use of cloth face coverings would slow rather than stop the transmission of the virus as they are not as effective as surgical masks or N95 masks. Surgical masks and N95 masks are considered critical supplies, and the CDC advises that they should be reserved for use by health-care workers who are at a higher risk.
