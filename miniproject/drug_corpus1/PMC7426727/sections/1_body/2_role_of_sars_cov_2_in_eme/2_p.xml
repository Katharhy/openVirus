<p id="p0060">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the zoonotic virus most closely associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). There are strong misconceptions about the role played by SARS-CoV-2 in the emergence of COVID-19, especially the severity of COVID-19 in selected demographic groups. These misconceptions result in treatments focused on virology without any consideration of toxicology: containing/attenuating SARS-CoV-2 exposure/viral loads rather than intrinsically strengthening the immune system. These virology-based actions do not address the underlying toxicology-based problems that must be addressed properly in order to decrease human vulnerability to infectious diseases, including COVID-19. Short-term, reactive virology-based measures (e.g., quarantines, repurposed drugs, etc.) are required to contain the present SARS-CoV-2 outbreak (

However, the long-term, proactive toxicology-based measures required to intrinsically strengthen the immune system and prevent such future outbreaks have not been addressed. This article attempts to clarify these misconceptions and to propose strategic approaches aimed at intrinsically strengthening the immune system. If such a strategy had been followed consistently in the past, it could have prevented/minimized the incidence and outcome of COVID-19. Still, this strategy is essential to prevent/minimize the adverse effects of the inevitable future pandemics.
