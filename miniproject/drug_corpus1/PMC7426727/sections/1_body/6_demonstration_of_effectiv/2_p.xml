<p id="p0175">It is clear from the SARS results and the present COVID-19 results that exposure to the coronavirus for most people (except the relatively small number in the most vulnerable demographic) results in relatively mild symptoms (or, in many cases, no symptoms). In other words, the vast majority of the public is metaphorically being protected presently by an extremely effective “quasi-vaccine”; namely, following practices that, while they certainly degrade the immune system to some extent because of exposure to toxic stressors, do not degrade the immune system excessively. Promoting healthy lifestyle habits (including healthy diet, regular aerobic exercise, and appropriate responses to adverse life events) and an ambitious regulation of toxic stressors (chemicals, radiations, etc.) are cornerstones to reducing the risk of developing most chronic diseases. These healthy habits represent a “quasi-vaccine” as they are capable of eliminating those factors that contribute to degrading the immune system and adding those factors that contribute to strengthening the immune system. For most of the public, this “quasi-vaccine” has proven to be effective, and further elimination of immune-degrading contributing factors will improve the immune system further and afford even greater protection from infectious diseases.</p>
