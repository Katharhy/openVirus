<p id="p0190">The underlying causes of the present pandemic have been both misrepresented and camouflaged. Causes that are mainly toxicology-based have been ignored relative to virology-based causes. This has resulted in treatments and ‘protective’ measures that address virology issues to the exclusion of toxicology issues, are of questionable effectiveness, and do little (if anything) to prevent future pandemics. They have produced disastrous effects on the global economy that have worsened social and economic conditions of many people and contributed to a deterioration of their physical and mental health. To correct this situation, and offer intrinsic protection against future pandemics, both tactical/reactive responses to survive the immediate threat and strategic/proactive responses to prevent the problem and damage from re-occurring are required.</p>
