<p>Altogether in this consensus-based document we describe the effects of epidemic and pandemic viral infections (SARS, MERS, influenza A (H1N1)pdm/09, HIV and COVID-19) and the interactions with TB and the lung; the majority of these diseases are droplet-borne. The diagnostic tools range from nucleic acid detection and molecular techniques to immunoassays and traditional cultures for 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Core management issues were discussed, including drugs, DDIs, novel therapies, and principles of infection control and workplace safety. COVID-19 and TB interactions were discussed in-depth based on the scant information available so far, which requires broad and in-depth research into the subject. New approaches to clinical management and country responses specifically to COVID-19 were elaborated by the expert panel, as well as opportunities and lessons for future responses.
