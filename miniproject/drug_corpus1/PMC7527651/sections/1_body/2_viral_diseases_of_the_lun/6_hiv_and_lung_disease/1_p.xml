<p>The spectrum of HIV-associated pulmonary diseases is broad and the lungs are one of the most frequently affected organ systems in HIV-infected persons regardless of age [
 <xref rid="C101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. The absolute CD4 T-cell count, used as a surrogate marker of immunodeficiency, is important in guiding the aetiological evaluation of lung infections [
 <xref rid="C102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Pulmonary TB infection and reactivation are more likely with a CD4 count below 500 cells·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. Opportunistic infections, 
 <italic>Pneumocystis jirovecii</italic>, bacterial infections, Kaposi sarcoma and extrapulmonary/disseminated forms of TB occur mainly in patients with CD4 T-cell counts below 200 cells·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. Cytomegalovirus infection, 
 <italic>Mycobacterium avium</italic> complex and aspergillosis usually occur at CD4 counts below 50 cells·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. Risk factors to consider are the geographical origin that predisposes to specific disease (
 <italic>e.g.</italic> TB, coccidioidomycosis, paragonimiasis and histoplasmosis), adherence to antiretroviral therapy, prescription of 
 <italic>P. jirovecii</italic> prophylaxis and presence of comorbidities. Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia occurs at all stages of HIV infection, but is more frequent in patients with profound CD4 T-cell depletion and decreases with antiretroviral therapy. Community-acquired pneumonia accounts for 35–50% of all hospital admission cases due to respiratory failure and is the main reason for ICU admission [
