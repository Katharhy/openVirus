<p>Viral respiratory infections are a major public health concern due to the capacity of viruses to spread from person to person directly 
 <italic>via</italic> aerosols/droplet nuclei, small droplets or virus-laden secretions from larger droplets, or indirectly by contact with contaminated surfaces [
 <xref rid="C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Large respiratory droplets are generated primarily during coughing, sneezing and talking, and during procedures such as suctioning and bronchoscopy, which can also generate droplet nuclei. Transmission occurs when droplets containing microorganisms from an infected person are expelled a short distance through the air and deposited on another individual's conjunctivae, nasal mucosa or mouth. Large droplets fall quickly onto surfaces close to the infected person, increasing the risk of contact transmission. Moreover, viral infections can also be transmitted 
 <italic>via</italic> aerosol particles of small size (&lt;5–10 µm) which may be infectious at a distance of several metres [

 <xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], being detected for several hours on different surfaces [
