<p>T-cells contribute to the generation of the B-cell response and cell-mediated immunity leading to viral clearance. In particular, B-cells produce antibodies that may neutralise the respiratory viruses directly by binding to viral surface proteins or activating the complement cascade (

 <xref rid="C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. T-follicular helper cells, a specialised subset of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T-cells, play a critical role in protective immunity helping B-cells produce antibodies against foreign pathogens [

 <sup>+</sup>-specific T-cells with cytolytic activity. The protective antiviral T-cell response is a T-helper cell type 1 (Th1) response mainly mediated through interferon (IFN)-γ production [

 <xref rid="C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Moreover, to prevent lung tissue damage, all these responses are finely modulated; regulatory mechanisms adopted by T-cells such as cytokine secretion, upregulation of inhibitory receptors [
 <xref rid="C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] or expansion of the T-regulatory cell subset lead to a balance between tissue damage and clearance of the virus. The immune systems of neonates, infants, children and adults are different, both in their composition and functional responsiveness to infectious diseases [
