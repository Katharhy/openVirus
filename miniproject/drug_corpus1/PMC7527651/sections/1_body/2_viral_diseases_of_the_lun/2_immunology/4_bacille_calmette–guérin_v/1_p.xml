<p>Bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG), the current vaccine against TB, has important protective effects against other infections. In randomised trials, BCG reduced infant mortality by around 40% [
 <xref rid="C49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and respiratory infections other than TB by 70% in adolescents [
 <xref rid="C50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. These “nonspecific effects” of BCG vaccination are explained by epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of innate immune cells, a process termed “trained immunity” [
 <xref rid="C51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Clinical evidence suggests that BCG may protect against viruses [
 <xref rid="C52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], and BCG-vaccinated healthy adults re-challenged with live yellow fever vaccine showed improved antiviral immunity and decreased viral loads [
 <xref rid="C53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In mice, BCG vaccination protects against influenza A, lowering viral replication and lung injury [
