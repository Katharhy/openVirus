<p>A recent ecological analysis suggested that BCG vaccination may also protect against COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="C56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Countries without universal policies of BCG vaccination (
 <italic>e.g.</italic> Italy, the Netherlands and the USA) seem more severely affected by COVID-19 compared with countries with universal BCG policies. However, such ecological studies that relate country aggregate and individual data should be interpreted with caution. Also, COVID-19 has shown a recent increase since publication of the analysis [
 <xref rid="C56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] in low- and middle-income countries and may still be underreported, confounders such as age were not taken into account, and variable BCG policies over time affect individual BCG coverage [
 <xref rid="C57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="C59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Several large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) currently evaluating the effect of BCG vaccination against COVID-19 in thousands of healthcare workers and elderly, in the Netherlands, Australia and other countries, will provide evidence to support or refute BCG as a cheap and rapidly scalable preventive measure against COVID-19 and other viral respiratory infections.
