<p>Regarding the response to 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, after mycobacterial dissemination to the lymph nodes, dendritic cells present bacterial antigens to T-cells and prime them [
 <xref rid="C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Priming occurs around 10 days post-infection in the mediastinal lymph nodes, and is followed by generation of effector T-cells [
 <xref rid="C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and Th1 CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T-cells that lead to the formation of granulomas. Granulomas are organised structures where T-cells and B-cells surround innate immune cells (macrophages and neutrophils) with a fibrotic capsule to generate a hypoxic environment to prevent 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> growth [
 <xref rid="C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], with hypoxia potentially worsening tissue destruction in TB [
 <xref rid="C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. CD4 Th1 host responses are crucial [
 <xref rid="C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], especially at the beginning for TB control [
 <xref rid="C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Regarding the CD8 T-cell component, mouse studies have revealed a relatively smaller role of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cells in protection against 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection [
 <xref rid="C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and an even smaller contribution of B-cells and humoral immunity [
 <xref rid="C38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Differently, in human studies, 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-specific CD8 T-cells have been associated with active TB [
 <xref rid="C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>–
 <xref rid="C44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], both in HIV-uninfected and -infected patients [
 <xref rid="C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="C42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="C45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and in response to recent infections [
 <xref rid="C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="C44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Increased CD8 T-cell response is associated with 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> load and longitudinal studies have shown a decrease of this CD8 T-cell response during anti-TB treatment [
 <xref rid="C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. It has been shown that the cells are differently modulated over the course of TB disease, suggesting a role in TB pathogenesis that is not yet fully elucidated [
 <xref rid="C46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>–
 <xref rid="C48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].
