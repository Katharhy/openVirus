<p>The 21st century has been marked by major epidemics, including some that qualify as pandemics, caused by old diseases such as cholera, plague and yellow fever, as well as emerging diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Ebola, Zika, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), HIV (although technically endemic), influenza A (H1N1)pdm/09 and most recently COVID-19. Several of these viruses affect the lung. Tuberculosis (TB) remains the top infectious disease killer caused by a single organism and was responsible for 1.5 million deaths in 2018 [

This consensus-based document describes the effects of the main viral epidemics which predominately affect the lungs or cause systemic immunosuppression (MERS, SARS, HIV, influenza A(H1N1)pdm/09 and COVID-19) and their interactions with TB at a diagnostic, treatment and public health level. The document is the fruit of a collaborative project involving the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control Public Health Emergency (ECDC PHE) team, the World Association for Infectious Diseases and Immunological Disorders (WAidid), the Global Tuberculosis Network (GTN), and members of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) Study Group for Mycobacterial Infections (ESGMYC).
