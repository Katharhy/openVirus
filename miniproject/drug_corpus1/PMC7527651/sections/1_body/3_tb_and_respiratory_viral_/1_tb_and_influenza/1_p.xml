<p>The association of TB and influenza could be bidirectional: TB may increase the susceptibility to influenza and the risk of complications, and influenza may increase the susceptibility to TB. The susceptibility to influenza appears to be greater in patients with pre-existing pulmonary disease (
 <italic>e.g.</italic> asthma and COPD). As a large proportion of post-TB treatment patients have long-term functional impairment, mainly COPD, which can be severe [

 <xref rid="C105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>], patients with such pulmonary sequelae may be predisposed and more susceptible to influenza infection and its complications, including mortality [
