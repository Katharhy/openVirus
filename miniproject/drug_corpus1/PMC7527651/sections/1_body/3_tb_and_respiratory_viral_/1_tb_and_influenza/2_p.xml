<p>As early as 1919, the occurrence of TB among patients surviving influenza or pneumonia, but without clear distinction between both diseases, was reported [
 <xref rid="C109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Influenza induces a temporary increase in the susceptibility to bacterial infections, exemplified by the frequent occurrence of bacterial pneumonia following viral pneumonitis [
 <xref rid="C110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Because influenza impairs the immune response, it may be expected that influenza could also promote the development of active TB among patients with latent TB infection (LTBI) [
 <xref rid="C111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]; however, the occurrence of TB may occur much later than the occurrence of influenza, thus making the temporal association difficult to demonstrate. There was an excess mortality from pulmonary TB during the influenza pandemics of 1889 and 1918 in Switzerland [
 <xref rid="C112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. It has also been reported that summer influenza epidemics in Wuhan, China, may have contributed to the increase in reported TB cases [
 <xref rid="C113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Conversely, a report from Thailand did not demonstrate a worse outcome for patients with concurrent influenza and TB [
 <xref rid="C114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>], and another report from Indonesia did not demonstrate a correlation between antibodies against influenza and the presence of TB, but there was an association between the level of antibody titres against influenza virus and the stage of TB [
 <xref rid="C115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. Interestingly, influenza vaccination was reported to be a protective factor against TB in elderly persons in Taiwan [
 <xref rid="C116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. The exact impact of concurrent influenza and TB remains uncertain.
