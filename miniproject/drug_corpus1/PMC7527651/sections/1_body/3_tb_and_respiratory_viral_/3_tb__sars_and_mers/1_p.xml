<p>TB co-infection with SARS is rare. A study of 83 patients with SARS found three patients with TB co-infection, where one patient with SARS subsequently developed TB, while the other two had TB and then developed SARS [
 <xref rid="C122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. All three patients were on steroid therapy, which may have decreased viral- and/or TB-specific immunity and increased the risk of co-infection. In a different cohort of 236 SARS patients, two were diagnosed with pulmonary TB [

 <sup>+</sup> T-cells are crucial for TB-specific immunity [

 <xref rid="C129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. Lastly, one TB patient developed SARS co-infection because of a wrong admission to a cohort of SARS patients [
 <xref rid="C130" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. This highlights the importance of remaining vigilant to other communicable diseases, including TB, when epidemic or pandemic infections dominate media headlines [
