<p>There may be interaction between COVID-19 and TB [
 <xref rid="C133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>], but long-term observations are lacking [
 <xref rid="C134" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. Only two studies have investigated the interactions so far. In the first ever cohort of 49 patients from eight countries, COVID-19 was diagnosed before, simultaneously or after TB [
 <xref rid="C135" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. In the second study including 69 patients, mortality was investigated [
 <xref rid="C136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. In a separate anecdotal report, L
 <sc>iu</sc>
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="C133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>] reported an increased prevalence of LTBI in patients with severe COVID-19 infection and concluded that infection with 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> may influence the progression and outcome of COVID-19. Evidence on the interactions between TB and COVID-19 is needed.
