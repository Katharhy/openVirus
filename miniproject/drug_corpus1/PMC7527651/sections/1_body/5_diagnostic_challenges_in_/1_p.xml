<p>For prompt diagnosis of viruses causing severe acute respiratory infections [
 <xref rid="C148" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>], such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="C149" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="C152" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>], and differentiation from other common bacterial infections, a strategic laboratory approach is needed. This approach requires integrating conventional virology assays, molecular platforms combining nucleic acid extraction and PCR or real-time PCR, and rapid molecular tests (RDTs) used in point-of-care minilabs (
 <xref rid="TB1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Positive results using single or multiplex RDTs may lead to adequate cohorting and management of infected patients [
 <xref rid="C153" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. Negative results are often less conclusive because of a lack of sensitivity and nonstandardised collection of specimens. Using metagenomic next-generation sequencing, pathogens not included in the tests can be detected including both known and novel viruses. Genomic data provides information on virulence genes [
 <xref rid="C154" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>], resistance mutations and clusters using phylogenetic approaches [
 <xref rid="C155" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>, 
 <xref rid="C156" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. Specific antibody detection remains useful for seroprevalence studies in selected populations and in vaccine studies. The recurrence of old pathogens and emergence of new pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 underlines the importance of worldwide virus surveillance systems [
 <xref rid="C157" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>]. For this purpose, developing protein microarrays to respiratory virus serology is useful [
 <xref rid="C153" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>].
