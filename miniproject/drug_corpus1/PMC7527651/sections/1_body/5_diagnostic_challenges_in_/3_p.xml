<p>The massive use of molecular assays to diagnose COVID-19 introduced similar molecular platforms that could be used for detecting pathogens in respiratory specimens. The challenge lies in sample processing and RNA/DNA extraction protocols rather than cross-reactivity resulting in false-positive results. This is an opportunity to strengthen the diagnostic potential of microbiological laboratories, producing an invaluable asset to improve diagnosis against other infections including TB. At the same time, the expertise, tools and networks developed for TB diagnosis could aid the rapid implementation of molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 and other viral infections. Tests (lateral flow assay and ELISA based) to rapidly detect antigens in swabs or respiratory secretions and to determine serological evidence of recent and past infection and evidence of neutralising antibodies are currently being evaluated.</p>
