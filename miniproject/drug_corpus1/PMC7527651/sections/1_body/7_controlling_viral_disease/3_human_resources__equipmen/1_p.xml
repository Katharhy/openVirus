<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is, first and foremost, a health crisis [
 <xref rid="C208" ref-type="bibr">208</xref>]. However, it is rapidly also becoming an economic crisis. In a vicious circle, the reduction in economic activities reduces money circulation, tax revenues and finances available for establishing the public health countermeasures needed to control the pandemic. At the same time, social protection measures to ensure a minimum salary to the many workers who cannot be supported by their employers increases the financial constraints at the government level. The poverty generated by the economic crisis is likely to have medium- and long-term consequences, particularly in resource-limited countries, with increases in malnutrition and poverty-related diseases, which include TB.
