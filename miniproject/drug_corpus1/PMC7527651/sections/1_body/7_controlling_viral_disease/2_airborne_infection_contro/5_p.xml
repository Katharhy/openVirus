<p>SARS-CoV-2 is inactivated by common disinfection measures such as 5 min contact with household bleach [
 <xref rid="C201" ref-type="bibr">201</xref>]. The following disinfectants kill the virus: ice-cold acetone (90 s), ice-cold acetone/methanol mixture (40/60, 10 min), 70% ethanol (10 min), 100% ethanol (5 min), paraformaldehyde (2 min) and glutaraldehyde (2 min). Commonly used brands of hand disinfectants also inactivate SARS-CoV (30 s) [
 <xref rid="C202" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>]. The ECDC guidance on disinfection of environments in healthcare and nonhealthcare settings potentially contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 recommends products with virucidal activity licensed in the national markets or 0.05% sodium hypochlorite (dilution 1/100, if household bleach is used, which is usually at an initial concentration of 5%). For surfaces that can be damaged by sodium hypochlorite, products based on ethanol of at least 70% can be used [

 <xref rid="C202" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>] and UV radiation (60 min) [
