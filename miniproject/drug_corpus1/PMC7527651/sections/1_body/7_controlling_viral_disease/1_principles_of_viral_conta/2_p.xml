<p>Infection control refers to the different methods and strategies deployed to reduce or prevent the incidence and/or transmission of infections (see the following subsection on “Airborne infection control and workplace safety”). Containment, through early detection, investigation and reporting of cases, together with contact tracing with self-isolation, aims at containing, preventing or delaying the spread of the disease in the community. Geographical containment in a defined area relies on measures to restrict the virus spreading beyond the “containment zone” or “cordon sanitaire”, including pharmacological and public health interventions such as intensified surveillance and laboratory testing, movement restrictions in and out of the containment zone, and monitoring the area immediately surrounding the containment zone (buffer zone) for secondary infections [
