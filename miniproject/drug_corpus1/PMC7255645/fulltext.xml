Human immunodeficiency virus-infected MSM show high HIV-1 burdens and substantial clustering of infections within transmission networks [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The MSM population has become one of the major risk groups for HIV-1 infection in China where there are approximately 20 million MSM. For Chinese MSM, the prevalence of HIV-1 infection has rapidly increased from 0.9% in 2003 to 7.8% in 2016, and, notably, 27.6% of the 124 000 newly diagnosed HIV-1 infections in 2016 were attributed to MSM transmission [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Due to social isolation, discrimination, and verbal or physical abuse, some MSM may not disclose their sexual orientation [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which in turn may put them at particularly high risk for HIV-1 transmission because of their identity of nondisclosed MSM and the lack of HIV-1 prevention services that are usually available to MSM. Furthermore, it is difficult to characterize HIV-1 transmission in nondisclosers through traditional &#x0201c;shoe-leather&#x0201d; epidemiologic reviews. Hence, it is critical to identify the specific group of MSM who do not disclose their homosexual orientation and better understand their needs for HIV-1 prevention.</p><p>In 2018, Ragonnet-Cronin et al [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] reported self-reported heterosexual men who clustered only with MSM and with no women as potential nondisclosed MSM. They adapted time-resolved phylogenetic analysis of HIV-1 sequences to create transmission networks and found that 18.6% of all clustered heterosexual men were actually nondisclosed MSM in the United Kingdom (UK). In addition, they found that nondisclosed MSM were more likely to link MSM and heterosexual women, and they might increase the risk of HIV-1 infection in their female partners. This group of nondisclosed MSM was only revealed in the UK since 2014 and has not yet been fully investigated [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In LMICs, few research studies on MSM sexual orientation disclosure have been reported. A cross-sectional survey in China found that more than 80% MSM did not disclose their sexual orientation to healthcare professionals [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the UK, nondisclosed MSM are more likely to be in peripheral position in the transmission networks. They usually chose nondisclosed MSM as sexual partners and might exhibit lower-risk sexual behavior than MSM [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, the characteristics of nondisclosed MSM and their role in HIV-1 transmission remain to be elucidated in other countries.</p><p>In this study, we adapted HIV TRAnsmission Cluster Engine (HIV-TRACE), a recently developed tool for rapid and automated characterization of transmission networks from large sets of HIV-1 genetic sequences [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and used HIV-1 sequence data from HIV-positive subjects diagnosed in Guangzhou city between 2008 and 2015, to locate nondisclosed MSM in HIV-1 transmission network and to explore their characteristics and potential role in HIV-1 epidemics.</p><sec sec-type="materials" id="s1"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Study Design</title><p>The study included 3079 HIV-1 <italic>pol</italic> sequences (HXB2 position 2253&#x02013;3821) obtained from 3684 HIV-positive subjects who were diagnosed and claimed to be infected through heterosexual transmission (HET), MSM, or intravenous drug users (IDUs) from 2008 to 2015 in Guangzhou, China. Demographic characteristics (age, gender, marital status, and education) and risk groups (HET, MSM, or IDUs) of HIV-1 infection were extracted from the electronic follow-up records at Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Guangzhou CDC). Sequences were aligned with the representative sequences of HIV-1 group M subtypes and circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) obtained from the Los Alamos database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hiv.lanl.gov">http://www.hiv.lanl.gov</ext-link>) using MAFFT [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The HIV-1 subtypes were determined by the phylogenetic tree constructed by IQ-TREE 1.6.9 [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] using an ultrafast bootstrap with 1000 replicates, as well as the Shimodaira&#x02013;Hasegawa approximate likelihood-ratio test (SH-aLRT) with 1000 replicates. Human immunodeficiency virus-1 CRF genotyping was done by using the RIP online subtyping tool [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The HIV-1 <italic>pol</italic> sequences described here are available under the following GenBank accession numbers: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="MN424584">MN424584</ext-link>&#x02013;<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="MN427369">427369</ext-link>.</p><p>In addition, a background sequence dataset of HIV-1 subtype B, CRF01_AE, CRF07_BC, and CRF55_01B was compiled using HIV BLAST from the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) database (June 2019). To limit the size of alignments, the 10 most similar reference sequences for each Guangzhou sequence were selected. Sequences with no information of gender or risk groups of HIV-1 infection were excluded.</p><p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Guangzhou CDC (No. 2017030). Written inform consent was obtained from the participants.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Transmission Network Analysis</title><p>The Tamura-Nei 93 nucleotide substitution model was used to calculate pairwise genetic distance for all the sequences analyzed. The Transmission network was constructed using HIV-TRACE with a threshold of pairwise genetic distance of 0.5%, which is more appropriate for identifying rapidly growing clusters [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In brief, each sequence is represented by a node in the network, and nodes are linked together if their pairwise genetic distance is 0.5% or less. Network centrality was measured by using NetworkAnalyzer 2.7 implemented in Cytoscape 3.7.0 [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and network assortativity was calculated by using NetworkX 1.9.1. package in Python 3.7.3.</p><p>The position within the transmission networks was determined based on centrality measurements including average shortest path length, closeness centrality, radiality, and degree to quantify how important a node is in viral transmission. Among them, the average shortest path length represents the distance between 2 connected nodes [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Closeness centrality usually measures the speed that the virus spreads from a given node to other reachable nodes in the network and is defined as the reciprocal of the average shortest path length of a node [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Radiality, a node centrality index, is obtained by subtracting the average shortest path length of a node from the diameter of the connected component plus 1 [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Another measurement of the contribution of transmission within a network is the number of edges linked to a node, also called the node degree [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Network assortativity was adapted to determine the transmission links, ie, whether nondisclosed MSM link to each other rather than MSM in the clusters. The value of assortativity ranges from &#x02212;1 to 1, which means completely disassortative and definitely assortative, respectively [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>To reduce the possible bias due to the size of the clusters, we also calculated the centrality indicators after removing the clusters of n = 2 and conducted centrality analysis among the group with an equal number of inferred nondisclosed MSM and MSM, in which MSM were randomly chosen to match the number of nondisclosed MSM.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>We used a multivariate logistic regression model with the outcome being either clustered in the network (1) or not (0). Age, gender, marital status, education level, risk group of HIV-1 infection, and HIV-1 subtype or genotype were included as predictor variables. The difference between nondisclosed MSM and MSM was determined by using 2-sample <italic>t</italic> test and Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test in IBM SPSS Statistics 25. In addition, a logistic regression model was adapted to predict the variables associated with the outcome being inferred as nondisclosed MSM. The independent role of individual factor was evaluated by using univariate logistic regression followed by the evaluation of the interaction of these factors in the multivariate logistic regression. The factors with <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; .1 were removed from the multivariate model by using backward stepwise analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s6"><title>Characteristics of Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 Sequences Analyzed</title><p>A total of 3079 HIV-1 <italic>pol</italic> sequences were obtained from 3684 HIV-positive people who were diagnosed in Guangzhou between 2008 and 2015.

These sequences formed 221 clusters and their sizes ranged from 2 to 88 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).

However, no significant difference was found regarding marital status and education levels between nondisclosed MSM and self-reported non-MSM.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s10"><title>Discussion</title><p>We inferred approximately 10% of self-reported non-MSM as nondisclosed MSM in Guangzhou, China and their central position in HIV-1 transmission networks. Unlike the peripheral position of nondisclosed MSM that have been reported in the UK [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], we found that nondisclosed MSM in China were more likely to be in the central position, indicating their important role and relatively great contribution of HIV-1 transmission. However, the position within the transmission clusters could also be related to the timing of HIV-1 infection. Unfortunately, the influence of the timing of infection was not evaluated due to the lack of the information. Our preliminary results and previous study indicate that nondisclosed MSM should be considered as a specific target group with high risk in HIV-1 transmission and epidemics.</p><p>In our study, 28.36% of the Guangzhou sequences linked with at least 1 other sequence at a pairwise genetic distance of &#x02264;0.5% and were included in the transmission clusters. Our results are in line with the findings in the UK where 28.8% of the patient sequences were included in the resulting networks by using a cutoff value of 5 years to most recent common ancestor sequences [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. We must emphasize that 9.92% of self-reported non-MSM were inferred to be nondisclosed MSM in Guangzhou. This tends to be a relatively conservative estimation because we chose a relatively small pairwise genetic distance of 0.5%, given the rapidly spreading HIV-1 among MSM. Ragonnet-Cronin et al [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] identified 18.6% of all clustered heterosexual men in the networks to be nondisclosed MSM in the UK. In another study, Hu&#x000e9; et al [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] reported that up to 21% of black African men who report only heterosexual behavior became infected through sex with men in the UK. These results suggested that the actual proportion of nondisclosed MSM may be underestimated and should be further investigated in China.</p><p>Compared with MSM with whom they clustered, nondisclosed MSM were more likely to be older, married, and less educated. Our results are consistent with earlier findings that low rates of MSM sexual orientation disclosure in China may be associated with limited access to MSM services, insufficient social and psychological support, and social discrimination [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We also found that among the self-reported non-MSM, infection with HIV-1 CRF55_01B or through HET rather than IDU showed a greater likelihood of being inferred as nondisclosed MSM. These results suggest that nondisclosed MSM in Guangzhou are actually bisexual and have both male and female sex partners, which in turn may increase the risk of their sex partners to infect HIV-1. The similar study conducted in the UK also supports that nondisclosed MSM link MSM and heterosexual epidemics [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Human immunodeficiency virus-1 CRF55_01B was first described in 2006 in China and is a recombinant of CRF01_AE and subtype Thailand B&#x02019; [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A study in Shenzhen city, which is very close to Guangzhou city, showed that among HIV-infected MSM, the proportion of CRF55_01B increased from 0 in 2006 to 17% in 2012, indicating a rapid spread of HIV-1 CRF55_01B infection in this population [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These results also suggest that HIV-1 CRF55_01B is in an stage of active transmission and rapid expansion, which may affect HIV-1 epidemics in China. It remains to be investigated whether the increased prevalence of CRF55_01B among HIV-infected MSM is due to the wide spread of CRF55_01B infection in nondisclosed MSM or better virus fitness for CRF55_01B.</p><p>Compared with previous HIV-1 transmission network studies, which were limited to a single HIV-1 subtype at a time, HIV-TRACE is substantially powerful in analyzing multiple HIV-1 subtypes or genotypes simultaneously [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A limitation of our study was that the transmission network created by HIV-TRACE cannot determine the direction and order of transmission events. Ragonnet-Cronin et al [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] have pointed out that by using such a reconstruction method, the degree, ie, the number of links within a transmission network, may be overestimated and does not represent the true events of onward transmissions. In our study, we used 3 robust centrality indicators, including average shortest path length, closeness centrality, and radiality to investigate the position of nondisclosed MSM within a transmission network to reduce possible bias due to the size of clusters or the lack of the timing of HIV-1 infection. The results of the 3 centrality indicators were significantly different between nondisclosed MSM and MSM with whom they clustered, indicating that nondisclosed MSM may play an important role in HIV-1 transmission in Guangzhou. Our results are obviously different from those reported in the UK [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and they may reveal differences in sexual or transmission behavior of nondisclosed MSM in different countries or regions. However, more detailed analysis including the information of transmission directions and timing of HIV-1 infection may gain crucial insight into the behavior of this population. Ratmann et al [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] recently specified to use viral deep-sequencing to reconstruct HIV-1 transmission networks and to determine the direction of transmission in these networks. This new technique provides us with a novel tool for further characterization of the role of nondisclosed MSM in HIV-1 transmission. In addition, we did not test the role of nondisclosed MSM in transmitting HIV-1 between MSM and heterosexual epidemics through broker analysis because there were only 16 heterosexual women in our clusters and 14 of them were in the clusters with only 2 members. A nationwide study is necessary to include a sufficient number of HIV-1 sequences and HIV-infected subjects from different regions. We want to emphasize that the inference of nondisclosed MSM is based on their linkage to MSM. Therefore, any comparison with MSM is inherently biased.</p></sec><sec id="s11"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results indicate the central role of nondisclosed MSM in HIV-1 transmission and support the urgent need for prevention and healthcare measures specifically targeting the nondisclosed MSM population because they are barely reached by traditional epidemiological investigation and may not receive appropriate healthcare programs designed for MSM. Their risk in HIV-1 transmission has not yet been fully studied. Further studies collaborated with social scientists should aim to better understand the characteristics of nondisclosed MSM and their needs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s12"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p>Supplementary materials are available at <italic>Open Forum Infectious Diseases</italic> online.
