We also found that among the self-reported non-MSM, infection with HIV-1 CRF55_01B or through HET rather than IDU showed a greater likelihood of being inferred as nondisclosed MSM. These results suggest that nondisclosed MSM in Guangzhou are actually bisexual and have both male and female sex partners, which in turn may increase the risk of their sex partners to infect HIV-1. The similar study conducted in the UK also supports that nondisclosed MSM link MSM and heterosexual epidemics [
