<p>In our study, 28.36% of the Guangzhou sequences linked with at least 1 other sequence at a pairwise genetic distance of ≤0.5% and were included in the transmission clusters. Our results are in line with the findings in the UK where 28.8% of the patient sequences were included in the resulting networks by using a cutoff value of 5 years to most recent common ancestor sequences [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. We must emphasize that 9.92% of self-reported non-MSM were inferred to be nondisclosed MSM in Guangzhou. This tends to be a relatively conservative estimation because we chose a relatively small pairwise genetic distance of 0.5%, given the rapidly spreading HIV-1 among MSM. Ragonnet-Cronin et al [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] identified 18.6% of all clustered heterosexual men in the networks to be nondisclosed MSM in the UK. In another study, Hué et al [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] reported that up to 21% of black African men who report only heterosexual behavior became infected through sex with men in the UK. These results suggested that the actual proportion of nondisclosed MSM may be underestimated and should be further investigated in China.
