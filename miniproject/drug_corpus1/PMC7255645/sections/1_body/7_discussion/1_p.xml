<p>We inferred approximately 10% of self-reported non-MSM as nondisclosed MSM in Guangzhou, China and their central position in HIV-1 transmission networks. Unlike the peripheral position of nondisclosed MSM that have been reported in the UK [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], we found that nondisclosed MSM in China were more likely to be in the central position, indicating their important role and relatively great contribution of HIV-1 transmission. However, the position within the transmission clusters could also be related to the timing of HIV-1 infection. Unfortunately, the influence of the timing of infection was not evaluated due to the lack of the information. Our preliminary results and previous study indicate that nondisclosed MSM should be considered as a specific target group with high risk in HIV-1 transmission and epidemics.
