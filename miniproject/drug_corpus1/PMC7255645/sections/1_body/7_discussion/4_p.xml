<p>Human immunodeficiency virus-1 CRF55_01B was first described in 2006 in China and is a recombinant of CRF01_AE and subtype Thailand Bâ€™ [
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A study in Shenzhen city, which is very close to Guangzhou city, showed that among HIV-infected MSM, the proportion of CRF55_01B increased from 0 in 2006 to 17% in 2012, indicating a rapid spread of HIV-1 CRF55_01B infection in this population [
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These results also suggest that HIV-1 CRF55_01B is in an stage of active transmission and rapid expansion, which may affect HIV-1 epidemics in China. It remains to be investigated whether the increased prevalence of CRF55_01B among HIV-infected MSM is due to the wide spread of CRF55_01B infection in nondisclosed MSM or better virus fitness for CRF55_01B.
