<p>Our results indicate the central role of nondisclosed MSM in HIV-1 transmission and support the urgent need for prevention and healthcare measures specifically targeting the nondisclosed MSM population because they are barely reached by traditional epidemiological investigation and may not receive appropriate healthcare programs designed for MSM. Their risk in HIV-1 transmission has not yet been fully studied. Further studies collaborated with social scientists should aim to better understand the characteristics of nondisclosed MSM and their needs.</p>
