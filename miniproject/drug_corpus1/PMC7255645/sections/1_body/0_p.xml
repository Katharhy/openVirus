<p>Men who have sex with men (MSM) are at increasing risk for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in many countries and regions, although both HIV-1 prevalence and incidence are declining in the general population worldwide [

For Chinese MSM, the prevalence of HIV-1 infection has rapidly increased from 0.9% in 2003 to 7.8% in 2016, and, notably, 27.6% of the 124 000 newly diagnosed HIV-1 infections in 2016 were attributed to MSM transmission [
