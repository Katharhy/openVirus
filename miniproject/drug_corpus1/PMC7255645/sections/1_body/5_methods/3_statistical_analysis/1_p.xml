<p>We used a multivariate logistic regression model with the outcome being either clustered in the network (1) or not (0). Age, gender, marital status, education level, risk group of HIV-1 infection, and HIV-1 subtype or genotype were included as predictor variables. The difference between nondisclosed MSM and MSM was determined by using 2-sample 
 <italic>t</italic> test and Mann-Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test in IBM SPSS Statistics 25. In addition, a logistic regression model was adapted to predict the variables associated with the outcome being inferred as nondisclosed MSM. The independent role of individual factor was evaluated by using univariate logistic regression followed by the evaluation of the interaction of these factors in the multivariate logistic regression. The factors with 
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; .1 were removed from the multivariate model by using backward stepwise analysis.
