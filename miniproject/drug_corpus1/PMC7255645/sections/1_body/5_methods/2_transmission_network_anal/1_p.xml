<p>The Tamura-Nei 93 nucleotide substitution model was used to calculate pairwise genetic distance for all the sequences analyzed. The Transmission network was constructed using HIV-TRACE with a threshold of pairwise genetic distance of 0.5%, which is more appropriate for identifying rapidly growing clusters [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In brief, each sequence is represented by a node in the network, and nodes are linked together if their pairwise genetic distance is 0.5% or less. Network centrality was measured by using NetworkAnalyzer 2.7 implemented in Cytoscape 3.7.0 [
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and network assortativity was calculated by using NetworkX 1.9.1. package in Python 3.7.3.
