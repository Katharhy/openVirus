<p>The position within the transmission networks was determined based on centrality measurements including average shortest path length, closeness centrality, radiality, and degree to quantify how important a node is in viral transmission. Among them, the average shortest path length represents the distance between 2 connected nodes [

Network assortativity was adapted to determine the transmission links, ie, whether nondisclosed MSM link to each other rather than MSM in the clusters. The value of assortativity ranges from âˆ’1 to 1, which means completely disassortative and definitely assortative, respectively [
