<p>In addition, a background sequence dataset of HIV-1 subtype B, CRF01_AE, CRF07_BC, and CRF55_01B was compiled using HIV BLAST from the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) database (June 2019). To limit the size of alignments, the 10 most similar reference sequences for each Guangzhou sequence were selected. Sequences with no information of gender or risk groups of HIV-1 infection were excluded.</p>
