<p>The study included 3079 HIV-1 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences (HXB2 position 2253–3821) obtained from 3684 HIV-positive subjects who were diagnosed and claimed to be infected through heterosexual transmission (HET), MSM, or intravenous drug users (IDUs) from 2008 to 2015 in Guangzhou, China. Demographic characteristics (age, gender, marital status, and education) and risk groups (HET, MSM, or IDUs) of HIV-1 infection were extracted from the electronic follow-up records at Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Guangzhou CDC). Sequences were aligned with the representative sequences of HIV-1 group M subtypes and circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) obtained from the Los Alamos database (

 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The HIV-1 subtypes were determined by the phylogenetic tree constructed by IQ-TREE 1.6.9 [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] using an ultrafast bootstrap with 1000 replicates, as well as the Shimodaira–Hasegawa approximate likelihood-ratio test (SH-aLRT) with 1000 replicates. Human immunodeficiency virus-1 CRF genotyping was done by using the RIP online subtyping tool [
