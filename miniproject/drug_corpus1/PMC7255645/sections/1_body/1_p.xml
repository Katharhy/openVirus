<p>Due to social isolation, discrimination, and verbal or physical abuse, some MSM may not disclose their sexual orientation [
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which in turn may put them at particularly high risk for HIV-1 transmission because of their identity of nondisclosed MSM and the lack of HIV-1 prevention services that are usually available to MSM. Furthermore, it is difficult to characterize HIV-1 transmission in nondisclosers through traditional “shoe-leather” epidemiologic reviews. Hence, it is critical to identify the specific group of MSM who do not disclose their homosexual orientation and better understand their needs for HIV-1 prevention.
