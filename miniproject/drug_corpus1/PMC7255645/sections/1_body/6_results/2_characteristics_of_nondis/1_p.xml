<p>Based on the transmission networks constructed by HIV-TRACE, 18.55% (41 of 221) of the clusters contained 1 or more than 1 nondisclosed MSM and 1 or more than 1 MSM but not women (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). These clusters included 61 nondisclosed MSM and 254 MSM (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), indicating that 9.92% (61 of 615) of the self-reported non-MSM may actually be nondisclosed MSM. Of 41 clusters containing nondisclosed MSM, 18 (43.9%) had only 2 sequences, and the maximum cluster size of Cluster168 was 88 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). The median of links for each node was 3.0 (interquartile range [IQR], 2.0–7.0). The average genetic distance among these links was 0.33% ± 0.11%. Most of these clusters were infected with CRF07_BC (46.3%) or CRF01_AE (31.7%), but the largest cluster (Cluster168) was infected with CRF55_01B. Compared with MSM, nondisclosed MSM were slightly older (
 <italic>P</italic> = .006), more likely to be married (
 <italic>P</italic> = .002), and less likely to be educated (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) than MSM (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The proportion of HIV-1 genotypes was not significantly different between the two groups (
 <italic>P</italic> = .219).
