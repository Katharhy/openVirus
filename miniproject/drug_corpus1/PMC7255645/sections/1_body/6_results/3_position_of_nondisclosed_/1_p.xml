<p>Clusters created in this study indicated that nondisclosed MSM could be in the central (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) or peripheral (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>) positions within a transmission network. Nondisclosed MSM could also link both MSM and themselves (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>) in the transmission network. For all of the transmission networks containing nondisclosed MSM and MSM, the average shortest path length was significantly smaller for nondisclosed MSM (1.0; IQR, 1.0–2.0) than for MSM (2.0; IQR, 1.2–3.2;

 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and the radiality (1.0, IQR = 0.8–1.0 vs 0.8, IQR = 0.6–0.9; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) were significantly greater in nondisclosed MSM than in MSM (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), indicating that nondisclosed MSM were in a central position of the transmission networks and played an important role in HIV-1 transmission. Only the degree was slightly smaller for nondisclosed MSM (2.0; IQR, 1.0–5.5) than for MSM (3.0; IQR, 2.0–7.0; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .008), suggesting less connects in nondisclosed MSM than in the MSM with whom they clustered.
