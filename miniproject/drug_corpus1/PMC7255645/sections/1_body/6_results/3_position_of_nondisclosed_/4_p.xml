<p>To investigate whether nondisclosed MSM link to each other more closely than to MSM in the clusters, we chose 8 clusters containing at least 2 MSM and at least 2 self-reported heterosexual men. There were 152 MSM and 26 heterosexual men among the 8 clusters in the true networks. The assortativity coefficient was 0.025, indicating that nondisclosed MSM were more likely to link to each other.</p>
