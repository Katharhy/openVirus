<p>Of note, for the transmission cluster size n = 2, the contribution of each member to the centrality is equal. Therefore, we recalculated the average shortest path length and other centrality indicators after removing the clusters n = 2 and got similar results (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). To evaluate the potential bias due to the larger MSM-dominant components, we further analyzed the centrality indicators using equal number of nondisclosed MSM and MSM, and we found no significant difference (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). These results indicate that cluster size did not significantly affect the results of centrality analysis.
