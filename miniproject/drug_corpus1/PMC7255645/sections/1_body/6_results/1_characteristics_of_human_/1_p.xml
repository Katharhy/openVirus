<p>A total of 3079 HIV-1 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences were obtained from 3684 HIV-positive people who were diagnosed in Guangzhou between 2008 and 2015. We selected 2786 sequences, each representing a distinct HIV-positive individual from the 4 most common HIV-1 genotypes in China: subtype B (174, 5.65%), CRF01_AE (1093, 35.50%), CRF07_BC (1155, 37.48%), and CRF55_01B (364, 11.82%) in this study (
