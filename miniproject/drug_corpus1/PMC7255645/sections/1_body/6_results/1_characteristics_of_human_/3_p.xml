<p>In our study, we retrieved 323 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences of HIV-1 subtype B, CRF01_AE, CRF07_BC, and CRF55_01B from the LANL database as background sequences. All the background sequences have the information of gender and risk groups of HIV-1 infection. Of 3109 sequences analyzed, 28.36% (790 of 2786) of the Guangzhou sequences and 22 background sequences had a putative linkage with at least 1 other sequence at a pairwise genetic distance of 0.5%. These sequences formed 221 clusters and their sizes ranged from 2 to 88 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Among them, 60.63% (134 of 221) of these transmission cluster sizes are n = 2. The proportion of cluster sizes 3–5, 6–10, and &gt;10 is 31.67%, 3.62%, and 4.07%, respectively (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup3">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). A total of 19.91% of the clusters contain MSM and the subjects infected through HET or IDU, whereas 7.23% of the cluster are non-MSM (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup3">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). These results indicated that HIV-1 transmission is more frequent among MSM, but majority of the these HIV-1 infections were one-to-one transmission.
