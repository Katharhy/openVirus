<p>In our study, the proportion of the total HET sequences for men and women was 68.1% (341 of 501) and 31.9% (160 of 501), respectively, and was similar to that of the unclustered sequences for men (64.9%, 270 of 416) and women (35.1%, 146 of 416). The proportion of the total IDU sequences for men and women was 88.96% (274 of 308) and 11.04% (34 of 308), respectively, and was similar to that of the unclustered sequences for men (88.51%, 262 of 296) and women (11.49%, 34 of 296). These results indicated no significant sampling bias for the unclustered self-disclosed HET and IDU sequences attributed to men or women. It is interesting to note that 17.06% (85 of 501) of the HET sequences and 3.90% (12 of 308) of the IDU sequences clustered, whereas 35.05% (693 of 1977) of the MSM sequences clustered (
