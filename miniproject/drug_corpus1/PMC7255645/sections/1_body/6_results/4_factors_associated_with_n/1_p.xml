<p>We used both univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify factors that could predict nondisclosed MSM among the self-reported non-MSM (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup5">Supplementary Tables S5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup6">S6</xref>). We found that nondisclosed MSM were more likely to be younger (
 <italic>P</italic> = .003), less likely to be infected with CRF01_AE (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) or CRF07_BC (
 <italic>P</italic> = .003) than CRF55_01B, and more likely to be infected through HET than IDU (OR, 4.56; 95% CI, 2.20â€“9.46; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup7">Supplementary Table S7</xref>). However, no significant difference was found regarding marital status and education levels between nondisclosed MSM and self-reported non-MSM.
