<p>In 2018, Ragonnet-Cronin et al [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] reported self-reported heterosexual men who clustered only with MSM and with no women as potential nondisclosed MSM. They adapted time-resolved phylogenetic analysis of HIV-1 sequences to create transmission networks and found that 18.6% of all clustered heterosexual men were actually nondisclosed MSM in the United Kingdom (UK). In addition, they found that nondisclosed MSM were more likely to link MSM and heterosexual women, and they might increase the risk of HIV-1 infection in their female partners. This group of nondisclosed MSM was only revealed in the UK since 2014 and has not yet been fully investigated [
