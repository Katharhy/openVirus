  <p>Clusters containing men who have sex with men (MSM) and heterosexual men and positions of nondisclosed MSM within MSM clusters. (A) All human immunodeficiency virus-1 transmission clusters identified in this study. (B) Clusters containing multiple nondisclosed MSM and MSM. (C) Nondisclosed MSM tended to be on the center of clusters. (D) Nondisclosed MSM tended to be on the periphery of clusters. (E) Nondisclosed MSM linked to other nondisclosed MSM in MSM clusters. Potential nondisclosed MSM were inferred as self-reported heterosexual men who clustered with MSM and with no women.</p>
