<p>Natural products used in TCM remains to be a wealthy source for the identification of novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of human diseases 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>. In the past decade, scientists have made a considerable effort to identify multiple component herbal formulae in TCM with anti-SARS-CoV activity (Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Further identification of chemical entities contained in TCM herbs responsible for the anti-SARS- CoV effect was also pursued (Table 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Due to the homology of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, these previous studies may shed light on the naturally occurring compounds with the capacity to inhibit SARS-CoV-2.
