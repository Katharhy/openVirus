<p>The helicase protein is also considered as a potential target for the development of anti-HCoV (human coronavirus) agents. Yu 
 <italic>et al.</italic> reported scutellarein and myricetin potently inhibited the nsP13 (SARS-CoV helicase protein) 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> by affecting the ATPase activity

 <italic>Coriolus versicolor</italic> (IC50:108.4 µg/mL) and 
 <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> (IC50:41.9 µg/mL) inhibited SARS-CoV RdRp in a dose- dependent manner
