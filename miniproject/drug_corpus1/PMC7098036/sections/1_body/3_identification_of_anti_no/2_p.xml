<p>3- chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) is vital for replication of virus, and thus represents a promising drug target for the development of therapeutics agents for SARS-CoV as well as other human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2. It was reported that following TCM herbal extracts had the capacity to inhibit the enzymatic activity of SARS 3CLpro: Chinese 
 <italic>Rhubarb</italic> extracts (IC50: 13.76 ± 0.03 μg/mL) 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, water extract of 
 <italic>Houttuynia cordata</italic>
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,

 <italic>,</italic> flavonoid extracted from

 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> and beta-sitosterol (IC50: 1210µM) extracted from the root extract of 
 <italic>Isatis indigotica</italic>
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>. Further, following herb-derived naturally occurring compounds including sinigrin (IC50: 217µM), indigo (IC50: 752µM), aloe-emodin (IC50: 366 µM), hesperetin (IC50:8.3 µM) 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, quercetin (IC50: 73µM), epigallocatechin gallate (IC50: 73µM), gallocatechin gallate (IC50: 47 µM) 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, herbacetin, rhoifolin and pectolinarin 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> were able to inhibit the SARS 3CLpro activity. Moreover, the flavonoids namely herbacetin, isobavaschalcone, quercetin 3‐β‐D‐glucoside, and helichrysetin had the potential to block the enzymatic activity of MERS‐CoV 3CL protease
