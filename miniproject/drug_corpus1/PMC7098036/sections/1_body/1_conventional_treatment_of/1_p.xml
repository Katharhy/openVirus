<p>Due to the absence of a specific antiviral therapeutics and vaccine, main treatment strategy for COVID-19 is supportive care, which is supplemented by the combination of broad-spectrum antibiotics, antivirals, corticosteroids and convalescent plasma 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). HIV protease inhibitors ritonavir and lopinavir have been used, typically in combination with appropriate antibiotics or with IFNÎ±-2b, in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. Nucleoside analogs such as ribavirin 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> may be potentially beneficial for the treatment of COVID-19, since ribavirin was approved for treating respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and used extensively during the SARS and MERS outbreak 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. However, ribavirin had severe side effects such as anemia 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and whether it had sufficient antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 is unclear. Nucleoside analogs favipiravir (T-705) can effectively inhibit the activity of RNA polymerase of RNA viruses such as influenza 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. A recent 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study found that it had the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, but the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> effect remains elusive. Remdesivir may be the most promising antiviral drug for treating COVID-19. It has 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antiviral activity against a wide array of RNA viruses including SARS and MERS 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, and could decrease viral loads and pathology of lungs in animal models 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. A study showed remdesivir markedly inhibited the infection of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, and most symptoms of the first US patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 had resolved swiftly after intravenous administration with remdesivir 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. Currently, it is under clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous remdesivir for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. Oral oseltamivir has been used for the treatment of the cases with SARS-CoV-2 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, while its efficacy currently remains uncertain.
