<p>Currently, the laboratory study on the effect of TCM is apparently lagging behind the clinical application of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Nevertheless, some scientists have started to examine the effect of TCM products or its components on SARS-CoV-2 in their laboratories. For example, an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study showed that S
 <italic>huang Huang Lian Oral Liquid</italic> had the inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>. However, its clinical efficacy and safety for the treatment of COVID-19 patients has not been evaluated. We noticed that this TCM product was not recommended by HNC's Guideline 
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>. Same as SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 uses receptor ACE2 for the cellular entrance 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. Theoretically, blockade of ACE2 can prevent the infection of SARS-CoV-2. Chen and Du thus performed the molecular docking study and they found that TCM-derived compounds, including as baicalin, scutellarin, hesperetin, glycyrrhizin and nicotianamine could interact with ACE2 
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>. Therefore, these compounds as well as herbs containing these ingredients may have the capacity to inhibit the infection of SARS-CoV-2. We anticipate more experiment studies showing anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of TCM or its components will be published in the near future.
