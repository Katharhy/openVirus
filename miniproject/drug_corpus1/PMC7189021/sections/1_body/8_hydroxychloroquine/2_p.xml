<p id="Par23">Hydroxychloroquine raises the pH in intracellular vacuoles and improves processes such as protein degradation by acidic lysosome hydrolases, assembly of macromolecules in endosomes, and post-translation protein modification in the Golgi apparatus. It is suggested that the antirheumatic properties of these compounds derive from their involvement in macrophages and other antigen-presenting cells with the “antigen processing”. These compounds give greater confidence in aspects of the clinical and laboratory parameters. These are distinguished from glucocorticoids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents by their slow start of the action.</p>
