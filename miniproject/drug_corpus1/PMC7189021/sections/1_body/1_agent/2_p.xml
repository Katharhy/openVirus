<p id="Par8">COVID-19 is the seventh MERS-nCoV and SARS-nCoV coronavirus family member to infect humans. A genetic sequence of the virus was made available to the WHO via genome sequencing, which allowed various laboratories to produce diagnostic reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests specifically for viral RNA detection. COVID-19 is a category 2B Î² CoV with a genetic sequence similarity of more than 70% to SARS-nCoV (Hui et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>). The origins of the new infection with coronavirus was ascertained as bats. With full genome sequences, Zhou and colleagues found that the virus is 96% the same as a bat coronavirus at the level of the entire genome (Zhou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020</xref>). Wu and colleagues performed a phylogenetic analysis of the entire viral genome and deduced that the virus was most closely associated with a group of previously isolated SARS-like coronaviruses from bats in China (Wu et al.
