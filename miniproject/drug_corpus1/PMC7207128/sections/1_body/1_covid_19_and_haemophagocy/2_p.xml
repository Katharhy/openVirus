 <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In immunocompetent individuals, intracellular pathogens trigger a T-helper cell 1 (Th1)-type immune response with a release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that activate histiocytes (macrophages and dendritic cells), NK cells and cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs). These cells continue to reciprocally stimulate each other through receptor interaction and by cytokines. In sHLH, there is a dysfunction of CTLs and/or NK cells leading to the persistence of the antigenic insult which maintains cytokines release

 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This may be due the persistence of the viral insult caused by cytotoxic cells dysfunction.
