<p>The economic impact of past pandemics is hard to examine due to the lack of robust data.
 <xref rid="b84-rmmj-11-3-e0027" ref-type="bibr">84</xref> However, a retrospective look at the first 6 months of the COVID-19 epidemic reveals a catastrophic impact on the economies of most countries having to cope with significant numbers of cases. The harshest economic impact generally occurred in varying degrees in wealthier countries. One of the most important parameters for quantifying economic damage is the gross domestic product forecast, although different countries use other economic metrics. According to the majority of prognoses, the damage was expected to be greatest during the second quarter of 2020. The primary reason for the severe economic impact of COVID-19 has been the leading and widely justified slogan, “health before wealth.” Another parameter that has significantly contributed to the economic crisis worldwide is the swift increase in job losses. Quantification of financial activities in selected populations may add important data to more accurate evaluation of the world economy as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, listing the purpose of out-of-home visits (residential, parks, workplace, grocery stores, pharmacy) may contribute to a composite financial evaluation of representative family units.
