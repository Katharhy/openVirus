<p>Other possible trajectories should also be investigated. For example, if early infections occurred in persons who had close contact to bats or other animals, such as animals raised on farms or held and sacrificed at wet markets, this would clearly point to a specific zoonotic link. Another possibility is that the new virus was engineered for investigational purposes or with malicious criminal intentions. By looking at the structural details of the virus, molecular biologists have ruled out and published the arguments against this last-mentioned possibility.
