<p>A series of questions must be answered when attempting to determine the primary source of a pandemic virus like SARS-CoV-2. As it is a coronavirus, the most probable source is a virus that originated in bats.
 <xref rid="b63-rmmj-11-3-e0027" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> To confirm this theory, genomic profiles of coronaviruses previously isolated from bats must be compared with coronavirus profiles isolated from patients. If these sequences are identical, then it can be assumed that the primary source is a bat.
 <xref rid="b64-rmmj-11-3-e0027" ref-type="bibr">64</xref> However, if the virus has been preserved in the refrigerators of a virology laboratory, there exists a very real possibility of viral “escape” from the laboratory to the community. In this scenario, especially if the laboratory is located in the proximity of the epidemic epicenter, a laboratory origin of the pandemic virus would be a strong alternative. Additional tests such as antibody testing of the personnel working in the suspected laboratory should provide further assistance in elucidating the true origin and pathway of the virus.
