<p>Once these mechanisms had been clarified, multiple hypotheses relating to specific actions of different drugs were proposed. For example, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin all inhibit the uncoating of the invading endosomes. On the other hand, the antivirals remdesivir and favipiravir inhibit gRNA replication by RdRp. Additional drugs, not only antivirals, have also been identified to target the complex mechanisms of the intracellular viral cycle.
