<p>In the early days of the pandemic great effort was invested into understanding the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2,
 <xref rid="b9-rmmj-11-3-e0027" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> so as to provide a basis for discovery of an effective vaccine to prevent COVID-19 and/or a safe and efficacious drug to cure it, or at the least, to ameliorate its symptoms, shorten its duration, and/or block its mechanism of transmission. Being a virus, SARS-CoV-2 must invade host cells, hijack the cellâ€™s biologic machinery for reproduction, and, finally, release multiple daughter virions. Research uncovered six steps in the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2: (1) attachment and entry; (2) uncoating; (3) guide ribonucleic acid (gRNA) replication; (4) translation in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus; (5) assembly; and (6) virion release.
