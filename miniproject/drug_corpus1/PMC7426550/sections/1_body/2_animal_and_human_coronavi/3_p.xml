<p>Although the transmissibility of both severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is lower than that of COVID-19, the case fatality ratio is many times higher for MERS and SARS than for COVID-19 (

 <xref rid="b22-rmmj-11-3-e0027" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> However, the number of COVID-19 cases have markedly outnumbered the number of cases in both SARS and MERS. While clinical manifestations for the two last-mentioned infections were generally limited to the respiratory tract, although with higher degrees of disease severity, it is remarkable that there has been a wide spectrum of heterogeneous clinical manifestations in COVID-19 cases. From a pathophysiological perspective, this phenomenon is explained by the ubiquitous presence of ACE2 receptors throughout multiple organs and blood vessels. At a clinical level, some typical COVID-19 manifestations described during the pandemic include “silent anoxia,”
