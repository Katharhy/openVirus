<p>Based on current knowledge, there are seven species of human coronaviruses.

The remaining three human coronaviruses are associated with a wider spectrum of disease severity. Relatively frequently they cause severe pneumonia and other serious complications (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-rmmj-11-3-e0027">Figure 1</xref>, five of the seven human coronaviruses have well established intermediate hosts, based on both epidemiologic and genomic data. In the case of COVID-19, preliminary data suggest that several species of pangolins are the suspected intermediate host. Pangolins are mammals covered by keratin scales. In China the pangolin is seen as an edible animal mainly, but traditional medicine in this country also attributes multiple curative properties to a powder obtained by mashing their scales.
