<p>In the 1990s a major epidemic of cholera occurred in Peru. 
 <italic>Vibrio cholera</italic> contaminated the ballast water in ships that had arrived from India. Massive contamination of large quantities of live fish occurred when the ballast water was discharged into the sea near the shore. Fish were subsequently caught from this area, and thousands of Peruvians developed cholera after consuming raw fish (ceviche), a popular traditional food. The epidemic was terminated abruptly when the health authorities recommended to discard the head and branchia (gills) when preparing the fish for consumption.
