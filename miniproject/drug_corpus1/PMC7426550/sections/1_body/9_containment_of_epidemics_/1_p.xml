<p>In 1854, a cholera outbreak erupted in the densely populated neighborhood of Soho, London. John Snow, a physician who lived in the vicinity, mapped the houses of the many affected persons with cholera. He discovered a water pump in the center of the mapped area that had been used by all infected persons for obtaining drinking water. On his advice, municipal authorities removed the pump handle, resulting in an immediate end to the epidemic, with no further cases. It was subsequently learned that human excrement pits had drained into and contaminated the water supply.
