<p>The main problem with the need to develop a vaccine against a new pandemic microbe is that the process is lengthy and mined with multiple obstacles.

 <xref rid="b81-rmmj-11-3-e0027" ref-type="bibr">81</xref> In the past, the elapsed time from vaccine development to approval and production could take up to 10 years. However, in order to efficiently and rapidly cope with an emerging pandemic, ideally, the scientific world must be prepared with predefined “templates” to facilitate accelerated vaccine development. If a proposed vaccine causes serious side effects or alternatively is not sufficiently immunogenic, the development process should be restarted from the beginning. In some cases, when a clinical evaluation of a vaccine reaches Phase III, the number of newly infected cases drops rapidly, making it difficult to test the actual efficacy of the vaccine in preventing infection. In the quest for a COVID-19 vaccine, there have been a few initiatives to recruit volunteers who would be challenged with the virus after being immunized. However, for this scheme to work, it is essential to have a very efficacious drug available for treating the infection, should the vaccine fail.
