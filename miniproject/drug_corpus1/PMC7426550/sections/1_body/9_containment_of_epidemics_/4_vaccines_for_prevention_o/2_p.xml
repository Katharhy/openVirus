<p>As recently summarized by the WHO,
 <xref rid="b78-rmmj-11-3-e0027" ref-type="bibr">78</xref> there are currently at least 125 different COVID-19 vaccination research projects underway in the quest to prevent COVID-19. Essentially, six groups of vaccines are being explored, three of which first require the isolation of viral particles. These virions are either: (1) weakened (attenuated); (2) killed by hot or chemical substances (inactivated); or (3) fragmented viruses followed by isolation of small pieces of the virus (subunits). A second class of vaccine starts with genetically engineered pieces of either RNA or DNA, which subsequently are embedded in either: (4) plasmids (DNA); (5) lipids (RNA); or (6) an adenovirus vector.
 <xref rid="b79-rmmj-11-3-e0027" ref-type="bibr">79</xref> In all cases, particles are diluted in a solution for initial animal testing (preclinical trials) and subsequent testing in humans (clinical trials).
