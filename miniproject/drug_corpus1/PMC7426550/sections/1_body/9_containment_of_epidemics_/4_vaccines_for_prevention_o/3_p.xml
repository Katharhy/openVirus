<p>Clinical trials are performed in three phases, each one having an increasing number of volunteers. Phase I (10â€“100 volunteers) examines safety and immunogenicity. Phase II (&gt;100 volunteers) examines safety, immunogenicity, and dose adjustments. Phase III (more than 10,000 volunteers) primarily examines infection prevention following exposure. If all three phases are successful, then the vaccine undergoes regulatory approval and subsequent mass production under strict quality control.</p>
