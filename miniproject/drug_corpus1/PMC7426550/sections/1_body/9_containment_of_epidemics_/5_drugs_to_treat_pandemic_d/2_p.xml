<p>Despite an increase in antibiotic resistance, there remain multiple choices for treatment of bacterial pandemics. For example, the main pillar of medical treatment for cholera is the emergency replacement of large amounts of fluid lost as a result of diarrhea and vomiting, with antibiotics playing a secondary role in its treatment.
