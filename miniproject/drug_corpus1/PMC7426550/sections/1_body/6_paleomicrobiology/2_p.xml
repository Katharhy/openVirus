<p>With regard to smallpox, several well preserved mummies have been found in Egypt and other countries. Some mummies, such as that of the Egyptian pharaoh, Ramses V, provided dermal evidence that they had terminally suffered from smallpox. However, genomic evidence for the actual virus has been found only rarely in mummies. This can be explained by the poor long-term preservation of viruses. Other diseases documented by paleomicrobiological methodologies include tuberculosis, leprosy, and multiple parasitic infections.
