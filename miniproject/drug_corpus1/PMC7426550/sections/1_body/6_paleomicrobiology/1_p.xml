<p>During the last decades and as a valuable complement to the written documentation on ancient bacterial pandemics, paleomicrobiological studies relating primarily to the plague (
 <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic>) have contributed greatly to the reshaping of our understanding of its epidemiology. There was much confusion and controversy regarding the epidemiology of plague in the multiple pandemics that occurred several centuries ago, until the studies of French investigators, Drancourt and Raoult and colleagues, which revolutionized several contentious concepts established by other investigators.

 <italic>Bartonella quintana</italic>, a bacterium transmitted by lice.

 <xref rid="b57-rmmj-11-3-e0027" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> Since 
 <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic> is also found in body lice, the investigators developed a laboratory rabbit model and exposed the animals to human lice infected with specific bacteria. Additional epidemics investigated by the same scientists were found to be caused by 
 <italic>Bartonella quintana</italic> alone or combined with 
 <italic>Rickettsia prowazekii</italic>.
 <xref rid="b54-rmmj-11-3-e0027" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> These and other studies supported the theory that infected lice were key spreaders of 
 <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic>, sometimes found in polymicrobial infections.
