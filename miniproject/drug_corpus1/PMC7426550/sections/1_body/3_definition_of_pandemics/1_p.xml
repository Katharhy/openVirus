<p>The simplest definition of a pandemic is a contagious infectious disease that has spread to multiple geographic areas or continents. The term “contagious” implies that the infection can be transmitted person-to-person, either directly or indirectly. Various degrees of controversy emerge between members of the medical and scientific communities when defining a new disease as pandemic. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), “a pandemic is the worldwide spread of a new disease.”

A large number of books dealing with pandemics have been published, mainly during this last decade.
