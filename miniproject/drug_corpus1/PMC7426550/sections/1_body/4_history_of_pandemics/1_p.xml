<p>Obviously, written testimony on possible pandemics is lacking with regard to prehistoric times. However, it is important to recall that during the pre-agricultural era, the nomadic population of 
 <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> on Earth was relatively small. Consequently, we can assume that pandemics were relatively rare at that time. The known history of pandemics is based on the discoveries of documentation by ancient historians and other sources.

 <xref rid="b38-rmmj-11-3-e0027" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Due to the lack of consensus on the definition of a pandemic, there are some cases in which there is a discrepancy regarding the categorization of an epidemic as a pandemic. For example, the SARS epidemic in 2002–2003 had all the characteristics of a potential dire pandemic, but fortunately its spread was interrupted by yet unexplained mechanisms. Some pandemics such as AIDS have been widespread both in time and in vast geographic distribution.

 <italic>Pan troglodytes troglodytes</italic> to humans occurred in Africa.
