 <xref rid="b8-rmmj-11-3-e0027" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> plots of the daily global numbers of COVID-19-infected persons during the second trimester of 2020 reveal an undulating and ascending pattern that is difficult to explain. However, they also show a progressive and steady decrease in mortality for that same period.
