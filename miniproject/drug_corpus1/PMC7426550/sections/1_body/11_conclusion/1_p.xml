<p>Despite the rapid and advanced progress in many medical disciplines since the end of the nineteenth century, the COVID-19 pandemic has sadly demonstrated vast limitations worldwide in successfully coping with it. There is no doubt that the unexpected and yet fully unknown behavior of SARS-CoV-2 has strongly contributed to its pandemic status. For example, the high proportion of infected but totally asymptomatic persons has made containment challenging, to say the least. In some cases, the proportion of infected persons feeling absolutely well can approach almost 90%.

Sampling the entire population on board revealed that a vast majority had contracted the infection, but 80% of them were asymptomatic patients.
