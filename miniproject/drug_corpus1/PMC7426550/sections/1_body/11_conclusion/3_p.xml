<p>This retrospective analysis and comparison of COVID-19 with prior pandemic diseases can contribute to the improvement of a rationale and scientific approach to future epidemics or pandemics. The most important take-away point should be an understanding of the high degree of preparedness that is needed, including various protocols for social distancing that are adapted to the different transmission modalities of the involved microbes. In addition, multiple innovative protocols aimed at a robust accelerated vaccine development process are needed. Disease-causing viruses, or colonizing species in the animal kingdom, should be evaluated for potential spillage to human beings. For those specific viruses, it is imperative to delineate seminal protocols that can be launched in emergency situations.</p>
