<p>Epidemics and pandemics have had a very strong impact on human history. Diseases like smallpox, measles, and plague decimated entire populations in several regions of Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. At the end of the fifteenth century, the European conquistadores of the Americas brought diseases with them that were unknown to the native population. Due to the local lack of immunity to these newly imported viruses, smallpox and measles spread rapidly, causing fear and frustration among the natives due to the lack of natural resistance and a very high mortality rate; local communities were decimated and sometimes entire settlements were wiped out. This tragedy facilitated the conquest of the land and the massive conversion of Indian tribes to Christianity across the Americas.
