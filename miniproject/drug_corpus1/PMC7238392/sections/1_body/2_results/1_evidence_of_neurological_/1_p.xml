<p id="Par4">Respiratory distress is the most distinctive symptom (55%) reported in COVID-19 patients [7]. Reported neurological findings fall into three categories: central (headache [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], dizziness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], impaired consciousness, acute cerebrovascular disease, ataxia and seizures), peripheral (hypogeusia, hyposmia) and musculoskeletal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Mao et al. reported that 6 of 214 patients had either ischemic or haemorrhagic strokes, although it was not reported whether the strokes occurred before or after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Approximately 5% reported hypogeusia (5.6%) and/or hyposmia (5.1%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Additionally, a clinical picture reminiscent of a central hypoventilation syndrome (“Ondine’s curse”) was reported from a COVID-19 survivor in Wuhan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. There have been increasing reports of delirium in COVID-19 patients, and delirium may also be associated with more severe disease. A recent retrospective case series from China found that 22% of people who died from COVID-19 experienced delirium compared with 1% of people who recovered [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. There has also been a case report of altered mental status in a COVID-19 patient with encephalopathy on EEG [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and acute haemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy, the latter of which was thought to be due to cytokine storm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Myalgia and muscle injury were reported in 10.7% of the cases in Wuhan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and rhabdomyolysis has been reported in another case from Wuhan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].
