<p id="Par5">Neurological manifestations have also been observed first-hand in Italy’s Brescia province which documented 9340 COVID-19 patients as of April 5, 2020 (personal observations of authors AP ML).Many patients experienced hyposmia or anosmia, dysgeusia, dysarthria and either allodynia or acroparesthesias. An atypical onset has been observed in few patients characterized by a delirious presentation that occurs prior to the onset of any respiratory syndromes. Within a cohort of 2660 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 6 patients presented with encephalitis as the first and only symptom, 2 of whom subsequently died. Four patients presented with new onset seizures with no fever. These symptoms were then followed by the respiratory syndrome. There is evidence that many patients displayed varying patterns of respiratory manifestations. One such presentation consists of a sudden onset of respiratory failure in contrast to severe acute pulmonary failure. There also seems to be increase in number of both ischemic stroke and haemorrhagic stroke compared to historical series. Finally, more recently a case report has been published about the onset of Guillaine Barrè syndrome (GBS) during SARS-CoV-2, suggesting a pattern of a parainfectious profile, instead of the classic postinfectious profile [
