<p id="Par2">Reports are emerging from China and Italy and increasingly from several countries of neurological symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2, which may be worsening clinical pictures, respiratory outcomes and mortality rates in patients with COVID-19. While most coronaviruses cause mild respiratory illness, it is well known that many beta-coronaviruses have nervous system involvement [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] as well as a common host cell entry receptor with SARS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], SARS-CoV-2 may also demonstrate neurotropism via possible invasion through the cribriform plate, olfactory nerve, thalamus and brainstem resulting in suppression of central cardiorespiratory drive [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Reports from China describe neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients with one retrospective case series from Wuhan, China showing 78 of 214 patients (36%) with neurological manifestations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Observations from Italy have confirmed Chinese data noting a high number of patients with hyposmia, anosmia and varying patterns of possibly centrally mediated symptoms including respiratory manifestations. In the evolving pandemic, healthcare professionals, therefore, need to recognize and address neurological consequences. We summarized the available knowledge to guide further research, clinical surveillance and management protocols.
