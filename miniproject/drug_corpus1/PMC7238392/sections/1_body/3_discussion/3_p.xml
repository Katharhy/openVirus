<p id="Par8">Second, what is the mechanism of action causing the neurological symptoms seen in patients with COVID-19? It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 causes neurological sequelae via inflammation, as elevated inflammatory biomarkers in patients with COVID-19 have been noted. Pro-inflammatory cytokine release is known to cause severe pulmonary damage in COVID-19, termed “cytokine storm”, and likely affects the CNS as well. Indirect CNS damage, through cytokine storm, can cause high mortality rates, encephalopathy, and posterior reversible encephalopathy (PRES). In acute infections, cytokine release can also result in strokes, a number of which have been reported in SARS post infection [
