<p id="Par10">Many patients present dysgeusia, dysphagia, dysarthria (personal observation AP) indicating a possible vagal involvement which could also indicate the possibility for diaphragmatic paresis and tachycardia thus potential bulbar infections. We know that SARS-CoV-1 enters cells through the ACE2 receptor mainly in renal, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In mice, infected hippocampal cells were isolated in the CNS several days post-infection indicating that SARS-CoV-1 has the capability to spread to the CNS after clearance by the lungs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In humans, SARS-CoV-1 has been found in the CSF [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and in neurons on autopsy [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Another coronavirus (swine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus) travels via peripheral nerves to the brainstem via trigeminal and vagal sensory nuclei [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. HCoV OC43 (a coronavirus responsible for the common cold) infects human microglia leading to persistent infection and has been found in the CSF and brain tissue of patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In mice, it travels to the CNS from the olfactory bulbs and, importantly, is blocked by destroying olfactory sensory neurons [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This potential mechanism becomes crucially important clinically when considering that wearing masks could likely be the most effective prevention against viral entry into the CNS.
