<p id="Par11">Finally, prospective cohort studies are needed to understand the long-term impacts of COVID-19 on neurological functions. It is currently unknown if people who have recovered from severe COVID-19 suffer any lasting neurological sequalae. It is certainly true and well known that several patients discharged from ICU, thus also several COVID 19 patients, suffer of chronic illness myopathy or neuropathy or both which might worsen the clinical outcomes. Concomitant risk factors or determinants (e.g. demographic factors, comorbidities, or available biomarkers) that may predispose a person with COVID-19 to neurological manifestations should be identified.</p>
