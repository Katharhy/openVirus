<p>For pandemic preparedness, it is important to understand the genetic determinants of IAVs that permit them to replicate, to be transmitted, and to cause disease in humans. Such work allows the identification of sequence markers that can be used in global surveillance and eradication efforts, and it supports testing of prepandemic vaccine and antiviral stockpiles to ensure their efficacy if novel IAV strains acquire human replication and transmissibility features (

Key landmark studies in this area identified several amino acid substitutions in viral proteins, notably hemagglutinin (HA), that are critical for allowing mammalian transmissibility of avian IAVs, and identification was facilitated by the creation of fully infectious, replication-competent, and antigenically novel IAVs at the highest biosafety and biosecurity levels (
