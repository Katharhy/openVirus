<p>Procedures to generate and work with biologically contained H5N1 IAVs were thoroughly risk assessed prior to the start of the project and were approved by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (Ecogen number A161912). In brief, special considerations included the temporal and physical separation of experiments involving H5N1 IAV-like particles from experiments involving other IAVs in order to minimize the risk of accidental reassortment. With specific regard to the H5N1 IAV HA and its mammalian-transmissible variant, we did not at any point generate or propagate pDZ- or pPolI-based plasmids containing the respective full HA segment so as to prevent accidental rescue of replication-competent viruses containing the H5 HA segment: we used only plasmids carrying the HA ORF which lacked the 3′ and 5′ noncoding sequences essential for packaging. In addition, for the mammalian-transmissible H5 HA variant, we generated a human codon-optimized HA ORF lacking the 3′ and 5′ noncoding sequences. The rationale for this strategy was to destroy any potential cryptic packaging elements in the coding region, thereby eliminating the very rare chance of recombination of this sequence into a fully replication-competent virus.</p>
