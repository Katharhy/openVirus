<p>The biological containment system used here permits the cell culture study of otherwise BSL3 or BSL3+ IAV strains at BSL2 without the risk of reassortment or recombination. In this regard, expression of HA in 
 <italic>trans</italic>, with no possibility of its being genetically incorporated into a fully infectious virus, is the essential feature, as IAVs with novel HAs to which humans do not yet have any humoral immunity are the most threatening with regard to pandemic emergence (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Such a strict genetic safety feature allowed us to create reporter H5N1 IAV variants utilizing gain-of-function mammalian-transmissible HA proteins that are replication competent only in cells stably expressing HA. So-called gain-of-function experiments are controversial for pathogens with pandemic potential (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">â€“</xref>
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), and it is important to implement risk mitigation strategies as much as possible wherever the scientific question under study allows. Here, we did not want to address the mammalian transmissibility or virulence of gain-of-function H5N1 IAVs (which would require fully replication competent viruses), but instead we sought to use the biologically contained reporter system as a proof of principle for developing a feasible framework to assess the antiviral susceptibility and antigenicity of such viruses. Given our success in establishing and implementing such a system, as well as our results indicating that amino acid substitutions related to mammalian transmissibility do not reduce H5N1 antiviral sensitivity or antigenicity, we believe that the biologically contained reporters used here represent a safe and useful way to characterize IAVs with pandemic potential.
