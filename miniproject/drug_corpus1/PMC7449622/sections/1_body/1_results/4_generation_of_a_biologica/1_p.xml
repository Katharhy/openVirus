<p>Following the discovery that highly pathogenic H5N1 IAVs can be experimentally adapted in their HA sequence to confer mammal-to-mammal transmissibility (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), there has been a detailed discussion in the field about the biosafety, biosecurity, and ethical implications of studying such gain-of-function viruses (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). To overcome some of these barriers and concerns, biological risk mitigation strategies are an additional layer of molecular safety to enhance physical biocontainment (BSL3+) infrastructure and protocols. For example, genetic engineering of species-specific microRNA target sites into viral genomes can limit replication exclusively to nonhuman experimental models (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). As proof of principle for another biological risk mitigation strategy, we applied the biologically contained IAV reporter system described here to this problem. Although such a system limits experiments to 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture work, we reasoned that a major advantage would be the sensitive reporter read-out at a lower physical biocontainment level (e.g., BSL2). Importantly, in such a system, there is no mechanism for the virus to genetically acquire the variant HA conferring transmissibility, as the HA cDNA provided in 
 <italic>trans</italic> lacks essential 3′ and 5′ noncoding packaging sequences. We also used a human codon-optimized HA sequence to rule out the very rare chance of recombination. As before, and primarily for added biosafety in these proof-of-principle experiments, the construct was based on the modified H5 HA protein lacking the polybasic cleavage site (HALo), although it should be possible to use an HA containing the polybasic cleavage site. We thus generated an MDCK cell line stably expressing a variant Viet/04 H5 HA (HALo) protein with 4 amino acid substitutions described to confer airborne transmissibility (termed Viet/04-T-HA): N158D, N224K, Q226L, and T318I (H3 numbering) (

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). The two substitutions in the HA globular head (N224K and Q226L), together with loss of the glycosylation site at position 158 (N158D), are responsible for increasing the affinity of HA for human-type receptors (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). In addition, the T318I substitution increases HA thermostability and lowers the pH required for fusion (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Stable homogenous expression and correct localization of the Viet/04-T-HA protein in MDCK cells was confirmed by Western blotting and indirect immunofluorescence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">C</xref>). We grew a stock of Viet/04-
 <italic>Renilla</italic> IAV on these cells to produce virus-like particles incorporating the Viet/04-T-HA protein and confirmed that this new Viet/04-T-
 <italic>Renilla</italic> IAV is biologically contained: it forms plaques and undergoes multicycle replication, as determined by luciferase activity, only on MDCK cells that stably express HA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4D</xref> to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">F</xref>). These data indicate that a biologically contained H5N1 reporter virus with gain-of-function mutations that confer mammalian transmissibility can be produced and used for facile assays.
