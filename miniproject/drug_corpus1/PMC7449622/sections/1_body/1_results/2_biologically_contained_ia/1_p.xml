 <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase was chosen as our reporter molecule because of two key advantages over other commonly used reporters, such as fluorophores and the small luciferase NanoLuc: (i) luciferases in general have higher dynamic ranges than fluorophores, such as GFP, allowing more optimal discrimination between small interventions (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), and (ii) a unique, stable, live-cell substrate system is available for 
 <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase (EnduRen; Promega), which means that cell lysis or supernatant collection is unnecessary, minimizing the liquid handling required with most other luminescent substrates and allowing simple continuous live-cell monitoring over long periods with multiple time points. To demonstrate this system, we infected MDCK or MDCK-HA cells with either WSN/33-
 <italic>Renilla</italic>, Neth/09-
 <italic>Renilla</italic>, or Viet/04-
 <italic>Renilla</italic> IAV-like particles at a range of multiplicities of infection (MOI) and added EnduRen substrate to the medium at 1 h postinfection. With no other manipulation, we were able to perform direct live-cell luminescence readouts every 3 h until the viral replication kinetics were complete (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">F</xref>). Notably, in preliminary experiments we found that the EnduRen substrate is stable in tissue culture medium for at least 30 h and does not need to be replenished. Relatively high-MOI (1 and 0.1 PFU/cell) infections of MDCK or MDCK-HA cells with all of the reporter IAVs led to a rapid increase in luminescence emission, peaking at 6 to 9 h postinfection and giving an ∼1,000-fold increase of activity over mock infections. No differences in these replication kinetics or magnitude were obvious between experiments in MDCK cells with and without complementing HA expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref> to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">F</xref>). In contrast, relatively low-MOI (0.01 and 0.001 PFU/cell) infections showed peak luminescence levels only ∼10- to 100-fold above that of mock infection in MDCK cells lacking HA expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">C</xref>, and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">E</xref>), suggesting only single-cycle infections in these cells, but led to luminescence levels ∼1,000-fold higher than mock infection at later time points (12 to 24 h postinfection) in MDCK cells expressing HA, presumably due to multicycle replication in these cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">D</xref>, and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">F</xref>). These data indicate that the IAV-
 <italic>Renilla</italic> reporters described here are biologically contained and can be effectively used to study single-cycle and multicycle replication kinetics under live-cell conditions with a very high dynamic range.
