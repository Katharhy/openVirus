<p>To evaluate the feasibility of using biologically contained IAV reporters for inhibitor studies, we assayed their sensitivity to known, approved antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir, zanamivir, and baloxavir. Oseltamivir and zanamivir are approved neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Using standard 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> NA inhibition assays, we determined that both oseltamivir and zanamivir potently inhibit the NA activity of WSN/33-
 <italic>Renilla</italic> IAV-like particles with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) similar to that required for inhibition of authentic WSN IAV particles (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">B</xref>). The NA activity of Neth/09-
 <italic>Renilla</italic> IAV-like particles was also inhibited to the same extent as wild-type Neth/09 IAV particles by these two antivirals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">D</xref>). These data indicate that the biologically contained IAV reporters can be used to faithfully recapitulate inhibitor study data of authentic viruses, making them a useful surrogate when work with fully infectious IAVs has to be limited. We further profiled the antiviral activity of baloxavir, a potent inhibitor of the viral endonuclease (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), against all of our IAV-
 <italic>Renilla</italic> reporters. MDCK cells expressing each cognate HA were infected with the respective IAV-
 <italic>Renilla</italic> virus in the presence of various concentrations of baloxavir. Following addition of EnduRen to the medium at 1 h postinfection, together with baloxavir, direct live-cell luminescence readouts were taken at several time points postinfection, and IC
 <sub>50</sub>s were calculated from the nonlinear regression curve that was determined for each virus from the area under the curve (AUC) of the replication kinetics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3E</xref> to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">G</xref>). Baloxavir was able to potently interfere with the replication of all three 
 <italic>Renilla</italic> reporter viruses (WSN/33, Neth/09, and Viet/04 based), with IC
 <sub>50</sub>s in the range of those published previously (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Thus, biologically contained IAV reporters can also be used to rapidly assess antiviral efficacy without laborious and time-consuming titrations of the wild-type viruses.
