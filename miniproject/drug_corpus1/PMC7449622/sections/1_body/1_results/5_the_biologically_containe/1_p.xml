<p>As a proof of concept for studying mammalian-transmissible gain-of-function IAV-like particles under biologically contained conditions, we assayed how the substitutions in Viet/04-T-HA impacted the effect of antivirals and antibodies. Standard 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> NA inhibition assays revealed that both oseltamivir and zanamivir inhibit the NA activity of Viet/04-T-
 <italic>Renilla</italic> IAV-like particles with IC
 <sub>50</sub>s similar to those required for inhibition of Viet/04-
 <italic>Renilla</italic> IAV-like particles, demonstrating similar incorporation of NA into both viruses (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">B</xref>). We also found that, despite the reported impact of the T318I substitution on HA thermostability and fusion potential (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>), the potent experimental HA-targeting fusion inhibitor S20 (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>) is as active against Viet/04-T-
 <italic>Renilla</italic> IAV as it is against Viet/04-
 <italic>Renilla</italic> IAV during infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C</xref>). In addition, we tested the neutralization capabilities of a monoclonal anti-H5 HA antibody and a polyclonal anti-H5 HA serum, with the aim of assessing whether the 4 gain-of-function amino acid substitutions impacted the antigenic profile of HA, an important consideration for development of prepandemic H5 vaccines. Viet/04-T-
 <italic>Renilla</italic> IAV-like and Viet/04-
 <italic>Renilla</italic> IAV-like particles were preincubated for 1 h with each antibody or serum at various concentrations prior to single-cycle infection of MDCK cells. Following addition of EnduRen, luciferase activity was measured at several times postinfection, and IC
 <sub>50</sub>s, or dilution factors with 50% inhibition, were calculated using the nonlinear regression curve for each infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5D</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">E</xref>). Importantly, Viet/04-T-
 <italic>Renilla</italic> IAV was sensitive to neutralization by both the anti-H5 monoclonal and polyclonal preparations and was, if anything, more sensitive to neutralization than Viet/04-
 <italic>Renilla</italic> IAV. These data show that the biologically contained IAV reporter system described here can be applied to safely study gain-of-function mutations, and assays can be readily established to understand antiviral susceptibility and potential antigenic changes.
