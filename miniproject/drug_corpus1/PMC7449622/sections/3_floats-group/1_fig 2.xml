  <p>Live-cell kinetic analysis of single-cycle and multicycle infections with the biologically contained IAV reporters expressing 
   <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase. MDCK cells (A, C, and E) or MDCK-HA cells (B, D, and F) in a 96-well format were infected with the indicated IAV reporter viruses at different MOI (1, 0.1, 0.01, or 0.001 PFU/cell) or mock infected. After 1 h adsorption, EnduRen substrate was added to the overlay medium, and luminescence (in relative light units [RLUs]) was determined directly in live cells every 3 h and normalized to the value from mock-infection conditions. Mean values from three independent experiments are plotted, with error bars representing standard deviations.
