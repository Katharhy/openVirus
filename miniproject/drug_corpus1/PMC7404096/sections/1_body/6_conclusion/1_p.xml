<p>Given the promising early 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> results of CQ/HCQ in SARS-CoV 2 and existing therapeutic dilemmas, the compassionate use of CQ/HCQ can be an option in the ongoing crisis despite the absence of convincing clinical evidence in COVID-19. However, physicians should avoid high doses of CQ/HCQ and exercise caution, particularly in patients with existing cardiovascular disease. We suggest that clinicians and researchers regularly update and adhere to the available credible evidence and findings of the ongoing clinical trials.
