 </sup> Their study involved administration of HCQ (600 mg/day for 10 days) and azithromycin (500 mg on day 1 and 250 mg on days 2–5). PCR after the drug regimen showed positive SARS-CoV 2 nucleic acids in 8 of the 10 patients, while 1 patient died. Although this was a relatively smaller study, the results showed a lack of clinical benefit of high dose HCQ plus azithromycin. They contradicted the results observed by Gautret 
 <italic>et al</italic>., casting suspicion to HCQ’s strong antiviral properties in COVID-19.
