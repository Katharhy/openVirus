 </sup> This randomised double-blinded phase IIb trial showed high fatality rates (27%, 95% CI: 17.9–38.2%) with high dose CQ (600 mg twice daily or 12 g total) when compared with the low dose (450 mg daily or 2.7 g total). Furthermore, QTc and higher lethality were observed more in the high CQ dose (18.9% and 39%, respectively). They concluded that higher CQ doses should not be recommended for COVID-19 treatment because of potential safety risks. These adverse events caused the premature halting of further patient enlistment.
