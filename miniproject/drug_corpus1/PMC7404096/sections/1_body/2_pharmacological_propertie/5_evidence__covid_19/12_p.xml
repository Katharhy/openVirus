 </sup> They screened 45 articles, of which 5 were chosen, including 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> preclinical research as well as clinical opinion papers. Preclinical studies and clinical opinions demonstrated the role of CQ/HCQ as a prophylactic measure for COVID-19. Meanwhile, there was no original clinical research to show the prophylactic effects of the CQ/HCQ. The authors concluded that the prophylactic use of these pharmaceutical agents still needs to be evaluated carefully in clinical studies due to the lack of clear evidence on prophylaxis and the specific safety concerns.
