<p>On 4 February 2020, an editorial in Springer Nature® conducted by Wang 
 <italic>et al.</italic> was one of the first to describe the effects of CQ in conjunction with other five antiviral drugs in Vero E6 cells infected with nCoV2019BetaCoV.

 </sup> They performed a standard 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assay in 2019-nCoV clinical specimens to elucidate the antiviral activity in terms of cytotoxicity, virus yield, and infection rate. Notably, their time-of-addition assay showed that CQ blocked the virus at low concentrations during both entry and post-entry phases of cellular infection. They concluded that CQ has a high prospect in 2019-nCoV as it is a standard drug with known safety profile, is relatively cheap, achieves a wide volume of distribution after oral intake, and can easily attain the EC90 seen in Vero E6 (6.90 μM) with standard 500 mg dose.
