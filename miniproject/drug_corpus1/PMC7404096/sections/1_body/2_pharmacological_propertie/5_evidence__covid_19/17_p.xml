<p>On 29 April 2020, Saleh 
 <italic>et al.</italic> conducted a prospective observational safety study to evaluate the effect of CQ, HCQ, and azithromycin in association with QT interval and risk of TdP and sudden cardiac death in COVID-19 patients.

 </sup> In this extensive cohort study to date with CQ/HCQ/azithromycin, no TdP or sudden death due to arrhythmia was noted. These medications did prolong the QT interval but did not lead to the discontinuation of therapy. They concluded that further research is needed to establish drug safety before a definitive recommendation can be made. In addition, a retrospective observational cohort safety study conducted by van den Broek 
 <italic>et al.</italic> on 29 April 2020, investigated CQ-induced QT prolongation in COVID-19 patients.

 </sup> They concluded that CQ leads to QT prolongation and recommended ECG monitoring of all patients taking CQ.
