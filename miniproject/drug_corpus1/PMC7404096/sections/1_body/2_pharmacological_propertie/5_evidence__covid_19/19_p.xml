 </sup> They concluded that healthcare professionals should dissuade from the clinical use of CQ/HCQ until the ongoing studies provide more evidence on efficacy and safety profiles. Similarly, on 5 May 2020, Jain 
 <italic>et al.</italic> conducted a safety study to establish an improved ECG monitor system of COVID-19 patients undergoing pharmaceutical treatment associated with a risk of QT prolongation.

 </sup> They created a tool called Situation Background Assessment Recommendation (SBAR) that identifies patients requiring ECG monitoring and tags QT prolongation within the ECGs. They showed that SBAR efficiently identified QT prolongation, with 95.1% being related to QT-prolonging medications.
