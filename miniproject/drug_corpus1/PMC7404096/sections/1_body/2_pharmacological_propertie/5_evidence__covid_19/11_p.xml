 </sup> Their study incorporated 62 COVID-19 patients, of whom 31 were administered an additional 400 mg/day HCQ for 5 days. They reported a shortened time to clinical recovery in regard to temperature and cough remission in the HCQ group. Also, a greater degree of improvement in pneumonia was noted compared with the control (80.6% 
 <italic>versus</italic> 54.8%). They concluded that HCQ could significantly decrease the clinical recovery time and enhance pneumonia absorption in COVID-19.
