 </sup> The trial involved 150 patients; 75 received HCQ along with standard care groups, while other 75 received standard care only. The probability of negative viral conversion was almost similar in the HCQ (85.4%, 95% CI: 71.8–93.8) and the standard of care group (81.3%, 95% CI: 71.2–89.6). But, adverse events were higher with HCQ than with standard of care (30% 
 <italic>versus</italic> 8.8%).
