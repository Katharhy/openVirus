 </sup> Based on the observations of 1376 consecutive patients with COVID-19 who received HCQ (600 mg twice daily on initial admission followed by 400 mg daily for 5 days), they conclude that there was no significant association of HCQ with lowering the risk of intubation or death (HR 1.04; 95% CI 0.82–1.32). Geleris 
 <italic>et al.</italic>

 </sup> concluded that HCQ should only be used within clinical trial settings unless its efficacy can be thoroughly tested and established. This study had many potential limitations, including missing data and inaccurate health record-keeping, incomplete documentation on smoking, and comorbidity status on patients as well as a single-centre design, limiting the generalisability of the study data.
