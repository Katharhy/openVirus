 </sup> They concluded that there was no significant association between HCQ use and a reduction or increased mortality rate due to COVID-19 complications (HR 1.08; 95% CI, 0.63â€“1.85). The majority of the observed fatalities are attributed to coexisting clinical comorbidities, like hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus, liver, or kidney dysfunction.
