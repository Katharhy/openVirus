<p>Furthermore, on 14 April 2020, a target French trial by Mahévas 
 <italic>et al.</italic> comprising 4 French hospitals to evaluate the effectiveness of HCQ in COVID-19 patients requiring oxygen was reported to be prematurely terminated following the unanticipated adverse drug events with high dose HCQ (600 mg daily), in particular, severe pulmonary and cardiogenic side effects.

 </sup> The study recruited 181 patients with COVID-19 induced pneumonia, of which 84 received HCQ while 97 did not. In total, 20.2% of patients receiving HCQ ended up in the ICU or had died within 1–7 days (primary endpoint) compared with 22.1% amongst those not taking HCQ [16 
 <italic>versus</italic> 21 adverse events; relative risk (RR) 0.91; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47–1.80]. The trial concluded that the use of HCQ against COVID-19 with hypoxic pneumonia should be discouraged.
