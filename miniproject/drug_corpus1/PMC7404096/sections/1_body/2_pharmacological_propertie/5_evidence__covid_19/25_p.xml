 </sup> the most significant ongoing open-labeled clinical trial to date in COVID-19 covering 175 hospitals throughout the United Kingdom (UK), published their result of the HCQ arm after a request from the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to the independent Data Monitoring Committee to review the trial. The trial results were published after randomisation of the 4674 patients; 1542 in the HCQ group and 3132 in the control group with usual care.
