 </sup> Efficacy was measured through quantification by viral clearance 
 <italic>via</italic> reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as well as all-cause mortality. The meta-analysis regarding viral clearance involved three studies with a total of 120 patients. It showed no benefit by HCQ on viral clearance (RR 1.05, 95% CI: 0.79–1.38; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.74 and I2 = 61.7%, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.007). Similarly, meta-analysis regarding all-cause death also involved three studies, but with a total of 474 patients. It revealed significantly higher rates of death with HCQ than with the control (RR 2.17, 95% CI: 1.32–3.57, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, I2 = 0.0%, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.43). Based on the given results, the authors recommended great caution in HCQ utility until further evidence from clinical trials is available.
