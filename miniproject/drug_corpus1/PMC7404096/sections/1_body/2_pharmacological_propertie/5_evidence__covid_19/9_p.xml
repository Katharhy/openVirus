<p>An open-label non-randomised French trial by Gautret 
 <italic>et al.</italic> on 20 March 2020, consisting of 36 patients (26 HCQ groups 
 <italic>versus</italic> 16 control groups), was conducted to investigate HCQ efficacy against COVID-19.

 </sup> Their primary endpoint was a virological clearance, as demonstrated by the negative nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results on the sixth day of inclusion. A significantly higher proportion of patients on the HCQ group (200 mg thrice-daily) achieved viral clearance as the primary outcome compared with the control (70% 
 <italic>versus</italic> 12.5%, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001). Similarly, patients treated with HCQ and azithromycin showed 100% viral clearance at the same time as 57.1% in HCQ only group and 12.5% in the control group (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The investigators concluded that HCQ, in conjunction with azithromycin, effectively reduces viral load in COVID-19. Although this study showed a promising clinical prospect of HCQ in COVID-19, either alone or in combination with azithromycin, their conclusion is severely limited due to the relatively small sample size.
