 </sup> on 9 March 2020, showed that both CQ and HCQ have appropriate antiviral effects with HCQ being more potent than CQ against COVID-19. They tested the antiviral activity of CQ/HCQ in Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV2 through ‘physiologically based pharmacokinetics’ models with five different HQ dosing regimens simulated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Their results showed that a twice-daily HCQ for 4 days (loading dose: 400 mg and maintenance dose: 200 mg) achieved three times the potency of the standard 500 mg CQ given in advance for 5 days. Following these outcomes, many clinical trials were launched across different health centers in China to evaluate the efficacy of CQ and HCQ in COVID-19.
