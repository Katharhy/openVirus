<p>The CQ and HCQ duo was one of the very first contenders in the race against COVID-19. Although there was no high-quality clinical evidence of CQ/HCQ against SARS and/or MERS, the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> results of CQ/HCQ were promising. Therefore, as SARS-CoV 2 shared genetics and pathological similarities with SARS/MERS within the coronavirus families, CQ/HCQ were considered to be initial candidates for drug repurposing in COVID-19.
