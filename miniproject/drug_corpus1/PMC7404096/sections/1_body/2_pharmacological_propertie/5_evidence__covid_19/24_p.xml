 </sup> In total, 821 positive COVID-19 patients were enrolled. Following 4 days of exposure, participants were allocated randomly to either a placebo group or a treatment group. Participants in the treatment group were given the initial dose of 800 mg HCQ, followed by 600 mg in 6–8 h, and 600 mg daily for 4 days. Primary outcomes were set as confirmed COVID-19 infection or COVID-19-like illness occurring during 14 days post exposure. Post-exposure prophylaxis was not observed with HCQ as there was no significant difference between the HCQ group and placebo (11.8% 
 <italic>versus</italic> 14.3%, absolute difference −2.4 percentage points; 95% CI: −7.0 to 2.2; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.35), although a higher side effect profile was observed with HCQ than placebo (40.2% 
 <italic>versus</italic> 16.8%). Boulware 
 <italic>et al.</italic> concluded that HCQ is not effective at preventing COVID-19 infection and does not show the benefits of post-exposure prophylaxis.
