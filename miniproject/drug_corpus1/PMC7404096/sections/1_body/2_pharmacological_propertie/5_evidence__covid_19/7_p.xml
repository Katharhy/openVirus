 </sup> More patients in the control group achieved a higher negative pharyngeal swab of viral nucleic acid at 7 days following the randomisation as the primary outcome (93.3%, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 14 
 <italic>versus</italic> 86.7%, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 13, 
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). While only one patient in the HCQ intervention group progressed to develop a severe infection, the authors suggested probable discrepancies in outcomes to relatively small sample sizes. They recommended more extensive studies to evaluate the conclusive effect of the drug.
