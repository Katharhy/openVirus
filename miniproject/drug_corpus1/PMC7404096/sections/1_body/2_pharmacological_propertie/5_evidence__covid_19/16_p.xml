 </sup> The study evaluated 368 veterans in three groups; 97 HCQ, 113 ‘HCQ plus azithromycin’, and 158 without HCQ. The death rate was seen to be 27.8%, 22.1%, 11.4% in the HCQ, ‘HCQ plus azithromycin’, and non-HCQ group, respectively. The risk of death was observed to be significantly higher in HCQ groups [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 2.61, 95% CI 1.10–6.17, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.03]; however, this was not significant in ‘HCQ plus azithromycin’ groups (adjusted HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.56–2.32; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.72). They emphasised to exercise caution and patience on awaiting further evidence on the efficacy of the HCQ before the extensive adoption of these therapies in the clinical settings.
