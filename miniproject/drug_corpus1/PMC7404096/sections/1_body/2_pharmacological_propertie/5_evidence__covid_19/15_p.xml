 </sup> Seven studies were incorporated into this systematic review, with a total of 1358 participants. Compared with the control groups, HCQ showed reduced radiological progression in lung injury [odds ratio (OR) 0.31, 95% CI 0.11–0.9], while no significant difference was seen in virological cure (OR 2.37, 95% CI 0.13–44.53), death or symptomatic worsening of illness (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.37–21.97) and safety (OR 2.19, 95% CI 0.59–8.18). They stressed the need for more convincing study and comprehensive data to reach a definitive consensus, despite having promising early results of HCQ and azithromycin in COVID-19.
