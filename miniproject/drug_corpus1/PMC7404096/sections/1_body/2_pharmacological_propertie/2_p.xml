<p>CQ and HCQ share similar pharmacokinetics, with rapid absorption from the gastro-intestinal surfaces, and are renally and hepatically eliminated. As they are weak bases, they increase the pH of acidic vesicles.

 </sup> Notably, HCQ increases intracellular pH levels by inhibiting lysosomal activity in immune cells to prevent downstream immune cell interaction, antigen processing, and cytokine responses. Furthermore, the increment in the pH interferes with viral entry into endosomes and blocks viral-endosome fusion.
