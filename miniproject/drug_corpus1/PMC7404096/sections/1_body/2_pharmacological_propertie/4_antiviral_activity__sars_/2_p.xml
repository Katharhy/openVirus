<p>Mallucci conducted one of the first animal studies in 1966 to demonstrate the antiviral activity of CQ on lysosomes of hepatitis virus-infected mouse cells.

 </sup> The mechanism of inhibition was unknown before the animal studies, and CQ was believed to lower virus yield, hypothesised by the prevention of new viral synthesis or viral uncoating. In 1972, Shimizu 
 <italic>et al.</italic> investigated the antiviral effects of CQ on non-oncogenic viruses in animal cell culture.

 </sup> They reported the antiviral effect of CQ on chick embryo cells infected with vesicular stomatitis virus with a subsequent reduction in the viral yield. The antiviral activities were attributed to the selective inhibition of vesicular stomatitis viral RNA without interfering with RNA synthesis in the host cells. In 1971, Lancz 
 <italic>et al.</italic> showed CQ inhibiting herpes simplex virus replication in HeLa cell cultures,

 </sup> However, they were unable to prove the inhibition 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Other studies in the late 1970s and mid-1980s reported CQ-induced inhibition of endocytosis and viral particle entry into cells, interfering with lysosomal enzyme activity, and preventing viral uncoating and multiplication and inhibition of DNA polymerase through intercalation.
