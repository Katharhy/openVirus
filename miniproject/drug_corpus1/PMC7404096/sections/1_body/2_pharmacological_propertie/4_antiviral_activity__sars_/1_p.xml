<p>Clark, in 1952, conducted studies depicting the potential anti-microbial activity of CQ by effective inhibition of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis on a protozoan parasite, 
 <italic>Plasmodium gallinaceum</italic>.

 </sup> This led to further investigations by Schellenberg and Coatney in 1960,

 </sup> who demonstrated CQ-induced inhibition of the incorporation of radioactively labelled nucleic acid substituents in DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA) of 
 <italic>Plasmodium gallinaceum.</italic> These studies showed that CQ could inhibit the nucleic acid, and this nucleic-acid inhibitory potential could be utilised in viruses.
