<p>Although there were some promising results concerning CQ/HCQ in SARS/MERS, most of these credible pieces of evidence were based on

Only a few clinical studies were available, which were methodologically inferior with small sample size, high dropout rates, variable baseline viral loads compared with monotherapy, and combination therapy of CQ/HCQ and differences in toxicities, which impacted the quality and validity of the results obtained.
