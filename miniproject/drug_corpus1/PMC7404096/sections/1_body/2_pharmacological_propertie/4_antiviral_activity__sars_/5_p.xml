 </sup> These inhibitory effects were noted with CQ treatment both before and after exposure to the SARS virus, suggesting its prophylactic as well as therapeutic utility. Vincent

 </sup> found that CQ interferes with the terminal glycosylation process of cellular receptors, particularly angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with the potential to prevent virus-receptor interaction, and interferes with viral spreading by increasing vesicular pH levels.
