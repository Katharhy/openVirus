<p>In 1994, Pazimo Yuhas and Tennant showed CQ/HCQ induced inhibition of retroviral infections in Moloney leukemia virus-cell cultures.

 </sup> During the same period, Tsai 
 <italic>et al.</italic> illustrated antiviral activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on the H9 cell line and avian reticuloendotheliosis virus on chick bone marrow cells resulting in the reduction in viral yield through the inhibition of viral protein glycosylation in the Golgi complex by CQ.

 </sup> The antiviral activity of CQ was reinforced by further studies conducted by Sperber 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, Chiang 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, and Boelaert 
 <italic>et al.</italic> by demonstrating the interference of HIV replication in T cells and monocytes.

 </sup> These studies were the fundamental basis of drug repurposing of CQ/HCQ on subsequent viral epidemics. They opened the door for many further studies on CQ/HCQ, either alone or in combination with other antiviral drugs.
