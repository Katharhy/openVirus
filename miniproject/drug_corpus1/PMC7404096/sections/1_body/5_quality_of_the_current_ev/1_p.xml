 </sup> They concluded that the available clinical studies have many limitations, including sample size, unclear reporting of study methodology, no blinding and/or randomisation, missing clinical data, inconsistencies in treatment 
 <italic>versus</italic> control groups such as groups taken from different healthcare centers, lack of control groups, lack of matching and stratification, inconsistent and low event rates, and an unadjusted analysis. Observational studies can lead to biases, like selection, collider, and confounding bias, that can significantly influence studies outcomes, making them challenging to interpret and/or replicate.
