<p>Although we did not perform the quality assessment of the available studies, the majority of the available studies were case-based small studies that are often not controlled with randomisation and/or standardisation. There is no denial that high-quality research, such as RCTs or extensive registry-based observational studies, are still warranted to have conclusive evidence before reaching any consensus. Despite these methodological challenges, it is still up to the research community and clinicians to accurately appraise studies and prioritise the publication of credible evidence.
