<p>Current clinical recommendations on CQ/HCQ in COVID-19 are not backed by substantial evidence, and most of the studies are methodologically inferior. In this unique circumstance, we are made to decide between providing medical care or producing reliable and scientifically valid data. This dilemma may lead to compromising the generation of evidence-based and clinically reliable results. In many cases, drugs like CQ and HCQ are being given compassionately due to the severe nature of the disease, despite the discrepancies and safety warnings. As there is insufficient clinical evidence to either refute or accept the use of CQ/HCQ in COVID-19, we would like to advise physicians across the globe to avoid high dose and exercise extreme caution in the compassionate use of CQ/HCQ, particularly in patients with cardiac comorbidities.</p>
