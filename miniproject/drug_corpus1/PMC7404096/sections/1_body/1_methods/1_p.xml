<p>A literature review was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar to identify all relevant English language scientific studies based on our study objectives. Non-specific combinations of the search strings included (Coronavirus OR Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome OR SARS OR SARS-CoV OR Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome OR MERS OR MERS-CoV OR Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR 2019-nCoV OR Coronavirus disease OR COVID-19) AND (Quinine OR Chloroquine OR CQ OR Hydroxychloroquine OR HCQ), in association with related pharmacology and antiviral activity. For additional studies, we also searched 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://medRxiv.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">medRxiv.org</ext-link>, the largest preprint repository of clinical medicine. Studies that analysed the efficacy and safety of CQ/HCQ in SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> models were included. Due to the scarcity of randomised control trials (RCT), other relevant studies, such as observational studies, case reports, case series, and review articles, were also incorporated. Studies conducted in the paediatric population and pregnant women were excluded. An independent analysis of the included studies was performed with a secondary reference search for the relevant supplementary studies.
