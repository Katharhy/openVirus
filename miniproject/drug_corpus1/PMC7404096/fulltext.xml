Despite uncertainties in the viral determinants and pathogenesis, it is crucial to accurately inspect all available evidence to construct accurate clinical guidelines for optimised patient care. This study aims to discuss the available evidence for the use of chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) against COVID-19. Early <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of CQ/HCQ against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are convincing. But contradictory evidence exists on the clinical use of CQ/HCQ, either alone or in combination with azithromycin. As of now, there is no compelling clinical evidence on CQ, HCQ, and azithromycin in COVID-19 and the available evidence is limited to methodologically inferior non-randomised studies. Studies have also shown detrimental drug reactions to CQ and &#x02018;HCQ plus azithromycin&#x02019;, mainly cardiac side effects in hospitalised patients with coexisting cardiovascular comorbidities. Therefore, we recommend that physicians avoid high doses and exercise extreme caution in the compassionate use of CQ/HCQ, either alone or in combination with other antiviral drugs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>chloroquine</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>evidence</kwd><kwd>hydroxychloroquine</kwd><kwd>review</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-December 2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>typesetter</meta-name><meta-value>ts1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-2049936120947517"><title>Introduction</title><p>The sudden outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), stemming from a novel coronavirus originating from Wuhan, China, has grown into a global pandemic as the third major outbreak of the virulent coronavirus family after Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2049936120947517" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Despite radical containment efforts, the SARS Coronavirus 2 (CoV 2) continues to spread globally.

The CQ/HCQ belongs to the same family of weak bases, alkylated 4-aminoquinolines.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2049936120947517" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> HCQ differs due to the presence of a hydroxyl group in its side chain with N-ethyl substitute being beta-hydroxylated. Both can easily cross cell membranes, with HCQ being more polar with a lower lipophilic effect.</p><p>CQ and HCQ share similar pharmacokinetics, with rapid absorption from the gastro-intestinal surfaces, and are renally and hepatically eliminated. As they are weak bases, they increase the pH of acidic vesicles.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2049936120947517" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Notably, HCQ increases intracellular pH levels by inhibiting lysosomal activity in immune cells to prevent downstream immune cell interaction, antigen processing, and cytokine responses. Furthermore, the increment in the pH interferes with viral entry into endosomes and blocks viral-endosome fusion.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2049936120947517" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>Although CQ and HCQ are relatively well-tolerated, both drugs are associated with systemic adverse effects, including QT syndrome, hypoglycemia, hepatitis, pancreatitis, neutropenia, retinopathy, anaphylaxis, and cardiac toxicities.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2049936120947517" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued warnings on CQ/HCQ, particularly based on the associated cardiac side-effects.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2049936120947517" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The CQ/HCQ, either alone or in combination with other drugs like azithromycin, can cause possible cardiac complications, including conduction defects, such as bundle branch blocks, atrioventricular blocks, QT prolongation, torsades de point (TdP), and even dangerous ventricular arrhythmias.

They stressed the need for more convincing study and comprehensive data to reach a definitive consensus, despite having promising early results of HCQ and azithromycin in COVID-19.</p><p>On 23 April 2020, a retrospective study by Magognoli <italic>et al.</italic> evaluated HCQ, either alone or in combination with azithromycin in COVID-19.<sup><xref rid="bibr43-2049936120947517" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> The study evaluated 368 veterans in three groups; 97 HCQ, 113 &#x02018;HCQ plus azithromycin&#x02019;, and 158 without HCQ. The death rate was seen to be 27.8%, 22.1%, 11.4% in the HCQ, &#x02018;HCQ plus azithromycin&#x02019;, and non-HCQ group, respectively. The risk of death was observed to be significantly higher in HCQ groups [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 2.61, 95% CI 1.10&#x02013;6.17, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03]; however, this was not significant in &#x02018;HCQ plus azithromycin&#x02019; groups (adjusted HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.56&#x02013;2.32; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.72). They emphasised to exercise caution and patience on awaiting further evidence on the efficacy of the HCQ before the extensive adoption of these therapies in the clinical settings.</p><p>On 29 April 2020, Saleh <italic>et al.</italic> conducted a prospective observational safety study to evaluate the effect of CQ, HCQ, and azithromycin in association with QT interval and risk of TdP and sudden cardiac death in COVID-19 patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr44-2049936120947517" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> In this extensive cohort study to date with CQ/HCQ/azithromycin, no TdP or sudden death due to arrhythmia was noted. These medications did prolong the QT interval but did not lead to the discontinuation of therapy. They concluded that further research is needed to establish drug safety before a definitive recommendation can be made. In addition, a retrospective observational cohort safety study conducted by van den Broek <italic>et al.</italic> on 29 April 2020, investigated CQ-induced QT prolongation in COVID-19 patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr45-2049936120947517" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> They concluded that CQ leads to QT prolongation and recommended ECG monitoring of all patients taking CQ.</p><p>Similarly, on 1 May 2020, Mercuro <italic>et al.</italic> in Boston, Massachusetts, investigated the risk of QT prolongation with the use of HCQ with or without azithromycin used in combination in COVID-19 confirmed-patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr46-2049936120947517" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> They observed that patients receiving HCQ as a treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia were at significant risk for QT prolongation and that parallel treatment with azithromycin further elevated the risk. They emphasised extreme caution and careful monitoring of the patients with a careful weighing of both risk and benefits before initiation of the treatment with HCQ/azithromycin.</p><p>On 2 May 2020, a rapid systematic review consisting of clinical trials carried out by Chowdhury, Rathod and Gernsheimer showed inadequate evidence to encourage the use of CQ/HCQ in COVID-19.<sup><xref rid="bibr58-2049936120947517" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup> They concluded that healthcare professionals should dissuade from the clinical use of CQ/HCQ until the ongoing studies provide more evidence on efficacy and safety profiles. Similarly, on 5 May 2020, Jain <italic>et al.</italic> conducted a safety study to establish an improved ECG monitor system of COVID-19 patients undergoing pharmaceutical treatment associated with a risk of QT prolongation.<sup><xref rid="bibr47-2049936120947517" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> They created a tool called Situation Background Assessment Recommendation (SBAR) that identifies patients requiring ECG monitoring and tags QT prolongation within the ECGs. They showed that SBAR efficiently identified QT prolongation, with 95.1% being related to QT-prolonging medications.</p><p>Furthermore, on 7 May 2020, Geleris <italic>et al.</italic> conducted an observational study to determine an association between HCQ and the need for intubation or risk of death.<sup><xref rid="bibr48-2049936120947517" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> Based on the observations of 1376 consecutive patients with COVID-19 who received HCQ (600&#x02009;mg twice daily on initial admission followed by 400&#x02009;mg daily for 5&#x02009;days), they conclude that there was no significant association of HCQ with lowering the risk of intubation or death (HR 1.04; 95% CI 0.82&#x02013;1.32). Geleris <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="bibr48-2049936120947517" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> concluded that HCQ should only be used within clinical trial settings unless its efficacy can be thoroughly tested and established. This study had many potential limitations, including missing data and inaccurate health record-keeping, incomplete documentation on smoking, and comorbidity status on patients as well as a single-centre design, limiting the generalisability of the study data.</p><p>An open-labeled randomised controlled trial was published on 7 May 2020, by Tang <italic>et al.</italic>, to assess the HCQ&#x02019;s efficacy and safety against COVID-19.<sup><xref rid="bibr49-2049936120947517" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> The trial involved 150 patients; 75 received HCQ along with standard care groups, while other 75 received standard care only. The probability of negative viral conversion was almost similar in the HCQ (85.4%, 95% CI: 71.8&#x02013;93.8) and the standard of care group (81.3%, 95% CI: 71.2&#x02013;89.6). But, adverse events were higher with HCQ than with standard of care (30% <italic>versus</italic> 8.8%).</p><p>On 11 May 2020, Rosenberg <italic>et al.</italic> reported a retrospective multicentre cohort study involving 1438 patients to evaluate an association between HCQ and COVID-19-induced mortality.<sup><xref rid="bibr50-2049936120947517" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> They concluded that there was no significant association between HCQ use and a reduction or increased mortality rate due to COVID-19 complications (HR 1.08; 95% CI, 0.63&#x02013;1.85). The majority of the observed fatalities are attributed to coexisting clinical comorbidities, like hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus, liver, or kidney dysfunction.</p><p>A systematic review and meta-analysis was published on 12 March 2020, by Singh <italic>et al.</italic> to summarise available evidence of HCQ in COVID-19.<sup><xref rid="bibr59-2049936120947517" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup> Efficacy was measured through quantification by viral clearance <italic>via</italic> reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as well as all-cause mortality. The meta-analysis regarding viral clearance involved three studies with a total of 120 patients. It showed no benefit by HCQ on viral clearance (RR 1.05, 95% CI: 0.79&#x02013;1.38; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.74 and I2&#x02009;=&#x02009;61.7%, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.007). Similarly, meta-analysis regarding all-cause death also involved three studies, but with a total of 474 patients. It revealed significantly higher rates of death with HCQ than with the control (RR 2.17, 95% CI: 1.32&#x02013;3.57, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002, I2&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0%, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.43). Based on the given results, the authors recommended great caution in HCQ utility until further evidence from clinical trials is available.</p><p>On 3 June 2020, Boulware <italic>et al.</italic> reported on an RCT that evaluated HCQ&#x02019;s effect on preventing symptomatic illness following SARS-CoV 2 exposure.<sup><xref rid="bibr51-2049936120947517" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> In total, 821 positive COVID-19 patients were enrolled. Following 4&#x02009;days of exposure, participants were allocated randomly to either a placebo group or a treatment group. Participants in the treatment group were given the initial dose of 800&#x02009;mg HCQ, followed by 600&#x02009;mg in 6&#x02013;8&#x02009;h, and 600&#x02009;mg daily for 4&#x02009;days. Primary outcomes were set as confirmed COVID-19 infection or COVID-19-like illness occurring during 14&#x02009;days post exposure. Post-exposure prophylaxis was not observed with HCQ as there was no significant difference between the HCQ group and placebo (11.8% <italic>versus</italic> 14.3%, absolute difference &#x02212;2.4&#x02009;percentage points; 95% CI: &#x02212;7.0 to 2.2; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.35), although a higher side effect profile was observed with HCQ than placebo (40.2% <italic>versus</italic> 16.8%). Boulware <italic>et al.</italic> concluded that HCQ is not effective at preventing COVID-19 infection and does not show the benefits of post-exposure prophylaxis.<sup><xref rid="bibr51-2049936120947517" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup></p><p>Furthermore, on 4 June 2020, Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 therapy (RECOVERY) Trial,<sup><xref rid="bibr52-2049936120947517" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> the most significant ongoing open-labeled clinical trial to date in COVID-19 covering 175 hospitals throughout the United Kingdom (UK), published their result of the HCQ arm after a request from the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to the independent Data Monitoring Committee to review the trial. The trial results were published after randomisation of the 4674 patients; 1542 in the HCQ group and 3132 in the control group with usual care. No significant difference was observed in the primary outcome of all-cause mortality within 28&#x02009;days (25.7% <italic>versus</italic> 23.5%, HR 1.11, 95% CI: 0.98&#x02013;1.26; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.10). The RECOVERY trial concluded no mortality benefit with HCQ in COVID-19 patients, leading to the stoppage of any further participants&#x02019; enrollment in the HCQ arm.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section6-2049936120947517"><title>Safety warning on CQ/HCQ</title><p>Apart from a general warning, the FDA has cautioned against the indiscriminate use of CQ/HCQ, either alone or in combination with azithromycin, in COVID-19 patients due to the potential linkage to cardiac toxicities, including severe complications like rhythm disturbances.<sup><xref rid="bibr60-2049936120947517" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup> While the FDA continues to explore these adverse events and will communicate their findings with the public once more information becomes available, the latest COVID-19 NIH Treatment Guidelines Panel recommends &#x02018;against using high-dose chloroquine (600&#x02009;mg twice daily for 10&#x02009;days) for the treatment of COVID-19 (AI), because the high dose carries a higher risk of toxicities than the lower dose&#x02019;.<sup><xref rid="bibr61-2049936120947517" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup> Similarly, the EMA has advised the close monitoring of the COVID-19 patients receiving CQ/HCQ.<sup><xref rid="bibr54-2049936120947517" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="section7-2049936120947517"><title>Recommendation</title><p>Current clinical recommendations on CQ/HCQ in COVID-19 are not backed by substantial evidence, and most of the studies are methodologically inferior.

In many cases, drugs like CQ and HCQ are being given compassionately due to the severe nature of the disease, despite the discrepancies and safety warnings.
