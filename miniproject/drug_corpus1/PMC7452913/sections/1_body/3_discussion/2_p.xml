<p id="p0140">Nsp13 helicase enzyme and Nsp14 protein are among the 16 non-structural proteins formed from the processing of viral replicative polyproteins-pp1a and pp1ab. These two proteins are the key components of the viral replication and transcription complexes which are essential for the life cycle of SARS-coronavirus. Both the proteins are highly conserved within the 
 <italic>coronaviridae</italic> family members. While Nsp13 helicase utilizes the energy derived from NTP hydrolysis to unwind duplex oligonucleotides into single strands, Nsp14 exhibits dual functions such as proofreading 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity conferred by the ExoN domain and methylation of guanosine cap by the N7-MTase domain. Because of the indispensability of both the proteins to complete the life cycle of the coronavirus, they are promising drug targets. Due to the paucity of the three-dimensional experimental structures of both the proteins, the structure-based drug discovery of specific inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp13 helicase and Nsp14 is a challenge. However, in the absence of experimental structures of the target proteins, a bioinformatics approach driven structural elucidation is another promising alternative.

 <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Mirza and Froeyen, 2020</xref>). In the present study, SARS-CoV-2 Nsp13 helicase and Nsp14 protein sequences were checked for homology against human proteome. Nsp14 did not show any significant hit whereas the nearest homolog of Nsp13 was found to be Zinc Finger GRF-Type Containing 1 (ZGRF1) isoform X10 showed both less identity and low query coverage in the DNA2 superfamily domain. However, the binding pocket of Nsp13 does not include the DNA2 superfamily domain and therefore, the antiviral drugs are highly likely to exhibit less binding affinity to the human homolog thereby causing minimal adverse reactions. Both the structures of Nsp13 helicase and Nsp14 
 <italic>in silico</italic> models were generated using the homologous structures from SARS-CoV. The 
 <italic>in silico</italic> models were validated using different parameters and both the models were found to be reliable and robust for further studies. Subsequently, these structures were utilized to probe the binding of FDA approved drugs to identify their respective potential inhibitors. Virtual screening of FDA approved drugs screening is the most promising strategy available as these drugs have already been tested in clinical trials and have proven antiviral activity which reduces both the time and costs incurred in the discovery of novel drugs. The NTPase domain of Nsp13 helicase and N7-MTase domain of Nsp14 were targeted by FDA approved drugs in the present study. NTPase domain consists of residues which are vital for the NTP hydrolysis activity essential for the unwinding of a duplex nucleic acid molecule and N7-MTase domain has a pocket consisting of binding of substrate SAH. A set of 54 approved drugs were screened for their Out of 54 approved drugs, three lead molecules were identified for each target proteins. These lead molecules are accepted drugs which are potent inhibitors of hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease (
 <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">De Clercq and Li, 2016</xref>). Interestingly, the top 3 hits- Simeprevir (SMV), Paritaprevir (PTV) and Grazoprevir (GZR) were also the top leads identified for Nsp14 protein and therefore, these molecules can be used as dual inhibitors. It is a novel finding and provides an opportunity to design dual inhibitors for both the target proteins sharing similar functions and further can disrupt the RTC machinery thereby impeding the infectious cycle of the coronavirus. The present study would pave the way for the discovery of dual-target inhibitors and help understand how a single molecule could be designed to block the pathogenic cycle of the deadly virus. This approach is more advantageous over the conventional one target-one drug approach given the fact that the actions and interactions of many proteins drive the pathogenesis of the disease and blocking one target might be less effective. Previously, 
 <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. (2015)</xref> attempted to design selective dual inhibitor of both Papain-like Protease (PL
 <sup>pro</sup>) enzymes of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV and demonstrated that 8-(Trifluoromethyl)-9H-purin-6-amine acts as an allosteric inhibitor against SARS-CoV (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 11 μM) and a competitive inhibitor against MERS-CoV (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 6.0 μM). 
 <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al. (2020)</xref> discovered calpain II and XII inhibitors as potent SARS-CoV-2 antivirals and concluded that design of dual inhibitors against the viral Main protease (M
 <sup>pro</sup>) and the host calpains/cathepsins might be attainable given that both of which are essential for viral replication. The studies further highlighted an additional benefit of dual inhibitors in providing a high genetic barrier to drug resistance. It would be interesting to study the dynamics of the proteins complexed with the inhibitors which will provide further mechanistic insights into the modes of inhibition though time-dependent conformational changes in the structures of the protein and the stability of the inhibitors within the active site pocket of the proteins. Various 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> biological assays are further needed to validate the findings of the present study.
