<p id="p0090">Each drug molecule along with the control inhibitors was docked into the active site pocket of Nsp13 helicase enzyme and Nsp14 protein using AutoDock 4.2 (
 <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Morris et al., 2009</xref>). A grid box with xyz coordinates of 411.902, 36.890 and 63.540, number of grid points of 70 × 70 × 70 and grid point spacing of 0.375 Å was used for Nsp13 helicase enzyme whereas in case of Nsp14 the grid box was centred at x: −8.5767 y: −44.469, z: −5.2724 with number of grid points of 70 × 70 × 70 and grid point spacing of 0.375 Å. The molecular docking was carried out using Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA) with the parameters specified as follows- a) An initial population size of 150 individuals, maximum number of 2,500,000 energy evaluations, the maximum number of 27,000 generations, the gene mutation rate of 0.02 and cross over rate of 0.8 with number of 50 GA runs. The conformations were clustered based on root mean square deviation (RMSD) cut off value of 2.0. The most favourable binding conformation was selected based on the lowest binding energy and lowest inhibition constant values. The nature of molecular interactions between the ligand and the enzyme was studied using LigPlot+ version 1.4.5 program (
