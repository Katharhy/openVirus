<p id="p0030">SARS coronavirus is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus with the largest known RNA genome size of approximately 29.7 kb (
 <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Marra et al., 2003</xref>). There are many aspects of SARS-CoV gene expression which is still yet to be understood at the transcription and translational levels (
 <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Adedeji et al., 2012a</xref>). Upon entry into the host cell, the virus initiates the synthesis of two large replicative polyproteins- pp1a and the pp1ab from the ORF1a and ORF1b respectively (
 <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Prentice et al., 2004</xref>). Subsequently, the virus-encoded papain-like proteinase (PL
 <sup>pro</sup>) and 3C-like proteinase (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>) processes these polyproteins (
 <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Thiel et al., 2003</xref>). The cleavage activity of these proteases leads to the release of 16 non-structural proteins (Nsps) which include Nsp12 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), Nsp13 (NTPase/helicase) and nps14 (
 <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Prentice et al., 2004</xref>). These proteins are the key components of replication-transcription complexes (RTC) indispensable for the life cycle of SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Van Hemert et al., 2008</xref>). The structural information about SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 helicase enzyme and nsp14 are poorly understood as the structure of both the proteins have not been elucidated till date and much of the information about them are derived from their corresponding structures from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. SARS-CoV Nsp13 helicase enzyme plays a key role in catalysing the unwinding of double-stranded oligonucleotides into single strands using energy derived from hydrolysis of NTPs (
 <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Jia et al., 2019</xref>). Based on conserved motifs and the ability to unwind both RNA and DNA duplexes in the 5′ to 3′ direction, SARS-Nsp13 belongs to superfamily 1 (SF1) (
 <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Fairman-Williams et al., 2010</xref>). All natural nucleotides and deoxynucleotides can be targeted as substrates by the cognate NTPase activity of the helicase enzyme (
 <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Ivanov et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Tanner et al., 2003</xref>). The sequence conservation and essentiality of the Nsp13 helicase enzyme across all coronaviruses have provided an opportunity to target this enzyme for the development of anti-viral drugs (
 <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Adedeji et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Jang et al., 2008</xref>). Both MERS- and SARS-CoV Nsp13 has a triangular pyramid architecture and is composed of five domains. While the two domains including the N-terminal Zinc binding domain (ZBD) and the stalk domain are pointed towards the apex of the pyramid, the remaining three domains comprising of two ‘RecA-like’ domains known as 1A and 2A and the 1B domain constitutes the triangular base of the pyramid (
 <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Jia et al., 2019</xref>). The NTPase activity of the enzyme resides in a cleft located at the base between 1A and 2A domains and consists of six important residues such as Lys288, Ser289, Asp374, Glu375, Gln404 and Arg567 (
 <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Jia et al., 2019</xref>). Four basic amino acid residues such as Arg337, Arg339, Lys345 and Lys347 positioned at the entrance of nucleic acid binding channel are critical for the unwinding activity of the helicase enzyme (
