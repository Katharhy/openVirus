<p id="p0035">The other target protein chosen in the present study is the Nsp14 protein which is important for viral replication and transcription and is highly conserved within the Coronaviridae family (
 <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Becares et al., 2016</xref>). SARS-CoV Nsp14 is a bimodular protein with the proofreading 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity in the exon domain (residues 1–287) located at the N-terminal region and residues 288–527 constitute the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent (guanine-N7) methyltransferase (N7-MTase) domain located at the C-terminal region (
 <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2015</xref>). While the exon domain confers replication fidelity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) by excising mismatched nucleotides during RNA biosynthesis process (
 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Denison et al., 2011</xref>), the N7-MTase domain helps in assembly of 5′ viral mRNA cap structure by addition of a methyl group to the cap guanosine at the N7 position which is essential for the stability of mRNAs, translation process and evading host defence (

 <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Marcotrigiano et al., 1997</xref>). The N7-MTase domain contains binding pockets for the substrates-S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) and Guanosine-P3-adenosine-5′,5′-triphosphate (GpppA) wherein residues Trp292, Asp331, Gly333, Pro335, Lys336, Asp352 and Val389 are important for SAH binding and GpppA binding pocket consists of residues-Asn306, Arg310, Trp385, Asn386, Phe401, Leu419, Tyr420, Asn422, Lys423, Phe426, Thr428, Phe506 (

The structures of the proteins are not available in the protein data bank. In the present study, comparative homology modelling was used to decipher the structures of the target proteins and these
