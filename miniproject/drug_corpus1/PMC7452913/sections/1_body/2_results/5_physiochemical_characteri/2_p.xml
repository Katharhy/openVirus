<p id="p0110">The physicochemical properties of Nsp13 helicase and Nsp14 proteins are enumerated in 
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> . The molecular weight for Nsp13 helicase and Nsp14 was calculated to be 66.85 kDa and 59.82 kDa respectively. Nsp13 helicase and Nsp14 have a theoretical isoelectric point (pI) of 8.66 and 7.80 respectively which indicates that the surface of both the proteins is positively charged (basic). The number of negatively charged residues (Asp and Glu) in Nsp13 helicase and Nsp14 was found to be 52 and 50 respectively whereas the number of positively charged residues (Arg and Lys) present in Nsp13 helicase and Nsp14 were 64 and 52 respectively. The extinction coefficient values of Nsp13 helicase and Nsp14 were found to be 68,785 M

An aliphatic index of 84.49 and 78.96 was found for Nsp13 helicase and Nsp14 respectively. The aliphatic index of a protein gives an idea about the relative volume occupied by amino acids having aliphatic side chain structures such as Ala, Val, Leu and Ile (
