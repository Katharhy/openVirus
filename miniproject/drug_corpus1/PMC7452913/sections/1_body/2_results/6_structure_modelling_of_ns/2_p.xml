<p id="p0115">The experimental structure of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp13 helicase and Nsp14 have not been reported to date which are the major deterrents in the structure-based discovery of inhibitors. In the present study, three dimensional 
 <italic>in silico</italic> model of the target proteins were deciphered using a comparative homology modelling approach. This approach uses the search for the most similar structure to the query sequence. Based on the BLASTp results against PDB database, the most suitable template for 
 <italic>in silico</italic> modelling was found to be the X-ray crystal structure of Nsp13 helicase protein from SARS-CoV which shows percent identity of 98.50%, query coverage of 100% and E-value of 0.0 (Suppl. Fig. 3A). Out of five 
 <italic>in silico</italic> models, Model 5 was chosen to be the best structure for further studies since it has the lowest MOLPDF value (4498.63232), low discrete optimized protein energy (DOPE) score (−63,878.37500) and GA341 score of 1 (
 <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> ). A GA341 score of 1 indicates that the model has a correctly folded structure similar to native conformation of the protein. A reliable model usually has the lowest MOLPDF score, lowest DOPE score and GA341 score close to 1. Similarly, the 
 <italic>in silico</italic> model for Nsp14 protein was constructed using homology modelling approach and the most suitable template identified was the X-ray crystal structure of the SARS coronavirus Nsp14 with a resolution of 3.33 Å. The template structure has a total score of 1071, query coverage of 100%, E-value of 0.0 and identity of 95.07% with the query sequence (Suppl. Fig. 3B). Out of five 
 <italic>in silico</italic> models, model 1 was chosen to be the best structure which exhibits the lowest MOLPDF value (3168.02441), lowest DOPE score (−57,913.47656) and GA341 score of 1 (
 <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).
