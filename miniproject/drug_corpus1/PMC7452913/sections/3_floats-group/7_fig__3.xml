  <p>(A) Surface representation of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp13 helicase enzyme highlighting the five domains-ZBD (turquoise), stalk (yellow), 1B (orchid), 1A (light green) and 2A (light blue) along with the ligand-binding pocket (black encircled region). The binding conformation and molecular interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Nsp13 helicase enzyme and (B) Simeprevir (SMV) (C) Paritaprevir (PTV) (D) Grazoprevir (GZR) (E) Scutellarin (control inhibitor). The coloured spheres are labelled with the residue name and residue number where different colours represent the residue type such as red indicating acidic residues (Asp and Glu), green indicating hydrophobic residues (Ala, Val, Ile, Leu, Tyr, Phe, Trp, Met, Cys and Pro), purple indicating basic residues (Lys and Arg), blue indicating polar residues (Ser, Thr, Gln, Asn and His), light grey indicating others (Gly and water) and darker grey indicating metal atoms. The molecular interactions between ligand atoms and protein residues are represented as a solid pink line indicating H-bonds to the protein backbone, dotted pink indicating H-bonds to protein side chains, green indicating pi-pi stacking interactions and orange indicating pi-cation interactions. The grey spheres are the ligand atoms that are exposed to solvent. The binding pocket is displayed with a curve line around the ligand, coloured with the colour of the nearest protein residue. The opening of the pocket is shown by a gap in the curve line. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)</p>
