<p id="Par72">The rejection of allografts is one of the most conserved and powerful immune mechanisms, making priming with alloantigens an ideal candidate for use in vaccination of the elderly. AlloStim
 <sup>®</sup> is in use under a US FDA cleared IND and has been shown to readily be rejected by heavily pre-treated, immunosuppressed metastatic cancer patients. A phase I/II clinical trial protocol for use of AlloStim
 <sup>®</sup> in healthy elderly adults in currently under review by US FDA. Upon clearance, clinical trials could be initiated to evaluate this allo-priming concept in short order. For proof-of-concept, longitudinal PBMC samples are proposed to be collected pre- and post-allo-priming. The PBMC are to be pulsed with a panel of inactivated viruses or recombinant viral proteins to determine if they will non-specifically activate the allo-specific Th1/CTL memory cells. The supernatants from the viral-pulsed PBMC are proposed to be evaluated in live virus cytolytic plaque assays to determine if viral propagation is suppressed.
