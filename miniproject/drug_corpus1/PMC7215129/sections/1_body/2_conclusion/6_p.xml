<p id="Par74">The key to an effective natural innate immune response that can limit the course of virus infection is the early production of type I/III interferons (IFN) and subsequent switch to type II IFN (IFN-Ï’) production as the immune response matures. Successful viral infections become established due, in large part, to delayed innate immune responses and viral-mediated suppression of type I/III IFN production, allowing for rapid viral propagation which eventually results in dys-regulated immune responses which are correlated with tissue destruction, co-infection, multiple organ failure and death.</p>
