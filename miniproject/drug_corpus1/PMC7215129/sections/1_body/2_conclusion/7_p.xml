<p id="Par75">To prevent accumulation of high viral burden in the elderly upon viral infection, allo-priming provides a mechanism whereby a ready pool of de-novo primed T-cells are in circulation that can respond rapidly to viral infection by producing IFN-ϒ. The presence of non-exhausted Th1/CTL memory immune cells will modify the elderly immune character by providing a Th1 re-balancing mechanism in the memory cell compartment. This is accomplished through the creation of a high titer of polyclonal, allo-specific, non-exhausted, memory Th1/CTL T-cells through intradermal injections of activated allogeneic Th1-like cells (AlloStim
 <sup>®</sup>). The allo-specific memory cells resulting from the priming are programmed to produce IFN-ϒ upon activation. IFN-ϒ has a direct anti-viral effect on cells infected with virus and can also protect uninfected cells from infection. IFN-ϒ creates the same anti-viral environment as innate release of Type I/III IFN does in an effective natural innate immune response.
