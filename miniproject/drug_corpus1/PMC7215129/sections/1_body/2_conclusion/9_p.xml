<p id="Par77">The proposed alloantigen priming strategy can also be used in conjunction with any viral-specific vaccines. Co-injection of allo-specific and viral specific antigens could accelerate the adaptive cellular immune response to a known virus and serve as a means to enhance response to vaccines in the elderly. Subsequent injection of allogeneic cells will stimulate an allo-rejection memory recall response which can non-specifically activate resident viral-specific cells elicited by vaccination. This dual activation provides a mechanism to upregulate MHCI on infected targets, making the memory cells elicited by viral-specific vaccination able to identify and kill viral infected targets. The combination approach also has the advantage of overcoming the narrow immunity conferred by a single peptide vaccine by incorporating the in situ vaccination mechanism to elicit broad viral-specific cellular immune responses.</p>
