<p id="Par76">These allo-specific memory cells are capable of cross-reacting with foreign viral antigens and can be readily activated non-specifically by environmental stimuli such as cytokines and foreign pathogens. The memory pool of allo-specific immune cells in primed individuals can also be re-activated by additional intradermal or intravenous infusion of AlloStim
 <sup>®</sup> allogeneic cells upon first symptoms of viral disease. The by-stander effect of allo-specific Th1/CTL memory T-cell activation and IFN-ϒ production is predicted to elicit protective effects on cells in the respiratory tract and generate rapid immune-mediated viral clearance as well as condition the microenvironment in infected tissues (e.g., lung epithelial cells) for an in situ vaccination leading to viral-specific immunity and memory that is specific for the invading virus. The heterologous immune effect can amplify the pan-viral protection upon each viral encounter, providing the possibility of long-term protection.
