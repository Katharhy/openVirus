<p id="Par70">Strategies to develop a vaccine to elicit neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are technically challengingÂ due to the conformational hiding of the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the ability of this virus to transfer cell-to-cell in syncytia and infect target cells in a ACE2- and protease-independent manner by pinocytosis, limiting environmental exposure needed for antibody neutralization activity. Development of an anti-viral vaccine against complex viruses, such a SARS-Cov-2, is likely to require a potent and broad T-cell response to overcome viral escape mechanisms related to humoral immunity.</p>
