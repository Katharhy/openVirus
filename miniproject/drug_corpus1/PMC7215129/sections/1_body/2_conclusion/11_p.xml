<p id="Par79">While finding methods to treat and prevent COVID19 infection is of urgent priority, it is also important to consider that the current pandemic is the third major outbreak of a novel coronaviral infection in humans within the past 20Â years. Currently there are no registered vaccines or means of therapeutic protection against the prior SARS or MERS outbreaks available anywhere in the world. This is despite considerable efforts from experts worldwide to develop vaccines. The same technical obstacles preventing development of specific vaccines and treatments for these past CoV outbreaks likely also exist for development of a vaccine for the current COVID-19 viral pandemic. However, even if an effective vaccine is developed, it is estimated that it will take at least a year to complete clinical testing sufficient to obtain regulatory approval. If COVID-19 fades as did SARS and MERS, by the time a vaccine is available it will no longer be as urgent.</p>
