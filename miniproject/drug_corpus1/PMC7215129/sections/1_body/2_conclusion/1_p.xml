<p id="Par69">Highly pathogenic human CoVs pose a substantial threat to public health. There are basically two groups of patients upon exposure to CoV, with the majority developing a short duration of clinical symptoms and the minority experiencing severe disease characterized by pneumonia and ARDS. The elderly are disproportionately vulnerable to severe disease due to immunosenescence and comorbidities. It is likely that CoVs will continue to cross species and cause additional outbreaks in the future. Therefore, even if a vaccine is developed for prevention of COVID-19, it would not protect against the next outbreak of a novel virus. Therefore, there is a need to develop novel strategies, not only to control the current pandemic, but also to be prepared to prevent the next pandemic.</p>
