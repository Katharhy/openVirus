<p id="Par71">A vaccine that elicits a robust cellular immune response requires identification of conserved viral epitopes and effective processing and presentation of viral antigens by APC on MHCI and MHCII in conjunction with co-stimulatory signals, as well as a diversity in the naive T cell repertoire. In addition, CTL memory cells resulting from vaccination will require infected cells to present the selected viral antigens in the vaccine on MHCI. Selection of common viral epitopes which present on MHC I (and MHC II) for vaccine development is technically difficult and CoV infection causes the down-regulation of MHC I on infected cells, making infected cells invisible to CTL. Since the elderly lack na√Øve T-cells that are necessary for development of CTL with broad specificity to viral antigens, elderly would be less likely to respond efficiently to any future vaccine which targets cellular immunity.</p>
