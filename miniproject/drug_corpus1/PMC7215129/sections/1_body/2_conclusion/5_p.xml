<p id="Par73">Elderly persons are particularly susceptible to progressive viral disease and have delayed immune responses to viral infection due, at least in part, to immunosenescence, Th2 immune bias, decreased diversity of naïve T-cells and high frequencies of exhausted memory cells from chronic inflammation (e.g., CMV). This results in a natural loss of the ability to mount effective innate and adaptive cellular immune responses to invading pathogens. The delayed and suppressed cellular immune response in the elderly enables viruses to become widely established and the resulting increased viral titers causes dys-regulated immune responses that can lead to a late, over-active immune response which can progress to pneumonitis, multiple organ failure and death.</p>
