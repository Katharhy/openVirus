<p id="Par41">Each time this cascade is initiated by viral encounter, the virus elimination serves as a booster to the original allo-antigenic priming. The new viral-specific Th1/CTL memory cells resulting from viral elimination join the resident memory allo-specific Th1/CTL resulting from the allo-antigenic priming, increasing the titer of Th1/CTL memory cells in circulation. Encounter with each new virus will non-specifically activate all previous non-exhausted memory cells and support the immune cascade that eliminates the new virus. Memory Th1/CTL to each new virus, in turn, increases the titer of Th1/CTL memory cells primed to respond to a subsequent viral encounter.</p>
