<p id="Par40">Thus, allo-antigenic priming can modulate the systemic immune balance and provide a pool of non-exhausted allo-specific Th1/CTL memory cells capable of rapidly responding to viral infection. The non-specific activation of these allo-specific memory cells upon viral encounter causes release of IFN-ϒ. The release of IFN-ϒ orchestrates the sequential activation of immune cells resulting in formation of an antiviral state, innate elimination of invading viruses and development of a viral-specific effector response and memory.</p>
