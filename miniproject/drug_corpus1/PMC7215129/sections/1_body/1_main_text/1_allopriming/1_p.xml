<p id="Par37">The allo-priming concept is designed to prime the immune systems of healthy elderly adults to create high titers of allo-specific Th1/CTL memory cells which can become activated upon encounter with any virus (by-stander activation) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The by-stander activation of allo-specific Th1/CTL memory cells upon viral encounter causes the release of interferon-gamma (IFN-ϒ), which creates an “anti-viral state” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. IFNs create an antiviral state in both virus-infected cells and uninfected, bystander cells, by inducing a program of gene transcription that interferes with multiple stages of viral replication cycles through various mechanisms [
