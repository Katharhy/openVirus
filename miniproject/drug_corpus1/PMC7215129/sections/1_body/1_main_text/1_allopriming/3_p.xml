<p id="Par39">Antigen presenting cells (APC), such as dendritic cells (DC), engulf and process released HSP-chaperoned viral antigens. Processing in the context of danger signals and IFN-ϒ, causes the maturation of immature DC to IL-12+ DC [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. IL-12 production acts to further increases IFN-ϒ, sustaining the anti-viral state and upregulating MHCI, MHCII and co-stimulatory molecules on APC [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The mature DC migrate to regional lymph nodes and display viral antigens on MHC I and MHC II with co-stimulator CD80/86 expression, leading to viral-specific Th1/CTL expansion. The IFN-ϒ upregulates MHCI on viral infected cells so these cells can be recognized and killed by viral-specific CTL [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. These viral-specific CTL can then orchestrate a sterilizing immune response and later differentiate into memory cells that provides protection from re-infection.
