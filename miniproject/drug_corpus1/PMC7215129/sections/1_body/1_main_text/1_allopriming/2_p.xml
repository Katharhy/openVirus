<p id="Par38">The IFN-ϒ release from by-stander activated allo-specific Th1/CTL memory cells activates innate effector cells (e.g., NK, NKT and macrophages) which in turn release additional IFN-ϒ, sustaining the anti-viral state. These activated innate effector cells lyse viral infected cells, controlling acute viral burden. By-stander activation of resident allo-specific CTL can also cross-react to lyse viral infected cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The lysis of viral infected cells by activated innate effector cells and cross-reactive allo-specific memory CTL releases “danger signals” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and heat shock proteins (HSP) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] which chaperone viral antigens (e.g., GRP78, HSP70) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] into the microenvironment, creating the conditions for “in situ vaccination”, which leads to development of viral-specific cellular immunity.
