<p id="Par46">AlloStim
 <sup>®</sup> cells are administered intradermally (ID) in an activated state. To assure the injected cells are activated when administered, they are prepared with anti-CD3/anti-CD28-coated microbeads attached. The activated AlloStim
 <sup>®</sup> cells are formulated as a frozen dosage form at 1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> cells/ml in PlasmaLyte A containing 1% human serum albumin and 2% DSMO. Individual doses of 0.5 ml are thawed and administered intradermally every 3–4 days for up to five total doses. This priming schedule is sufficient to provide high titers of circulating allo-specific Th1/CTL. AlloStim
 <sup>®</sup> has been evaluated in Phase I/II, Phase II and Phase IIA clinical trials in USA and Thailand in chemotherapy-refractory metastatic solid tumor patients. Phase IIB pre-registration and Phase IIB/III randomized, controlled registration clinical trials are currently being prepared for launch in third line metastatic colorectal cancer and advanced/metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma in USA and Asia, respectively. In these human clinical trials, AlloStim
 <sup>®</sup> has demonstrated ability to down-regulate checkpoint molecules in the tumor microenvironment, cause system-wide infiltration of effector T-cells and NK cells into metastatic lesions (conversion from “cold” to “hot”) and has consistently demonstrated a tail of between 20 and 35% of long-term survivors in chemotherapy-refractory metastatic disease with a good safety profile [
