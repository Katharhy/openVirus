<p id="Par45">To assure consistent differentiation of allo-specific Th1/CTL memory after allo-antigen priming, regardless of host immune status and age, a bioengineered, patented, immune cell called “AlloStim
 <sup>®”</sup> is used. AlloStim
 <sup>®</sup> is living, activated, intentionally mismatched, ex vivo expanded and differentiated allogeneic Th1-like cells derived from healthy donors. Injection of undifferentiated allogeneic immune cells or non-activated allogeneic immune cells were not able to elicit allo-specific Th1 memory, while priming with activated allogeneic Th1-like AlloStim
 <sup>®</sup> cells elicited dominant Th1 immunity and had both a protective effect and a therapeutic effect in a cancer model [
