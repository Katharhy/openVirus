<p id="Par49">The production of proinflammatory cytokines by AlloStim
 <sup>®</sup>, including IFN-γ and TNF-α, initially activates host NK cells to reject the allogeneic cells, due to missing self-MHC I on the CD4+ AlloStim
 <sup>®</sup> cells. The NK cell compartment is highly stable in terms of function and phenotype in the elderly [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and can therefore readily reject mismatched allogeneic cells. In subsequent ID AlloStim
 <sup>®</sup> injections, the production of IFN-ϒ and expression of CD40L by AlloStim
 <sup>®</sup> activates macrophages that reject the AlloStim
 <sup>®</sup> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The rejection of the allogeneic cells by NK cells or macrophages in the skin results in release of endogenous HSP and DAMP danger signals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], which in the context of CD40L and IFN-ϒ expressed by AlloStim
 <sup>®</sup> result in DC maturation to IL-12+ DC1 phenotype and their migration to draining lymph nodes to interact with cognate T-cells to elicit allo-specific Th1/CTL immunity [
