<p id="Par52">Elderly individuals have a significantly delayed innate immune response to viral infection and the adaptive immune response that follows is often sub-optimal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. The delayed innate immune response results in accumulation of high viral titers which, in turn, serves to elicit a late over-active immune response which isÂ correlated with a more severe and often lethal clinical course [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. The acute high viral levels that are achieved in elderly as a result of late innate immune response also increases the virulence of the virus, by increasing chances of human-to-human spread of infection.
