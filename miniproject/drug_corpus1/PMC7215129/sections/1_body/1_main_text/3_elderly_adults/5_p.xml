<p id="Par54">Elderly also have limited T-cell repertoires [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] which inhibits their ability to develop viral-specific adaptive T-cellÂ immune responses, both prophylactically (by vaccination) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>], and in situ (as a result of adaptive immune clearance of infection). This suppressed cellular immunity together with the aging of the respiratory organs makes elderly more susceptible to pathological effects of viral infection, especially effects of respiratory viral infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. The immune defects of the elderly make this population less likely to benefit from vaccinations as preventative measures against infectious diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>].
