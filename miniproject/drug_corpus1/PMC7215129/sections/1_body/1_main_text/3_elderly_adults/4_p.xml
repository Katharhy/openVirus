<p id="Par53">There is a dysregulation in the Th1/Th2-system in the elderly, which is dominated by Th2-functions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Memory Th1/CTL cells in elderly adults are diminished and functionally exhausted [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Memory cells of the elderly become exhausted due to lifelong antigenic challenge which can be as a result of chronic viral infection (e.g., CMV, EBV, HBV, HCV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Exhausted memory cells are unable to be non-specifically activated upon viral encounter. This defect in cellular immunity in the elderly limits the availability of heterologous immune mechanisms to react to acute viral infection, which contributes to a slower and often inadequate innate response to viral infection.
