<p id="Par50">The current COVID-19 viral pandemic has led to high number of deaths worldwide. This is the third serious coronavirus (CoV) outbreak in less than 20 years, following SARS in 2002–2003 and MERS in 2012. Elderly people account disproportionately to the morbidity and mortality associated with CoV infection. Vaccines have been the main global strategy to minimize the impact of viral infections, but no successful vaccines have yet been developed for these previous highly virulent CoVs. In any event, elderly adults generally respond poorly to anti-viral vaccines [
