 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>] which causes “inflammaging” resulting in reversing of immunosenescence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>]. Thus, allo-priming protocols may not only provide universal anti-viral protection for the elderly, but may also serve as an “anti-aging” mechanism to protect from co-morbid diseases of aging.
