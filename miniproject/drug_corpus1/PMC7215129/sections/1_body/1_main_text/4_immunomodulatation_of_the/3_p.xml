<p id="Par58">The immediate release of IFN-ϒ upon acute viral infection corrects the problem of delayed immune responsiveness and creates an early “anti-viral state” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. Establishment of the anti-viral state with early release of IFN-ϒ provides a crucial initial line of defense against viral infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. The anti-viral state is normally induced through early release of type I/III IFN from viral infected cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. However, many viruses, including coronavirus, can suppress production of type I/III IFN as an immune avoidance mechanism [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. The strategy of providing a pool of non-exhausted memory cells which produce Type II IFN (IFN-ϒ) upon viral encounter, overcomes the viral escape. IFN-ϒ creates an anti-viral state even in type I/III IFN resistant cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. Further, IFN-ϒ mobilizes innate effector cells that can respond rapidly to eliminate viral infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>] and also produce IFN-ϒ. Thus, early IFN-ϒ response to viral infection through allo-priming provides a rapid means of control over viral infection in the elderly.
