<p id="Par56">The progressive age-related dysregulation and decline of the immune system is known as “immunosenescence”. In the aging immune system, there is an accumulation of memory cells as a result of chronic stimulation with repeated clinical and subclinical infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This chronic stimulation causes these memory cells to become exhausted and no longer able to function, contributing to an increased susceptibility of elderly to infectious pathogens [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. The aging immune system is also characterized by a decline in the numbers of naive T cells, an imbalance in Th1/Th2 cell subsets, and a decrease in T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire [
