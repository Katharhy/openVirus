<p id="Par57">A cellular immune response with release of Th1 (type 1) cytokine profile, including IFN-ϒ, TNF-α and IL-2, is known to be protective against most viral infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. IFN-ϒ in particular has been shown to play an essential role in clearance of viral infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. Modulating the immune system of elderly individuals through alloantigen priming to provide high titers of non-exhausted Th1/CTL memory cells that can be non-specifically activated upon encounter with any virus to cause release type 1 cytokines may provide an immediate anti-viral immune response upon viral exposure and could also reinstate responsiveness to viral vaccines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. The delay in IFN responses to virus infection in the elderly is due to active suppression by viral proteins and immunosenescence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>], which allows virus to reach high titers early in infection, leading to immunopathology, T-cell apoptosis and progression to lethal pneumonia [
