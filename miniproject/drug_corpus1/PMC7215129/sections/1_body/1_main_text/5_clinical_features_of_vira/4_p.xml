<p id="Par63">The type of cytokine storm associated with severe disease is caused by cytokines released by activated monocytes, producing a storm of IFN-α, CCL-2, IL-6, TNF-α, CCL-3, CCL-5, CxCL-2, IL-1α, and IFN-γ. This monokine cytokine storm is directly correlated with morbidity and mortality [

It is recognized that a major cause of respiratory failure is coexistent bacterial pneumonia leading to ARDS. ARDS is characterized by damage to the endothelial–epithelial barrier of the alveoli, resulting in fluid leakage and accumulation in the alveolar lumen inhibiting gas exchange.
