<p id="Par65">The overactive immune response to sepsis, including monokine “cytokine storm” results from over activated M1 macrophages in response to tissue damage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>]. The response to sepsis is similar between old and younger patients. However, the mortality is much higher in older patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>]. The difference is related to the dysregulated immune systems of the elderly. The elderly are unable to turn down the over-activated monocyte response, leading to disease progression, while regulatory mechanisms in the young counter-act and prevent the consequences of monocyte over-activation.
