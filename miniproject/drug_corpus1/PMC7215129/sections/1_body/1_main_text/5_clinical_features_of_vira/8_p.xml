<p id="Par67">Immunosenescence causes an imbalanced homeostatic regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses, diminishing the host capacity to rapidly restore balanced immune functions. Thus, combined effects of age-induced immunosuppression, delayed innate immune responses [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>], all combine to make the post-viral infection period in the elderly have a longer duration. As a result, there are increased levels of viral propagation, higher incidences of tissue injury, and increased progression to ARDS and septic shockÂ in the elderly.
