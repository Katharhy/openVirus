<p id="Par60">Allo-priming is predicted to reduce the severity of clinical symptoms upon encounter with virus. Clinical features of respiratory viral infections in humans vary from a first subset that experience mild flu-like symptoms which subside over a few days; to a second subset that experience moderate to severe flu-like symptoms associated with high fever, hypoxemia and progression to pneumonia-like symptoms. These symptomatic patients are at high risk to progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, multiple organ failure and death. The subset with mild flu-like symptoms is associated with younger healthy individuals, while the subset associated with more severe symptoms is mostly associated with elderly adults that are frail and/or present with co-morbidities.</p>
