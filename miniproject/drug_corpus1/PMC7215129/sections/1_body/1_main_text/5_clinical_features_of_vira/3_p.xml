<p id="Par62">During pathogenic virus infection, a cytokine storm leads to excessive inflammatory infiltrates and virus-induced tissue destruction which contributes to morbidity and mortality. The timing and source of the IFN in the cytokine storm can affect the clinical course of viral disease. High serum levels of IFN-ϒ late in the course of viral infection is correlated with more severe disease [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>], whereas early IFN release results in lower viral titers and less severe disease. These observations support the prediction that early activation and release of IFN-ϒ from non-exhausted allo-specific memory Th1/CTL will correct this problem and avoid progression to severe disease.
