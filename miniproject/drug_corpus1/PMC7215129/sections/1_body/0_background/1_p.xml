<p id="Par32">Herein we propose to use a novel allo-priming strategy using patented, allogeneic Th1-like immune cells conjugated to CD3/CD28 microbeads (AlloStim
 <sup>®</sup>) to serve as a “Universal Anti-Viral Vaccine” to protect the health of elderly adults. Vaccination has been a strategy to protect against viral diseases in adults, such as influenza, pneumococcal pneumonia, shingles and hepatitis A/B. Successful prophylactic vaccination mechanisms provide protection through eliciting neutralizing antibodies to prevent viral entry into cells. However, this strategy does not provide protection against antigenic shift or drift variants of the original virus [
