<p id="Par35">In addition, elderly also suffer detrimental effects on their immune function due to chronic inflammation, known as “inflammaging” [

Inflammaging is correlated with comorbidities such as cancer, arthrosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease) all which increase the likelihood of serious progression of viral infection. In addition, the aging of the structure and function of the lungs contributes to increased incidence of pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis in the elderly after respiratory viral infection.
