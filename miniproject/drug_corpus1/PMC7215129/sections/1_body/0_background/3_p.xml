<p id="Par34">Many efforts are underway to develop anti-viral vaccines which elicit protective cellular immunity [

The age-related functional decline in cellular immunity (immunosenescence) makes the elderly less able to mount a cellular immune response to vaccination, making this population more vulnerable to morbidity and mortality associated with viral diseases and less likely to respond to an anti-viral vaccine.
