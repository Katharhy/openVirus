<p id="Par36">The remodeling of the senescent immune systems of the elderly through allo-priming is proposed as a method to restore cellular immune function in this population. The ability to restore functional cellular immunity to the elderly can increase responsiveness to viral infections, including COVID-19 and any future emergent novel virus. In essence, an elderly immune system modulated by allo-priming would potentially respond to viral infection in a similar manner to the immune response of younger individuals, resulting in less serious disease. The immunomodulation of the elderly immune system to function more like a youthful immune system should also restore responsiveness to any current or future viral-specific vaccines. A more balanced immune system in the elderly can also counter-regulate inflammaging, providing broad ranging health benefits to the elderly and to society [
