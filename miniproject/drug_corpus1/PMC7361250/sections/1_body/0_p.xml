<p>COVID‐19, the infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), has put to the test many sectors such as health, education, socioeconomic development, transport, trade and finance. Millions of people have been infected, hundreds of thousands have died, and the toll continues to soar. The international scientific community has found itself in a race against time to contain the spread of the disease, with an urgent need to devise fast screening and triage systems for early detection and isolation of affected patients. With advanced health‐care technologies and prior experiences with many epidemics in the past, people were confident that the scientific community will lead them out of this crisis. However, what has become apparent is a sense of panic and amateurism of some health‐care authorities, and a lack of agreement among scientists and experts with sometimes conflicting recommendations from trusted research institutions. This will not be the last pandemic; the international scientific community must learn valuable lessons from it to be able to combat future disease outbreaks that could be more infectious and lethal than COVID‐19.</p>
