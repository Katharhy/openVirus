<p>To assess the scale of a spread of a pandemic and to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions, it is vital to understand the transmission dynamics of the disease in diverse populations and areas. Modeling pandemics can provide valuable information to inform decision makers and crisis counselors, including for instance the possibility to generate accurate forecasts about the likelihood of outbreaks from newly diagnosed cases in other areas. These models can be handy for assessing the effects of population demographics on the spread of the disease (eg, social and environmental determinants), the effects of preventive measures (eg, confinement and social distancing) and differences among groups. They can assist decision makers to plan and predict what works better for a given group/population and can estimate the different observable and latent factors that can explain the spread of a virus through a population. One attractive feature is the ability to compare different explanations (ie, model comparison), based on prior knowledge and empirical data, that can tell decision makers and health professionals about the most likely scenarios that may unravel given a particular parametrization of the problem, and in evaluating competing models of population‚Äêwide intervention strategies. Big data specialists and modeling experts should design useful and realistic mathematical models that can take advantage of the recent sophistication in analytics and the wider availability of big data.</p>
