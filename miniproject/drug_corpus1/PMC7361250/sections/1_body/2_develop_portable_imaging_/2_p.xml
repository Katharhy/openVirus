<p>Many health‐care providers are now able to bring sophisticated portable imaging equipment (eg, portable X‐ray and ultrasound systems) to the patient with high quality, speed and flexibility. During the last decade, the most popular applications for portable radiographic systems have concerned sports medicine, emergency, obstetrics, nursing homes and small clinics in remote locations. There is a huge surge of interest in such portable systems in the current crisis, not only because of the convenience and flexibility they bring to health professionals, but crucially to minimize movement of people which is a key dimension in monitoring and controlling the spread of a disease. These systems can enable on‐the‐spot diagnoses, triage emergency patients, eliminate long wait times, dramatically shorten the time from evaluation to treatment, bring advanced imaging protocols to secluded areas and reduce costs of patient transportation as many of these miniaturized systems are easily transportable within an ambulance. Bioengineers and imaging researchers should work together to develop and promote the use of such portable systems that can be a game changer during pandemics. Developing rapid screening technology to potentially enable mass screening of people where they live, and ultimately identifying carriers before they become infectious, is central to any fight against a viral pandemic that is spreading at exponential rates.</p>
