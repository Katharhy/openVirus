<p>Sharing knowledge and talent is of vital importance to tackle a pandemic. By making their data public, scientists enable other researchers to replicate scientific findings and to perform their own analyses and explore a wider range of questions. The COVID‐19 pandemic has accelerated the rate at which new research and data from all over the world are shared, in order to inform international responses to the pandemic and to speed up the development of diagnostic tools, drug treatments and vaccines. Researchers should make sure to share patient‐level COVID‐19 metadata, properly anonymized and deidentified, in addition to details about data collection protocols. Versatile and secure data sharing protocols should be put in place to efficiently handle complex data, including demographic data, genomic data, microscopy data, clinical data, epidemiological data and imaging data. The more data researchers can access, the more quickly they can understand the behavior of the pandemic spread, identify biomarkers and develop therapies. Strengthening international collaboration and creating scientific data sharing platforms is central to understanding and combatting viral outbreaks, and such international initiatives should be supported by policy makers and funding bodies. Some initiatives can be mentioned here: GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data;
