<p>Over the past few months, we heard the voice of many key players in the global fight against this pandemic, including health professionals, crisis counselors, epidemiologists, medical scientists and immunologists. In this editorial, we aim to cast light on the crucial contribution of other players, working behind the scenes, including bioengineers, computer scientists and big data specialists. Their contribution is shaping the way the international community is going to stop this outbreak. This concerns promoting innovative solutions to the following four areas that are of paramount importance to current global interventions: (a) develop portable imaging systems that are fast and accurate for diagnostic and prognostic purposes, (b) create bespoke databases with robust and secure data‐sharing protocols of patient‐level COVID‐19 metadata, (c) devise AI‐powered tools that can process complex data and can make accurate and useful individualized data‐driven predictions and (d) derive accurate models about the spread of pandemics, with the ultimate aim to generate useful forecasts about the effects of interventions.</p>
