<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is reinventing modern health care through machines that can process, learn, predict and act. Many AI‐enabled imaging systems are now equipped with advanced analytics for faster and more accurate image processing (ie, AI radiologists). Thanks to the high availability of large‐scale annotated image data sets, great success has been achieved for image recognition and classification. AI can process unstructured complex medical data to predict and diagnose disease more efficiently at a faster rate and with high accuracy at the individual patient level, which is a significant advantage when dealing with a disease like COVID‐19 with a clinical presentation that overlaps with that of many respiratory viral illnesses. Some very encouraging recent initiatives included the use of deep learning algorithms to diagnose, triage and monitor coronavirus cases from a chest scan, with the attractive possibility to give immediate alerts if a patient needs support. AI‐powered tools have the potential to alleviate the growing burden on health professionals, who must review and prioritize a rising number of cases each day. These AI‐powered tools can be made available as cloud‐accessible systems to assist clinicians even in remote areas or in regions where there is a shortage of expertise. Such tools can help clinicians take a more comprehensive approach for disease management and to develop real‐time forecasts. For instance, AI‐powered chatbot streamlines the review of a patient's symptoms, and then recommends either a virtual check‐in or a visit of a health‐care professional for screening with portable imaging systems. With the ability to track exposed people—thanks to the proliferation of consumer wearables and smart devices—AI‐powered systems can provide timely feedback on how to stay healthy and safe during pandemics.</p>
