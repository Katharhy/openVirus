<p>Regardless of any direct or indirect neurological manifestations, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on the management of neurological patients, whether infected or not. In particular, the majority of stroke services worldwide have been negatively influenced by the pandemic and the lack of optimal care is likely to lead to a greater risk of death and higher odds of disability in acute stroke patients. This includes treatments for vessel recanalization (intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy), securing brain vascular malformations (aneurysm coiling and clipping), specialized stroke unit care, secondary stroke prevention strategies and rehabilitation. Moreover, patients with neuroimmunological disorders receiving immunosuppressive therapies may have a higher risk of COVID-19 infection than the one recognized so far. Similarly, patients with severe neurodegenerative disorders are prone to pulmonary infections and may reside in nursing homes that have so far proven to be hotspots for SARS-CoV-2 infections associated with high case-fatality rates. In addition, neurologists should also be prepared to treat neurological adverse effects related to the use of anti-viral agents and other medications that may be tested and used against SARS-CoV-2.</p>
