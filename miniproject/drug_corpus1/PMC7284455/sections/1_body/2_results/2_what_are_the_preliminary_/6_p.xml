 </sup> Agitation, confusion and abnormal corticospinal tract signs were commonly documented in those critically ill patients and 33% of those discharged had a persistent dysexecutive syndrome. Further diagnostic evaluation was also performed in a subset of patients, consisting of magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography and CSF examination. Among neuroimaging features, leptomeningeal enhancement in eight patients, frontotemporal hypoperfusion in 11 patients and cerebral ischemic stroke in three patients were reported. CSF examination was performed in seven patients and was abnormal in three of them, presenting positive oligoclonal bands with an identical electrophoretic pattern in serum or elevated protein and IgG levels. However, RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was negative in all examined CSF samples.
