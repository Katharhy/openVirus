 </sup> Proposed neurotropic mechanisms have been published and involve viral access to the CNS through systemic circulation or across the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone leading to symptoms of hyposmia and hypogeusia.

 </sup> Viral neuro-invasion and subsequent central neuronal injury have also been proposed to contribute to the acute respiratory distress of the patients with COVID-19.

 </sup> Moreover, the adhesion of SARS-CoV2 to ACE2 receptors gains particular importance in the cases of intracerebral haemorrhage, due to the inactivation of the receptor and subsequent dysfunction in blood pressure regulation.

 </sup> In severely infected patients, coagulopathy and prolonged prothrombin time due to disseminated intravascular coagulation may contribute to increased risk of secondary intracranial haemorrhage. In cases of ischemic stroke, potential mechanisms are hypercoagulability associated with inflammation, endothelial and platelet activation, dehydration and cardio-embolism from virus-related cardiac injury.

 </sup> Hypoxemia can further worsen neuronal damage.
