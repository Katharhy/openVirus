<p>More case reports of neurological manifestations have also followed (

 </sup> The authors diagnosed this patient as a case of SARS-CoV-2 encephalitis. However, caution is highly suggested since positive RT-PCR in the CSF is not necessarily equivalent to CNS infection. A traumatic lumbar puncture with contamination of the CSF sample by the patient’s blood or other biological secretions that contained the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2, cannot be entirely excluded. One more patient with COVID-19 presented with altered mental status and possible encephalopathy and underwent electroencephalogram (EEG), which showed bilateral slowing and focal slowing in the left temporal region with sharply countered waves.

 </sup> However, the patient had suffered a stroke in the past and had an underlying left temporal lesion of encephalomalacia, that could have contributed to the abnormal EEG. CSF analysis was also not indicative of CNS infection. More conclusive evidence of SARS-CoV-2 associated meningitis/encephalitis are presented by a case report of a comatose patient with positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in the CSF and neuroimaging features indicative of right lateral ventriculitis and encephalitis mainly on right mesial lobe and hippocampus.

 </sup> Surprisingly, no genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 was detected during nasopharyngeal swab testing raising the question of primary seeding of the CNS 
 <italic>versus</italic> residual CNS infection after viral clearance from other sites, a feature observed in other viral infections like Ebola and human immunodeficiency virus. A case of acute haemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy in a patient with COVID-19 has also been described as a result of an intracranial cytokine storm, similar to the one occurring in the lungs during severe COVID-19, leading to respiratory failure.

 </sup> Large trials have been looking into therapeutic countermeasures that include immune modulation like IL-6 inhibition in an attempt to fight this inflammatory cascade. Another case involved the peripheral nervous system with the development of para-infectious Guillain–Barré syndrome.

  <xref rid="bibr39-1756286420932036" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>
 </sup> However, the authors acknowledge the fact that SARS-CoV2 infection in their case might as well be a coincidence rather than causality. Five more patients developed Guillain-Barré syndrome 5 to 10 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms.

 </sup> Severe deficits, axonal involvement and respiratory failure with subsequent need for mechanical ventilation were reported among those patients. PNS involvement has also been documented in two patients who were diagnosed with Miller-Fisher syndrome and polyneuritis cranialis at 3 to 5 days after exhibiting COVID-19-related symptoms.
