<p>Drastic times call for drastic measures and the safety of neuroscience specialists should be preserved. Neurologists are first responders to stroke and other neurological emergencies and have to be protected.

 </sup> One management approach could be that only neurology subspecialists who do procedures or surgeries should be going to the emergency room, stroke units and neuro-intensive care units (i.e. neuro-intensivists and neuro-endovascular specialists, vascular neurologists).

 </sup> Other non-urgent neurological evaluations may be performed remotely.

 </sup> Tele-neurology has emerged as a fundamental component of solutions to sustain neurological healthcare quality.

 </sup> Its expanding use ranges from the simplest drug prescriptions to the more complicated tele-triage of patients before they get admitted to an emergency department. It has already been implemented with success in stroke care over the past decade and in pilot projects for epilepsy care but can also be applied to other neurological fields.

 </sup> We expect that information technology experts would scientifically support this endeavour and that authorities would reimburse it appropriately. More optimistically, after the management of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the recovery of global health, the COVID-19 pandemic may act as a stimulus for a new era of tele-neurology to be established. Finally, medical education for neurological residents and the younger generation of neurologists needs to adapt to e-learning activities in these times of extraordinary needs.
