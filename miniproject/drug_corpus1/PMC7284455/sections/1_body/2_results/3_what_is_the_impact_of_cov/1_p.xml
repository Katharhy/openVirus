<p>Regardless of any direct or indirect neurological manifestations related to SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-19 pandemic has a huge impact on the management of neurological patients, whether infected or not. Normal neurological medical care, as we know it, has been seriously impaired worldwide.

 </sup> Many neurological wards, among other general medical wards, have been converted into quarantine wards for the treatment of infected patients. Routine neurological outpatient visits are delayed or suspended, and treatment remains available only for emergency conditions and highly selective cases. Even in the emergency setting, neurological departments may be forced to function with fewer staff, either due to staff redeployment to COVID services, prophylactic quarantine or direct illness. The remaining healthy personnel are at high risk of burn-out, due to long shifts, sleep deprivation, psychological distress, shortages of medicine and supplies and discomfort associated with personal protective equipment (PPE) use.

 </sup> Characteristically, PPE use has recently been associated with the development of

 </sup> Despite those unprecedented conditions, quality of care in neurology should be maintained.
