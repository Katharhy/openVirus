 </sup> Intensive care units are being overcrowded by COVID-19 patients, and post-operative neurosurgical patients cannot be admitted for monitoring. The less emergent surgeries are being postponed. Patients are being triaged according to case severity and are transported to a limited number of designated neurosurgical centres, since the majority have been transformed to COVID-19 wards. Fortunately, but not surprisingly, cases with traumatic brain lesions, which require urgent surgery, are being reduced in number due to the public lockdown and social distancing measures.
