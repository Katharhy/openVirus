  <p>Imaging evaluation of a patient with intracerebral haemorrhage with concomitant COVID-19.</p>
  <p>A 67-year-old man with a history of hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia and coronary artery disease presented to the emergency department of a comprehensive stroke centre on April 6, 2020 after waking up with slurred speech, left-sided weakness and numbness. Admission systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels were 178/106 mmHg. The patient was afebrile with no respiratory symptoms. However, history provided by his wife suggested that earlier in the morning, prior to his admission, he had an increased body temperature of 38.5°C. Brain computed tomography scan uncovered right thalamic intracerebral haemorrhage with mass effect and intraventricular extension (A). The patient was admitted in the stroke unit. Due to the history of fever, a nasopharyngeal swab was performed on the day of admission and was negative for SARS-CoV-2. However, on the following day the patient redeveloped fever, so work-up with blood cultures, chest X-ray (B) and urinalysis was performed but did not uncover any obvious source of infection. A second nasopharyngeal swab was ordered and came back positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Despite SARS-CoV-2 infection, the patient never experienced any symptoms of dyspnoea, cough, chest pain or diarrhoea during his hospitalization. He only reported the presence of mild generalized headache and nausea, which could have been attributable to the intracerebral haemorrhage. A certain causal association between COVID-19 and intracerebral haemorrhage cannot be established based on the evidence in this case, especially since the patient had a medical history of three common risk factors of manifesting both the diseases (

However, it may be postulated that blood pressure dysregulation due to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) inactivation by SARS-CoV-2 could have been at least partially involved in the development of intracerebral haemorrhage.
