  <p>ACE-2 is overexpressed in adipose tissue in obesity and diabetes allowing COVID-19 to infect the cell. Lean (brown adipocyte) tissue is characterized by high amounts of mitochondria and HO-1 levels which result in low levels of ROS. Brown adipose tissue is better than white adipose tissue in its ability to handle the inflammation cause by COVID-19. Obese (white adipocyte) tissue is characterized by low amounts of mitochondria and HO-1, which results in high levels of ROS and upregulation of ACE-2 receptors, especially in morbid obesity and diabetes. COVID-19 patients with high amounts of white adipose tissue develop severe inflammation.</p>
