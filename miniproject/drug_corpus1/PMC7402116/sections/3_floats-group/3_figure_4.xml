  <p>The porphyrin synthesis pathway in relation to COVID-19. The porphyrin synthesis pathway displaying COVID-19 binding the end product, hemoprotein, which binds non-enzymatically to porphyrin causing upregulation of heme production as a result of negative feedback due to a decrease in functional hemoprotein. This leads to increased free heme, decreased functional hemoprotein, and the release of toxic iron, resulting in tissue injury. Key: CoA = coenzyme A, ALA = delta-aminolevulinic acid, and HMB = hydroxymethylbilane.</p>
