  <p>COVID-19 infects the cells. COVID-19 increases free heme and free iron (Fe), but more importantly, decreases functional hemoprotein. (
   <bold>Left</bold>) Unbound COVID-19 binds to porphyrin within the cell membrane with high affinity, providing entry into the cell. Iron and oxygen are released forming a COVID-19-Porphyrin complex. The COVID-19-porphyrin complex competitively inhibits heme oxygenase (HO-1) leading to severe oxidative stress from free heme and iron, and subsequently downregulates HO-1 gene expression. (
   <bold>Right</bold>) Unbound COVID-19 binds ACE-2 receptor with lower affinity than porphyrin, and upon internalization into the cell, binds to the porphyrin substrate of hemoprotein within the cell. The result is a malfunctional hemoprotein, and with the release of iron and oxygen, a COVID-19-porphyrin complex. The consequences of increased free heme and iron along with decreased HO-1 levels, inhibition of HO-1, and decreased functional hemoprotein levels have detrimental effects to the infected cells.
