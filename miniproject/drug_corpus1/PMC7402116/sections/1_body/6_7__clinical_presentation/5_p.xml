<p>The basis for COVID-19 causing morbidity and mortality is severe systemic inflammation. This is the result of increased heme and free iron production, impairment of intracellular hemoprotein function, decreased levels of HO-1, and downregulation of HO-1 gene expression. The basis of current research to treat COVID-19 has focused on direct inhibition of viral replication and the inflammatory response.</p>
