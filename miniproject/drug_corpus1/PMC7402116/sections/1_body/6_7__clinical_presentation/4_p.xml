<p>The overall clinical presentation of COVID-19 patients is consistent with the predilection of the virus to mainly affect cells with high ACE-2 receptors, likely as a result of the ability of the virus to decrease the amount of functional hemoprotein in these cells. These hemoproteins include hemoglobin, myoglobin, NO synthase, cytochromes within the electron transport chain (ETC), CYP enzymes, and catalase. Given that hemoprotein by definition contains heme, thus providing COVID-19 a substrate to bind to, COVID-19 has the potential to cause serious malfunction in all of the metabolic pathways in which these proteins are essential for normal function [
