<p>The organs mainly affected by COVID-19 infection includes the lungs (i.e., the endothelium of the pulmonary vasculature), kidneys, liver, and arterial endothelium (as evidenced by a prothrombotic state); all of which contain high concentrations of ACE-2Rs known to provide a binding site to COVID-19 to infect cells. There is concern that patients with hypertension on ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBâ€™s) might have an increased risk of infection [

This continues to remain controversial, but current recommendations are to continue these drugs as indicated [
