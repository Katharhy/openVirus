<p>Remdesivir, a CYP3A4 substrate, is an anti-viral agent developed to treat Ebola but proved ineffective [
 <xref rid="B119-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. It also showed promise in SARS and MERS [
 <xref rid="B120-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>,
 <xref rid="B121-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. The drug is currently being used in clinical trials to treat COVID-19. It is an adenosine analogue that inserts itself into the RNA virus, terminating its replication. It has been the most promising antiviral agent currently tested (in two phase III randomized clinical trials) against COVID-19. CYP3A4 transcription is affected by cytokines and glucocorticoids, downregulated by the acute phase reactant IL-6 and upregulated by dexamethasone [
 <xref rid="B122-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. As a result, concomitant use of steroids along with Remdesivir may lead to lower drug levels of Remdesivir in COVID-19 patients with severe inflammation, and therefore higher IL-6. This may be the reason behind reports of adverse events in Remdesivir recipients versus placebo [

 <xref rid="B124-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. Favipiravir is undergoing phase II clinical trials in China and Thailand with reports of efficacy when combined with interferon [
 <xref rid="B125-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. Favilavir, another antiviral, was the first approved COVID medication in China. In a clinical trial of 70 patients, the drug reportedly showed efficacy in treating the disease with minimal adverse effects [
 <xref rid="B126-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. Another antiviral agent that was tested against COVID-19 was the protease inhibitors Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV). This drug combination was found to reduce mortality rate and lead to a milder disease course during the open clinical trial in the 2003 SARS outbreak [

 <xref rid="B128-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. However, LPV/RTV alone has not proved to be superior to the standard of care in COVID-19 patients [
 <xref rid="B129-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. Interestingly, LPV is a substrate of CYP3A4, while RTV is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 [
 <xref rid="B130-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. Is it possible that RTV potentiates the effects of LPV by increasing drug levels of LPV? Further research needs to be done to evaluate this. Current in vitro studies are examining LPV/RTV and interferon beta against COVID-19 [
