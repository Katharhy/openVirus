<p>Immunosuppression therapy is being examined to counteract the severe systemic inflammatory reaction caused by SARS-COV-2 infection. One of the modalities being considered is corticosteroids. Corticosteroids should only be used in COVID-19 induced lung injury in the setting of a clinical trial [

 <xref rid="B142-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. Some studies were noted to indicate benefit in COVID-19 patients with a low-to-moderate dose [

 <xref rid="B142-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. A more recent randomized clinical trial (RCT) published in the UK involving 2100 patients in the treatment arm has shown promising results with the use of dexamethasone [
 <xref rid="B143-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. In the patients who were critically ill on ventilators secondary to COVID-19, the treatment group showed a decrease in mortality by 1/3 vs. the standard of care [
 <xref rid="B143-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. Furthermore, those who required supplemental oxygen but were not intubated showed a 20% decrease in mortality rates [
 <xref rid="B143-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. Given the feasibility and cost effectiveness of dexamethasone, it has been approved by the UK government for use in COVID-19 patients. These results emphasize that the inflammatory storm caused by COVID-19 could present a critical therapeutic target to mitigate the deleterious effect of the virus. In summary, there has been no magical therapy to treat COVID. The search remains for an approach that combines antiviral therapy with an approach to reducing the inflammatory cytokines.
