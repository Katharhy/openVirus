<p>There is comprehensive literature on the genetic polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 that affects metabolism of drugs that use this pathway, which includes almost 50% of the drugs currently in use [
 <xref rid="B105-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. These polymorphisms can increase the metabolism (ultrarapid metabolizers) that might decrease their effectiveness or markedly decrease their metabolism (slow metabolizers) resulting in toxicity [
 <xref rid="B106-antioxidants-09-00636" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Slow metabolizers are more common. Slow metabolizers allow toxic levels of drugs like hydroxychloroquine to accumulate resulting in increased cardiac complications like prolonged QTc syndrome, with increased risk of cardiac death, particularly in obesity and diabetes, where ACE-2 is upregulated (
