<p>COVID-19 has worse outcomes in the obese and diabetic populations, likely because these patients are already in a proinflammatory state at baseline due to elevated levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) from insulin and leptin resistance [

Insulin resistance also results in chronic very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion and increased delivery of acyl moieties to muscle, which if provided in excess, will lead to induction of insulin resistance irrespective of obesity [
