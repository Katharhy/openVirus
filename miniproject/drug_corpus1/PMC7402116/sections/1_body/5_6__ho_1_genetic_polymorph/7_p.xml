<p>The combination of increased ACE-2R on adipocytes along with elevated levels of insulin, leptin, and acyl moieties allows COVID-19 to create the perfect “cytokine storm” leading to severe ROS formation which destroys mitochondria, especially in patients with abundant white fat cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-00636-f007">Figure 7</xref>). In severe cytokine storm you have inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS), NO which will convert superoxides to peroxynitrite which is directly toxic to DNA and the vascular endothelium. The severity of the cytokine storm will inhibit HO-1. In addition, the uncoupling of mitochondrial enzymes will further increase ROS production. Increasing HO-1 levels decrease these inflammatory cytokines and iron toxicity in obesity. [
