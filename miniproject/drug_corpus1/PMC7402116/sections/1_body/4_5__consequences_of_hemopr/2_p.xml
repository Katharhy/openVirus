<p>NO synthetase is a hemoprotein probably affected by COVID-19. If COVID-19 impairs NO synthetase, NO levels decrease. Recent studies have tried using inhaled nitric oxide to mitigate the severity of COVID-19 to supplement the amount normally produced by the nasal turbinates to promote bronchodilatory and vasodilatory effects [
