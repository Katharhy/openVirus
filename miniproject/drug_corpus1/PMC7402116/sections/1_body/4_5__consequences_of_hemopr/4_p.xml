<p>Catalase and cytochrome enzymes require heme. Catalase is a vital hemoprotein also potentially affected by COVID-19 as its malfunction would be responsible for directly increasing free ROS. When catalase is not present, the conversion of hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) to water (H
 <sub>2</sub>O) and O
 <sub>2</sub> does not occur [

The binding of COVID-19 may cause dysfunction of the ETC in cells and may translocate cytochrome C into the cytosol from mitochondria, which induces an apoptosis cascade [
