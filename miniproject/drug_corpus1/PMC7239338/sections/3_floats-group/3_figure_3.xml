  <p>Model structures used to described acute viral infection dynamics (
   <bold>a</bold>) “Target cell limited” model of viral dynamics considers the interaction between free virions (V) and three cell populations, namely target cells (T), infected cells in the eclipse phase (I
   <sub>1</sub>) and productively infected cells (I
   <sub>2</sub>). In this model, polymerase inhibitor, such as favipiravir, act by blocking viral replication from infected cells with efficacy noted ϵ. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Extended model to account for the role of cytokines, in particular IFNα, that can decrease the cell susceptibility to infection, modeled by a compartment of refractory cells (R). (
   <bold>c</bold>) Integrated model of Ebola virus (EBOV) infection. In addition to compartments presented in

   </xref>, the model also considers IL6 and TNF. In parallel, the cytokine release increases the apoptosis of nonspecific CD8 T‐cells (E
   <sub>1</sub>), giving room for EBOV‐specific T‐cells (E
   <sub>2</sub>) to grow and increase the elimination rate of actively infected cells. Cytokine levels increase the instantaneous rate of death,
