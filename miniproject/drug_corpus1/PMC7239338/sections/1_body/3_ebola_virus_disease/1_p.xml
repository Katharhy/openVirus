<p>EVD is caused by infection with a virus of the family

 <italic>Zaire ebolavirus</italic> is the causative specie of the 2013–2016 West Africa outbreak and the current Democratic Republic of Congo outbreak, responsible of &gt; 95% of the reported fatality cases since the first description of the virus in 1976, and is, therefore, the specie of choice to develop animal models of the disease. Depending on the viral strain and available medical care, case fatality rate ranges from 30% up to 90%
