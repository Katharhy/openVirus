<p>To better understand the results of the JIKI trial, we analyzed the drug concentrations in 66 patients and we compared them with those predicted by the PK model taking into account patient’s individual characteristics.

 <sup>−6</sup>). There was no significant relationship between favipiravir concentrations and EBOV viral kinetics or mortality. Overall, these results suggested that favipiravir plasma concentrations in the JIKI trial failed to achieve the target exposure defined before the trial, defined as

 <sub>trough</sub> and 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>average</sub> equal to 10 and 113 µg/mL, respectively. Furthermore, the drug concentration showed an unanticipated drop between day 2 and day 4. The reasons why concentrations were lower than anticipated are not fully understood, but may be due to the fact that the PK model could not capture well the nonlinear kinetic for the dosing regimen used in the JIKI trial, as this model had been built on patients receiving much lower doses of favipiravir than in the JIKI trial (up to 800 mg b.i.d., as compared with 1,200 mg b.i.d. in the JIKI trial). An additional nonexclusive reason could be an effect of the disease on vital functions, altering the PKs of the drug.
