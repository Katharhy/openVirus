<p>In line with the efforts of a global response against the spreading Ebola epidemic, a European consortium, 
 <italic>Reaction! (horizon 2020 grant 666092)</italic>, was set up to evaluate favipiravir efficacy in a context of emergency. The first aim of mathematical modeling was to find the optimal dosing regimen of favipiravir in patients with EVD, for which the drug’s half‐maximal effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) was much larger than against most strains of influenza virus.

 </xref> The dosing regimen of favipiravir approved in Japanese patients for influenza was 1,600 mg twice daily the first day followed by 600 mg twice daily from the second to the fifth day. The target exposure was identified from a preclinical experiment, where mice infected by EBOV were successfully treated with favipiravir 150 mg/kg b.i.d. initiated 6 days after viral challenge.

Using a PK model developed by the manufacturer, we identified that a loading dose of 6,000 mg the first day (split over three intakes), followed by 1,200 mg b.i.d. afterward for 10 days could achieve similar average and trough concentrations (83.3 and 57 µg/mL, respectively) in African and white patients as that predicted in mice successfully treated with favipiravir, taking into account the species plasma protein binding.
