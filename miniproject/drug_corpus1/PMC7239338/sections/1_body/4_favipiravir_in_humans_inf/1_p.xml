<p>The 2013–2016 Ebola epidemic has been the largest outbreak of the virus since its discovery in 1976. Spread over Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, 28,616 cases of patients with EVD have been reported, of which 11,310 were fatal.

 </xref> Although the epidemics started late 2013, it took until the summer 2014 for the main health authorities, including the World Health Organization (WHO), to realize that this outbreak was unprecedented and required a coordinated and global response in terms of public health and therapeutic interventions. In September 2014, the WHO established a list of drug candidates for testing in patients with EVD.

 </xref> Among those candidates was favipiravir (T‐705), an RNA polymerase inhibitor approved in Japan for the treatment of noncomplicated influenza infections and in clinical development in the United States. Favipiravir is an oral drug with a fast absorption (time of maximum plasma concentration (T
 <sub>max</sub>) ~ 1 hour) and high bioavailability (&gt; 90%), a low distribution volume (~ 15 L), and a short half‐life (2–5 hours). This drug was characterized by dose‐dependent and time‐dependent pharmacokinetics (PKs) due to the auto‐inhibition of the main enzymatic pathway, mediated by aldehyde oxidase, and ethnic discrepancies of exposure, with lower plasma concentration of ~ 50% reported in white and African patients as compared with Japanese patients.
