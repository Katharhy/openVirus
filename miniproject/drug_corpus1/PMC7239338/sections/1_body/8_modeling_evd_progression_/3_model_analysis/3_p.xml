<p>Given the PKs of the drug, we estimated the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> drug efficacy, which was close to 50% with maintenance doses 180 mg/kg b.i.d. With this level of efficacy, our integrated model reproduced the 60% survival rate observed at D21, and predicted that this level would remain largely similar even if treatment initiation is delayed up to D3, but not afterward (

 </xref>), we predicted that 100% (resp. 70%) survival could be obtained if treatment is initiated up to D4 (resp. D5), consistent with the 100% survival obtained in animals treated with 10 mg/kg 3 days after viral challenge (
