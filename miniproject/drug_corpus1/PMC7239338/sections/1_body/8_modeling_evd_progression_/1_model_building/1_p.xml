<p>Although the results shown in Section “Mathematical modeling supports high doses of favipiravir in nonhuman primates” demonstrated that favipiravir is effective in EVD in NHP, a number of open questions remained: how and to what extent does favipiravir modify the course of the infection? How does it potentiate the immune response? What can be expected with more potent drugs? What could be the benefit of antivirals outside prophylaxis or post exposure treatment? We aimed to address these questions using a host pathogen modeling approach, described in ref.
