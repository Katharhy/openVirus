<p>As described in Section “Mathematical modeling supports high doses of favipiravir in nonhuman primates”, favipiravir delayed and reduced peak viremia in a concentration dependent manner, which, as explained in Section “General concepts on modeling viral dynamics and antiviral treatment during an acute infection”, cannot be satisfactorily explained by a basic target cell model. Therefore, mathematical models of increasing complexity were used to fit EBOV viremia, and we tested several models

 </xref> To identify the most relevant cytokine associated with viral dynamics, we successively fitted the model to viral load data and each cytokine found significantly associated with survival at D7. Thus, pro‐inflammatory cytokines IL6, IFNα, and TNFα were successively incorporated in models (i), (ii), and (iii) (leading to a total of 12 possible candidate models), whereas IFNγ was used for model (iv). Models assuming that pro‐inflammatory cytokines increased cell refractoriness to infection consistently provided the best description of the viral load in untreated and treated NHPs, allowing us to better capture the dose effect relationship on viremia compared with the target cell limited model. Given their high level of correlations, a similarly good fit to the viral load data could be obtained when assuming that this effect was driven by either of the three pro‐inflammatory cytokines IFNα, IL6, or TNFα. Because the effects of IFNα is supported by 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, we included only the effect of IFNα but we kept IL6 and TNFα in the model as instrumental variables reflecting the overall level of cytokine response.
