 <italic>V</italic>, are roughly constant in absence of treatment and reflect the equilibrium between the process of viral production and viral elimination. Likewise, the number of infected cells is constant, which reflects the fact that the loss of infected cells, due to virus cytopathicity or elimination by the immune response, is compensated by 
 <italic>de novo</italic> infection of target cells that constantly replenish the pool of infected cells. In these models, the initiation of an antiviral drug may primarily block new infection with an effectiveness 
 <italic>η</italic>, or block viral production with an effectiveness 
 <italic>ε</italic>. These treatment effect parameters vary between 0 (no drug effect) and 1 (full suppression).
