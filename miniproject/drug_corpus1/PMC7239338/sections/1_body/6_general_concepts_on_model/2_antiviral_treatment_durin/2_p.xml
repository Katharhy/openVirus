<p>In chronic infection, the role of an antiviral treatment is to reduce viral replication, making the few remaining virus particles uncapable to compensate the continuous loss of infected cells and to support infection. Viral clearance can be achieved if treatment effectiveness passes a threshold, called the “critical efficacy,” and equal to

Nonetheless, this shows that high antiviral activity will be needed to compensate the impaired immune response and to achieve viral clearance in chronic infection.
