<p>In addition to historical preclinical data available from the manufacturer, new studies evaluating high dose levels of i.v. favipiravir in Mauritian cynomolgus macaques were conducted by the 
 <italic>Reaction!</italic> consortium. Altogether, favipiravir PKs was characterized in 30 uninfected cynomolgus macaques from Chinese (
 <italic>n</italic> = 17) or Mauritian (
 <italic>n</italic> = 13) colonies treated with i.v. favipiravir for 7–14 days with maintenance doses of 60–180 mg/kg b.i.d.

 </xref> Favipiravir was found to exhibit a complex nonlinear kinetics in the early days of treatment with, in addition, a progressive reduction in drug concentrations over time that could be related to the auto‐inhibition of the aldehyde oxidase, the main enzyme involved in favipiravir metabolism.
