<p>Based on these predictions, two additional studies at the doses of 150 or 180 mg/kg were conducted in cynomolgus macaques from Mauritius Island using the same design (i.e., with treatment starting 2 days prior to infection and continuing for 14 days; i.e., 12 days postinfection). We reported in the primary analysis the results obtained in animals challenged with 1,000 focus forming units. This included 13 animals left untreated and 13 treated with favipiravir doses of 100 (described above), 150 and 180 mg/kg (
 <italic>N</italic> = 3, 5, and 5, respectively). All animals left untreated or treated with 100 mg/kg died within 10 days postinfection, as already discussed above, whereas animals receiving 150 and 180 mg/kg had extended survival (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 and 0.001, respectively, compared with untreated), leading to a survival rate of 40% (2/5) and 60% (3/5), respectively, at day 21 postinfection (study termination,

 </xref>). These results allowed us to identify that favipiravir plasma trough concentrations larger than 70–80 µg/mL, which are about twice as much as found in patients of the JIKI trial (see above), were associated with reduced viral loads, lower infectious titers, and extended survival. The mechanism of action by which favipiravir reduces viral replication may be direct inhibition of the viral polymerase via chain termination, but also by the dramatic increase in virus mutagenesis revealed by genomic deep‐sequencing analyses.
