<p>A model of EVD was set up in cynomolgus macaques from a Mauritian colony, which well recapitulates the disease in humans.

 </xref> In brief, animals were infected intramuscularly with 10 to 1,000 focus forming units with Ebola virus Gabon 2001 strain, belonging to 
 <italic>Zaire ebolavirus</italic> species. Viral load was detectable in most animals at day 3 postinfection (D3), deterioration of the clinical score was visible in most animals at D5 and peak viremia was achieved at D7 with levels around 8 ± 2 log
 <sub>10</sub> EBOV RNA/mL (i.e., close to the levels observed in humans (see above)). The model is fully lethal with death occurring between D8 and D11. This is an important difference with the human infection, for which the pathogenesis is less rapid; however, the time between disease onset, defined as the observation of the first clinical signs, and peak viremia (2–4 days) is close to what has been estimated in humans (5 days).
