 </xref> Interestingly, the model predicted that favipiravir administered at day 0 had the potential to reduce the median peak viremia by about 3 logs, corresponding to a median efficacy of 90%, and, therefore, close to the critical efficacy to abrogate Zika replication (

 </xref>). Given that peak viremia occurred 2–3 days after subcutaneous infection in this animal model, the window for treatment is nonetheless narrow and the model predicted that treatment needs to be administered no later than day 1 to have a strong effect on systemic levels of viruses, at least in NHPs. In humans, lower viremia levels are often observed

 </xref> and the peak of plasma viremia occurs later, potentially allowing for later antiviral treatment initiation. Furthermore, as favipiravir penetrates the sexual compartments and crosses the blood brain barrier,

 </xref> If the probable teratogenicity of favipiravir prevent its use in pregnant women, it might be of interest for symptomatic severe central nervous system injury in adults with acute infections. However, the impact of the timing initiation on the kinetics in these compartments is unknown.
