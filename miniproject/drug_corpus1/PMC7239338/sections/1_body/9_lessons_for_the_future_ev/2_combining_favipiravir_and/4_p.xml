 </xref> Our analyses did not find a statistically significant effect of ribavirin in reducing viral production, however, the best description to the data was obtained by assuming an effect of ribavirin in preventing infected cells from dying. This possibly explains why the AST levels remained lower in ribavirin‐treated mice and could also explain the viral plateau observed at peak viremia in ribavirin monotherapy group.

 </xref> Thus, our model suggested that ribavirin did not act much as a direct antiviral against Lassa virus infection, but rather by reducing the elimination of infected cells, which could limit inflammation and extend survival.
