<p>Beyond EVD, several other hemorrhagic fevers may benefit from the evaluation of favipiravir. For instance, the promising effects on favipiravir in the NHP model of Marburg disease encouraged the implementation of a clinical trial targeting exposed people in a prophylaxis or postexposure setting. During the last Marburg outbreak in Uganda in October 2017, favipiravir was considered for such a trial, and a protocol was developed and submitted to the Inserm ethics committee and the non‐government organization Médecins Sans Frontières. Despite the fact that the rupture of the transmission chain prevented the need of the intervention, the protocol remains usable in case of new epidemic clusters arising. Likewise, the combination of favipiravir and ribavirin in Lassa virus hemorrhagic fever could be of relevance for future clinical use. However, a better understanding of the PKs and the tolerance of favipiravir in humans is now needed to identify dosing regimens that are safe and achieve the target concentrations identified in animal studies.</p>
