 <p>China was the epicenter for the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which quickly spread to other Asian countries and later to Western countries; subsequently, COVID-19 was categorized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Diagnosis primarily depends on viral detection in respiratory samples; however, available kits are limited, lack high sensitivity, and have a long turnaround time for providing results. In this scenario, computed tomography has emerged as an efficient and available high-sensitivity method, allowing radiologists to readily recognize findings related to COVID-19. The objective of this article is to demonstrate the main tomographic findings in symptomatic respiratory patients with COVID-19 to assist medical professionals during this critical moment.</p>
