<p>Consolidation refers to the replacement of air in the alveolar space by cells, tissues, or pathological fluids, obscuring the local vessels and bronchial margins, sometimes forming air bronchograms

 </sup>. In COVID-19, consolidations are often associated with ground-glass opacities with a similar distribution pattern
