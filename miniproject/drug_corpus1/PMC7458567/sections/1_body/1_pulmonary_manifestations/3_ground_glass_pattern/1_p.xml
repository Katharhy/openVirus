<p>A ground-glass pattern is defined as an increased density of the pulmonary parenchyma that does not obscure the bronchial and vascular structures within the area affected by the pathological process. Additionally, it may be related to interstitial thickening, partial air space filling, partial alveoli collapse, increased capillary blood volume, or an association with any of these factors
