<p>Initially, CT scans may fail to detect changes or indicate only small areas of ground-glass opacity, which are sometimes isolated. Over time, the number and extent of pulmonary findings increase, mainly with consolidations and crazy-paving areas. These findings usually peak around the 10th day and slowly regress. In the late stages, linear opacities are commonly observed, although ground-glass opacities and consolidations may persist
