Postmortem histopathological examinations have demonstrated diffuse alveolar damage with fibromyxoid exudates, characterized by pulmonary edema with hyaline membrane-formation and pneumocyte desquamation, which indicate an early phase of acute respiratory distress, suggesting that this is the pathological process underlying the tomographic findings of alveolar and interstitial damage and parenchymal changes
