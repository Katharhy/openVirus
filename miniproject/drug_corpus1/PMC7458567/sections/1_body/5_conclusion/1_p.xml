<p>Recent studies have suggested that chest CT has greater sensitivity but low specificity when compared to RT-PCR for the diagnosis of COVID-19

 </sup>. The predominant typical radiological findings include peripheral and bilateral multilobe and bilateral ground-glass opacities, with or without septal consolidation, round opacities with ground-glass attenuation with or without consolidation foci or septal thickening, or the reverted halo sign (or other findings of organizing pneumonia). When these imaging patterns are not present, chest CT scans can still be categorized as indeterminate, atypical, or negative for pneumonia, highlighting that some tests demonstrate no radiological changes during the earlier stages of the disease
