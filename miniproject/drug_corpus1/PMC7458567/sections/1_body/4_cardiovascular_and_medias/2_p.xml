<p>In cases of limited availability or use of echocardiogram and/or cardiac magnetic resonance, contrasted-enhanced chest CT, even if not coupled with the electrocardiogram, can provide information regarding the diameter of cardiac chambers as well as pericardial changes. The dimensions of the cardiac chambers can be estimated using the evaluation proposed by Hota et al.
