<p>In the Indonesian community, HIV transmission is increasingly from key populations to their sex partners [

 <xref rid="pone.0234697.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. One third of the estimated 46,000 annual new infections in 2018 were among women [
 <xref rid="pone.0234697.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] whose main risk factor for infection is having a male partner who injects drugs or buys sex [
 <xref rid="pone.0234697.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. HIV testing remains low due to low risk perception and high levels of HIV stigma [

 <xref rid="pone.0234697.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Consequently, many PLHIV (34%-47%) are diagnosed at an advanced stage of infection [

 <xref rid="pone.0234697.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], and women are often diagnosed only after they develop symptoms or lose a partner to HIV infection. Although active contact tracing results in earlier diagnosis [
 <xref rid="pone.0234697.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], many countries, including Indonesia, lack specific policies on HIV partner notification [
 <xref rid="pone.0234697.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Guidelines for HIV testing in Indonesia recommend testing spouses of PLHIV, but do not specify how or who should provide this service [
 <xref rid="pone.0234697.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and studies indicate low awareness of partner notification in key populations [
 <xref rid="pone.0234697.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Given the high rates of new HIV diagnosis in prisons, the lack of partner services in these settings is a conspicuous missed opportunity.
