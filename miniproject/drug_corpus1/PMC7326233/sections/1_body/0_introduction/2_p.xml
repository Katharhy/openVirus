<p>Assisted HIV partner notification services refers to when consenting PLHIV are assisted by a trained healthcare provider to disclose their HIV status or to anonymously notify their sex and/or drug-injecting partners of their potential exposure to HIV infection [

 <xref rid="pone.0234697.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the World Health Organization recommends that healthcare providers encourage and, if asked, actively assist PLHIV to notify their partners and give them options for HIV testing [
 <xref rid="pone.0234697.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This policy recommendation, however, includes no evidence from criminal justice settings, which is an important gap in the scientific literature given the important role of prisons in HIV prevention globally, and the likely challenges to engaging prisoners in partner notification.
