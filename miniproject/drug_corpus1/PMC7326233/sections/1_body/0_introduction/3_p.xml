<p>Available evidence suggests that PLHIV are mostly willing to disclose their HIV status and to participate in provider-assisted HIV partner notification [

 <xref rid="pone.0234697.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Yet, prisons are distinct psychosocial settings in which disclosure of one’s HIV status may be more stigmatizing [

 <xref rid="pone.0234697.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. 
 <italic>Approach goals</italic> are perceived positive outcomes, such as the desire for a closer relationship, that can motivate PLHIV to disclose their HIV status to others [

 <xref rid="pone.0234697.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. 
 <italic>Avoidance goals</italic> are perceived negative outcomes, such as stigma, that can cause PLHIV to avoid disclosing their HIV status to others. Individual decisions about whether and how to disclose one’s HIV status also may be influenced by a person’s past experiences with HIV disclosure [

 <xref rid="pone.0234697.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and relationship characteristics such as the desire for children and/or greater intimacy with a partner [

 <xref rid="pone.0234697.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. As researchers begin to examine the possibilities for HIV partner notification in new settings and populations, it is worth examining how PLHIV weigh these psychosocial and interpersonal factors in reaching a decision to notify their partners and choose among the various referral methods.
