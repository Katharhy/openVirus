 <xref rid="pone.0234697.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows participant scores on psychosocial factors theorized to influence willingness to endorse provider referral. On average, participants experienced moderate levels of anticipated stigma (mean = 2.7, SD = 1.1), internalized stigma (mean = 2.6, SD = 1.3) and intersectional stigma (mean = 2.8, SD = 1.1). Health locus of control was highest for the internal subscale. Participants reported greater relationship closeness to sex partners (mean = 3.15, SD = 0.94) compared to drug-injecting partners, (mean = 2.61, SD = 0.97). Although most participants had disclosed their HIV status to a close friend or family member, fewer had disclosed their HIV status to sex or drug-injecting partners.
