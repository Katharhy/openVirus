 <italic>approach goals</italic> for HIV status self-disclosure. The reasons most frequently given by participants for wanting to disclose their HIV status to their sex partners (i.e. approach goals) were to prevent partners from becoming infected, to allow partners to be tested for HIV, and to inform partners about the possibility of HIV exposure. Participantsâ€™ main reasons for wanting to disclose their HIV status to drug-injecting partners were to allow those partners to be tested for HIV, to prevent partners from being infected, and to inform partners about the possibility of HIV exposure. Participants also indicated that the desire for social support and wanting to reveal information that had caused them emotional discomfort were important reasons for disclosing their HIV status to sex and drug-injecting partners.
