<p>Most participants (91.3%, 137/150) were sexually active in the six months before incarceration (
 <xref rid="pone.0234697.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Participants identified a total of 469 sex partners in the six months before incarceration, including women (75.2%, 353/469), men (24.0%, 113/469) and male-to-female transgender persons (&lt;1.0%, 3/469). Nearly half of those who were sexually active before incarceration (48.1%, 66/137) reported sex with just one person, while half (51.8%, 71/137) reported sex with two or more partners. Most of those who were sexually active before incarceration acknowledged having a main sex partner (someone with whom they had a regular and committed sexual relationship), and about half acknowledged having casual sex partners during that time. Condom use with sex partners was low overall (between

 <italic>sometimes</italic>), and participants were significantly less likely to have used condoms with main partners compared to non-main partners (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001). A few participants also reported injecting drugs or sharing needles with main and casual sex partners before incarceration. Only a quarter of participants reported that their main sex partner had ever received an HIV test.
