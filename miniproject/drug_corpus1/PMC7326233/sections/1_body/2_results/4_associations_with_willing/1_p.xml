<p>Multivariate associations with willingness to endorse provider referral from the logistic regression are shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0234697.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. In an adjusted model, each one unit increase in anticipated stigma was associated with a 42% lower odds of being willing to endorse provider referral to notify sex partners (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.35, 0.96), and a 46% lower odds of endorsing provider referral to notify drug-injecting partners (aOR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.29, 1.00). Conversely, relationship closeness was associated with a higher adjusted odds of endorsing provider referral to notify drug-injecting partners (aOR = 2.08, 95% CI: 1.25, 3.45). The adjusted odds of endorsing provider referral to notify sex partners decreased with age and was lower for those diagnosed during the current prison term, those who had not yet disclosed their HIV status to friends or family members, and those with higher chance locus of control scores; however, these associations were not statistically significant.
