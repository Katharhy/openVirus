<p>A key finding from this study was that participants with higher anticipated stigma were less likely to endorse provider referral to notify sex or drug injecting partners. Previous research suggests that PLHIV often experience anxiety about disclosing their HIV status to others [
 <xref rid="pone.0234697.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] and that those with higher anticipated stigma and fewer coping resources are less likely to disclose their HIV status or agree to notify partners [
 <xref rid="pone.0234697.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Although HIV partner notification rarely results in social or economic harms for people in community settings [

 <xref rid="pone.0234697.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], the risks for people in prison are unknown. PLHIV in prison suffer the social costs of multiple stigmatizing identities [

 <xref rid="pone.0234697.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], yet have fewer resources for coping with stigma. Disclosure that results in loss of social support may have greater negative consequences for PLHIV who often depend on their partners for housing, financial security, and treatment support after prison release. Yet, it is also possible that partner notification could lead to greater relationship closeness and stability [
 <xref rid="pone.0234697.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], which is an especially important outcome in the context of prisons given that incarceration often destabilizes the lives of inmates and their sex partners in ways that increase their risk of HIV exposure [
 <xref rid="pone.0234697.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0234697.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. We have argued elsewhere that implementing HIV partner services in prisons raises serious ethical challenges [
 <xref rid="pone.0234697.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], including questions about the ability of service providers within these settings to ensure that partner services are provided consistent with rights-based WHO guidelines [
 <xref rid="pone.0234697.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Interventions that give PLHIV in prison greater control over their health information and health care decisions are likely to reduce stigma and improve acceptance and utilization of partner services.
