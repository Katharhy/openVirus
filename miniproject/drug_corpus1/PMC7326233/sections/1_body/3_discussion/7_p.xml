Participants were not asked which partner notification method they would prefer, nor were they asked about their sex/drug-injecting partners within prison who also may benefit from HIV testing. Our cross-sectional design does not allow us to infer the direction of associations and absence of an association could be due to insufficient power. Most study measures were developed for community populations and may be less reliable or reflective of the concerns of people in prisons. Participants in this study were asked to generalize about their interpersonal relationships, yet disclosure decisions are likely made based on consideration of the specific circumstances of each individual relationship. Further studies are needed to understand which of these factors most influence individual decisions as to whether and how to notify partners. Finally, participants were recruited from just two male prisons and not randomly selected, which limits generalizability, including to female prisoners, who are a smaller share of Indonesiaâ€™s prison population (5.5%) [
