<p>This study is, to our knowledge, the first to explore the acceptability of HIV partner services in prisons and provides important new insights as to the potential risks and benefits of partner notification from the perspective of incarcerated PLHIV, a group that is vastly underrepresented in the partner services literature [
 <xref rid="pone.0234697.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Based on a relatively large and representative sample of PLHIV, we provide detailed estimates for the number and characteristics of potentially notifiable partners, which may be useful for establishing a contact tracing period and allocating resources for future intervention work. Guided by an explicit theory, our analysis of interpersonal and psychosocial factors influencing disclosure provides a roadmap for developing disclosure decision aids and other tools to support voluntary and informed decision-making in these settings. Set in a country where many PLHIV are diagnosed in prison, our findings may usefully guide work in other LMICs with HIV epidemics likewise concentrated in prisons.
