<p>In this study, researchers examined the acceptability of anonymous notification by a health service provider (i.e. provider referral) and approach and avoidance goals for HIV status self-disclosure in a sample of incarcerated PLHIV, most of whom were sexually active and using drugs before incarceration. We found that two-thirds (66.4%) of PLHIV endorsed provider referral as an acceptable method to notify their sex partners and nearly three quarters (72.4%) endorsed provider referral to notify their drug-injecting partners. Although participants were presented only with a hypothetical scenario (i.e., participants were told that researchers had no intention to notify partners), these high levels of acceptance held constant regardless of the index patientâ€™s age, sexual orientation, or past disclosure experiences, signaling an important opportunity to implement WHO-recommended HIV partner services in prisons. Nevertheless, our findings also show that anticipated stigma, fear of rejection, and privacy concerns may be important barriers to assisted partner notification and that researchers and service providers will need to consider carefully how best to address these concerns to promote the safety of PLWH and ensure the broadest possible participation. Because people in prison may be estranged from or have difficulty contacting their partners, the service option of provider referral offers a practical alternative that relieves the burden of informing a partner, offers anonymity, and expedites notification.</p>
