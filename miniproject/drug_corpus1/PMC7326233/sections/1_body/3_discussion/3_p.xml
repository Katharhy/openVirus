<p>Findings from this study indicate ongoing HIV transmission risk to index patients and their partners and suggest that partner notification could play an important role in mitigating the risk of future exposure. For example, some PLHIV continued to inject drugs and share injecting equipment within prison. These activities, coupled with low rates of ART adherence within prison, pose a major challenge for preventing the emergence and transmission of drug-resistant HIV. Recent research in Indonesia demonstrates that incarceration is the single-most important risk factor for acquiring drug resistant HIV in PWID [

Although indispensable for improving health outcomes and reducing HIV transmission, these interventions require high levels of adherence in order to be effective and do not address the needs of partners who may already have shared an exposure. Contact tracing for key populations and their sex partners, who together account for 47% of new infections globally [
