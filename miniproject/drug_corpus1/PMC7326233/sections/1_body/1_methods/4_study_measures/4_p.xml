 <xref rid="pone.0234697.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], with subscales measuring anticipated stigma, internalized stigma, and intersectional stigma (i.e., stigma associated with substance use and incarceration). Participants indicated the frequency of stigma experiences on a 5-point Likert-type scale from 
 <italic>never</italic> to 
 <italic>always</italic>, with higher scores indicating higher perceived stigma. Reliability was high (15 items; Î± = 0.91). Disclosure history was assessed using a multiple-response question asking participants whether they had disclosed their HIV status to a close friend, family member, sex partner, or drug-injecting partner. Participants who had not disclosed their status to anyone were classified as having never disclosed.
