<p>Researchers assessed participants’ 
 <italic>approach</italic> and 
 <italic>avoidance goals</italic> for HIV status self-disclosure using statements from The Reasons for Disclosure Questionnaire, which measures reasons for disclosure/non-disclosure after an HIV diagnosis [
 <xref rid="pone.0234697.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The Reasons for Disclosure Questionnaire consists of 24 statements measuring 5 reasons for disclosing (catharsis, duty to inform, test the other persons’ reactions, relationship support and similarity), and 6 reasons for non-disclosure (privacy, self-blame, communication difficulties, fear of rejection, protecting the other, and superficial relationship). Participants were asked which of the various reasons might be most influential in deciding whether or not to disclose their HIV status to 1) sex and/or 2) drug-injecting partners with whom they may have shared an HIV exposure.
