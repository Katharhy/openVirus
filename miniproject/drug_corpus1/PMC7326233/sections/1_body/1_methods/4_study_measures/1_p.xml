<p>The two main outcomes in this study were: 1) the acceptability of provider referral as a method for notifying sex and drug-injecting partners, and 2) 
 <italic>approach</italic> and 
 <italic>avoidance goals</italic> for HIV status self-disclosure. To assess the acceptability of provider referral, researchers first read a script describing provider referral as a process in which a nurse or doctor helps to confidentially notify and offer HIV testing to partners who may have been exposed to HIV through sex or needle-sharing. Participants then were asked whether or not they would be willing to let a nurse or doctor confidentially notify their 1) sex and/or 2) drug-injecting partner(s) in the community of possible HIV exposure, with response options for 
 <italic>yes</italic> and 
 <italic>no</italic>. Researchers explained that partner notification questions were only to ascertain whether such services were of interest to participants and that researchers had no plans to collect information about or to notify partners.
