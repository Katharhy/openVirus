<p>Three items adapted from the Unidimensional Relationship Closeness Scale [
 <xref rid="pone.0234697.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] were used to assess how close participants were to their sex and drug-injecting partner(s). Items included, 
 <italic>How close are you to your sex (drug-injecting) partners</italic>, 
 <italic>How important are your sex (drug-injecting) partners</italic>, and 
 <italic>How often do you see your sex (drug-injecting) partners</italic>. Responses were given on a four-point Likert-type scale. Preliminary analyses suggested that the items were reliable (sex partners, α = 0.82; drug-injecting partners, α = 0.74). Composite scores were created to indicate relationship closeness, with higher scores indicating greater closeness.
