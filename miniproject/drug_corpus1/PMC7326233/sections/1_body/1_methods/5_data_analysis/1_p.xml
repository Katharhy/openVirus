<p>This study was a secondary data analysis of pilot data to generate hypotheses for a future study. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample and examine pre-incarceration HIV treatment and behavioral risk factors. Due to low missing data, no imputation was required. We conducted separate bivariate and multivariate analyses to examine associations with willingness to endorse provider referral to notify 1) sex partners, limiting our analysis to participants who were sexually active in the 6 months before incarceration; and 2) drug-injecting partners, limiting our analysis to participants with a pre-incarceration drug injection history. To fit a final model with few parameters, we selected for inclusion in our model socio-demographic variables with a significant bivariate association (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05; i.e., age, diagnosis in prison or community) or theorized to influence acceptability of provider referral (i.e., stigma, disclosure history, relationship closeness, health locus of control). Finally, we examined participantsâ€™
