<p>PLHIV in prison are often the last to receive internationally-recommended HIV prevention and treatment services, to the detriment of individual and public health. Assisted HIV partner services are demonstrably safe and effective in reaching people with undiagnosed infection and may prove even more potent when offered to PLHIV in prison as part of a comprehensive package of HIV prevention and treatment services. As this study shows, PLHIV in prison understand the importance of notifying their partners and are prepared to accept notification assistance from healthcare providers. Despite their present circumstances and the possibility that their partners may reject them, a majority of PLHIV in these prisons are committed to seeing that their partners receive information about HIV testing, treatment, and support. Provider-assisted approaches offer a simple and potentially effective way to notify these partners and could alleviate some of the difficulties and concerns that PLHIV have about notifying partners themselves. Given the recentness of their diagnosis, the high frequency of drug and sex risk behaviors before incarceration, and their expressed willingness to notify partners, PLHIV in prison are excellent candidates for partner services. Assisted partner notification for PLHIV in prison may provide a targeted and resource conserving approach to confront emerging challenges within the current HIV epidemic in Indonesia, including rapidly increasing new infections and barriers to HIV testing in women and a surge in drug-resistant HIV among PWID that is tied to prisons. While further studies are required to ascertain the actual risks and benefits of implementing partner services in prisons, this study shows that lack of acceptability is no longer an argument for withholding this vital assistance.</p>
