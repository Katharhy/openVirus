<p>There is no magic bullet for controlling the sexual transmission of the HIV epidemic. Though there are a few, new prevention strategies developed in recent years, unfortunately none can be used alone to stop the epidemic. Cases in African countries or parts of China have demonstrated that implementation of combined interventions can achieve epidemic control.

 </sup> Controlling the HIV epidemic, particularly the sexual transmission of HIV, should focus on three critical areas: infectious cases, transmission mode, and the susceptible population. Prevention must consider fully implementing all strategies listed in the 13th 5-year action plan. We need to prioritize the key areas and key populations, and develop specific implementation plans for execution. Yunnan can serve as role model for the rest of China, as the province has developed its own annual plan for setting specific targets to achieve the 90-90-90 targets by 2020. Only when we work hard to implement all planned strategies in targeted populations can the number of new HIV infections be reduced.
