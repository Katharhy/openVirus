 </sup> HIV prevention strategies have shifted from previously focusing on health education, behavioral interventions, and condom promotion, towards a focus on people living with HIV (PLWH) and using biological strategies, such as anti-retroviral therapy (ART) to achieve viral suppression. Anti-retroviral medicines can now be used to eliminate transmissibility, or be provided to those who are not infected but considered high risk to prevent their HIV infection.

 </sup> Other prevention strategies, such as male circumcision, have been widely used in some African countries; while pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been adopted in some developed countries as national control strategies to reduce new HIV infections among people at high-risk of HIV infection.
