 </sup> Furthermore, there is no signal that the epidemic is going to slow down. With an increased number of people tested for HIV, the number of newly diagnosed HIV cases is steadily increasing. For the past four years, over 100,000 newly diagnosed HIV cases have been reported each year, climbing to over 148,500 new cases in 2018.
