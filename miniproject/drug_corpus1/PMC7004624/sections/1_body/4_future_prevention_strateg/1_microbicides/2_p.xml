<p>Microbicide development research in China was launched in 2008 under the National 11th Five-Year Plan on HIV.

Microbicides provide a new and unique opportunity for HIV prevention without requiring a daily pill such as PrEP. Thus, this discreet, long-acting method may be a new strategy to reduce sexual transmission of HIV in China.</p>
