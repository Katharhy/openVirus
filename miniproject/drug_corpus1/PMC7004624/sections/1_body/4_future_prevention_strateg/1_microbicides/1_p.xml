<p>Microbicides are new products being studied that contain drugs that prevent vaginal or rectal transmission of HIV via sexual exposure. These microbicides can take the form of vaginal rings, gels, films, inserts, or enemas, aimed at preventing HIV or STIs. Several studies over the past decade have examined the safety and efficacy of such preventative measures. A clinical trial conducted in 15 sites across Southern and Southeastern Africa showed that a vaginal ring which continually released the ART drug Dapivirine, provided a modest level of protection against HIV infection in women.
