<p>Globally, transmission of HIV through blood transfusion is relatively uncommon, accounting for a small proportion of HIV infections around the world.

 </sup> Since 2015, the Chinese government has scaled-up HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) testing strategies, to shorten the “window period” of HIV infectiousness, or the time between potential exposure to HIV infection and when the HIV test will provide an accurate result. During this period, a person can be infected with HIV, but test negative for the disease. From approximately 14 to 21 days using 4th generation antigen and antibody tests, to some 10 to 14 days using RNA nuclear acid methods, the widespread use of these newer tests have reduced the risk of HIV infection via blood transfusion by almost half. Challenges remain; as sporadic cases of HIV infection during this “window period” have been reported in China. Strategically, self-deferral of men who have sex with men (MSM) from blood donation is a key strategy in protecting the blood supply, as HIV prevalence in this group is much higher than in the general population in China.

 </sup> Studies have estimated however, that MSM continue to account for a proportion of blood donors, as a large proportion of MSM use blood donation as a means for HIV testing.

 </sup> The use of their blood may place recipients at a greater risk of HIV infection if transfused during the window period. As more cases of HIV are identified amongst donors, the higher chance of “window period” infections and the higher the risk of HIV transmission via transfusion. To ensure blood safety, laboratory screening is not enough. This should be supplemented with screening of potential high-risk blood donors, including screening for specific behaviors rather than periods of abstinence.

 </sup> In China, screening of blood donors and improved supervision and management of the blood supply is needed to eliminate the risk of “window period” transfusion.
