<p>Since 2004, China has promoted condom use in female sex workers and MSM for the prevention of HIV sexual transmission. Sentinel surveillance results from 2015 showed that 77% of sex workers and 53% of MSM reported condom use during the last sexual episode.

 </sup> From 2006 to 2015, the HIV prevalence among female sex workers consistently remained below 1%, while the prevalence of HIV among MSM increased from 1% to 8% during the same period time. Therefore, promoting condom use only is not an effective method for eliminating HIV sexual transmission. It must be combined with other prevention measures.

 </sup> Additionally, long-term and routine condom promotion strategies, which emphasize awareness of condom use and promote higher availability of condoms, should be implemented to address these ongoing concerns.
