<p>PMTCT is also a key component of China's national HIV/AIDS strategy. In 2005, China started its first PMTCT program in eight cities throughout the country. This program provided free HIV testing and treatment as a standardized part of HIV antenatal care.

 </sup> China's Integrated Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV, Syphilis, and Hepatitis B program was later launched in 2010 and extended nationwide in 2015. As a result, more than 99% of HIV-infected pregnant women were tested and 90% received treatment in 2017. In the same year, the mother-to-child transmission rate of HIV was 4.9%, falling from 12.8% in 2005.

 </sup> The key components of China's PMTCT program, including (1) routine, provider initiated, opt-out HIV screening during pregnancy, delivery, and post-partum, (2) maternal ART, (3) infant prophylaxis, and (4) follow-up testing for infants and children, have played critical roles in reducing mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Since implementing the PMTCT program, HIV testing rates among HIV-positive mothers and the number receiving ART have both increased, though challenges still remain. Improved collaboration efforts and quality of services are needed to achieve total elimination of mother-to-child transmission in China.
