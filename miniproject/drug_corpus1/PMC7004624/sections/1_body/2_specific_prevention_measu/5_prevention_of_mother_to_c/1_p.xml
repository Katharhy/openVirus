<p>Mother-to-child transmission, also known as “vertical transmission,” occurs when HIV is transmitted from an HIV-positive mother to her child during pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding. Without ARV treatment, the likelihood of a positive pregnant woman passing the virus to her child is 15% to 45%.

 </sup> Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programs offer a range of services for women to help maintain their health during pregnancy and stop their infants from acquiring HIV. More than one million HIV infections among children have been prevented between 2010 and 2018 due to the implementation of PMTCT interventions.
