<p>Increasing HIV knowledge and awareness is crucial to improving behavioral risk decisions and stopping the spread of HIV. After 30 years of the fight against HIV in China, most of the public is familiar with HIV and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), even though they may not fully understand the disease. In China, the most powerful AIDS education campaign was the national HIV testing campaign program in 2004 to 2005, targeting former plasma donors and other key populations.

 </sup> This campaign was directed towards former commercial plasma donors who sold blood plasma in the mid-1990s. The campaign taught them about the risk of selling blood and HIV infection, promoting their need to get tested. In conjunction with this educational messaging, the campaign mobilized different government entities to update national HIV/AIDS policies and improve basic knowledge about HIV/AIDS. Since then, HIV education program has been expanded to the general population and other high-risk groups in collaboration with other international groups such as the United Nations Jointed Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and United Nations Population Fund. Subsequently, public knowledge about HIV has been increasing. A general AIDS awareness campaign alone, however, may not be sufficient to control the HIV epidemic and eliminate stigmatization of the disease. More face-to-face education programs in factories, rural areas, schools, and amongst families is needed in China, as studies have found general lower levels of HIV awareness within these groups.

 </sup> Additionally, though previous efforts focused on providing the correct educational messages grounded in scientific research, we often ignored the target audience's interests and needs, with current messaging potentially only reaching those whom have been impacted by the disease. Though general AIDS educational campaigns can raise overall awareness of the general public, these types of programs have not been evaluated to measure their effectiveness in reducing the number of HIV infections or determining the changes in HIV knowledge in the general population over time. Subsequently, new educational campaigns building on the successes of previous efforts should use messaging that caters to specific audiences in their own language and in familiar settings to be more effective.
