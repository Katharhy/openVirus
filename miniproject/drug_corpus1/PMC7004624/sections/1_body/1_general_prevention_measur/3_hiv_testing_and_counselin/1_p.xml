<p>Voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) has been shown to be one of the most effective strategies in finding and diagnosing HIV+ individuals and is also an important entry point into care and treatment. VCT can reduce risk behaviors and is an important strategy for reducing HIV transmission, as awareness of HIV status has been shown to help increase safer sexual practices.

 </sup> China adopted VCT as a part of its national HIV programming in 2003 and this program has since been expanded to over 10,000 sites by the end of 2018.

 </sup> More importantly, the cases diagnosed at VCT centers are usually among individuals whom have yet to progress to late-stage HIV, compared to cases diagnosed in hospital settings. Thus, these patients often initiate ART sooner, giving them a chance to live longer, while also reducing secondary HIV transmission in the community.
