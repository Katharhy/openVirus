<p>PLWH who are unaware of their status rarely actively seek HIV testing. To diagnose cases earlier, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a guideline to promote provider-initiated HIV testing and counseling (PITC). These guidelines support HIV testing initiated by the provider rather than the patient and emphasized the importance of early diagnosis. The PITC guideline has been adopted by member countries and promotes HIV testing globally.

Since that time, the number of HIV tests and the number of HIV cases diagnosed at medical care settings has significantly increased, accounting for about 60% of total tests and over 50% of diagnosed HIV cases throughout the country.
