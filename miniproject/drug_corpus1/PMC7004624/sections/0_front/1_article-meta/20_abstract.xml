 <p>This paper reviews the current epidemics of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in China, particularly the globally available prevention strategies developed and implemented. This review focuses on HIV prevention measures in general, such as education, testing, and counseling and in specific responses to transmission modes, such as blood safety, harm reduction for people who inject drugs, and condom promotion to reduce sexual transmission. We also assess newly developed prevention measures, such as prevention treatment, pre-exposure prophylaxis, post-exposure prophylaxis, male circumcision, and promising potential future preventions, including microbicides and vaccines. Based on this assessment, we provide recommendations for their implementation in China. We conclude that there is no magic bullet for HIV prevention, particularly sexual transmission of the disease, but only a combination of these prevention strategies can control the HIV epidemic.</p>
