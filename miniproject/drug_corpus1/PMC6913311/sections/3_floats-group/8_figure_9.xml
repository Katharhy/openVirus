  <p>Inhibition of protein synthesis by crude drugs. MDCK(+) cells were infected with influenza virus at an input m.o.i. of 5 and maintained in DMEM containing 3.2, 6.3, or 12.5 mg/ml of 
   <italic>Glycyrrhizae radix</italic> or 
   <italic>Cnidii rhizome</italic>. At 7 h after infection, the cells were pulse-labeled with EXPRESS Protein Labeling Mix, [
   <sup>35</sup>S] for 20 min. Proteins were immunoprecipitated by using anti-influenza virus rabbit serum and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. Radioactivity was analyzed by using a Fujix BAS 2000 image analyzer. IP: immunoprecipitated with an anti-influenza virus antibody. Total: cell lysates before immunoprecipitation were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and a part of the image corresponding to the region of M1 protein roughly ranging from 25 to 60 kDa is shown.
