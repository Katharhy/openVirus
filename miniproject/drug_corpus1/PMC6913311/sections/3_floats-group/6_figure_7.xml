  <p>Measurement of infectious titers and calculation of IC
   <sub>50</sub>. Virus infectivity in the medium prepared as described in the legend of 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> at an m.o.i. of 0.2 was measured. The logarithms of infectious titers and crude drug concentrations were plotted, and IC
   <sub>50</sub> values were calculated on the basis of a linear approximated line.
