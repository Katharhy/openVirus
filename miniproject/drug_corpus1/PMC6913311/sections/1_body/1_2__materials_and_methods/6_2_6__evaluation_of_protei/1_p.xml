<p>MDCK(+) cells were infected with the virus at an input m.o.i. of 5, and after 1 h of virus adsorption, the inoculum was replaced with DMEM containing 3.2, 6.3, or 12.5 mg/ml of 
 <italic>Glycyrrhizae radix</italic> or 
 <italic>Cnidii rhizome</italic>. At 7 h after infection, the cells were incubated for 30 min in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and then labeled with EXPRESS Protein Labeling Mix, [
 <sup>35</sup>S] (PerkinElmer, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) for 20 min. The cells were lysed in a radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 150 mM NaCl, and Complete proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics)) as described previously [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Proteins were immunoprecipitated by using anti-influenza virus rabbit serum and protein A-conjugated Sepharose beads (Pharmacia, Sweden) and analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Radioactivity was analyzed by using a Fujix BAS 2000 image analyzer (Fuji Medical Systems, Inc., Tokyo, Japan).
