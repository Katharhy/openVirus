<p>MDCK(+) cells were infected with the virus at an input multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 5 or 0.2. After 1 h adsorption, the virus inoculum was removed and the cells were further incubated in DMEM containing a Kampo drug or a crude drug at different concentrations and 30 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml of trypsin (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). After 24 h, the medium was harvested and processed for a hemagglutinin (HA) test with chicken erythrocytes and for virus infectivity measurement by the TCID
 <sub>50</sub> method. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of a reagent was calculated by using the media from cells infected at an input m.o.i. of 0.2. Logarithms of the infectivity titers in the medium and concentrations of a reagent were plotted in a graph, and a linear approximate line was drawn for the calculation.
