<p>MDCK(+) cells, canine kidney-derived cells described in [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimum essential medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplement with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Biosera, Kansas City, MO, U.S.A.), penicillin G (100 units/ml, Meiji Seika Pharma, Tokyo, Japan), and streptomycin (100

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and its infectivity was measured by calculating the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) in MDCK(+) cells in a 96-well plate as described previously [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Antiserum against influenza virus was prepared by immunizing a rabbit with purified A/Udorn/72 (H3N2) virions [
