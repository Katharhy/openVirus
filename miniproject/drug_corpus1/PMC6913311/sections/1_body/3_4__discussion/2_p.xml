<p>In the present study, five Kampo drugs that are prescribed for patients with respiratory symptoms were examined for their effects on influenza virus replication in cultured cells. Four of the five Kampo drugs suppressed virus replication. Among the Kampo drugs, the anti-influenza virus activity of maoto was particularly potent and maoto suppressed replication of the virus at an m.o.i. of 5, suggesting that it can inhibit the growth of a virus in infected cells. Kakkonto also weakly inhibited the growth of influenza virus at an m.o.i. of 5. At infection with an m.o.i. of 0.2, virus growth was markedly inhibited by jiinkokato and senkyuchachosan, indicating that the production of progeny virions or the process of infecting nearby cells was inhibited. On the other hand, these drugs did not inactivate virus particles.</p>
