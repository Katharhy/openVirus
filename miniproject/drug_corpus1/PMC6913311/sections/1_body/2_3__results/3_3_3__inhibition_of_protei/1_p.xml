<p>Inhibition of viral protein synthesis by 
 <italic>Glycyrrhizae radix</italic> and 
 <italic>Cnidii rhizome</italic> was also examined. MDCK(+) cells were infected with influenza virus at an m.o.i. of 5 and cultured in the presence of the crude drugs at various concentrations. At 7â€‰h after infection, proteins were pulse-labeled with 
 <sup>35</sup>S-Cys and -Met for 20 minutes and immunoprecipitated with an anti-influenza virus antibody. 
 <italic>Glycyrrhizae radix</italic> specifically inhibited viral protein synthesis without affecting overall cellular protein synthesis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Only the M1 protein is shown in the figure, but similar results were obtained for other viral proteins (data not shown). On the other hand, 
 <italic>Cnidii rhizoma</italic> did not inhibit viral protein synthesis.
