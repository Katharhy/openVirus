<p>The cytotoxicity of the Kampo drugs against MDCK(+) cells used in infection experiments was investigated. A Kampo drug was added to the culture media at various concentrations indicated in the figure, and cytotoxicity assays were performed to measure the levels of the deviating enzyme LDH in the media after 24 h (

High LDH values were obtained at the highest concentration of 24.5 mg/ml for senkyuchachosan and at the highest concentration of 21.9 mg/ml for bakumondoto, but there was no increase in LDH in other conditions, indicating almost no cytotoxicity of the drugs.
