<p>Each Kampo drug at the highest concentrations shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> was mixed with the virus, and infectivity was measured (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The Kampo drugs did not significantly reduce the infectivity, indicating that the Kampo drugs did not inactivate virus infectivity. This indicates that the Kampo drugs act on virus-infected cells, not virus particles.
