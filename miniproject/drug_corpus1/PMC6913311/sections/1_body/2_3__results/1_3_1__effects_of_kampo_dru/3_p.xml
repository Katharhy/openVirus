<p>MDCK(+) cells were infected with influenza virus at an m.o.i. of 0.2 or 5, and then various concentrations of a Kampo drug were added to the culture media. After 24 h, the HA titers of the culture media were measured (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In the case of an m.o.i. of 5, a condition in which all cells are infected, maoto had inhibitory effects depending on its concentrations. Kakkonto and senkyuchachosan also had inhibitory effects at high concentrations. On the other hand, at an m.o.i. of 0.2, a condition in which some of the cells are infected first and then the virus spreads, all of the Kampo drugs except bakumondoto suppressed HA titers at around or above the level of 3 mg/ml (
