<p>The complexes were immersed in orthorhombic box (10 × 10 × 10 Å) of TIP3P solvent with 15,472 (ID 5817), 15,459 (ID 6799) and 15,467 (72187) water molecules, respectively, buffered at a distance of 10 Å after the determination of topology and atomic coordinates of protein with the edge of the box. A constant temperature of 300 K along with isobaric isothermal ensemble (NPT equilibrium) was used by Nose–Hoover chain thermostat along with Martyn–Tobais–Klein barostat for maintaining pressure at one bar for 50 ns for MD simulations. The resulting trajectories of protein–ligand interactions were recorded at every 50.0 ps interval for analysis. The simulations interaction diagrams, protein structure details, protein–ligand RMSD and individual RMSF figures were generated.</p>
