<p>The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for protein–ligand interaction was done by using ‘Desmond module’ for studying the conformational change of protein in a solvent (

The influence and structural stability of water molecules was investigated by running the protocol for 50 ns after following the MD protocol of minimization, heating, equilibrium and production run. The default protocol with OPLS3e force field of Desmond was used to saturate, minimizing the energy and determination of partial charges (Bowers et al.,
