<p>The recognition of the active site or the binding site of the target structure is a key step in drug designing through computational docking of the novel chemical moieties. The active site of 6VYO target was found to be a pocket like region containing a mix of hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions with a variety of hydrogen donors and acceptors. The active sites for receptor–ligand binding interaction of 6VYO proteins were predicted using sitemap modules in Maestro 12.0 Schrodinger suite (Halgren, 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The receptor grid was generated using the generation module in Maestro 12.0 Schrodinger suite by preferring active site residues after their prediction. The size of grid box was centroid of selected residues of the protein receptor. The atoms of protein were fixed within the default parameters of the radii of Vander Waal’s scaling factor of 1 Å with partial charge cut-off of 0.25 Å using OPLS3e force field and 20 Å docked ligand length. The dimensions of the grid box and receptor setup were

 <italic>y</italic> = 20 Å, 
 <italic>z</italic> = 20 Å and 
 <italic>x</italic> = 10 Å, 
 <italic>y</italic> = 10 Å, 
 <italic>z</italic> = 10 Å during docking study, respectively, with a grid space of 1 Å.
