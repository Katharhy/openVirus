<p>The five active sites were obtained which were designated as Site 1, Site 2, Site 3, Site 4 and Site 5. Out of these, three sites were selected for further analysis based on the DScore of more than one (DScore of Sites 1, 2 and 3 were1.039, 0.99 and 1.045, respectively). The 2D structure of ligands were downloaded from Asinex and PubChem open chemistry databases. Thus, a total of 8987 (eight thousands nine hundred and eighty-seven) ligands were grouped into two libraries (Lib A and Lib B). The Lib A included 8722 antiviral compounds downloaded from Asinex Elite molecular database (
