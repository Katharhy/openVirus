<p>The seven inhibitors were analyzed for their drug likeliness and pharmacokinetic properties such as ADME/T (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Elimination or Toxicity) (Butina et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). The QikProp module implemented in the ‘Schrodinger Suite 2019’ was used to estimate the drug likeliness of the inhibitors using pharmacokinetic parameters such as probable H-bonding atoms, human oral absorption (&lt;25%: poor; &gt;above 80%: good) and the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for blockage of human Ether-a-go-go-Related Gene (hERG) K + channels(&lt; −5: satisfactory) and Lipinski’s rule of five (Lipinski,
