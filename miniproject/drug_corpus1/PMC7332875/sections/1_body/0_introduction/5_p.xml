<p>All the SARS-CoV-2 proteins are potential drug targets thus inhibiting N-proteins will impair the viral replication machinery (Gordon et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Many studies have been conducted with different targets of this virus such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Elfiky, 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2020b</xref>), Spike protein/ACE2 (Hasan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) and main proteases (Elmezayen et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Pant et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Others have been conducted to find the potential treatments like phytochemicals (Aanouz et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Elfiky, 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2020a</xref>; Enmozhi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Islam et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). However, because of the lack of safety and toxicity studies, they will take time for further validation and clinical trials. Therefore, designing and repurposing the drugs from FDA approved drug for inhibiting N protein binding with RNA domains will lead to the inhibition of viral replication and subsequent virion formation of SARS-CoV-2.
