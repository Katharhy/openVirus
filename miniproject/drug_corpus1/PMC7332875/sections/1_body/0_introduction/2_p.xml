<p>Coronaviruses (CoV) are the positively single stranded RNA enveloped viruses having spherical or pleomorphic shape with club shaped glycoproteins on their outer surface (Fehr &amp; Perlman, 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Thus, deriving its name from a Latin word meaning ‘crown or halo’ (Paules et al., 2020). There are seven recognized strains of these viruses such as 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1, and the latest and novel SARS-CoV-2 which is responsible for the current outbreak (Zhu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The last two epidemics due to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV were associated with 10% and 37% mortality, respectively (Huang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The SARS-CoV-2 is causing the COVID-19 disease with variable mortality in different countries of almost all continents. It has been declared as the pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) (Eurosurveillance, 
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). It directly affects the respiratory tract leading to the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and death in the want of oxygen (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).
