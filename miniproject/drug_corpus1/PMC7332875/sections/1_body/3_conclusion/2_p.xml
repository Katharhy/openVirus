<p>We identified a total of seven hits in the first step after molecular docking, four from Asinex and three from PubChem database, which can inhibit the structural N proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Many studies are targeting different proteins including main protease (Mahanta et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Mittal et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) and spike proteins (Basit et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; de Oliveira et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). However, the homologous proteins of NTD has been used in one earlier study that has shown theophylline and pyrimidine groups of drugs as promisable interactions (Sarma et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). However, our study is the first study that targeted binding potential of known drugs and drug like moieties on the crystallized novel proteins structure 6VYO. There are 4–5 significant hydrogen bond interactions, on an average, associated with each drug molecule. It has interestingly been found that most of the hydrogen bonds interactions of all the seven drugs mainly are associated with ASN residues.
