<p>Thus, four Asinex ligands (5817, 6799, 6797, 7025) and three FDA approved drug molecules (PubChem ID: 72187, 135413534, 37542) were found to have good docking score on each site (Site 1, Site 2 and Site 3). The drug like moieties from Asinex have antiviral activities and drugs from PubChem databases are Zidovudine, Valganciclovir and Ribavirin. Thus, anti-HIV drugs as well as anti-Herpes drugs are active on this protein. Furthermore, second-step analysis was done by MD simulation to find final three drugs. Out of those, Zidovudine has stronger and more stable interaction with this protein structure. Therefore, the drugs especially Zidovudine can be further explored in the clinical trial as the potential treatment against the SARS CoV-2.</p>
