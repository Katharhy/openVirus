<p>Three best docked compounds Asinex 5817, 6799 and PubChem 72187 (Zidovudine) were subjected to MD simulations for 50 ns. The RMSD and RMSF values were used to observe the stability of protein–ligand complexes as compared to unbound protein structure. The RMSD plot of 5817, 6799 and 72187 are depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(A</xref>, B &amp; C), respectively. Figure 5(A) elaborates the interaction of protein with the ligand Asinex 5817. It shows main bimodal fluctuations at 3.4 Å during 12–18 ns interval and another at 3.4 Å for 30–36 ns. However, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6</xref>A, B and C show the favorable residual interactions which remained for more than 30% of the time. The hydrogen bonds with more than 70% duration of interactions were considered as strong bonds. The interaction with 40–70% was considered as medium while less than 40% was clubbed into weak hydrogen interactions. The medium strength of interaction of ligands were seen with D: ASN75 (66%) and C: TYR109 (45%). It also has D: TRP 52 linked to the center of the benzene ring with Pi–Pi interaction stocking at 72%. Other residues such as C: ARG107, C: THR57, D: ASP82 and D: ALA155 showed water bridges links.
