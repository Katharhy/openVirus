<p>The RMSF fluctuation is also very low in case of Zidovudine (0.8 minimum to 4.3) as compared to two other ligands [5817 (minimum 0.8–5.8) and 6799 (minimum 1.2–6.2). Figure 7 shows comparative binding free energy (Δ
 <italic>G</italic> bind) which were calculated at every 5 ns of all three ligands. The Δ
 <italic>G</italic> bind value for the three ligands 5817, 6799 and 72187 calculated over 50 ns are −51.96, −64.36 and −59.43, respectively. The binding free energy (Δ
 <italic>G</italic> bind) are very significant in all the three ligands. It can be seen (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6(A, B and C)</xref>) that compound 5817, 6799 and 72187 formed more stable hydrogen bonds with the residues of binding Site 3 of target protein.
