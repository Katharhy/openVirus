<p>It has been observed that many drugs in each category are common with all three sites. Therefore, those drugs, which are common among top 10 with interactions on all three sites, were taken out for the conclusion. Out of top 10 from each target site, four drug-like-moieties having antiviral activities from the Asinex databases and three antiviral drugs from PubChem are found to have great affinity on the three selected hotspot sites based on their docking score. Thus, seven drugs are chosen from the Asinex and PubChem database (
