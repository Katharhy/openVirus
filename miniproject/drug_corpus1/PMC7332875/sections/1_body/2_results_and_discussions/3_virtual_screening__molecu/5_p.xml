<p>Thus, the ligands of Asinex databases with their docking scores on each sites (Site 1, Site 2, Site 3) are 5817 (−10.19, −6.75, −10.29); 6799 (−8.83, −6.11, −10.156); 6797 (−8.61, −6.92, −8.42) and 7025 (−8.28, −6.94, −8.92). While three drugs concluded from PubChem databases and their docking score on each sites are Zidovudine (−11.08, −9.09, −9.75), Valganciclovir (−8.102, −5.40, −8.30) and Ribavirin (−8.59, −6.38, −7.94). Further ranking of these molecules was done by rescoring MM-GBSA functions. It indicates change in free energies of binding of protein − receptor complex and corroborates binding affinities and docking accuracies.</p>
