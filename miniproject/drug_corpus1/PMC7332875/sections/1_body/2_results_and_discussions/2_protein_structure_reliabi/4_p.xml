 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the associations of Sites 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 with their respective amino acid residues grouped into chain A, B, C and D, docking score, size and site score. Out of the five-hotspot sites, the best three sites were selected based on their DScore. Site 3 having 1.045 DScore was selected as main target site for the study. The DScore of Sites 1 and 2 are 1.039 and 0.99, respectively. The site with DScore of more than one was taken as predictive for better study of interaction. The amino acids residues of Sites 1, 2 and 3 are associated with chain A &amp; B, A &amp;D and C &amp; D, respectively. The docking results also showed the better docking scores with Sites 1 and 3 as compared to Site 2 (
