<p>Quality and reliability of three-dimensional structure of target protein is the important parameter for drug designing. The PROCHECK server presents Ramachandran plot displaying allowed and the disallowed regions about backbone dihedrals of protein residues. More than 90% score of most favored regions ensures a model of good quality. The Ramachandran plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(A)</xref>) of 6VYO proteins structures reveals that 100% of residues fall within most allowed region, which indicates that the three-dimensional protein structures are reliable (
