<p>The chemical interaction of the top four ligands (Asinex ID: 5817; 6799, 6797 and 7025) from Lib A is shown in Supplementary Figures S1–S3(A–D) with Sites 1, 2 and 3. Asinex Id: 5817 interacts with all the three sites with variable number of HB interactions like 5, 4 and 4, respectively. Their interactive residues are five amino acids (Chain A: ALA55 (2); Chain B: ASN77, ASN154, ASN153) with Site 1; 4AA (Chain A: ASN77, ASN75 (2); Chain D: ALA55, ARG149) with Site 2 and four amino acids (Chain C: ALA55 (2); Chain D: ASN153, ASN154) with Site 3.</p>
