<p>The binding free energies (Δ
 <italic>G</italic> bind) are also in the acceptable range between −33.96 and −61.45 kcal/mol of all four ligands from Lib A. The range of selected three ligands from Lib B is between −16.37 and −49.88 and each ligand molecule interacted with all three sites through different amino acid residues by H-bond interactions as well as other chemical interactions.
