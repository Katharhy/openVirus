<p>Supplementary Figures S4–S6(A–C) depict the chemical interaction of top three ligands (PubChem IDs: 72187, 135413534, 37542) from the PubChem database with Sites 1, 2 and 3 of N proteins. However PubChem ID: 72187 interacts with all the three sites with variable number of HB interactions numbering 5HBs with Site 1, 7HBs with Site 2 and 6HBs with site 3. The interaction of this ligand with H bond interactive amino acids are ARG107(2) in Chain A and ASN77, ASN150(2) in Chain B at Site 1, ASN154, ASN150 in Chain A and ALA55, ARG92(2), ARG(2) in Chain D with Site 2 and ALA55, ARG107 in Chain C &amp; ASN75, ASN153, ASN150(2) in Chain D with Site 3.</p>
