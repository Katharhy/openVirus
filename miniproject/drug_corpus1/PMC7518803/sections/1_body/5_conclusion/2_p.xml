<p id="p0290">The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been defined as a pandemic that is seriously contagious and can spread through many transmission routes. Early reports show that cardiovascular injury in the wake of viral epidemics is not uncommon. In addition, patients with chronic cardiovascular disease are at an increased risk of acute cardiovascular events with poor prognosis. To effectively treat COVID-19 patients, health care professionals must be knowledgeable about the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases while paying attention to the underlying disease and organ protection. We summarized the symptoms and pathogenesis of myocardial injury, existing therapies and promising new directions of COVID-19. Although the SARS-CoV-2 information already identified in our article might only be the tip of the iceberg, we still hope this review will provide a relatively comprehensive summary and some directions for clinical treatment and new therapeutic targets of COVID-19.</p>
