<p id="p0140">SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus; it is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus with a diameter of 50–200 nm, and it is the seventh coronavirus that can infect humans to date [
 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The full genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 share 79.6% sequence identity to SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In a comparative analysis of genomic data between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses in nature, Andersen et al. observed two notable SARS-CoV-2 spike protein features, including the optimized receptor-binding dimain (RBD) and polybasic cleavage site, which suggested that SARS-CoV-2 is not a product of purposeful manipulation [
 <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Tang et al. found that SARS-CoV-2 strains had 149 mutation sites. They also proposed that SARS-CoV-2 has evolved into two subtypes, L type and S type, which account for 70% and 30% of the viral population, respectively [
