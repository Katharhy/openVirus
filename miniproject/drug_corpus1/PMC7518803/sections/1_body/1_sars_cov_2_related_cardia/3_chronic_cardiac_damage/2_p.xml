However, the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV leads to dyslipidemia and long-term cardiovascular damage are still unclear. It is worth paying attention to whether SARS-CoV-2 causes chronic damage to the cardiovascular system. Recently, Puntmann et al. demonstrated that patients who recovered from COVID-19 had ongoing cardiac involvement, indicating that the virus may have a long-term effect on the heart [
