<p id="p0210">Early studies showed that in SARS patients, elevated serum pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IFN-γ, interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP10), and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), were related to pulmonary inflammation and lung injury [

Moreover, the levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), IP10, MCP1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP1α), and TNF-α were significantly elevated in ICU patients, which suggests that cytokine storms are positively correlated with the severity of the disease [
