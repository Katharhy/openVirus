<p id="p0175">Some COVID-19 patients have chest pain and other cardiovascular symptoms as the main symptoms, and the serological markers of cardiac injury are significantly increased, suggesting the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 may be a cardiotropic virus. Previous research has documented that SARS-CoV can directly attack human cardiomyocytes by binding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [

 <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 has similar gene sequences and clinical manifestations and the same cell receptor on its envelope. ACE2 is expressed in the heart, including in endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes [

 <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The virus mainly exists in endothelial cells, which may affect heart microcirculation and lead to abnormal myocardial zymograms. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of the virus directly attacking cardiomyocytes, since the expression level of ACE2 in endothelial cells is higher than that in cardiomyocytes and the patients who underwent autopsy did not show symptoms of myocarditis during the illness.
