<p id="p0180">Xu et al. discovered that compared with that of SARS-CoV, which emerged in 2003, the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a similar structure and high affinity with ACE2, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may infect humans in a manner similar to SARS-CoV, in which the spike protein binds to ACE2 in the lungs, and the complex is then internalized into alveolar cells [
