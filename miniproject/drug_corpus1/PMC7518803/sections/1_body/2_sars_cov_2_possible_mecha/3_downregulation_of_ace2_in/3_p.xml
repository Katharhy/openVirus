<p id="p0195">Crackower et al. showed that ACE2 knockout has a severe impact on mouse cardiac contraction, increases Ang II levels and upregulates hypoxia-induced genes in the heart, indicating that ACE2 is vital for cardiac function [

In one possible pathway, a decrease in ACE2 could cause a decrease in cardioprotective Ang 1–7, probably resulting in an imbalance between the ACE/Ang II/AT 1R axis and the ACE2/Ang 1–7/Mas axis. This is followed by elevated levels of Ang II, which could accelerate the occurrence and development of cardiovascular diseases. On the other hand, studies have shown that ACE2 degrades Des-Arg9-bradykinin [
