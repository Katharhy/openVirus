<p id="p0200">Ang I, angiotensin; Ang II, angiotensin II; ACE, angiotensin converting enzyme; ACE2，angiotensin converting enzyme 2; AT 1R，angiotensin type I receptor. B1 receptor, Bradykinin 1 receptor, B2 receptor，Bradykinin 2 receptor. ①The predominant physiological function of ACE is in cardiovascular homeostasis through hydrolyzing Ang I to produce the potent vasoconstrictor, angiotensin II, which can promote vasoconstriction, fibrosis and apoptosis by binding to AT 1R.ACE also inactivates the vasodilator Ang 1–7, bradykinin, by the sequential cleavage of two C-terminal dipeptides. ② ACE2 can hydrolyze a number of physiologically relevant peptides including both angiotensin I and angiotensin II. Ang 1–7 exerts vasodilatory, anti-proliferative, and anti-oxidative stress effects by binding to the Mas receptor, indicating ACE2 is a negative regulator of renin-angiotensin system. ③ACE2 also can inactivate des-Arg9-bradykinin. The decrease of ACE2 induces the increase of des-Arg9-bradykinin, which has an inflammatory effect. ACE link renin-angiotensin system and kinin-kallilrein system by cleaving bradykinin. The decrease of ACE can produce the increase of bradykinin, which exerts positive effect of vasodilation, angioedema, but also negative effect of mediating the production of interleukin-6.</p>
