<p id="p0190">ACE2 was identified as an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) homologue in 2000, and its sequence is 42% homologous to that of ACE. It is a member of the zinc metalloprotease family and is a type I membrane protein encoded by a gene on the X chromosome. ACE2 has 805 amino acids, including an N-terminal signal peptide, a catalytic extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal intracellular domain [
 <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Both ACE2 and ACE belong to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) family, but they differ in their roles. ACE2 can hydrolyze angiotensin (Ang I) to produce Ang 1–9, which is then hydrolyzed by ACE or another peptidase to produce the vasodilator peptide Ang 1–7. ACE2 can also directly act on angiotensin II (Ang II) to produce Ang 1–7, which is far more efficient than hydrolyzing Ang I. Ang 1–7 exerts vasodilatory, antiproliferative, and antioxidative stress effects by binding to the Mas receptor [
