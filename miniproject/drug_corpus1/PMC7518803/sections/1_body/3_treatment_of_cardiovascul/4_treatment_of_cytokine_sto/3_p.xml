<p id="p0275">Studies have shown that compared with those of nonsevere patients, IL-6 levels are obviously increased in severe COVID-19 patients, suggesting that IL-6 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) may be used to treat cytokine storms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection [
 <xref rid="bb0345" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Zhou et al. found that granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-6 play a pivotal role in the inflammatory storm caused by SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Zhou introduced the use of a new effective regimen of tocilizumab (IL-6 mAb) + conventional therapy for 14 severe patients at the First Hospital, University of Science and Technology of China. To further evaluate the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in COVID-19 pneumonia, a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled study (ChiCTR2000029765) was registered on the official website of the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry [

Some researchers further proposed that in addition to tocilizumab, specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from convalescent patients may be added to the plasma to treat patients during the recovery stage. Zhang et al. successfully isolated monoclonal antibodies from the B lymphocytes of convalescent patients and found that two of those antibodies showed a strong ability to prevent SARS-CoV-2 from binding the ACE2 receptor [

Recently, Cao et al. identified SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies by high-throughput single B cell sequencing of antigen-enriched B cells from 60 convalescent patients, and they found that BD-368-2, the most potent one of these antibodies, showed high therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice [

It is unlikely to be developed and mass-produced in the near future. Therefore, specific antibodies and vaccines are the main methods for treating and preventing COVID-19.
