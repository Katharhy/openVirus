<p id="p0240">SARS-CoV-2 mainly invades alveolar epithelial cells via ACE2 and causes pulmonary inflammation. However, as the number of infections has increased, some patients have presented with virus-associated cardiovascular injury, which may result from direct myocardial injury via ACE2 or a range of pathophysiological changes owing to ACE2 downregulation. Thus, ACE2 can be regarded as a potential therapeutic target for SARS-CoV-2 infection. These possibilities include blocking the binding between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2, suppressing ACE, and using recombinant human ACE2 protein for pulmonary protection.</p>
