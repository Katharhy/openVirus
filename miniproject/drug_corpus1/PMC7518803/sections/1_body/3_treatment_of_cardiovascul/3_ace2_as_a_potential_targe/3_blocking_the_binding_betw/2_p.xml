<p id="p0245">Zhou et al. found that the ACE2 expressed in mammalian cells has more glycosylation sites in its extracellular domain. They believed that these glycosylation modifications may affect the binding between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2 [

 <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], providing clues to guide the development of targeted drugs and vaccines. SARS-CoV-2 must bind to the ACE2 expressed on the cell surface to infect cells, so modifying the ACE2 binding site or changing its configuration may be potential approaches. Chloroquine inhibits viral infection by increasing the pH of the viral inclusion bodies required for virus-cell fusion and interfering with glycosylation at the ACE2 terminal [

 <xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. It was suggested that type II transmembrane serine proteases (TMSPSS2) can activate SARS-CoV-2â€¯S proteins to bind with ACE2 and enter host cells, so TMSPSS2 inhibitors prevented the SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins from binding to ACE2 [
