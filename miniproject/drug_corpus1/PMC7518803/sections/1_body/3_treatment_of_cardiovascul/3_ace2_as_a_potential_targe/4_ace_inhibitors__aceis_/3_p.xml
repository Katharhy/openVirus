<p id="p0260">However, Ferrario et al. showed that while the administration of ACEIs and ARBs to rats reduced blood pressure, it caused ACE2 levels to increase 4.7 times and 2.8 times, respectively [

In addition, Liu et al. suggested that ACE inhibitors increase the level of bradykinin, which binds to bradykinin B2 receptor (B2R) to dilate vessels and reduce blood pressure but may also increase vascular permeability and aggravate pulmonary edema. Bradykinin also mediates IL-6 production via the B2R/Erk 1/2 pathway and thus aggravates inflammation. Therefore, Liu et al. recommended that COVID-19 patients with hypertension discontinue the antihypertensive ACEIs and ARBs (if applicable) and switch to calcium channel blockers (CCBs). However, the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) emphasized that there is no evidence that ACEIs and ARBs can increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or cause deterioration of COVID-19 patients [
 <xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], so ACEIs and ARBs should not be discontinued easily for COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. For stable patients, the use of ACEIs and ARBs should be executed according to the recommendations in the 2018 ESC/ESH guidelines 1 [
