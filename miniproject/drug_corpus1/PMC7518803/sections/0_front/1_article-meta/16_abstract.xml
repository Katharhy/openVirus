 <p>The infection epidemic event of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was formally declared a pandemic by World Health Organization on March 11th, 2020. Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a new type of coronavirus, which has high contagion and mainly causes respiratory symptoms. With the increase in confirmed cases, however, the infection symptoms turn to be diverse with secondary or first clinical symptoms relating to damage of the cardiovascular system and changes of myocardial enzyme spectrum, cardiac troponin I, electrocardiogram, cardiac function. The occurrence of extra-pulmonary manifestations, including immediately and long-term damage, means that the overall health burden caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection may be under-estimated because COVID-19 patients developed cardiovascular system injury are more likely to become serious. The factors such as directly pathogen-mediated damage to cardiomyocytes, down-regulated angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression, excessive inflammatory response, hypoxia and adverse drug reaction, are closely related to the occurrence and development of the course of COVID-19. In combination with recently published medical data of patients having SARS-CoV-2 infection and the latest studies, the manifestations of damage to cardiovascular system by COVID-19, possible pathogenic mechanisms and advances of the treatment are proposed in this article.</p>
