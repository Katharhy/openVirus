<p>A 10-year data, from 2010 to 2018, on morbidity on Pneumonia among older persons age 65 and above was extracted from the Department of Health—Philippines Field Health Service Information System (FHSIS) annual reports, publicly accessible on the website of the department. These are officially diagnosed and reported cases To get the total number of older persons in the country with pneumonia which was 239,125 cases for ten years, data segregated according to sex (male and female) and age group (65–69 years old and 70 years old and above) were merged. The data were used to represent the cumulative adopters by fitting them to the Bass diffusion model using the Bass Forecasting Spreadsheet. The number of new adopters was graphed to forecast the diffusion of Pneumonia in the coming years. Another graph on the cumulative diffusion was also generated. The analysis of the data was then based on these graphs, generating insights and conjectures.</p>
