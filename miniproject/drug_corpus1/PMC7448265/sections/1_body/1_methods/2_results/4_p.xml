 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2333721420949308">Figure 3</xref> presents the difference between the Bass Model and the actual infected cases. There is a standard error of prediction of 0.04888763 which suggests a close resemblance between the two. The Bass Model can then predict the probable cases in the future close to the actual data. Similarly, a model using birth, susceptibility, infection, and death; a modification of the susceptible infected removal (SIR) model, can be used to produce numbers that are closer to real data. It is for this reason that studying infectious disease usually uses such a mathematical model.
