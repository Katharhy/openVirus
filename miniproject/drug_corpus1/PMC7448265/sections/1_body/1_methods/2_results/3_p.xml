 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2333721420949308">Figure 2</xref> shows that morbidity of pneumonia is expected to peak in the year 2200, 190â€‰years after the first data or almost two centuries after. This is reflective of the kind of pathogen causing the disease. Even though efforts to control its existence will be made through vaccination, it will continue to exist due to the characteristic of the microorganism harboring the disease. The projected increase in older population will play a role in this scenario. With the number constantly increasing, their interaction with each other is most likely to happen, causing the easier spread of the microorganisms.
