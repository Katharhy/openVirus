<p>The use of Bass diffusion model provided an insight on the cumulative nature of pneumonia infection due to the interaction between infected and the potentially infected. This would point out to the idea that the whole population specified would eventually be infected and reaching saturation. This nature of the model does not reflect the dynamics of many infectious disease phenomena just like pneumonia which may be repeatedly acquired and lost. Through a balance of infection and recovery, a steady-state with multiple states of individuals coexisting can be reached.</p>
