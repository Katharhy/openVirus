<p>The cumulative nature of the Bass Diffusion model tends to disregard the addition of new members of the population and the reduction due to deaths, seemingly moving towards full saturation. On the other hand, the compartmental nature of the modified SIR model can be used to explain the change in the number of people needing medical attention during an epidemic (

Economic models for the diffusion of innovations, as reflected in the early works of Bass, do consider “automatic” infection. People move from “susceptible” (non-adopter) to an infected (adopter) state by the additive effects of external and internal forces. In any case, these models do not take into account recovery; in light of the fact that the innovation adoptions are thought to be permanent changes, individuals never move back to a susceptible state. This results in the whole populace turning out to be adopters at equilibrium. This does not reflect the dynamics of many infectious disease phenomena just like pneumonia which may be repeatedly acquired and lost. Through a balance of infection and recovery, a steady-state with multiple states of individuals coexisting can be reached (
