<p>Pneumonia is a serious infection that occurs when a pathogen’s virulence overcomes a person’s host defenses. Aging is associated with general deterioration of organ function in a way that dictates not only an individual’s risk of developing pneumonia, but also clinical manifestations and outcomes. In addition to increased complexity of clinical presentation and more rapid progression of disease, older patients are at higher risk to have pneumonia owing to resistant organisms, and therefore empiric as well as definitive treatment can be challenging. Furthermore, the incidence of pneumonia increases with age, as does the impact of pneumonia on morbidity and mortality. Mortality rates for pneumonia in older adults are high and have not decreased in the last decade (
