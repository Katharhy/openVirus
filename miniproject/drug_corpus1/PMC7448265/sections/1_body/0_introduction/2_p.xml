<p>In addition, with advancing age and inevitable development of comorbidities, viruses may also cause serious illness and pneumonia (

Studies of community-acquired pneumonia in adults indicate a viral etiology, with influenza virus being the most common virus. Although distinguishing viral from bacterial pneumonia is difficult on clinical grounds (
