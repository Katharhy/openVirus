<p>It is then necessary to provide an understanding of the spread of pneumonia through analysis of the interaction between infected and the potentially infected. Network models of epidemic spreading have rationalized the understanding of how diseases propagate through a mobile interactome like the human population (

The Bass diffusion model, the most common mathematical representation of diffusive adoption will be used in this study. It describes the number of new adopters or new cases per unit time by the additive effects of external and internal forces (

It is also the aim of this study to provide basis for the decisions related to the program implementation thereby improving disease prevention efforts in older persons (
