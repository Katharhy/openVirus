<p id="p0025">A very limited number of infections have been reported in infants and neonates. At the present time there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy [
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>]. Moreover, although the virus may be transmitted during birth or very shortly thereafter, this is unusual [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. There is also currently no evidence that the virus is teratogenic, although, because of the small number of reported cases of infection during the first trimester (when embryogenesis occurs), a risk of congenital anomalies associated with COVID-19 cannot be completely excluded [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Data and prior experience with other respiratory viruses (e.g. influenza, SARS-CoV-1, MERS) suggest that antenatal transplacental transmission via maternal viremia is unlikely [
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Analyses of amniotic fluid, serum, placenta, vaginal fluid and breastmilk from pregnant women confirmed to have COVID-19 infections have found no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections [
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>]. On the other hand, newborn infants may remain at high risk postnatally for infection through maternal respiratory secretions.
