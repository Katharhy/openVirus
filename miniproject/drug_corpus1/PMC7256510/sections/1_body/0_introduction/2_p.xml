<p id="p0025">Although the emergence of new coronavirus diseases, probably originating from bats in China, had been predicted by early March 2019 
 <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, no international preventive action was taken. Finally, after several cases of pneumonia with an unfamiliar etiology were observed at the end of 2019, the National Health Commission of China released more details about the epidemic in early 2020 
 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The causative virus was initially called “novel coronavirus 2019” (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO), but it was then renamed as “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2) by the international committee of the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG), and the disease called “coronavirus disease 2019” (COVID-19) by WHO 
 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. It is thought that the Hunan seafood market in Wuhan city in China was the origin of the outbreak. Although it had been proposed that the COVID-19 patients in China might have utilized infected animals as a foodstuff, or might have visited the seafood market, further investigation revealed that some patients had not visited the seafood market. Therefore, the human-to-human transmission of this virus through coughing, sneezing, and the spread of respiratory droplets or aerosols was accepted. In addition, almost all countries in continents throughout the world reported disease spread caused by aerosol penetration into the upper the respiratory tract and lungs via inhalation

 <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. There followed a rapid growth in the number of cases all around the world. A mathematical model examined whether the control of SARS-CoV-2 infection could be achieved by isolating affected patients, and tracking their contacts with other individuals. This model concluded that isolating people and reviewing their contacts would be insufficient to control the COVID-19 pandemic within three months, because there would be too much delay between the onset of symptoms and isolation
