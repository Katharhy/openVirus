<p id="p0130">One study investigated the relationship between the mean daily average temperature and the average rate of increase of new patients with COVID-19. Five countries (Iran, Italy, Germany, Spain, and United States) were studied. To minimize the impact of confounding factors like the imposition of government measures or cultural differences between these countries, different areas in each country were compared separately. The results of this study found that in all studied areas, a significant difference in the average daily air temperature between the two regions was associated with a substantial difference in the daily average cumulative rate of new patients in those two regions
