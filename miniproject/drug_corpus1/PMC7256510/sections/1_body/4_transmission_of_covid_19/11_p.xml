<p id="p0120">Although it is unknown whether the SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted from infected animals (civet cat, snake, or other species) to humans at the Huanan seafood market or not, there is a clear possibility for animal-to-human transmission 
 <xref rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Ferrets, cats, dogs, and other domesticated animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 
 <xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. It has been demonstrated that cats can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and transmit it to other cats. Nevertheless, it is not yet clear if cats can transmit the virus to their owners; so at present this not a problem for cat owners. Moreover, ducks, pigs, chickens, and dogs are not likely to be infected. However, it should be mentioned that a German shepherd pet dog died (the cause of death could not be determined as the owner declined to conduct an autopsy) two days after the owner was in COVID-19 quarantine 
 <xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. So, possible animal-to-human transmission of the virus must be taken into account.
