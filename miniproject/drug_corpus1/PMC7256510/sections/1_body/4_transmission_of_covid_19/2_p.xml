<p id="p0075">SARS-CoV-2 can spread through both direct means (droplet and human-to-human transmission) and by indirect contact (contaminated objects and airborne contagion). Meanwhile personal protective equipment (PPE) could also be the source of airborne infections 
 <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. As mentioned before, person-to-person spread of SARS-CoV-2 is supposed to occur mainly via respiratory droplets, when a patient coughs, sneezes, or even talks or sings. Droplets typically cannot traverse more than six feet (almost two meters) and remain in the air for a limited time. However, SARS-CoV-2 remains intact and contagious in droplets (less than five microns in diameter) and can be suspended in the air for up to three hours 
 <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Therefore, airborne isolation, room ventilation, and appropriate application of disinfectant (especially in toilets) might restrict aerosol spread of the virus
