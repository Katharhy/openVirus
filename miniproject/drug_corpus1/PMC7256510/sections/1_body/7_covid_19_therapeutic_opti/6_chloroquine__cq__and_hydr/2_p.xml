<p id="p0265">CQ is an anti-malarial drug 
 <xref rid="b0500" ref-type="bibr">[100]</xref> with practical activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection 
 <xref rid="b0505" ref-type="bibr">[101]</xref>, which could help in the treatment of COVID-19. It has immunomodulatory effects, such as suppression of the production and release of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and Interleukin (IL-6). It also works as a novel type of autophagy inhibitor 
 <xref rid="b0510" ref-type="bibr">[102]</xref>, which probably interferes with viral infection and replication. Moreover, scientists have reported in a number of studies that CQ interferes with the glycosylation of the cellular ACE2 receptor, the spike protein of SARS-CoV, and the entry of the virus 
 <xref rid="b0505" ref-type="bibr">[101]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0515" ref-type="bibr">[103]</xref>. Besides, CQ increases the pH of acidic intracellular organelles such as endosomes and lysosomes, which are essential for membrane fusion 
 <xref rid="b0520" ref-type="bibr">[104]</xref>. So, this drug can reduce fever and improve the radiological characteristics of the lungs in COVID-19. Also, it reduced the time to recovery. Besides, CQ is one of three drugs that could be promising for the treatment of new coronavirus disease; the other two drugs, described above, are Favipiravir and Remdesivir 
 <xref rid="b0525" ref-type="bibr">[105]</xref>, where the percentage of patients with a negative viral nucleic acid test was higher with anti-malarial drugs. Until now, no severe side effects have been reported in more than 100 participants treated with CQ in trials. It has been shown that oral absorption of CQ and HCQ in humans is useful in SARS-CoV-2 treatment. Because HCQ was less toxic than CQ in animal models 
 <xref rid="b0530" ref-type="bibr">[106]</xref>, and considering that an overdose of CQ could result in acute poisoning and death 
 <xref rid="b0535" ref-type="bibr">[107]</xref>; the safe dosage (6–6.5 mg/kg per day) 
 <xref rid="b0540" ref-type="bibr">[108]</xref> of HCQ sulfate could effectively treat SARS-CoV-2 infections. It must be mentioned that although the combination of HCQ plus Azithromycin c was an effective treatment of COVID-19 
 <xref rid="b0545" ref-type="bibr">[109]</xref>, the NIH has not recommended it as a routine treatment for clinical use due to the potential for toxicity.
