<p id="p0430">IVIg is an effective immunomodulatory agent, which has been applied in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, bacterial infections, severe viral infections, fungal infections, and also in graft versus host disease (GVHD). It is composed of polyclonal immunoglobulin G or IgG. IVIg can modulate the immune system through various mechanisms, like reducing and preventing the production of cytokines, enhancing anti-inflammatory cytokines, and inducing immune system responses against the virus

 <xref rid="b0295" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. High-dose IVIg therapy, 0.3–0.5 g per kg body weight over five days, has been proposed for COVID-19 patients. Scientists have shown that the application of high-dose IVIg at the appropriate time point could prevent disease progression to a severe state and enhance the patient recovery rate in early phases of the disease. Moreover, after administration of IVIg no adverse effects were reported
