<p id="p0435">In one small retrospective cohort study in Italy, the effect of Anakinra, a recombinant Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, was studied in the treatment of COVID-19. In this study, 29 patients received the drug, while 16 patients received only standard treatment for COVID-19. Twenty-one patients (72%) of the intervention group had a CRP level below the standard after 21 days, and most of them recovered; while five patients were mechanically ventilated, and three died. Only eight (50%) of the 16 control patients had improved respiratory status after 21 days, of which one person was mechanically ventilated, and seven died. Survival rates at 21 days in the intervention and control groups were 90% and 56%, respectively with a significant difference. Anakinra could increase the survival of patients with COVID-19 and improve respiratory status, and may be an effective treatment
