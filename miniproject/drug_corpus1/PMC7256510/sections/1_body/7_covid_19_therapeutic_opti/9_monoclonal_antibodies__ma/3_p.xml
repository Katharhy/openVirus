<p id="p0415">Some mAbs that target the spike protein in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have shown promising results

 <xref rid="b0755" ref-type="bibr">[151]</xref>. For example, specific neutralizing mAbs against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in spike protein (CR3014

 <xref rid="b0765" ref-type="bibr">[153]</xref>, 311mab–31B5, 311mab–32D4, and 311mab–31B9), or specific mAbs that bind to ACE2 could all effectively block virus entry 
 <xref rid="b0695" ref-type="bibr">[139]</xref>. It must be mentioned that contrary to 311mab–31B9 (without any neutralization capability) 
 <xref rid="b0770" ref-type="bibr">[154]</xref>, 311mab-31B5 and 311mab-32D4 can both potently suppress the SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein and interaction with the human ACE2 (hACE2) protein, leading to virus neutralization. Moreover, using CR3022 as a monotherapy, or else in combination with other drugs might result in COVID-19 patient improvement. Besides, 47D11 could powerfully suppress the infection of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 through an unknown mechanism
