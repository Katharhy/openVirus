<p id="p0375">While passive antibody therapy involves the pooling of immunoglobulin preparations with high antibody titers, plasma therapy is applied as an emergency treatment, especially in epidemics and pandemics, when there is limited time or resources for pooled immunoglobulin preparation. Compared to passive antibody therapy which generates short-term rapid immunity, persistant immunity is produced by monoclonal antibodies or hyper-immune globulin (fractionated plasma products)

Moreover, plasma therapy can decrease viremia and reduce new infections (through neutralizing antibodies), clear free virus and infected cells, and alleviate the symptoms (like dry cough, fever, sputum, muscle pain) and pulmonary damage. Moreover, it can increase the lymphocyte ratio and blood oxygen saturation without any adverse effects
