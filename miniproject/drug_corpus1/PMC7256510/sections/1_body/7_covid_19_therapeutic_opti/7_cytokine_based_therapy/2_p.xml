<p id="p0270">The cytokine storm or cytokine release syndrome (CRS) results from the widespread release of pro-inflammatory cytokines following the activation of the immune system by microorganisms or even by therapeutic interventions 
 <xref rid="b0550" ref-type="bibr">[110]</xref>. In SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1β, IL-12, IL-18, IL-33, Interferon-α (IFN-α), IFN-γ, and TNF-α, or chemokines such as chemokine C-C motif ligand2 (CCL-2), CCL-3, CCL-5, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL-8), CXCL-9, and CXCL-10 were included in the cytokine storm

 <xref rid="b0560" ref-type="bibr">[112]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0565" ref-type="bibr">[113]</xref>. It has been shown that by activating type 1 macrophages (M1) and T-helper 1 (Th1) cells, COVID-19 increases the production of inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, IFN-γ, and granulocyte monocyte-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) 
 <xref rid="b0570" ref-type="bibr">[114]</xref>. It must be mentioned that IL-6 and GM-CSF (can significantly enhance the production of IL-6 by stimulating monocytes 
 <xref rid="b0575" ref-type="bibr">[115]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0580" ref-type="bibr">[116]</xref>) which are secreted by monocytes and T cells, are more important in inducing the cytokine storm than other pro-inflammatory cytokines.
