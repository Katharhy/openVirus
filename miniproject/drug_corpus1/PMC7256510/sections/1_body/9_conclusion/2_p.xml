<p id="p0520">In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 is a novel and highly contagious virus, and there is no specific treatment for COVID-19 disease up to now. It must be taken into account that if no effective action is taken and if drugs, vaccines, and patient tracking measures are not widely implemented or effective, intermittent social distancing is likely to continue until 2022. By that time COVID-19 might have affected 90% of the world population and kill over 40 million people

 <xref rid="b0930" ref-type="bibr">[186]</xref>. Therefore, it is wise to continue preventive methods and public health measures until an appropriate vaccine and effective drugs are discovered. Combinational therapies with some of the above-mentioned drugs or supplements, plus an appropriate immunomodulatory diet, proper mental support and adherence to standards, will eventually be effective against COVID-19.
