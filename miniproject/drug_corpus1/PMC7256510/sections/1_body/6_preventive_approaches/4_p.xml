<p id="p0155">It should be mentioned that due to the long incubation period and presence of asymptomatic patients, using a medical mask (especially N95) or a respirator (especially FFP3) could be recommended. Also, sterilizing the used respirator, only reusing it for a limited time, and proper disposal of the used masks, have been recommended. Although respirators (the protective classes, including FFP1, FFP2, and FFP3 
 <xref rid="b0265" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>) are produced as single-use items, they could be used again for a limited time unless there is a risk for contamination through the deposition of infectious particles on the surface 
 <xref rid="b0270" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. When the respirator becomes soiled or wet with bodily fluids or it can no longer be appropriately fitted, or if breathing via the respirator becomes difficult, it should be discarded. Also, masks should be discarded after being used during an aerosol-generating procedure (AGP). Until now, manufacturers have had no reason to disinfect masks or to produce masks for repeated use. However, there is a vital need to be able to disinfect masks and reuse them. SARS-CoV-2 remains viable in the environment, including on the surface of different materials like cardboard, iron, or tissue for some time. This suggests that there is a risk for rapid contamination of the outer surface of respirators and surgical masks. Contamination of the respirator surface could be prevented through placing a medical mask over it, or wearing a face shield that can be cleaned. Because of the severe contamination of respirators and surgical masks in the COVID-19 pandemic, several methods could be considered for the sterilization of used masks, including steam, hydrogen peroxide, or radiation.
