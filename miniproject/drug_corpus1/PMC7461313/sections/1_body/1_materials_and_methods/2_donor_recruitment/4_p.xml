<p>When donors presented for consent, they were asked to fill out a form that included a free‐text report of COVID‐19 symptoms and demographic information. Free text results were grouped into numerical variables of age, symptom duration, days from symptom resolution to sample collection, and maximum temperature (if febrile and measured). The categorical variables of initial NP swab result and sex were analyzed, along with variables related to COVID‐19 disease symptoms: fever, loss of taste/smell, diarrhea, chills, aches, fatigue, night sweats, headaches, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, chest tightness, other respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, skin symptoms (rash or hives), hospitalization, receiving treatment, history of autoimmune disease, history of past drug reactions, and history of bleeding or clotting disorder. Symptoms not reported in the free text fields were assumed to be negative/normal.</p>
