<p>A subset of the total enrolled population had samples drawn for serology testing and sufficient volume available for serology testing using three in‐house assays. These samples were collected from 214 donors. Anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein antibody testing was performed using the LIAISON SARS‐CoV‐2 S1/S2 IgG (DiaSorin Inc, Saluggia, Italy) as well as the Access SARS‐COVID‐2 IgG assay (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 nucleocapsid protein antibody testing was performed using the Elecsys Anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 (Roche Diagnostics, Basal, Switzerland). Importantly, the Roche assay tests for total (not isotype specific) anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 nucleocapsid reactivity. The quantitative cut‐off index for each assay was used to assess antibody strength.</p>
