<p>To test for correlations between clinical history and persistence of NP swab PCR positivity, a per‐swab analysis was performed by grouping swab results based on the number of days post symptom resolution when it was collected. Donors were not swabbed more often than once per week. All swabs taken greater or equal to 50 days from symptom resolution were grouped; one donor had two swabs within this group and the latter was used for analysis. Otherwise, all donors had only one swab per time period considered.</p>
