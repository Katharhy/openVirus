<p>Unpaired student t‐test with unequal variance was performed using Microsoft Excel (Microscoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) to evaluate the statistical differences in numerical variables. Univariate analysis for associations between categorical variables were assessed using Fisher's exact test on a 2‐by‐2 contingency table in R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) using stats package v4, with a null hypothesis that the odds ratio is equal to 1 and alternative hypothesis that the odds ratio is not equal to 1. The Bonferroni correction was used to assess the statistical significance of p‐values, therefore (given 20 tests performed, see Table 
 <xref rid="trf16015-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>) a p‐value of less than or equal to 0.0025 was considered significant for the univariate analyses.
