<p>The relationship between serology results and NP swab positivity/clinical history was assessed using multivariate linear regression in R. In addition to the COVID‐19 symptoms listed in Table 
 <xref rid="trf16015-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>, the model considered whether the individual was febrile (temperature &gt; 100.4 F), sex, days post symptom resolution to serology test collection, initial NP swab result, age, and symptom duration. To avoid oversampling donors who were tested by NP swab more than once, only the first NP swab result for each donor was considered.
