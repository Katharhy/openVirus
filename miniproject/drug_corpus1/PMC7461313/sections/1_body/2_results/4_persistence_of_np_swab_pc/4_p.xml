<p>Donor characteristics and COVID‐19 symptom history (see Table 
 <xref rid="trf16015-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>) were compared between positive NP swabs and negative NP swabs within one‐week time periods from symptom resolution to swab collection. There was no correlation between donor age and persistence of PCR positivity (Figure 
 <xref rid="trf16015-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). There was a slight correlation between loss of taste/smell and the persistence of NP swab positivity. On the other hand, there was a possible inverse relationship between the symptom of diarrhea and persistence of NP swab positivity (Figure 
 <xref rid="trf16015-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). However, these correlations did not reach statistical significance after correcting for multiple observations.
