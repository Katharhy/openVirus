<p>Initial NP Swab PCR was positive in 32 (11.8%) potential donors. The median time from symptom resolution to the initial positive swab was 31.8 ± 14.8 days. Donors who tested positive were offered serial follow‐up with repeat NP swab in 7‐14 days. By June 29, 2020 a total of 300 NP swabs were performed on these 272 donors. Six donors were positive initially and positive when they returned for a second swab; of those, four were negative when tested a third time. One donor remained positive by NP swab 75 days after the resolution of symptoms, after three consecutive positive swabs. Ten donors who tested positive initially did not return for a subsequent swab, while one donor positive on their second swab did not return for a third.</p>
