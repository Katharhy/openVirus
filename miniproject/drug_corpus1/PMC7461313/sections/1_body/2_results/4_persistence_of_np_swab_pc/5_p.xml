<p>Multivariate analysis of the serology test results revealed no significant correlation between antibody cut‐off index and whether a donor had a positive NP swab. The anti‐nucleocapsid total antibody cut‐off index was significantly higher for samples collected a greater number of days from symptom resolution (
 <italic>P</italic> = .00007) and samples from donors who had a longer symptom duration (
 <italic>P</italic> = .001). The Beckman anti‐spike cutoff index was significantly higher for donors who had been hospitalized (0.00002), received treatment for COVID‐19 (
 <italic>P</italic> = .01), and were older (
 <italic>P</italic> = .02). Similarly, the DiaSorin anti‐spike cutoff index was higher for donors who had been hospitalized (
 <italic>P</italic> = .007), See Figure 
 <xref rid="trf16015-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. For patients who were hospitalized for COVID‐19, median anti‐spike cutoff index was 32.0 ± 15.4 (Beckman) and 151.9 ± 73.7 (DiaSorin) verses 8.3 ± 9.8 and 64.3 ± 55.7 for non‐hospitalized patients, respectively. The other factors tested did not show a statistically significant effect on serology results.
