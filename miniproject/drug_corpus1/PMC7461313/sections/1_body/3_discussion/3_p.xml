<p>With the current lack of data as to whether persistent NP swab PCR positivity correlates with persistent infectivity, there are two major safety concerns relative to convalescent plasma in particular. First, even if CP donors with persistent positivity are minimally infectious, the inability to maintain social distancing and the common desire to remove a face mask during donation makes the possibility of donor room transmission high. Second, SARS‐CoV‐2 is known to infect endothelial cells and a recent report of intra‐utero transmission has emerged.

 </xref> Therefore, the possibility of transfusion transmitted SARS‐CoV‐2 cannot be completely disregarded and donors with persistently positive NP swabs may have a higher chance of transmitting virus in their plasma. Realistically, transfusion transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 may be of greater concerned if the plasma is used as a prophylaxis and provided to individuals who are not actually infected and therefore more vulnerable to transfusion transmitted disease. Perhaps pathogen inactivation should be considered when CP is used prophylactically.
