<p>One potential weakness of study is the small number of donors tested. Larger and focused studies are needed to determine if loss of taste/smell is truly correlated with the persistence of NP swab positivity, although the data presented here argues against a robust correlation. Theoretically, both could be the result of higher viral load within the nasal mucosa. The trend for donors with diarrhea to have negative NP swab results similarly may reach statistical significance with additional data. If verified, these trends might suggest different manifestations of COVID‚Äê19 infection: gastrointestinal verses nasopharyngeal. Another potential weakness of this study is that the sensitivity of the rapid PCR assay used may have underestimated the prevalence of positive individuals.

 </xref> Finally, the cutoff indices used to assess antibody strength may not be linearly related to antibody reactivity; however, it is assumed that cutoff index is positively correlated with reactivity.
