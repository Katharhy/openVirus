<p>Persistent infection with COVID‐19 might be defined as active viral replication beyond the currently accepted post‐exposure quarantine period of 14 days. It is unclear whether persistent PCR positivity by NP swab is due to persistent infection with transmissible virus or non‐transmissible nucleic acid fragments. These two models may not be mutually exclusive across the population and future studies are needed to determine whether individuals persistently positive by NP swab PCR represent an infectious risk. One possible study could attempt to culture live virus from individuals with persistently positive NP swabs, however care must be taken interpreting negative culture results, since viral culture is known to have limited sensitivity.
