 </xref> Initially, the FDA stated that donors between 14 and 28 days of symptom resolution should test negative for SARS‐CoV‐2 PCR by testing either a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab or the blood product of the itself. Due to a lack of validated blood product PCR assays, most institutions either utilized NP swab or waited until after 28 days from symptom resolution before collecting plasma. Interestingly, many potential donors who were tested by NP swab remained positive &gt;14 days from resolution of symptoms. Subsequently, the FDA changed their guidance to state that a confirmatory negative test was not necessary, even for donors who presented as early as 14 days after symptom resolution.
