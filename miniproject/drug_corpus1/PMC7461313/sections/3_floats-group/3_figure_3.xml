  <p>Correlation between serology results and donor factors. Cutoff indices are shown for Beckman SARS‐CoV‐2 IgG Antibody Assay (white), Roche SARS‐CoV‐2 Total Antibody Assay (light gray), and Diasorin SARS‐CoV‐2 IgG Antibody Assay (dark gray) relative to select patient characteristics. With the IgG assays, patients hospitalized or who received treatment had a statistically significant increase in cutoff index values, which was not seen with the total antibody assay (A and B). Increasing age was positively correlated with increasing cutoff indices for the Beckman IgG assay (C). Increasing symptom duration was found to be positively associated with increasing cutoff indices measured in the total antibody assay, but not for the IgG specific assays. Antibody reactivity for individuals with symptom duration less than verses greater than 28 days is shown in D</p>
