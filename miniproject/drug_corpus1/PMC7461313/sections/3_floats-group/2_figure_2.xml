  <p>Diarrhea and Loss of Taste/Smell. Neither the presence nor absence of diarrhea or loss of taste/smell showed a statistically significant association with the positive NP swab rate during each time period (≤21, 22‐28, 29‐35, 26‐42, 43‐49, and ≥50 days post symptom resolution). For loss of taste/smell, 
   <italic>P</italic> values were .28 and .14 during the 22‐28 and 29‐35 day time periods, respectively (Fisher exact test)
