<p>The ability to vaccinate against specific pathogens has played a major role in preventative medicine for the last century. Vaccines exist both for respiratory viruses such as 
 <italic>Influenzavirus</italic> and for bacteria such as 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic>. While the success of respiratory viral vaccines varies from season to season, data suggest influenza vaccination generally results in lower probability of complications, including ICU stay, mechanical ventilation, and severe outcomes, especially in patients with comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
