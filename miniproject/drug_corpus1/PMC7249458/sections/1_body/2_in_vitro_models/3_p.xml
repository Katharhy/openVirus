<p>In the last decade, tissue engineering has made significant advances regarding 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> human cell culture models. Developments of induced pluripotent stem cells, CRISPR-Cas, microfluidics, 3D printing, and biomaterials have led to technologies such as tissue-on-a-chip and advanced bioreactor models containing co-cultures of cells from ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal lineages. These models, utilizing human cells, have been able to mimic complex pathophysiology such as generation of pulmonary edema upon exposure to inflammatory signals such as interleukin-2.

 </sup> For example, in a model to study influenza A virus, 3D tissue-engineered constructs more accurately recapitulated the host morphology of cultured human epithelial airway cells compared to 2D culture, and infection with major influenza strains resulted in upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines.

 </sup> One coronavirus-specific example of a tissue-engineered platform in which respiratory viruses have been studied is the rotation wall vessel bioreactor. These models simulate low physiologic shear stresses and frequently incorporate multiple pulmonary cell types, including co-culture of human mesenchymal bronchial tracheal cells and human bronchial epithelial cells, challenging them against respiratory syncytial virus and SARS-CoV-1.

 </sup> Unfortunately, SARS-CoV-1 did not replicate in this study.

 </sup> In another model, human pulmonary epithelial progenitor cells were grown on a collagen matrix in a serum-free media with a mesenchymal stroma and exposed to virus. It was demonstrated that stem cells were targeted by SARS-CoV-1, which may suggest why normal lung regeneration following viral infection is challenging.
