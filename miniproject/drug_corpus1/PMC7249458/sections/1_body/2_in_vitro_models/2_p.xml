<p>The current gold standard for screening antiviral therapeutics is based on static monolayer culture of Vero cells, an interferon-deficient aneuploid line of kidney epithelial cells originally isolated from an African green monkey.

 </sup> In a recent study, Vero cells were exposed to a library of 3000 drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration and the Investigational New Drug program and then infected with SARS-CoV-2 to screen for potential therapeutics.

 </sup> Because Vero cells lack interferon, they are highly susceptible to viruses and allow for replication, and so they have been an attractive vehicle to screen compounds. However, interferon itself is an important regulator of host binding proteins involved in SARS-CoV-2.

 </sup> In general, the relevance of a drug's ability to inhibit viral infection of a malignant nonhuman primate (NHP) kidney cell lacking interferon production is uncertain. For example, while the antidepressant sertraline was found to have potent

  <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
 </sup> later testing in an

 </sup> Static cultures of xenograft monolayers fail to replicate many of the conditions facing viruses 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, including realistic extracellular matrix (ECM), three-dimensional cellâ€“cell interfaces, and shear forces. Coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses, for example, can bind to the ECM components such as sialic acid to assist in infection of the host.
