<p>Development of physiologically representative 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> models of viral disease can assist in two critical roles during a pandemic: (1) better characterization and understanding of the hostâ€“pathogen interface and mechanisms of infection; and (2) as a platform for high-throughput screening of potential therapeutics. Currently, it is challenging and clinically necessary to predict the course of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Profiling biomarkers may allow for better risk stratification and resource allotment.

 </sup> More accurate 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> modeling to understand host response as well as viral mechanisms for transmission and replication is critical for the identification of biomarkers to pursue as hypothesis-driven diagnostic and therapeutic targets. In addition, a physiologically relevant 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> model has the potential to fill the critical need for improved drug candidate screening.
