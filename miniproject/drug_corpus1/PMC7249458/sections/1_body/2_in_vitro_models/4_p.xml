<p>There are a number of exciting tissue-engineered human

 </sup> Elements that may improve the relevance of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> models include: (1) human rather than animal cell lines; (2) co-culture of multiple pulmonary cell lines; (3) 3D scaffolds that mimic native pulmonary architecture; and (4) culture methods that permit generation of ECM prior to viral inoculation. Additional head-to-head studies will need to be performed to determine if these components are necessary to capture the pathophysiology of viral infection. These platforms will be important in conducting hypothesis-driven research to understand the host–pathogen interface. Scaling these models to allow for high-throughput drug screening will offer important advantages over the current Vero-based methods to identify therapeutic candidates for 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> translation rapidly during major infectious outbreaks.
