<p>Lastly, short interfering RNA (siRNA) has also been explored as both prophylaxis and therapy for coronavirus infection.

 </sup> For sequences specific to SARS-CoV-1, siRNA was effective in a NHP model,

 </sup> resulting in diminished viral load and alveolar damage. Four intranasal doses were required over 5 days in treatment arms. The researchers reported not using additional vehicles to deliver their siRNA such as polyethylenimine due to the possibility of carrier-induced lung inflammation. However, more complex vehicles have since been developed by the field specifically for pulmonary usage, including mesoporous silica nanoparticles

 </sup> As siRNA sequences, specific antibodies, and small molecules are identified that specifically mitigate SARS-CoV-2, tissue engineers and biomaterials scientists can continue their work in designing vehicles to target areas of high viral load specifically and extendedly. Even if this work may not come to fruition during the current pandemic, these vehicles may serve vital roles during future viral outbreaks.
