<p>Classes of molecules that have been suggested as possible therapies include repurposed small-molecule drugs, monoclonal antibodies, and oligonucleotide strategies.

 </sup> For example, based on a small clinical study,
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>
 </sup> the combination of hydroxychloroquine (a small molecule traditionally used to treat malaria and lupus) and azithromycin (a macrolide antibiotic with anti-inflammatory properties) has been suggested as a means to reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral load, although these results are controversial.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>
 </sup> Poly(lactide) and poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microparticles can deliver azithromycin for up to 60 days with zero-order release kinetics.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>
 </sup> There are also formulations using fumaryl diketopiperazine microparticles to deliver azithromycin via intratracheal insufflation directly to the lungs, resulting in higher local concentrations in a murine pneumonia model compared to oral and intravenous routes of delivery.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>
 </sup> Given that the half-life of hydroxychloroquine is &gt;40 days, extended drug delivery options may not be warranted.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>
 </sup> However, there have been successful delivery systems constructed from PLGA nanoparticles for specific cell targeting.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>
 </sup> While the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 remains an area of active study, the above examples serve to show that tissue engineers and biomaterials scientists have been working on drug delivery for decades with a variety of vehicles available for small molecules in general.
