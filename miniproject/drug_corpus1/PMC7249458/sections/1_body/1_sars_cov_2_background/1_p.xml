<p>Coronaviruses, or 
 <italic>Orthocoronavirinae</italic>, are enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses. The virus gets its name from the projections, or “spikes,” emerging from its envelope that appear crown-like on electron micrography. The major components of SARS-CoV-2 are the envelope protein (E), membrane glycoprotein (M), spike protein (S), nucleocapsid protein (N), and its relatively large RNA genome of ∼30 kb.

 </sup> Enveloped viruses have a protective lipid bilayer with surface proteins and are generally more vulnerable to harsh environments than non-enveloped viruses. The spike protein is supposed to interact with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) membrane protein to induce fusion, endocytosis, and subsequent invasion into the host cell.

 </sup> Coronaviruses escape endosomes to the cytoplasm via acid-dependent cleavage of the S protein.

 </sup> RNA viruses, with few exceptions, replicate in the cytoplasm. The virus takes advantage of host ribosomes to replicate by translation and then assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum directed by M and E protein interactions. Viruses are then released by exocytosis to repeat the cycle of infection. Given this pathophysiology, potential targets being explored as therapeutics agents include blocking ACE2 interactions, altering endosome pH to prevent escape, inhibiting viral and/or host enzymes critical to replication, and downregulating host inflammation, given that an overexuberant response may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
