 </sup> working closely alongside clinicians, biologists, chemists, physicists, mathematicians, veterinarians, and other specialists, which will be critical in a multidisciplinary approach to combating the virus known as SARS-CoV-2. Lastly, tissue engineering as a field has emphasized clinical translation, including creating workflows to optimize bringing the benchtop to the bedside,
