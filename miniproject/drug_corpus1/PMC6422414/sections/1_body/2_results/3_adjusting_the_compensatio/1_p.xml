 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-idr-12-613">Figure 7</xref> shows the changes in the rate of public health products provided by the China CDC under various compensation levels for public health products by the government. From tests 1â€“3, the compensation levels for public products by the government were changed to 20% (0.01), twice (0.1), and ten times (0.5) their current values (0.05), respectively. The results showed that the higher compensation level for public products correlated with higher rates of public health products provided by the China CDC, which improves the compensation level by increasing the rates they provided.
