 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-idr-12-613">Figure 6</xref> shows the influence of governmental investment in China CDC on the rate of public health products they provided. According to the Chinese Health Statistical Yearbook 2015, the budget received by the China CDC consists of financial subsidy income from the government, amounting to 31,047,600,000 CNY. Therefore, the initial governmental investment in China CDC in January 2014 was determined as 31,047,600,000/12 CNY. In test 1, the initial value decreased to 10%, in test 2, it was set twice its current value, and in test 3, it was set ten times its current value. China CDC provided services such as public health products (including infectious and endemic diseases control), quasi-public products, and private products. Therefore, the rate of public health products provided by China CDC reflected the governmentâ€™s efforts to prevent and control infectious and endemic diseases. The results from these four different scenarios represented that as the governmental budget in China CDC increases, the rate of public health products they provided also increases significantly, which may lead to the growth of output capability of China CDC.
