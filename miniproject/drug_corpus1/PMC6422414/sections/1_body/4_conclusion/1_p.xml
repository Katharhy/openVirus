<p>The problem with infectious and endemic disease prevention and treatment system is the result of its incomplete functions and limited health resources. Under the current situation and systematic structure, because health institutions pursue economic benefits excessively, the whole system pays more attention to the treatment than the prevention of diseases, which in turn hinders epidemic control. To address the problems and improve the system, the government should increase its investment in the public health service system and improve the compensation system to ensure smooth implementation of epidemic prevention and treatment and, ultimately, improve the health status of the whole population in China.</p>
