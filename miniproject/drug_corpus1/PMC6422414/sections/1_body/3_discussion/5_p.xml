<p>Based on our literature review, this is the first study on China’s epidemic control system using an SD model. Owing to the model’s immaturity, some aspects remained to be improved, such as the application of more accurate data and stricter assumptions. Although the SD model has some deficits, it still allowed us to evaluate the public health system and estimate the epidemic control effects.</p>
