<p>This study has several limitations. As it is the first time that an SD model was used to study public health services provided by the China CDC in order to meet the needs of infectious and endemic disease control in China, relationships between subsystems have been simplified. Furthermore, several factors such as the cure rate were not considered in the model. Future studies will address these limitations and enhance the associations between the model and actual interventions.</p>
