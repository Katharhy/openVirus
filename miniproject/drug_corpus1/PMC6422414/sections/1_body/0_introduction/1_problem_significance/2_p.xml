<p>In the field of epidemiology, there is a special type known as endemic disease, which refers to the constant presence and/or usual prevalence of a disease or infectious agent in a population within a geographic area.
 <xref rid="b25-idr-12-613" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Endemic disease often overlaps infectious disease. An infectious disease will disappear or transit into an endemic disease based on its pathogenicity and transmission mode.
 <xref rid="b26-idr-12-613" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Some infectious diseases are endemic diseases in certain regions, for example, chickenpox is an endemic disease in the UK, malarial disease is endemic in Africa, and AIDS is becoming more and more endemic in Africa. Similar with infectious diseases, endemic diseases also threaten the health of the worldwide population in a particular way. If someone visits these endemic regions, especially the foreign workers, they will be exposed to these endemic diseases. Because of the constant existence of endemic diseases for many years, they even impose a far higher public health burden than infectious diseases
