<p>China is no exception to the burdens of infectious and endemic diseases. On the one hand, according to the law of the China on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, infectious diseases are divided into three categories: category A, including plague and cholera; category B, including 26 infectious diseases (viral hepatitis, AIDS, malaria, dengue fever, etc); and category C, including 11 infectious diseases (influenza, epidemic parotitis, etc). Among the mortality rates of major diseases in urban areas in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2016, infectious diseases (excluding respiratory tuberculosis) ranked 11th, 13th, 11th, 9th, and 10th, respectively, with the component ratios of 0.67%, 0.66%, 0.72%, 1.09%, and 1.05%.
 <xref rid="b29-idr-12-613" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The occurrence of infectious diseases showed a fluctuated trend in China but was always a serious threat to people’s health. The Chinese Health Statistics 2017 reports that the top ten infectious diseases for morbidity in categories A and B are viral hepatitis, tuberculosis, syphilis, bacillary and amebic dysentery, gonorrhea, scarlet fever, AIDS, brucellosis, measles, typhoid, and paratyphoid.
 <xref rid="b29-idr-12-613" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> On the other hand, China is a country with serious endemic diseases. Endemic patients in China are seriously affected, widely distributed, and threatened.
 <xref rid="b30-idr-12-613" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> According to the National Health Commission of China, the most important endemic diseases in China are Kashin–Beck disease, Keshan disease, iodine deficiency disorders, endemic fluorosis, and arsenic poisoning.
 <xref rid="b31-idr-12-613" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> The “13th Five-Year” National Endemic Disease Prevention and Control Plan proposed that by 2020, China will continue to eliminate the harm of iodine deficiency disorders and maintain the basic elimination of endemic fluorine and arsenic poisoning, Kashin–Beck disease, and Keshan disease.
 <xref rid="b32-idr-12-613" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> In this study, we focused on both infectious and endemic diseases. Based on the 28 infectious diseases in The Chinese Health Statistics 2015 and 2017, this study included 23 prevalent infectious diseases and excluded 5 temporarily eliminated infectious diseases. The included infectious diseases are epidemic encephalitis, typhoid and paratyphoid, brucellosis, infant tetanus, syphilis, epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, epidemic hemorrhagic disease, gonorrhea, anthrax, rabies, scarlet fever, malaria, viral hepatitis, dengue, whooping cough, bacillary and amebic dysentery, tuberculosis, AIDS, leptospirosis, cholera, measles, plague, schistosomiasis, and H7N9 avian flu. In the field of endemic diseases, we focused on the five most significant diseases mentioned above, namely, Kashin–Beck disease, Keshan disease, iodine deficiency disorders, endemic fluorosis, and arsenic poisoning.
