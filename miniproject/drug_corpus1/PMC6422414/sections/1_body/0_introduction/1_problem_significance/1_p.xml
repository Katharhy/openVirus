<p>The prevention and treatment of infectious and endemic diseases should be carefully considered, because they are both global issues. Infectious diseases occur mainly in developing countries, but owing to its mode of transmission, developed countries are always involved during epidemics. In 2017, 90 countries and areas had ongoing malaria transmission,
 <xref rid="b1-idr-12-613" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> an estimated 36.9 million people living with HIV at the end of 2017 and 940,000 died from HIV-related causes globally in 2017.
 <xref rid="b2-idr-12-613" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Among the people who died from infectious diseases, &gt;90% had AIDS, infectious diarrhea, tuberculosis, malaria, or respiratory diseases. According to the World Health Statistics, infectious diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis, AIDS, dengue, and measles, are long-time health risks, and solutions to these diseases should be found immediately. Half of the world’s population has been reported to being predisposed to malaria, and among the estimated 219 million cases, malaria caused 435,000 deaths in 2017.
 <xref rid="b1-idr-12-613" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The number of people living with HIV represents a worse tendency, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Neglected tropical diseases pose a severe threat to the poorest and most marginalized communities and cause millions of deaths; in particular, the incidence of dengue has dramatically increased in the recent decades. Therefore, WHO is calling for more efforts to prevent, treat, and eliminate infectious diseases.
 <xref rid="b3-idr-12-613" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> WHO has set some targets to achieve health-related Millennium Development Goals, including some regarding infectious diseases such as eliminating malaria in at least ten countries by 2020.
 <xref rid="b4-idr-12-613" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In addition, WHO has analyzed the risk factors associated with diseases, such as their transmission; all these risk factors increase the probability of epidemics, such as diarrheal diseases (including cholera), hepatitis, and pneumonia. Encouraged by the WHO and the importance of preventing and treating infectious diseases for global health, scholars from different countries and regions have conducted related studies. Researches mainly concentrated on the prevention and treatment, assessment methods and models, and epidemiology.
 <xref rid="b5-idr-12-613" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> HIV/AIDS is the most controversial research topic, including its prevention and treatment,

 <xref rid="b10-idr-12-613" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> epidemiology and pathogenesis,

 <xref rid="b17-idr-12-613" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Other epidemics also caused much attention, such as dengue epidemics,

 <xref rid="b19-idr-12-613" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="b20-idr-12-613" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and influenza.
 <xref rid="b21-idr-12-613" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Some studies focused on the epidemic prevention methods,
 <xref rid="b22-idr-12-613" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> the new epidemiological paradigm,
 <xref rid="b23-idr-12-613" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and the optimal control of epidemic outbreaks.
 <xref rid="b24-idr-12-613" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The EU also made great efforts to prevent epidemics. The ECDC has identified the major threats of epidemics and predicted the main risk factors faced by EU member countries and the European region in 2013. The ECDC analyzed seven types of infectious diseases, published an assessment report on the risks of infectious diseases in Europe, and included health risks in and outside of the EU, regarding the eight infectious diseases.
