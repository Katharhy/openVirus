<p>To validate the model, the initial value of variables was set in 2014, which was simulated in the next 3 years (2014–2016). This would help us demonstrate whether the model aligns with the historical evolution of China’s health delivery system. The validation results are shown in 
 <xref rid="t1-idr-12-613" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The actual data were taken from historical records of the 
 <italic>Chinese Health Statistical Yearbook 2017</italic>,
 <xref rid="b29-idr-12-613" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and the simulated data were the results of validation analysis. One can see that deviation between the actual and simulated data was not significant – namely, between −0. 8162% and 0.1550%, which is a reasonable range. Thus, the model is considered validated and reasonable.
