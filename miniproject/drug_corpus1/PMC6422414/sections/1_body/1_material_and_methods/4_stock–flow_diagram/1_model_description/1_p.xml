<p>To further quantify the disease control system, its three parts were established: the infectious disease, the endemic disease, and China CDC subsystems. The former two subsystems greatly influence the China CDC subsystem, mainly affecting the demand, and the latter, in turn, affects the tendency and stability of the former two subsystems. Various input and output variables in the three subsystems form the interrelationships in the disease control system, providing the possibility of constructing an SD model to study the disease control system. Data were extracted from the Chinese Health Statistical Yearbook 2015.
