 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-idr-12-613">Figure 2</xref> shows the SD model of the disease control system. This diagram would help policymakers, health managers, and common readers understand the structure and interaction of the system, thus making more scientific decisions and policies to support the disease control program. The diagram includes some different symbols: rectangles indicate stock variables, rate variables are linked by double-lined arrows, and causal relationships among variables are shown by single-lined arrows. In this stockâ€“flow diagram, stock variables are the total population, China CDC capital, and China CDC manpower. Flow variables are increment of population, decrement of population, increment of China CDC capital, decrement of China CDC capital, increment of China CDC manpower, and decrement of China CDC manpower. Auxiliary variables include rates of public health products provided by China CDC, output capability of China CDC, and amount of public health products provided by China CDC. Initial variables include birth rate, mortality rate, initial value of government investment in China CDC, and morbidity and fatality rates of 23 notifiable diseases. Intervention variables are government investment in China CDC and compensation level of public health product. The observation variable is the rate of public health products provided by China CDC.
