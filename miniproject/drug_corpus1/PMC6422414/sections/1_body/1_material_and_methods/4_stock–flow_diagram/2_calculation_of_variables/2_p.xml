<p>Second, values of the stock variables were calculated based on the initial value of the stock variables and the flow variables (increment and decrement values). For example, the initial total capital value of China CDC was 39,299,210,000 CNY, and the initial total manpower value of China CDC was 192,397. Therefore, the formulation of the total capital and manpower of China CDC was constructed as follows: total capital of China CDC = 39,299,210,000 + increment of capital of China CDC – decrement of capital of China CDC and total manpower of China CDC = 192,397+ increment of manpower of China CDC – decrement of manpower of China CDC.</p>
