<p>Finally, the total number of contagious patients was the sum of patients suffering from 23 notifiable contagious diseases (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-idr-12-613">Figure 4</xref>). The numbers of various patients were all reckoned based on the stock variable discipline. For example, the number of patients with viral hepatitis was formulated as the initial number of patients with viral hepatitis (1,223,021) + its increment – its decrement. In addition, the increment of patients with viral hepatitis was calculated as the total population × morbidity of virus hepatitis, where the total population was 1,367,820,000 + increment – decrement of population, and the morbidity from viral hepatitis was obtained from the Chinese health statistical yearbook. Similarly, decrement of patients with viral hepatitis was determined as the number of patients with viral hepatitis × its fatality rate. Therefore, other contagious diseases were calculated the same as viral hepatitis.
