<p>Fifth, the number of endemic patients was the total number of five different endemic patients, which came from the population of five disease counties and their morbidity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-idr-12-613">Figure 3</xref>). Morbidity of these diseases was extracted from the Chinese Health Statistical Yearbook 2015. The population of five disease counties was calculated according to the formulation of stock variables. Take the population of endemic fluorosis county as an example. The initial population of endemic fluorosis county was 94,537,000, and the increment and decrement of endemic fluorosis population were determined according to the population of endemic fluorosis county, birth rate, and death rate. Therefore, the five formulations were constructed as follows: Population of endemic fluorosis county = 94,537,000 + increment of endemic fluorosis population – decrement of endemic fluorosis population; popula tion of Keshan disease county = 61,892,000 + increment of Keshan disease population – decrement of Keshan disease population; population of Kashin–Beck disease county = 37,715,000+ increment of Kashin–Beck disease population – decrement of Keshan disease population; population of iodine deficiency disorder county = 1,319,645,000 + increment of iodine deficiency disorders population – decrement of iodine deficiency disorders population; and population of endemic arsenic poisoning county = 1,349,000 + increment of endemic arsenic poisoning population – decrement of endemic arsenic poisoning population.
