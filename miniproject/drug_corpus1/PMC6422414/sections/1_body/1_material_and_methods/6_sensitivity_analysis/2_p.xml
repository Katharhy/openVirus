<p>Two parameters were selected for the sensitivity analysis, with the variation rates between â€“20% and 20% of the current values. The two variables were the compensation level and initial government investment to China CDC. The output variable was the rate of public health products provided by China CDC. The model operated 200 times, and this procedure was conducted by Vensim. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-idr-12-613">Figure 5</xref> shows that among the 200 cases, 50% of the output variables were in the yellow, 75% in the green, 95% in the blue, and 100% in the gray area. This result suggested that the output variable did not show an extreme variation but changed in a slight and reasonable range. Therefore, the model is stable, reliable, and suitable for simulation analysis.
