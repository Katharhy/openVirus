<p>A disease control system is designed to prevent and control epidemics and other diseases and aims to decrease morbidity, improve the environment, and enhance the population’s health condition. The center of the disease control system is China CDC where the socioeconomic, national policy, financial, human resource, epidemics, and living environment systems are communicated, connected, and interacted to determine the functions of the disease control system. Thus, the aim of enhancing the population’s health state can be achieved, and the whole population as well as China CDC will benefit from the system. A disease control system involves three major parts: the government, consumer, and supplier. Governments will influence the disease control systems by adjusting price and compensation systems and changing the investment in China CDC. All these factors as the demand for an EPI and conditions of contagious and endemic diseases influence the demand for disease control services and products. The supplier is mainly influenced by the input, including manpower resource allocation and the funding system and its allocation. The three parts interact with each another, determining and sustaining the disease control system.</p>
