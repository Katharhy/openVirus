<p>The flow directions of resources and their allocation were analyzed. In this diagram, the medical resources referred to are China CDC capital and manpower. In 2014, the government investment in China CDC was 31,047,600,000 CNY, accounting for only 0.29% of the government health expenditure.
 <xref rid="b45-idr-12-613" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Combined with the low compensation level of public health products, the total capital of China CDC was completely insufficient. Hence, China CDC’s output capability was very poor, the China CDC’s provision of public health products was insufficient, China CDC was more willing to provide private and quasi-public products to make more earnings, and the price of three types of health products would be higher because of the poor compensation system. Meanwhile, owing to the more volatile manpower of China CDC, its output capability was greatly influenced and weakened, seriously hindering the process of disease control. The model of “grasp the shadow instead of the essence” could be used in analyzing the interaction between paid and public services provided by China CDC. Under the circumstances that China CDC’s total public health resources were insufficient, China CDC would try to overcome the embarrassing situation by decreasing the provision of public services and increasing the paid services, thus weakening the functions of China CDC and impeding the enhancement of the people’s health states. Therefore, the optimum solution to the deficient disease control system should be identified.
