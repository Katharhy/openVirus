<p>The China CDC’s investment and compensation system and the income mechanism were analyzed. Its incomes are mainly from government financial investment and paid service income. The governmental financial investment in the health delivery system accounted for a relatively small proportion (30.41%) of the total health expenditure in 2011,

This caused China CDC to depend more on service incomes, dramatically impeding the disease control process and the achievement of health condition enhancement. The China CDC’s paid service incomes can be divided into two parts, private and quasi-public product incomes, directly cutting down the provision of public health products that cannot provide financial benefits for China CDC. However, the price of the three types of products and the amount of products provided by China CDC are influenced by the compensation level of the public health product: as the compensation level of a public health product increases, so does the amount of products provided by China CDC. Thus, the function of the disease control system would be realized more completely. The China CDC has been known to play a significant role in satisfying the demand for disease control, mainly among the population with contagious and endemic diseases and the population requiring EPI.
