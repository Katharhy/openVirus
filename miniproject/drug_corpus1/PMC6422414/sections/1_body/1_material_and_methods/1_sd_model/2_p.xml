<p>An SD simulation often includes the following six steps. First, identify problems in the system and define the boundary dynamically. Second, based on the system’s dynamic changes and hypothesis, establish the causal loop and stock–flow diagrams. Third, identify and change the most significant stocks and flows. Fourth, determine the functions, equations, and initial values of some variables. Fifth, analyze and test the correspondence between the model and reality. Finally, present a discussion and conclusion according to the simulated results. The SD simulation can be completed using the Vensim DSS computer software, which allows us to concep-tualize, document, simulate, analyze, and optimize models of dynamic systems. Thus, the Vensim DSS was employed in this study to help create the SD model.</p>
