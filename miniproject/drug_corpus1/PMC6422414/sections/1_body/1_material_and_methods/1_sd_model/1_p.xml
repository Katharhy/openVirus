<p>SD contains four components (stock variables, flow variables, converters, and connectors) and is mainly constructed using causal loop and stock and flow diagrams. The stock and flow variables are essential components of SD structures, constituting the stock and flow diagrams with information. The stocks are state variables; the flows represent rates of change. SD models also include some cause-and-effect chains, and these closed chains are called feedback loops, which can be divided into reinforcing and balancing feedback loops and help understand the interrelations and interactions between elements of the system. In SD models, the causal loop diagrams consist of some feedback loops, and the stock and flow diagrams are based on the causal loop diagrams; by combining the two diagrams, the relationships among variables with the potential to change over time are understood.</p>
