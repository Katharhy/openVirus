 <xref rid="slct202001709-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> The pathogenesis and replication mechanisms of various coronaviruses have been elaborated in details since the 1970s. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were first identified in 1960 and caused acute upper respiratory infection (URI).
 <xref rid="slct202001709-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> CoVs affected the humans worldwide and are the pathogenic agents for both mammals and avian. These viruses can infect respiratory, hepatic, central nervous, and gastrointestinal systems of humans, bats, birds, mice, and some wild animals.
 <xref rid="slct202001709-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> These viruses are highly pathogenic to humans. Previously, CoV causes an epidemic of SARS in humans and infected thousands of people in Guangdong province of China, in 2002‐2003, followed by MERS in Saudi Arabia in 2012.
