<p>Apart from these four principle structural proteins, various coronavirus also encodes some special structural and accessory proteins like 3a/b protein, 4a/b protein and hemagglutinin‐esterase (HE) protein.
 <xref rid="slct202001709-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> The subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) of coronaviruses encodes all the structural and accessory proteins.
 <xref rid="slct202001709-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> The translation of coronavirus genomic RNA is controlled by the replicase‐transcriptase protein genes. These replicase‐transcriptase proteins encoded by two open‐reading frames (ORF) namely, ORF1a and ORF1b, respectively. These two ORFs are synthesized two large polyproteins like pp1a and pp1ab. The first ORF is 2/3
 <sup>rd</sup> of the entire genome length from the 5′‐terminal and they encode a pp1ab polyprotein.
 <xref rid="slct202001709-bib-0007b" ref-type="ref">7b</xref> The pp1ab polyprotein further divide into 16 nonstructural proteins (1‐16 nsps) except in the gamma‐coronavirus lacks nsp1. Most of the nonstructural proteins are very important and plays critical role in coronavirus viral RNA synthesis. The functions of some nonstructural proteins are not reported so far. There are 16 nsps of coronavirus form Double‐Membrane Vesicles (DMVs). Some nsps have hydrophobic transmembrane domains which acts as achor to the pp1a/pp1ab proteins with membranes during replication‐transcription complexes formation.
 <xref rid="slct202001709-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> Interestingly, the nsps or viral replication processes are found to be potential antiviral drug targets which might be helpful in the development of drugs against coronavirus.
 <xref rid="slct202001709-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> These nsps regulate genome transcription and replication processes.

 <xref rid="slct202001709-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> For example, nsp10 has role in viral replication/transcription complexes formation whereas the viral RNA replication and transcription are controlled by nsp12.
 <xref rid="slct202001709-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> It is essential to understand the function of all nsps for the development of promising drugs/vaccines against the COVID‐19 pandemic. The function of 16 nsps of coronaviruses are shown in the Table
