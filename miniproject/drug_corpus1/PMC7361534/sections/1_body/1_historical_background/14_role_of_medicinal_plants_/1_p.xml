<p>Till today, there is no single vaccine developed for effective treatment of deadly coronavirus disease COVID‐19. On exposure to the deadly virus, the recovery rate of the patient mainly depends upon the strength of the immune system. According to WHO, 80% population of the developing country make use of herbal plants for successful treatment of various disease as well as for boosting up the immunity of individuals. The best preventive measures under practice to minimize the rate of infection includes primarily controlling the source of infection along with maintaining proper hygiene, avoiding crowded places, isolation, early diagnosis, and supportive treatments (boosting the immune system using herbal medicine). The herbal drugs are designed using specific parts of plants (roots, stem, bark, flowers, seeds, and fruits) to increase the resistance against the emerging and re‐emerging viruses and bacteria (used in Ayurveda, as mentioned in Charaka Samhita and Susruta Samhita). Various plants produce beneficial ingredients such as oregano oil, fennel, garlic, peppermint, echinacea, sambucus, licorice, astragalus, ginger, tulsi (
