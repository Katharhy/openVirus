 <italic>In silico</italic> methods offer a way to methodically and rapidly yield additional repurposing candidates. Three‐dimensional structure for the main protease of SARS‐CoV‐2 in complex with N3 (PDB ID: 6LU7) available on the RCSB protein databank is being use in insilico study. Bioinformatics analysis is used to virtually screen the molecules to get the promising candidate against the main protease of SARS‐CoV‐2. A recent study published, relied on this approach, using the predicted structure of all SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins based on their homology with other known coronavirus protein structures, and identified several compounds with potential antiviral activity.

There are many approved drugs to cure the patients suffering from different diseases. These durgs are approved based on the efficacy and safety (pharmacology, formulation and toxicity) of medicines to humans. Subsequently, then many therapeutic and defensive agents have been discovered. More than 500 patents have been filed to combat these viruses in various authorities worldwide, so far.

Further, it is reported that hydroxychlroquine is less effective when administered alone than in combination with the azithromycin. Although, hydroxychlroquine and azithromycin have toxicity to heart and hydroxychloroquine showed toxic effect on eye.
