<p>The viral spike glycoprotein is dimer or trimer and has two functions: attaching the virus to receptor sites located on the host surface and activate the virion membrane to fuse with host membrane so that RNA genome released inside the host cell.
 <xref rid="slct202001709-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref> It may be noted that coronaviruses attack inside the cell membrane rather than acting on the surface of host cells. CoVs genome is non‐segmental, and the two‐third portion consists of overlapping ORFs responsible for translating the polyproteins. Remaining ORFs of genomes contained for structural proteins. Depending upon the protein sequences CoVs are subcategorised into four genera (α‐, β‐, γ‐, and δ‐CoVs).
 <xref rid="slct202001709-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">39</xref> The two genera α‐ and β‐ were primarily associated with rodents and bats for their genes source, although birds are the key reservoir for γ‐ and δ‐CoVs. So far, there are seven human coronaviruses (HCoVs) reported in literature where two of the coronaviruses (229E and NL63) are α‐CoVs, while remaining five coronaviruses namely, SARS, MERS, OC43, HKU1, and SARS‐CoV‐2 are β‐CoVs.
