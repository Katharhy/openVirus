   <p>Controlling and development of vaccines to prevent the outbreak of infectious diseases such as COVID‐19, needs fast action. Till date, no efficient vaccine/drug for its treatment is developed. Clinically patients treatment is mainly supported by emphasizing on the strength of their immune systems. In case of respiratory failure, patients are kept in the intensive care unit. Various nonspecific drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, ribavirin, lopinavir etc. are used for treating COVID‐19; however, their actual effectiveness is still not apparent.</p>

   <p>Since nanotechnology has improvised therapeutic advancements in recent years and is an advanced combating tool in drug designing as well as drug targeting. Scientists could be encouraged towards the use of nanomaterials for targeting viral structures and depriving the impact of such novel viral infections.</p>

   <p>The traditional diagnostic methods for viral disease sometimes are bulky, expensive and require skilled staff to operate, as it requires cell culture and sample preparation and thus, they are limited to centralized laboratories. But, the application of nanosensors, new tools offers massive advantages in the diagnosis of viral diseases; it requires only suitable nanoparticles. The development of nanosensors will be beneficial due to low cost, rapid detection tool and can help in the epidemics such as COVID‐19. Moreover, the existing toxicity evaluations of the NPs, though, cannot eliminate health risks.</p>

   <p>To encounter the pandemic situation in the current scenario is herculean. However, it could be possible by undergoing strong preventive major like social distancing, avoiding crowded places, wearing a good quality mask, maintaining personal hygiene like washing hands regularly, and early diagnosis of infection is of utmost crucial if symptoms of disease appear.</p>

   <p>The herbal drugs designed using specific parts of plants (roots, stem, bark, flowers, seeds, and fruits) increase the resistance against the emerging and re‐emerging viruses and bacteria (used in Ayurveda, as mentioned in Charaka Samhita and Susruta Samhita). Oregano oil, fennel, garlic, peppermint, echinacea, sambucus, licorice, astragalus, ginger, tulsi, turmeric, etc. have flavinoids, alkaloids, polyphenol's plays an essential role against various viral infections. These herbs release interferons and antibodies against viruses. It also increases the quantity of phagocytosis that protects the body by harmful particles. One of the herbal drugs ‘fifatrol’ natural antibiotic combination of vital phytoconstituents, immunomodulatory and antioxidants is helpful against viruses, allergens, and bacteria, thereby providing multi symptoms relief.

   <p>Since COVID‐19 outbreak is a global concern, therefore, confronting similar future situations needs uncompromising regulations. Zoonotic origin and genetically crossed species barriers need to be seriously encountered through the scientific database. Since 2019‐nCoV probably originated from bats and there are many future chances to get more viruses like this, which may prove more deadly and transmissible. Therefore, scientists must take fast action to recognize the origin of this deadly virus, discover active and safe drug and therapeutics to prevent its escalation and to combat any upcoming pandemic.</p>
