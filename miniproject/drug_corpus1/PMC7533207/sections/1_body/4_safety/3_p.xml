<p>ADE may occur when antibodies to the virus fail to efficiently neutralize the virus. Previous studies showed that the binding of virions to non-neutralizing or sub-neutralizing antibodies could lead to more efficient viral uptake into the target cell in FcÎ³ receptor or through complement-mediated mechanisms, leading to enhanced viral replication [
