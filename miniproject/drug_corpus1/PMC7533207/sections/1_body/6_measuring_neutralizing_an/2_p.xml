<p>Because historical experience of the use of convalescent plasma therapy suggests that the neutralizing activity may correlate with the efficacy of convalescent plasma, the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers should be considered, if available. However, laboratory methods for evaluating neutralizing antibody titers, such as the PRNT, microneutralization assay, and pseudovirus neutralization assay, are not routinely performed in hospital settings. However, as several reports suggest that SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG titers correlate with neutralizing antibody titers [

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], the SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG titer should be measured in the convalescent plasma.
