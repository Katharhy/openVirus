<p>Some patients who recover from viral diseases may not have high titers of neutralizing antibodies, which are crucial for the effectiveness of convalescent plasma therapy [

 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Of asymptomatic individuals, 93.3% and 81.1% had reductions in IgG and neutralizing antibody levels, respectively, during the early convalescent phase, as compared to 96.8% and 62.2% of symptomatic patients, respectively. Forty percent of asymptomatic individuals, and 12.9% of symptomatic individuals, became seronegative for IgG in the early convalescent phase. Another study showed that SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibody titers were low for the first 7 – 10 days after symptom onset and increased after 2 – 3 weeks [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The median peak time for neutralizing antibodies was 33 days after symptom onset. The titers in 93·3% of the patients declined gradually over the 3-month study period. Another study evaluated serological reactivity in plasma from 436 convalescent plasma donors with a history of disease compatible with COVID-19 in England [
