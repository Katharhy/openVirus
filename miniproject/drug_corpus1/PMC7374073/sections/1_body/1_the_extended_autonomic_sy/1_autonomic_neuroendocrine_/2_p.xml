<p id="Par46">Neuroendocrine systems expand the meaning of “autonomic.” Modern neuroendocrinology refers specifically to peptides secreted by hypothalamic neurons into the circulation. Even in this sense the neuroendocrine and autonomic systems interact. For instance, thyroidectomy, which increases thyrotropin secretion, also increases plasma levels of the SNS neurotransmitter NE [
