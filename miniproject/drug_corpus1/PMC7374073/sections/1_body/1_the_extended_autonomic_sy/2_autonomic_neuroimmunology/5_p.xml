<p id="Par51">The sources of endogenous DA outside the brain are relatively poorly understood. In the kidneys DA is formed from uptake and decarboxylation of circulating DOPA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR190">190</xref>] by proximal tubular cells and acts as an autocrine-paracrine substance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>] that promotes natriuresis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In patients with decompensated congestive heart failure, levodopa treatment increases urinary sodium excretion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Whether intravenously administered DOPA or DA affects the NLRP3 inflammasome is unknown.
