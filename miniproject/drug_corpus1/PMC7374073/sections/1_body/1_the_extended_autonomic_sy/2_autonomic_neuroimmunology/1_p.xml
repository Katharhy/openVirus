<p id="Par47">Another extension of the concept of autonomic relates to the immune system. The field of neuroimmunology focuses on interactions between the nervous system and immune functions. Anti-inflammation exerted by adrenocortical steroids was fundamental in Selye’s stress theory [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR191">191</xref>]. The inflammasome concept is based on the NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3, or NLPR3 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">173</xref>]. NLPR3 is conceptualized to be an intracellular sensor that can detect a wide variety of microbes, including RNA viruses. NLRP3 inflammasome formation leads to release of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and IL-18 and to cell death by pyroptosis. Pyroptosis is a form of programmed cell death that may remove intracellular viral replication niches in the tissue.
