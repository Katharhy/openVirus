<p id="Par49">It has been proposed that overactivity of myocardial beta-adrenoceptors by SNS activation exerts proinflammatory effects [

The latter mechanism is by definition an activity of “APUD” cells (APUD standing for amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation) that release polypeptide hormones in a diffuse neuroendocrine system [
