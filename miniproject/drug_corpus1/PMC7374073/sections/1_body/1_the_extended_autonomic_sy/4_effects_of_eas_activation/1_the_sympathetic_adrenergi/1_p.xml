<p id="Par57">EPI is a remarkably potent hormone that exerts numerous bodily effects. Most of these are well known, and so only aspects potentially relevant to COVID-19 are noted here. EPI-induced vasoconstriction in the splanchnic bed and kidneys decreases gastrointestinal and renal perfusion. EPI increases sweating [
