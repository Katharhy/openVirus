<p id="Par68">As noted above, the HPA axis has been viewed as the main effector of the central stress system. Regulation of the HPA axis is more complicated than that depicted by Selyeâ€™s theory or the Chrousos/Gold model. For instance, in critically ill patients there is decreased clearance of circulating cortisol [

Studies involving real-time dynamics of glucocorticoid hormones and glucocorticoid receptor function indicate pulsatility of the HPA axis and a continuous dynamic equilibrium [
