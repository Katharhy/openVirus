<p id="Par71">The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) plays major roles in homeostasis of extracellular fluid volume, blood pressure, electrolytes, and immune functions. The main determinants of release of the proteolytic enzyme renin are SNS and SAS activation (acting through beta-a adrenoceptors), decreased renal perfusion, and decreased sodium delivery to the distal tubules of the kidney. Renin cleaves the circulating protein angiotensinogen to form angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II (AII) by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which is especially abundant in vascular endothelium of the lungs. AII exerts numerous effects. It is a potent vasoconstrictor and augments adrenocortical secretion of aldosterone, the body’s main salt-retaining steroid. In adrenomedullary cells AII stimulates secretion of catecholamines via increased cytosolic ionized calcium [

ACE2, a homolog of ACE, converts AII to angiotensin 1–7 (Ang 1–7), which opposes the effects of AII. Thus, ACE2 inhibition would be expected to build up AII. Relevant to the present discussion, the SARS-CoV-2 virus enters cells via binding to ACE2.
