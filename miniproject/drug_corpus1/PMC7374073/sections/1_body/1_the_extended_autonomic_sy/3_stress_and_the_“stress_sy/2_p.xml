<p id="Par55">The original Chrousos/Gold stress system has required modification. For one thing, arginine vasopressin (AVP, synonymous with anti-diuretic hormone, ADH) is another neuroendocrine factor derived from the PVN. For another, the LC does not directly drive SNS or SAS outflows; several other brainstem sites do [

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, right panel). The central autonomic network is the source of outflows to components of the autonomic nervous system, including the SNS, for which NE is the neurotransmitter, the SAS, for which EPI is the hormone, and the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), for which acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter [
