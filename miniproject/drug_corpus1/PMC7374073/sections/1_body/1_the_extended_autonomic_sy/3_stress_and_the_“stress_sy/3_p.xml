<p id="Par56">Selye also conceptualized the “General Adaptation Syndrome” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">160</xref>]. By this he was referring to three stages. The stages were alarm, resistance, and exhaustion, and the three pathologic consequences were adrenal enlargement, gastric bleeding, and “involution of the thymico-lymphatic apparatus.” The alarm stage is acute and in the present vocabulary would include HPA, SNS, and SAS activation. The resistance stage, which Selye theorized can go on for variable periods of time, is adaptive and may correspond to an allostatic state. Accumulation of allostatic load decreases thresholds for induction of vicious cycles that usher in the exhaustion stage, the harbinger of imminent organismic death.
