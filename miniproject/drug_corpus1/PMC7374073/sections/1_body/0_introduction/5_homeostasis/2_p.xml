<p id="Par34">A classic example of homeostasis is regulation of core temperature (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, left). In response to cold exposure, sympathetic noradrenergic system (SNS) outflows increase, resulting in cutaneous vasoconstriction, shivering, and piloerection, all of which tend to maintain the core temperature. In response to heat exposure, sympathetic cholinergic system (SCS) outflows increase, evoking diaphoresis that tends to maintain the core temperature by evaporative heat loss.
