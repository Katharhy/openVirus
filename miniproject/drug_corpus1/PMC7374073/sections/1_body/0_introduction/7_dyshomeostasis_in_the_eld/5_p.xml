<p id="Par42">Plasma NE levels, NE responses to stress, skeletal muscle sympathetic outflow, and cardiac NE spillover all increase with aging [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">134</xref>], probably from a combination of decreased neuronal reuptake of NE and increased sympathetic nerve traffic. For a given amount of reflexively increased sympathetic outflow, however, there is a blunted vasoconstrictor response [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Responses of cardiac NE spillover to exercise are similar in elderly vs. young men, but this is due to an aging-related decline in neuronal reuptake of released NE, meaning that the increment in cardiac sympathetic outflow probably is blunted [
