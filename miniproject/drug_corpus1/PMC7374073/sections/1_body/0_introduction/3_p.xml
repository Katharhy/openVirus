<p id="Par31">Pneumonitis and pulmonary dysfunction usually dominate the clinical picture, but it is by now clear that COVID-19 importantly involves other body organs and systems, including the heart, gut, kidneys, and brain. The purpose of this essay is to convey a perspective that can account for the age-relatedness of COVID-19 mortality and the multi-organ—and therefore multi-disciplinary—aspects of the disease. The thesis is that both of these aspects may reflect dysautonomia, broadly defined as a condition where changes in functioning of one or more components of the autonomic nervous system adversely affect health.</p>
