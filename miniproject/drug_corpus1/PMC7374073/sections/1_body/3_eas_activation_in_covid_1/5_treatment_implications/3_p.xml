Fenoldopam is a catechol-containing DRD1 partial agonist that does not cross the blood-brain barrier. The drug also exerts vasodilator effects in coronary, renal, mesenteric, and peripheral arteries and is used intravenously clinically as an anti-hypertensive agent. The sulfonylurea oral hypoglycemic drug glyburide is a NLPR3 inhibitor [
