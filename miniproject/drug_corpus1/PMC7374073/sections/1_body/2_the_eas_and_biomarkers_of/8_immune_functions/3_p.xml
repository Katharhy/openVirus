<p id="Par89">COVID-19 patients have been reported to have lymphopenia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>], related to decreases in natural killer cells and T cell populations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The numbers of total T cells and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells are dramatically reduced, associated with increased serum IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-alpha concentrations and poor survival [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Meanwhile, there tends to be neutrophilia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR192">192</xref>] and increased neutrophil extracellular traps (networks of extracellular fibers mainly containing neutrophil DNA that bind pathogens), associated with increased COVID-19 mortality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">180</xref>].
