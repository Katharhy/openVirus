<p id="Par77">In acute coronary syndromes, hyperglycemia upon admission is common regardless of a history of diabetes and is associated with both increased mortality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>] and a variety of morbidities including ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation, atrial fibrillation, advanced degrees of atrioventricular block, and pulmonary edema [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and poor outcome after emergency coronary artery bypass grafting [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR177">177</xref>]. In non-diabetic patients admitted for acute myocardial infarction, concentrations of cortisol, EPI, and NE are the main correlates of circulating glucose concentrations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">133</xref>]. High glucose levels are an adverse prognostic factor in patients admitting for ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), regardless of the occurrence of diabetes mellitus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">162</xref>]. Both acute mortality and the subacute event rate are increased in patients with high admission glucose levels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">147</xref>]. In the pre-hospital phase of cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, hyperglycemia occurs commonly and is associated with increased mortality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185">185</xref>].
