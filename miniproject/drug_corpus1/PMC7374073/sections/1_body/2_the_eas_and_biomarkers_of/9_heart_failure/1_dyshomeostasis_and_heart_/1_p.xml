 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">153</xref>]. Once cardiac pump function declines to below a certain level despite maximal SNS stimulation, blood backs up into the pulmonary veins, bringing on pulmonary edema. The patient becomes short of breath, and in a distress response experiences the classic “feeling of impending doom” that has been associated from time immemorial with massive activation of the SAS and high circulating EPI levels. Rather than augmenting left ventricular myocardial contractility, EPI can be toxic to myocardial cells. Myocardial contractility could decrease further, and “stress cardiopathy” could set in, worsening the pulmonary edema.
