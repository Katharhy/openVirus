<p id="Par91">Low LF power is an independent predictor of sudden death in heart failure patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. LF power seems to be less of a marker of cardiac sympathetic outflow than of the ability to modulate that outflow via baroreflexes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">144</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">166</xref>]. Therefore, the absence of LF power in severe heart failure may represent baroreflex failure. Whether severely ill COVID-19 patients have low LF power is unknown.
