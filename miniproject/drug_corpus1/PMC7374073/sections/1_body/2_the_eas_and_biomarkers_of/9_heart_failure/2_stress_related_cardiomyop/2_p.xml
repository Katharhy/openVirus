<p id="Par93">After the 2004 Niigata earthquake, two patients were reported who had takotsubo cardiomyopathy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">175</xref>]. Both had stress-associated chest pain, giant T waves in the electrocardiogram, and echocardiographic apical hypokinesia, without evidence of coronary artery disease during cardiac catheterization. Both patients had accelerated loss of 
 <sup>123</sup>I-metaiodobenzylguanidine-(
 <sup>123</sup>I-MIBG)-derived radioactivity, consistent with increased sympathetically mediated exocytosis from myocardial sympathetic nerves. After the 1995 Hanshin earthquake, there was an increased incidence of patients with deep negative T waves, also associated with accelerated loss of 
 <sup>123</sup>I-MIBG-derived radioactivity [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>]. The frequency of atrial fibrillation was also increased [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>]. Patients admitted to the hospital after the earthquake were characterized by older age, systolic hypertension, infection, increased B-type natriuretic peptide and C-reactive protein (respective biomarkers of heart failure and inflammation), and decreased glomerular filtration rate [
