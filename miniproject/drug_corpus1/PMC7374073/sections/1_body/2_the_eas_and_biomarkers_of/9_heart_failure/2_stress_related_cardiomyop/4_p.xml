<p id="Par95">In heart failure cardiac NE stores become depleted [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This is likely from greater NE release with escape of neuronal reuptake compared to catecholamine biosynthesis via tyrosine hydroxylase [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The depletion of NE stores in the failing human heart attenuates the ability of indirect-acting sympathomimetic amines to provide inotropic support [
