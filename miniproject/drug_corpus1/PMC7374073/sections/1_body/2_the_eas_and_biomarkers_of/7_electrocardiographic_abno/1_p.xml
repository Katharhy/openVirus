<p id="Par83">Tachycardia, electrocardiographic changes, and abnormal heart rate variability in the frequency domain occur commonly during catastrophes and in severe illnesses. At the time of the Taiwan earthquake of 1999, 15 patients happened to be undergoing 24-h Holter monitoring, and heart rate variability data were analyzed in the time and frequency domains. Heart rate and the ratio of low frequency/high frequency (LF/HF) power increased after the earthquake and were attributed to PNS withdrawal [

 <sup>123</sup>I-metaiodobenzylguanidine-derived radioactivity, interpreted as indicating increased cardiac sympathetic outflow [
