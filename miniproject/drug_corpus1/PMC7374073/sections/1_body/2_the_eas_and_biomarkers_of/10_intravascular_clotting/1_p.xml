It has been proposed that an imbalance between coagulation and inflammation results in a hypercoagulable state. Thrombosis initiated by the innate immune system may limit SARS-CoV-2 dissemination, but aberrant activation of this system could cause endothelial injury, with dysregulation of fibrinolysis and thrombosis [
