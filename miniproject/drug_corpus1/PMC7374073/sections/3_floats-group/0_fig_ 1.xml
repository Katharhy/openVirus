  <p>From homeostasis to allostasis. In allostasis there is a shift in input-output curves for oppositely acting effectors (yellow and white), resulting in regulation of the monitored variable (in this case body temperature) at a different level. The acceptable bounds are the vertical dashed lines. A low-grade fever associated with a flu-like illness is an example of an allostatic state</p>
