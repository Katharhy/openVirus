<p>The co-existence of the two epidemics of HIV and SARS-CoV-2 could be particularly deleterious for people living with HIV not only in low and middle-income countries but also in high income countries. Widespread lockdowns, enforced in an attempt to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, lead to patients' job losses, difficulties in reaching the clinics where anti-HIV drugs are distributed, and problems in drug supplies to the clinics. Funds needed to step up the response to the new pandemic could reduce those assigned to the fight against HIV infection/AIDS and TB, and vulnerable HIV-infected populations (drug users, sex workers, poor patients living in urban slums or in rural areas, prisoners) would particularly suffer from this. Any efforts will have to be made to prevent or limit the above problems. In any case, it will be extremely important to describe the features of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the evolution of COVID-19 in HIV-infected patients, including whether HIV-infected people develop sufficient level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and their persistence over time. Even in this difficult situation, clinical and research centers, including those in Africa, will have to strive to clarify the numerous aspects of this unprecedented coinfection for the benefit of all HIV-infected patients worldwide.</p>
