<p>Tuberculosis coinfection is a huge problem in people living with HIV. In particular, in 2016, 2.5 million new cases of TB occurred in Africa, and an estimated 417,000 people died from the disease (over 25% of TB deaths worldwide) (

In the case of influenza, studies in mice showed that the amount of tissue damage among tuberculosisâ€“influenza-coinfected mice increased with longer duration of tuberculosis before the challenge with influenza (

 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) in patients with TB; interestingly, during the 2003 SARS epidemic, TB-SARS coinfection led to more striking CD4 cell decreases and poorer anti-SARS IgG antibody responses in the few patients studied (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Whether TB leads to a similar impairment in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 needs to be established.
