<p>Patients on antiretrovirals and with CD4 cell counts higher than 200/Î¼L might have a mild or moderate course of COVID-19, should ARVs have an effect on SARS-CoV-2. Protease inhibitors, in particular, inhibit enzymes which activate envelope glycoproteins as part of the process of viral entry into cells (

However, on the basis of available evidence, a recently published review concluded that it is unclear whether lopinavir/ritonavir and other ARVs improve clinical outcomes in severe COVID-19 or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients at high risk of acquiring it (
