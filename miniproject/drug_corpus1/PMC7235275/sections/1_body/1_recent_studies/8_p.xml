<p>Three HIV-coinfected cases have been reported from Italy (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). A 62-year-old man with undetectable viral load and 441 CD4 cells/μL required mechanical ventilation and improved; a 63-year-old man with undetectable HIV-RNA and 743 CD4 cells/μL and a 57-year-old woman (HIV-RNA and CD4 cell count not reported) had an uneventful course (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Interestingly, prior to getting SARS-CoV-2 all the three patients were on darunavir-based antiretroviral therapy, and pharmacokinetic data showed good compliance, suggesting that darunavir, at least at the currently employed 800 mg dosage, does not prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection HIV-infected individuals (
