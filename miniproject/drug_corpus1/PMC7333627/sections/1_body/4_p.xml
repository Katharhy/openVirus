<p id="para0005">It is unclear that the reported low co-infection rate is the result of large scales of empirical antimicrobial administration or the limitation of the overwhelmed clinical examinations in health systems during the pandemic. We concern the underestimation of the co-infections in COVID-19 patients, especially those on invasive mechanical ventilation support. However, we are also aware of the long-term impact of the development of antimicrobial resistance due to unnecessary usage of antimicrobial agents. We urge to re-establish the stewardship of antimicrobial therapy by systematic surveillance on antimicrobial usage and co-infections in COVID-19 patients. Future development in fast diagnosis for infectious agents based on genomics or proteomics identification will provide timely and accurate information for disease management. It is essential to develop evidence-based guidelines for responding the potential second wave of COVID-19 or future pandemics.</p>
