  <p id="Par3">The International committee on Virus Taxonomy has officially named the novel coronavirus as Severe Respiratory Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Gorbalenya et al. 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>). However, many scientists consider the suggested name inappropriate as it causes confusions regarding the disease it causes and leads to a misconception that the new virus is another strain of the previous SARS-CoV (Jiang et al. 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020a</xref>). We, therefore, as of now, refer to the novel coronavirus as 2019-nCoV for the purpose of this article.
