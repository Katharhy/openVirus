<p id="Par14">Gene annotation studies have successfully deciphered the genome of the novel coronavirus in great detail (Chan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2020a</xref>). The single-stranded RNA of the 2019-nCoV consists of 29,881 nucleotides coding for 9860 amino acids. The either ends of the RNA genome are flanked by 5′ and 3′ untranslated region (UTR) which is similar to that of other 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>. Starting from the 5′ end, the genome consists of ORF1 a/b that codes for 16 non-structural proteins (nsp) including RdRp followed by other ORFs coding for accessory and structural protein genes—spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). There is no major difference between the functions of various nsp of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV.
