<p id="Par15">Coronaviruses produce a set of nested sub-genomic (SG) mRNAs of varying sizes which are then translated to produce various structural and accessory proteins (Sztuba-Solińska et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2011</xref>). These SG mRNAs are synthesized by a ‘discontinuous template synthesis’ method in which a 5′ leader sequence is joined to an ORF(s) via the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS). TRS is a conserved 5–7 nucleotide sequences upstream of ORFs in coronavirus genomes. Bioinformatics studies have revealed that in 2019-nCoV around 12 ORFs produce a set of 9 nested SG mRNAs. Inside a host cell when the virus makes its copies, the orf1a/b is directly translated to produce two polypeptides pp1a and pp1ab which are cleaved to form 16 nsp including RdRp. These nsp together form a replication transcription complex (RTC). RTC then replicates the virus genome and produces various structural and accessory protein SG mRNAs inside a double membrane vesicle.
