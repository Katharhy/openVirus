<p id="Par37">Many scientists had predicted the possibility of re-emergence of a 2002–03 SARS-CoV like coronavirus outbreak in future. We still fell short of the requisite preparedness to combat the current outbreak. We need to learn many lessons from this current novel coronavirus outbreak and other epidemics in the past from different geographical regions under the ‘One Human–Animal–Environment’ approach. If an effective treatment to eradicate novel coronavirus infections is not found quickly the pandemic may turn into a recurring endemic in certain regions which will be even harder to tackle. Biomedical engineers, scientists, chemists and doctors need to come together to find innovative solution. A lot is known about coronaviruses, but still a lot needs to be known about their evolution, transmission and functions of different regions of their genome. Research focusing on development of broad range drugs and vaccines against coronaviruses based on conserved protein structures needs attention to stay ready for similar outbreaks in future. Newer technologies like artificial intelligence for prediction of disease epidemiology and development of more sensitive and affordable biosensors must also be given attention in this context.</p>
