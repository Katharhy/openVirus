<p id="Par35">Bats are known to be the reservoirs of many deadly viruses like the Nipa virus and Ebola beside coronaviruses. A reason for this is the inability of batsâ€™ innate immunity to sense viral DNAs in the cytosol. Bats have a very high rate of metabolism and increased rates of oxidative phosphorylation cause self-DNA damage leading to its escape from the nucleus and mitochondria into the cytosol. Bats have with time evolved to ignore this self-DNA in the cytosol by dampening of STING mechanism of DNA sensing and downregulating the production of appropriate IFN response. This in turn leads to even viral DNA in bat cytosol to go undetected leading them to host a wide range of viruses (Xie et al.
