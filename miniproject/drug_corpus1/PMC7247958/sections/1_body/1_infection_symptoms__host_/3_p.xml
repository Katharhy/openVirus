<p id="Par8">Most of the severely ill patients were reported to be in their old age, had some previously underlying conditions like diabetes or cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases or were co-infected with infectious bacteria or fungi like 
 <italic>A. baumannii</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. The number of males infected with 2019-nCoV is higher than the number of females. This trend was observed even at the time of the SARS-CoV outbreak. A reason behind this trend can be that X chromosome and sex hormones positively regulate innate and adaptive immunity enhancing anti-viral immunity in females (Channappanavar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2017</xref>). Moreover, the 2019-nCoV like the previous SARS and MERS CoV infections elicits strong cytokine responses in the host causing increased pulmonary inflammation and lung damage. Elevated levels of IgA and IgM in the lungs of an infected patient had been detected. The viral infection leads to the production of IL1B, IFNÎ³, IP10 and MCP1 which further lead to T-Helper 1 cell production (pro-inflammatory). However, a striking observation is that unlike the previous SARS CoV the 2019-nCoV elicited the production of T-Helper 2 cell-related cytokines like IL-10 and IL-4 as well (which are associated with anti-inflammatory signature). This can be one of the reasons for relatively less severe symptoms in many patients.
