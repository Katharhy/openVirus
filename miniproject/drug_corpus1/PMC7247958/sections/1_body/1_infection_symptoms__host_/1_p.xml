<p id="Par6">Symptoms exhibited by COVID-19 patients include pneumonia (which includes fever, dyspnoea, malaise, dry cough and respiratory distress), leucopenia and lymphopenia (a low lymphocyte count below a threshold has been suggested as a method for initial clinical diagnosis) (Hui et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020a</xref>; Huang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2020</xref>). Less common symptoms include headache, diarrhea, sputum production and hemoptysis (Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2020</xref>). Moreover, chest radiographs exhibit multifocal ground glass lung opacities. The incubation period of the virus is relatively long of about 5–14 days (Bouadma et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2020</xref>; Jiang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020b</xref>). Many patients that go asymptomatic during incubation period become major cause of the spread of this virus.
