It is speculated that this patient must have been infected either through an unknown source or through droplet transmission. Moreover, spread of infection in family clusters from these patients establishes the possibility of human to human transmission of infection (Chan et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2020</xref>). Given the cases where health workers or other patients and visitors to hospitals across Wuhan have contracted the infection, airborne droplets due to coughing, touching and using personal hygiene items (like towels and cosmetics) of the infected and nosocomial transmission seem the most probable modes of further spread of infection. However, further investigations are required to understand the exact mode of transmission of this virus among humans.
