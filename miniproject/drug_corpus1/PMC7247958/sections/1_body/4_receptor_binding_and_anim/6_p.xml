<p id="Par21">According to recent reports (Cyranoski 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2020</xref>), researchers at the South China Agricultural University in Guangzhou have claimed that the endangered pangolins are most likely the intermediate host of 2019-nCoV before it spread to humans. This claim is based on the fact that genome sequences of viruses isolated from pangolins are 99% similar to the genome sequence of 2019-nCoV isolated from patients and that coronavirus use receptors with similar molecular structure in pangolins as in humans for infection. Further supporting this claim is a study that reported coronavirus infection is one of the causes of deaths in pangolins (Liu et al.
