<p id="Par19">The rate of 2019-nCoV spread and resultant deaths have dramatically risen with time in Wuhan despite proper quarantine measures in place. As more strains from the later phases (after the onset) of the 2019-nCoV outbreak are isolated and sequenced, mutations in the S gene leading to the accelerated transmission and enhanced infectivity will be elucidated. These further investigations will also throw light on the recombination events that led to animalâ€“human transmission of this virus.</p>
