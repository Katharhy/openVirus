<p id="Par16">The 2002–03 SARS-CoV binds with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) receptor present on bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes in the lower respiratory tract via the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. The spike protein is divided into two functional subunits—S1 domain and S2 domain. The S1 domain is responsible for receptor binding, whereas the S2 domain is responsible for fusion of virus with the host cell membrane. The SARS-CoV forms a clover-shaped trimer with three S1 heads and a trimeric S2 stalk (Cui et al.

The S1-CTD at the tip of S1 domain acts as the RDB. The RBD is further sub-divided into a core region and a receptor binding motif (RBM). The compatibility of spike protein with the host cell receptor is largely dependent on the amino acid residues in the RBM. Any changes in the RBM or even core region amino acid residues can decrease or increase the affinity of spike –receptor binding. Changes in amino acid residues in RBM can even alter the virus’ tropism (Song et al.
