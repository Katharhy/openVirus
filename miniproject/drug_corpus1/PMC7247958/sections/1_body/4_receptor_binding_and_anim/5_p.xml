<p id="Par20">Recombination events leading to zoonotic 2019-nCoV from bat-derived SL-CoVZC45 and SL-CoVZXC21 must have taken place inside bats or in some unknown intermediate host being sold at Huanan seafood market. A study based on comparative relative synonymous codon usage bias (RSCU) analysis claimed that two species of snakes—
 <italic>Bungarus multicinctus</italic> and 
 <italic>Naja atra</italic>, acted as intermediate host for 2019-nCoV in which the recombination events happened about 2 years ago (Ji et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020</xref>). The principal behind RSCU analysis is that viruses tend to evolve codon usage bias similar to that of their hosts. The study compared the synonymous codon usage bias in 2019-nCoV with that of all possible intermediate hosts—birds, marmots, hedgehog, bats, snakes and humans, and the results were expressed as squared Euclidean distance. The two species of snakes mentioned above had the least squared Euclidean distance value compared to other animals. The RSCU results were further supported by claims that the two species of snakes are found in the central Hubei province and were even being sold at Huanan sea food market. The study has, however, been discredited by a large number of scientists on the grounds that it is highly unlikely that any coronavirus strain would ever infect a reptile which are so distant from mammals.
