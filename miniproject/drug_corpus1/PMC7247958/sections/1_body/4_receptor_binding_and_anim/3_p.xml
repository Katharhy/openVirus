<p id="Par18">The overall phylogenetic analysis of spike protein of 2019-nCoV with various reference genomes of 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> is more or less similar to the full-length genome phylogenetic analysis. In fact, the S2 domain of 2019-nCoV has a high degree of similarity with its two bat-derived ancestorsâ€”SL-CoVZC45 and SL-CoVZXC21, but interestingly, on the other hand, the S1 domain shares very little similarity. Rather the S1 domain of 2019-nCoV is very similar to that of SARS-CoV with around 50 conserved amino acid residues despite the fact the two falls in different clades. Consistent with this, the homology modeling of RBD of 2019-nCoV with SARS-CoV RBD as template revealed that the RBM of the 2019-nCoV is very similar in structure to that of SARS-CoV. These results led to the conclusion that 2019-nCoV may also bind to the human ACE-2 receptor. Another study using HeLa cells expressing ACE-2 also reached the same conclusion that 2019-nCoV may bind with the ACE-2 receptors (Zhou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2020</xref>). However, many residues that are crucial for binding of SARS-CoV RBD with ACE-2 vary in 2019-nCoV. The significance of these variations on ACE-2 binding needs to be further investigated.
