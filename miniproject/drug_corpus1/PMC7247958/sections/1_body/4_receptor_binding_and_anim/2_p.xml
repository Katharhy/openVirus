<p id="Par17">Residues 442, 472, 479, 480 and 487 in the SARS-CoV RBM contribute to host receptor specificity and in determining host range (Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2012</xref>). The residues at each of these positions form a salt bridge with specific ACE-2 receptor residues. Asparagine or arginine at residue 479 of RBM increases binding affinity with human and civet (intermediate host of SARS-CoV) ACE-2, whereas lysine at the same position decreases this binding affinity. Serine at residue 487 is required for RBM binding with civet ACE-2, but it fails to bind efficiently with human ACE-2. On the other hand, mutations in SARS-CoV leading to threonine at residue 487 lead to very efficient RBM and human ACE-2 binding. The early phase SARS-CoV strain-hcGd03 (Ser at residue487) that infected humans from civets had low infectivity and failed to transmit between humans. However, middle- and late-phase SARS-CoV strains especially hTor02 had a high infectivity and rapidly transmitted between humans as it had Thr at residue 487. Therefore, it can be inferred that RBD of spike protein in 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> is the cornerstone of infectivity and animal to human transmissions.
