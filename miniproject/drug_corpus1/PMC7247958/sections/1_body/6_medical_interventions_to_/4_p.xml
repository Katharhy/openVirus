<p id="Par32">The S2 domain is highly conserved between 2019-nCoV, its two bat-derived ancestors and SARS-CoV. Development of anti-viral peptides targeting the S2 domain has been also been proposed to combat a wide range of SARS-related infections (Du et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2009</xref>). A study has found that dimerization of nsp9 and its subsequent binding with nucleic acid is essential for nucleic acid replication in coronaviruses (Zeng et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2018</xref>). The dimerization of nsp9 is brought about by N-finger motif in nsp9. Drugs targeting nsp9 dimerization can also be an effective treatment in curbing 2019-nCoV infection.
