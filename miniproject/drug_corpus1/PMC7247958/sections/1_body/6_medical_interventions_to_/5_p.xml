<p id="Par33">As of now, most of the patients have to rely on their immune system to fight 2019-nCoV infection as no vaccine or effective drug is available. It may take several months if not years before one such vaccine is even developed and commercialized. Possible vaccine may include attenuated 2019-nCoV strains, substructures like membrane or envelope proteins, etc.</p>
