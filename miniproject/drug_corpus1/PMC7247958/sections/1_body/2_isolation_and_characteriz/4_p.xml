<p id="Par13">The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene in the ORF1a/b region of the 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> genomes is highly conserved across the genus (Lu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2020</xref>). The RdRp gene thus formed the basis for real-time-PCR (RT-PCR)-based laboratory diagnosis of the 2019-nCoV infection in early index patients. The cycle threshold or ct values of the patient-derived samples ranged from 22.85 to 32.41. These low ct values may be indicative of a high viral nucleic acid abundance in patient samples due to a very high rate of virus replication resulting in enhanced severity of the infection. The S gene in the 2019-nCoV genome that codes for the spike glycoprotein has also formed the basis for RT-PCR-based diagnosis of infection. The spike protein on the outer surface of coronaviruses is responsible for host cell receptor binding and invasion.
