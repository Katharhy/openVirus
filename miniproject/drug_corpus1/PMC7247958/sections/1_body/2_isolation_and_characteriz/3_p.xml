<p id="Par12">A BLASTn of the sequenced cDNAs (query sequences) was performed for which no matching sequence was found in the GenBank database. However, the query sequences had high similarity with the 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> sequences pertaining to lineage B (which include SARS CoV and SARSr-CoV). The highly similar sequences were then used as references for analysis and gene annotation of the query sequences. Further electron microscopic analysis of the viral particles in the inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm of the cytopathic HAL revealed spiked envelope with a solar corona-like shape, confirming that the viral particles belonged to the family Coronaviridae. Phylogenetic analysis of the novel query sequences along with other 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> genome sequences revealed that the closest relatives of the 2019-nCoV are bat-derived SL-CoVZC45 and SL-CoVZXC21 (forming one clade), whereas the SARS-CoV is distantly related forming a separate clade (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). However, the 2019-nCoV formed a distinct monophyletic cluster within the clade with a long branch separating away the two bat-derived SARSr-CoV (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).
