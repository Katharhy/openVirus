<p id="Par27">It is considered to be the most probable mechanism by which coronaviruses evolve. Homologous recombination between coronavirus genomes may take place during co-infection inside a host cell. Coronaviruses take advantage of TRS to carry on homologous recombination using a model similar to copy-choice recombination model. The RdRp while attached to the nascent nucleic acid molecule may switch to an acceptor template from a donor template where the acceptor and donor templates are from different closely related coronaviruses. The 2019-nCoV genome may have undergone a similar kind of homologous recombination with a closely related donor coronavirus during co-infection in an intermediate host.</p>
