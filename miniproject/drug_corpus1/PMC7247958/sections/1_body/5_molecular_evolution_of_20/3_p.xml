<p id="Par24">The ORF1b, ORF3b and ORF8 regions of the 2019-nCoV have a very low amino acid sequence identity when compared to that of either SARS-CoV or SL-CoVZC45 and SL-CoVZXC21. On the other hand, the 2019-nCoV S1-CTD crucial for determining virus tropism shares not only a high degree of conserved amino acid residues but also a very similar structure of RBM with SARS-CoV instead of SL-CoVZC45 and SL-CoVZXC21. This observation leads to the inference that positive selection pressures and simultaneous evolutionary mechanisms that caused the viral transmission to humans are very similar in both 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. A broader understanding of the molecular events causing mutations favorable for these viruses to switch to human hosts is necessary to prevent future outbreaks and in designing better preventive measures.</p>
