<p id="Par26">Coronaviruses have an unusually large RNA genome (26–30 kb) which makes them prone to errors during replication. The average error rate of RdRp is 10
 <sup>–3</sup>–10
 <sup>–5</sup> mutations per nucleotide per replication cycle. However, a set of RNA proofreading and editing enzymes like Exonuclease N synthesized by coronaviruses enhance the RdRp fidelity by around tenfold. It has been observed that during ecological stresses and positive selection pressures to switch between hosts the RdRp fidelity decreases presumably due to decrease in Exonuclease N activity. This in turn makes the coronavirus prone to higher rates of mutations and may lead to altered tropism. Studies have in fact shown when the selection pressures are over and the virus has successfully switched to new host, RdRp fidelity is enhanced again.
