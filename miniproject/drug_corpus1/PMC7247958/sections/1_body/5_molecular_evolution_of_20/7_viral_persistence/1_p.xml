<p id="Par28">The ability of viruses to establish and sustain infections in host cells is known as viral persistence. In case of downregulation of the expression of host receptor through which the coronavirus binds, the virus may evolve to either be able to bind to a different receptor or may bind to the original receptor with even greater affinity. As mentioned above, the SARS-CoV strains isolated from middle- and late-phase patients of the outbreak were more virulent and had a higher affinity for ACE-2 receptors compared to that of early phase. It is speculated that this happened due to accumulation of mutations in the S gene of middle- and late-phase strains resulting in greater affinity of spike protein for ACE-2. The steep rise in number of cases as well as deaths in a short span of time due to 2019-nCoV infection can be attributed to viral persistence inside host cell and during humanâ€“human transmission.</p>
