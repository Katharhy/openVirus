<p id="Par22">SARS-CoV originated from SARSr-CoV strains like WIV1 and RsSHC014 isolated from bats in a cave in Yunnan province in China. However, neither of these were direct ancestors of early phase SARS-CoV strains. Recombination events in both bats and civets especially in the S, ORF3b and ORF8 regions of the genome led to the evolution of SARS-CoV strains capable of infecting humans (He et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2004</xref>). The importance of mutations in S gene in this regard has already been discussed. Experimental analysis of protein coded by ORF3b region of SARS-CoV shows that the protein is required for increased replication rate of the virus inside host cells leading to cell necrosis (Yount et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2005</xref>; Khan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2006</xref>). The protein also acts as interferon antagonist by blocking IFN-Î² synthesis and signaling (Kopecky-Bromberg et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2007</xref>). Likewise, ORF8-coded protein activates inflammasomes like NLRP3 inside host cells (Shi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2019</xref>).
