<p id="Par27">However, Africa has a high burden of infectious diseases and comorbidities such as HIV, tuberculosis and malnutrition, all of which have detrimental effects on the host’s immune system, thus potentially increasing their susceptibility to severe respiratory infections, such as SARS-CoV-2. Although evidence is inconclusive of the potential interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and these comorbidities, it is important to remember that more than 200 million people suffering from malnutrition, 15 million people currently living with HIV and 2.5 million new cases of tuberculosis all reside in Africa.

This high burden of infections and comorbidities coupled with weak established health systems sets a platform for the epidemic to spin out of control unless stringent preventive measures are instated. Data on the critical care bed capacity in most African countries is generally sparse [
