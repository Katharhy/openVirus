<p id="Par13">Scientists remain baffled at the relatively low number of cases in Africa compared to the rest of the world. Could it be that African nations learnt important lessons from previous outbreaks such as Ebola, and thus boosted their surveillance systems to contain the COVID-19 outbreak? When the SARS-CoV-2 virus first arrived in Africa in February 2020, most countries heightened their disease surveillance systems by introducing mandatory screening at ports of entry, setting up isolation and quarantine centres, activating disease surveillance mechanisms from previous Ebola surveillance systems and tracing of contacts of suspects to quickly detect and respond to the outbreak [

This could partly explain the relatively low number of cases on African soil. The question remains, has Africa done enough in the fight against the SARS-CoV-2?
