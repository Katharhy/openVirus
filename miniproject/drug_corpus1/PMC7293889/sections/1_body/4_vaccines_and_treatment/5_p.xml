<p id="Par24">Another promising drug under investigation is tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 agent used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Another report described the efficacy of tocilizumab when administered subcutaneously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. This route of administration could be particularly useful in contexts where intravenous administration is not available. However, the availability, cost and monitoring of side effects, as well as the increased risk of superimposed or reactivating infections, may limit the use of tocilizumab and other immune-modulator agents in resource-limited settings.
