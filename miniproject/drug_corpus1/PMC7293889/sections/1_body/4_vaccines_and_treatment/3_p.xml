<p id="Par22">Similar to vaccines, no effective treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infection exists to date. A recent trial showed no benefit in the use of lopinavir/ritonavir, a drug commonly available in the treatment of HIV in Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The European AIDS Clinical Society (EACS) and the British HIV Association (BHIVA) stated that there is no evidence to support switching to regimens containing boosted protease inhibitors in order to prevent COVID-19 in people living with HIV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Similarly, there are ongoing studies to determine the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], which previously demonstrated in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. However, no study has demonstrated significant mortality benefit nor a consistent clearance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from respiratory samples with the use of hydroxychloroquine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. A recent study demonstrated an increased risk of mortality with hydroxychloroquine, attributable to increased risk of cardiac toxicity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Although this paper was withdrawn adding more complexity to the role of hydroxychloroquine, the drug would require consistent cardiac monitoring for toxicity especially when combined with azithromycin. The feasibility of rolling out this treatment in resource-constrained settings where cardiac monitoring may not be readily available makes it an unreliable option. Lastly, a randomised trial demonstrated no significant benefits of hydroxychloroquine used as post-exposure prophylaxis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and effects as pre-exposure prophylaxis have only been hypothesised.
