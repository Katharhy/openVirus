 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. While these measures are easily applicable to high and middle resource countries, the same cannot be assumed for low resource settings where access to water is still challenging. With a population of 1.3 billion people, it is estimated that 47% of Africans have no access to clean water; a significant bottleneck in preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and other water-borne diseases such as cholera [

Although the infectivity of the virus particles isolated in faeces is not yet known, the need to improve sanitation and access to water in Africa has never been greater [
