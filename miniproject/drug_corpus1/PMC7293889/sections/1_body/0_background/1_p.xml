<p id="Par9">Over the last half-century, more than fifty emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) have occurred worldwide. In Africa alone, almost half of the countries experience an EID epidemic each year. About 75% of these diseases are vector-borne or transmitted via zoonotic agents [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The movement of people between different parts of the globe coupled with the variance in incubation periods for each disease (usually varying between days and weeks) makes it difficult to establish a timely diagnosis of such outbreaks, thus favouring the dissemination of these infections worldwide. This is particularly true for respiratory infections, which are transmitted by micro-droplets or secretions. All these factors contribute to the evolution of pandemics and should be taken into account from a public health perspective.
