<p>The majority of malaria cases were found in Kédougou with a peak of transmission in October during the rainy season. These findings are in agreement with other malaria reports, which shows the accuracy of the results provided by the MBS-Lab and indicates that this platform could also be used to monitor the most deadly human parasite.

 </sup> However, no arbovirus cases were observed during the investigation at Kédougou, an area where arbovirus infection is reputed to be endemic.

 </sup> Whereas in Asia and the Americas human-to-human transmission by mosquitoes is the current form of arbovirus circulation, in West Africa sylvatic circulation is predominant.

 </sup> With entomological and virological surveillance programmes, several epidemic events have been observed in Kédougou after sylvatic amplification in mosquitoes.

 </sup> With climate change, urbanisation and population mobility, sporadic cases or small outbreaks are at risk of turning into large epidemics.

 </sup> Indeed, ancestral sylvatic dengue transmission, initially carried by non-human primates and 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes in the forests of West Africa, is now characterised by larger outbreaks, as exemplified by the recent epidemics in Senegal in 2017 and 2018.

 </sup> In that framework, the MBS-Lab was deployed, and 882 (in 2017) and 1736 (in 2018) sera samples were handled (unpublished data). The MBS-Lab played a key role in managing the outbreaks with proximity, rapid response and early patient management.
