<p>For the protection of laboratory staff and the environment, all samples were unpacked only inside the isolator, in order to minimise the risk of exposure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>). The surfaces of packaging and sample tubes were decontaminated with Aniospray disinfectant (Laboratoires ANIOS, Lille, France). Easy and safe handling was the main objective for the design of the isolator with a negative internal pressure of up to −50 Pa. The entrance and exit pass boxes flanking the isolator were set at −25 Pa. Therefore, specimens containing any class of infectious pathogen can be handled within the MBS-Lab.
