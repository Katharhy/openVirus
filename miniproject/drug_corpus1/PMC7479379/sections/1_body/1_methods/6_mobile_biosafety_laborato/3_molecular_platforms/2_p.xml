<p>The Idylla™ system (Biocartis, Mechelen, Belgium) is a fully automated, real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction) molecular testing system designed to offer results in the minimum amount of time. All components required for nucleic acid extraction, purification, real-time transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction amplification and detection are integrated in a single cartridge that was further loaded into the Idylla
 <sup>TM</sup> system. Handling time was less than five min per sample and the liquid-tight, disposable cartridges greatly reduce the risk of contamination.
