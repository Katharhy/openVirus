<p>A closed biosafety isolator equipped with a high-efficiency particulate air filter was integrated in the MBS-Lab. A negative pressure cascade (−25 pascal [Pa], −50 Pa and −25 Pa inside the isolator) provided a safe environment for handling different classes of pathogen, thereby eliminating the need for personal protective equipment required for high-containment laboratory facilities.</p>
