<p>The MBS-Lab was built in Belgium and shipped to Dakar, Senegal, in September 2017. This prospective study was carried out in five different localities in Senegal based on their climatological and ecological differences (from the dry northern to the humid southern regions) for six months (from October 2017 to March 2018). Work was conducted in various healthcare settings ranging from district hospitals and laboratories to primary healthcare settings and outreach initiatives in remote areas. After a week of training of IPD staff, the MBS-Lab was first deployed in the Kédougou area (south-eastern Senegal) from 08 to 23 October 2017, before being mobilised unexpectedly for dengue outbreak management in Louga city (north-western Senegal) from 25 October to 23 November 2017. Following this event, extensive field evaluation continued in the following sites: (1) Barkedji, Linguère and Dahra localities, which are not far from Louga (03–29 December 2017), (2) Bandafassi and Angoussaka villages near Kédougou (13–27 January 2018), (3) Saint-Louis city and Debi-Tiguette village next to the bird sanctuary of Djoudj in the north (11–23 February 2018) and (4) Sokone and Karang in the Fatick region in the central part of country, near The Gambia (11–24 March 2018) (
