<p>Past and recent disease outbreaks (e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Ebola, Zika, dengue) have shown that infectious diseases continue to affect the lives of people, while also representing social, economic and national security threats that can quickly evolve into global health crises.

 </sup> For example, the 2014â€“2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa cost $32.6 billion and resulted in the loss of 11 000 lives.

 </sup> Furthermore, dengue fever has become endemic in Africa with recurrent outbreaks in different countries.

 </sup> A parallel threat is the rise of antimicrobial resistance with an estimated 4.1 million deaths per year, expected to lead to a $42 trillion loss to the African economy by 2050.

 </sup> It is therefore urgent to further strengthen infectious disease surveillance and outbreak preparedness. Compared to the resources devoted to dealing with other global threats such as terrorism, climate change or war, little investment is dedicated to infectious disease outbreak preparedness.

 </sup> In recent years, health professionals and decision-makers have identified several strategies needed to mitigate risk.

 </sup> However, up to now, preventive initiatives have underestimated threats. In view of this, there is an increasing international community alliance, not only to raise funding, but more importantly to develop adequate and rapid deployment of task forces to prevent or contain declared outbreaks.
