<p>Some authors have proposed a classification of immunomodulators and immunosuppressants according to “likely risk”, suggesting continuation of TNFα inhibitors and anti-IL biologics (“likely moderate risk”) in the presence of mild viral symptoms [

Other authors recommend a limitation or avoidance of ciclosporin, methotrexate, and TNFα inhibitors for dermatologic patients in areas with high infection rates and stopping all immunosuppressive and biological therapy when exposure to confirmed COVID-19 cases occurs [
