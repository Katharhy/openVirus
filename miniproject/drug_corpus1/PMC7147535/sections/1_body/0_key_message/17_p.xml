<p>In summary, the available data on past and present outbreaks of coronavirus suggest that immunosuppressed patients are not at an increased risk for severe disease and complications compared with the general population and that immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory drugs may potentially control the “cytokine storm” associated with a poorer outcome in these patients. Thus, patients with cutaneous immune-mediated diseases (including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and hidradenitis suppurativa) can continue their treatment even during the COVID-19 outbreak, preventing disease flares that can contribute to an increasing patient burden, disability, poor quality of life, and healthcare usage.</p>
