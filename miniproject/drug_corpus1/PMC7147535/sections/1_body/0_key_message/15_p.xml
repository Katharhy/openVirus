<p>Baricitinib, a Janus kinase 1/2 inhibitor submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, has been predicted to reduce the ability of the virus to infect lung cells because it targets members of the numb-associated kinase (NAK) family, including adaptor-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1) and cyclin G-associated kinase (GAK), which are both involved in viral endocytosis [

Baricitinib appears to be able to effectively inhibit AAK1 and GAK at the plasma concentration obtained with the submitted dosage for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (2–4 mg daily), as well as reducing IL-6 and IFN-γ levels, which may be responsible for the more severe forms of interstitial pneumonia due to COVID-19 [
