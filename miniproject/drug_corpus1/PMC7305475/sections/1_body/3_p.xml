Our hospital provided a practical virtual platform to perform specialist assessments, with a generally positive response and thousands of patients who signed up in less than a month. We ensured that all the patients who had a scheduled appointment during the lockdown period were contacted by phone or other telematics platforms. The assessments were based on the evaluation of both mental health conditions and the impact of Covid-19 on everyday life. We used a structured interview, containing items that referred to understanding the lockdown measures, exacerbation of mood, anxiety and sleep symptoms, and economical repercussions of the emergency. We interviewed 179 subjects in 2Â months, 97.8% of which expressed satisfaction with the service offered.
