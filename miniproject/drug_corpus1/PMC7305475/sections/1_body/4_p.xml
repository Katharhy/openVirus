<p id="Par5">In case of hospitalization, we remodeled the clinical routine and organization for inpatients to limit the spread of the virus within a high-risk environment, with the aim of zero infections among patients and health-care workers. Before the admission, every patient underwent a nasopharyngeal swab and a strict contact tracing, in cooperation with the Infectious Diseases staff; those who tested negative for Sars-CoV-2 were admitted under a 3-day isolation regime. During the hospitalization, basic preventive measures were implemented, including frequent hand washing, physical distancing, and use of facemasks, with continuous training operated by the staff. Neither group activities nor visits from relatives were allowed, with the use of common rooms/spaces restricted to adequate distancing. Temperature, vitals, and respiratory symptoms were assessed daily on 39 consecutively admitted patients, which detected only 2 suspected cases. Those were quickly isolated and transferred to the Infectious Diseases ward; none of them were confirmed as Covid-19.</p>
