    "In order to prevent spread of COVID-19, World Health Organization (WHO) has specified that measures such as cleaning hands regularly with alcohol-based hand sanitizer or washing with soap and water, avoiding touching nose, eyes, mouth and social distancing should be followed by people. Another important measure for containing spread is by Testing–Testing and Testing. By testing, patients affected by COVID-19 can be isolated and further spread from them can be prevented. For testing, clinical specimen inactivation should be performed in a bio-safety level-3 (BSL-3) laboratory and after this step, routine testing can be performed in a bio-safety level-2 laboratory. Based on the infection and death rates in the current pandemic situation, few high-level bio-safety facilities are required to handle this deadly virus associated with potential exposure risks. It would take a long time, a large staff and many resources to construct a new fixed bio-safety facility, thus delaying the prevention and control of the pandemic. Therefore, a mobile BSL-3 laboratory with both bio-safety and flexibility is urgently needed to manage the pandemic and emergent public health incidents. To meet this requirement, the author has designed a mobile virology research and diagnostic laboratory with inputs from ESIC Medical College, Hyderabad, identified two companies which specialize in fabrication of shelters and containment facilities, realized and installed it within 15 days of time. This state-of-the-art, one of its kind laboratory was inaugurated by Hon’ble Raksha Mantri on 23 April, 2020. The MVRDL developed as per WHO and ICMR bio-safety standard (BSL-3) can be used:To conduct real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test for diagnosing COVID-19. Possibility to test up to 2000 samples per day.For virus culturing for drug screening, convalescent plasma-derived therapy.To aid in the development of vaccine and development of diagnostic kits."
