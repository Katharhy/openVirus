This analysis shows, perhaps not unexpectedly, that, following the spike of the research interest in the initial phases of each epidemic, progressively fewer research papers were published for previous outbreaks after they ended. This trend probably reflects the lack of special funding for such research and, consequently, the lack of successful therapeutic development against the respective diseases. Indeed, fluctuations in research funding for each epidemic appear to follow the same spike-like trend as research publications (

This lack of research interest and/or funding outside of periods when these outbreaks are occurring is probably partially responsible for the current situation: no approved anticoronaviral medications exist and, as such, the world is frantically looking to repurpose existing drugs, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which is premature and, according to at least some reports, could be potentially harmful to patients
