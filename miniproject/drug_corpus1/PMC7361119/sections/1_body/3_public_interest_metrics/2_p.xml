<p id="par0120">First, we gathered and standardized Google Trends data for each of the epidemics based on their start dates and relative time periods (no Google Trends data are available before January 2004; thus, some timepoints for bird flu and SARS were not available). When observing the first 30 months of the outbreaks, the response of the public to the epidemic appeared to peak during the first 8 months (

For diseases that had been previously studied, such as swine flu and Ebola hemorrhagic fever, there was already some search interest before the start date of the epidemic and, thus, the relative search interest in these diseases was higher during the earlier months of the epidemic. These outbreaks were shorter lived than some of the other diseases, such as MERS (infection continues today, although cases peaked in early 2014)
