<p id="par0145">HIV serves as a prime example of how scientists in academia, government, and industry can combine efforts to combat a common threat. Even though it took 5 years to name the virus that caused the disease and 6 years to approve the first medication, cumulative scientific efforts ultimately paid off in the form of a diversity of treatment regimens available and a major improvement in life expectancy in most parts of the world

 <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>. The latter is especially important to consider when developing therapies, vaccines, and antiviral medications. A lower mutation rate means that there is a higher probability of new treatments working for lengthier periods of time. It is also important to consider whether an infection is chronic or if recovered individuals can become sick again, examples being HIV and influenza, respectively. Epidemics last longer or can recur if the pathogen at hand meets these criteria, thus allowing more time for drug discovery to have a tangible output, such as ART for HIV and annual vaccines for influenza. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is not known to be chronic and neither is it known definitively whether secondary infection can occur 
 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, but this or a similar virus is predicted to eventually re-emerge, meaning that drugs developed and tested now will be useful for future epidemics
