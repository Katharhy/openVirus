<p id="par0140">Azidothymidine, better known as AZT, was the first drug approved in the USA to treat HIV and was tested in clinical trials and approved for use in patients in 1987, 6 years after the pandemic began 
 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. AZT was originally synthesized for use as an anticancer agent 
 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> and was then repurposed against HIV. Given the toxicity of AZT and the rapid evolution of drug resistance 
 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, new compounds targeting various aspects of viral replication were eventually designed, encompassing different classes of antiretroviral drug, such as non-nucleoside/nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, integrase inhibitors, and fusion inhibitors 
 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Currently, combinations of these different classes of antiretroviral drug are used in what is known as 
 <bold>antiretroviral therapy</bold> (ART) to prevent the development of drug resistance. To date, 22 distinct medications and 22 combination therapies have been approved by the FDA, most during the early 2000s 
 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The first nonrepurposed drugs approved by the FDA were lamivudine (a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor) and saquinavir (a protease inhibitor), both approved in 1995, nearly 15 years after the start of the pandemic 
 <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Later during the pandemic, new drugs were developed in a streamlined process where lead compounds active against HIV 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> were structurally modified to improve their efficacy and lower their cytotoxicity 
 <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. 
 <bold>High-throughput screening</bold> (HTS) campaigns have also proven useful in identifying existing compounds with promise against HIV
