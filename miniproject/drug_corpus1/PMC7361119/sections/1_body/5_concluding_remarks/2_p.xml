<p id="par0160">The speed of the response of the scientific community to major outbreaks has increased over the past two decades matching the increasing accessibility of information via the internet, but the outcome of this response has not changed. Despite the presence of various intergovernmental agencies, such as the WHO and the United Nations, individual nations have traditionally responded to large-scale epidemics in a disjointed fashion, and they desperately lack a pre-established, adequate, continuous, and centralized effort even within their own countries, let alone, internationally

As seen in the data presented in this study, the viruses that had already been studied before their respective epidemics garnered more publications and clinical trials in a shorter period of time than those that were understudied previously. Zika virus and Ebola virus had both been discovered long before they caused significant morbidity and mortality around the world; yet, they were not studied extensively, and thus, the correlated response of the scientific community was inefficient
