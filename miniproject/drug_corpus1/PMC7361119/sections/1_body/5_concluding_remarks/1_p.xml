<p id="par0155">In recent years, there has been a noticeable uptick in the response of the scientific community to outbreaks. We have observed that the Ebola (2014–2016) and Zika (2015–2016) outbreaks had more publications and clinical trials performed in a shorter time period than for previous outbreaks (

However, the response of the scientific community to the COVID-19 outbreak represents the most rapid response yet, with an unprecedented number of clinical trials and publications both in peer-reviewed journals and preprint servers. However, clinical and research efforts in response to past epidemics have failed to yield therapies during or after epidemic period; traditionally, it has taken years for effective drugs and vaccines to be developed and approved, much past the point at which they could be clinically useful and/or could be tested in clinical trials.
