 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> estimated that the yearly cost of a pandemic could amount to ∼US$60 billion dollars being spent worldwide on treatment, control, and prevention efforts. As seen in the current outbreak of the SARS Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), this cost might be even higher because of restrictions on international trade and travel, closing of businesses, prohibition of large gatherings of people, and other social-distancing strategies

Although these measures do help curb the spread of the disease, they have potentially devastating consequences: it was initially predicted that a large volume of cases over a short period of time would result in the USA having barely enough masks to last even 2 weeks into the pandemic

 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, one can see that, on Super Tuesday in the USA in 2020, the popularity of Google searches for ‘coronavirus’ was nearly three times that for ‘Super Tuesday’. Also, because of prohibitions on gatherings of more than 25–50 people in many cities and states, people might have stayed away from the polls out of fear of contracting the virus and might continue to do so in the future, possibly influencing the outcome of the 2020 US election
