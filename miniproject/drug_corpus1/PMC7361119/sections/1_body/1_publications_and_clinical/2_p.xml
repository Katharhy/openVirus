<p id="par0095">First, we looked at the response of the scientific community on weekly timescale (

 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) and publications (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) over the first 24 weeks of each outbreak, with week 0 corresponding to the time point when the federal authorities or the WHO first started reporting the data on the epidemic (for COVID-19, December 31, 2019 is considered the start date). On this standardized timescale, the number of clinical trials launched for COVID-19 greatly outnumbered that of any of the previous epidemics; the growth rate of publications on COVID-19 was also the highest. One can also see that, for more recent epidemics, such as Ebola and Zika, more clinical trials were launched during the first 24 weeks of the epidemic than had been the case for previous epidemics, such as bird flu and MERS (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The only exception to this general observation was swine flu, which is an anomaly because H1N1 flu strains had been researched extensively before the start of the outbreak in 2009 as a result of the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and other past H1N1 epidemics
