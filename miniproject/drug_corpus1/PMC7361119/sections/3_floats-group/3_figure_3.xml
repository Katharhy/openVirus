  <p>Cumulative number of publications and clinical trials over time for SARS in comparison with the global number of cases/deaths (log scale). Start date of epidemic is defined as the date when authorities such as the WHO started listing data on the number of cases. The data correspond to the first 3 months after severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. The number of cases and deaths were obtained from the WHO and the number of publications from PubMed. In 2003, ArXiv was the only preprint server available and no preprints were published during the first 3 months of SARS epidemic. The search was based on the keywords ‘SARS’, ‘Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome’, and ‘SARS-CoV’. No clinical trials for SARS were deposited on ClinicalTrials.gov during the first 3 months after the outbreak.</p>
