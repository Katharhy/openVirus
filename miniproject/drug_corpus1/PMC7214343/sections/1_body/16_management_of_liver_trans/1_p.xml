<p id="p0110">Patients with advanced liver disease and those after LTX represent vulnerable patient cohorts with an increased risk of infection and/or a severe course of COVID-19 Because of the immunosuppressed state they have 
 <xref rid="b0295" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. As the innate immune response associated with increased serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels may be the main driver for pulmonary injury due to COVID-19, immunosuppression may be protective 
 <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0300" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. Coronaviruses have not shown to cause more severe disease in immunosuppressed patients. More interestingly, reviewing the mortality and morbidity reports published on Coronaviruses outbreaks such SARS that emerged in 2002, MERS, and more recently COVID-19, no fatalities were reported in patients undergoing transplantations, receiving chemotherapies or other immunosuppressive treatments 
 <xref rid="b0305" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. Risk factors for poor outcome include older age (post-transplant recipients aged greater than 60 years old) male sex and presence of comorbidities (obesity, diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease) 
 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Available data on coronavirus before and during outbreaks suggest that immunosuppressed patients are not at increased risk of severe pulmonary disease compared to the general population; however, immunosuppression may prolong viral shedding in post-transplant patients with COVID-19 if they are already infected 
 <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0300" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. Immunosuppressive therapy should be started in patients with liver disease with or without COVID-19 who have strong indications for treatment (e.g., autoimmune hepatitis, liver transplant patients, and in cases of graft rejection). This should be done without compromising their transplant management as reducing the dosage or stopping immunosuppressants as this may precipitate acute rejection in a liver transplant recipient, so there is no need to reduce or stop immunosuppression for asymptomatic post-transplant patients without known COVID-19 
 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The reduction should only be considered under special circumstances (e.g., medication-induced lymphopenia, or bacterial/fungal superinfection in case of severe COVID-19) after consultation of a specialist 
 <xref rid="b0310" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. The potential role of corticosteroids for the prevention of progression of mild COVID-19 to severe pneumonia is unknown. WHO recommends avoiding corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19 unless indicated for another therapeutic purpose 
 <xref rid="b0315" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. In patients with confirmed COVID-19, we should minimize the dosage of prednisone, maintaining a sufficient dosage to avoid adrenal insufficiency 
 <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Similarly, it is also advised to reduce daily calcineurin inhibitor dosage; consider decreasing tacrolimus/cyclosporine by 50%, stop mycophenolate (CellCept/Myfortic) and Azathioprine especially in the setting of lymphopenia, fever, or worsening pneumonia attributed to COVID-19. In the case of ground-glass opacities, pneumonia switching mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) to calcineurin inhibitors (CNI, e.g., tacrolimus) should be done given the possibility of pneumonitis with mTor; otherwise, we should stop all immunosuppression 
 <xref rid="b0295" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. For outpatients on belatacept, switching to tacrolimus or cyclosporine should be considered after 28 days from the last dose, to avoid clinic visit. For inpatients on belatacept, we should not administer any further belatacept. Twenty-eight days after the last dose, adding low dose CNI should be considered. For CNI intolerant patients, increasing daily prednisone dose from 5 mg to 7.5–10 mg daily might be considered. Low dose prednisone (5 mg) in all patients who were receiving it before hospitalization can be maintained
