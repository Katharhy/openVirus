<p id="p0065">Based on the current situation with the conflict of the limited capacity of ICU beds and the urgent need for transplantation in some cases, safety protocols should be applied in transplant centers with experience exchange between them. A recent protocol applied in one of the major centers of LTX in Portugal is to test new liver transplant cases with PCR for COVID-19 and arrange for transfer other medical or surgical critically-ill patients to the nearest other ICUs inside the hospital or outside, to ensure the ICU beds availability for new liver transplant cases. Moreover, patients and staff from each sector of the ICU should use different routes inside the ICU to decrease the risk of infection

The definition of fast-tracking in liver transplant still lacks consensus among different centers, ranging from early postoperative extubating in the operating room once the surgery is finished, to strategies that minimize postoperative ventilation time. Generally, this term is reserved for early extubation, recovery in a post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), and direct transfer to the surgical ward avoiding an ICU stay
