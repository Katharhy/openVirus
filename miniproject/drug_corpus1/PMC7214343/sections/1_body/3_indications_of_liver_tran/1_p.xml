<p id="p0020">Because of the rapidly changing situation of COVID-19 infection worldwide, indications of LTX will need to be updated according to the emerging data. Bearing in mind that any liver transplant related activity not only involves the donor and the recipient, but it involves many individuals, including doctors, paramedical staff, nurses, and health care workers. Taking into consideration that there is a risk of the donor to recipient transmission of COVID-19, from both deceased donors and living donors. The risk of donor-derived infection would depend upon donor exposure, infectivity in the incubation period, degree and duration of viremia, and viability of the virus within blood or specific organ compartments 
 <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Traditionally, The AASLD/AST guidelines outline four major types of indications for LTX in the United States: Acute liver failure, complicated cirrhosis, metabolic liver diseases, and systemic complications of chronic liver disease 
 <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Acute liver failure is the most important indication for emergency LTX. Common causes of acute liver failure include acetaminophen overdose, acute viral hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, mushroom poisoning, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, acute ischemic hepatitis (shock liver), and acute fatty liver of pregnancy

Similarly, patients with cirrhosis and type 1 hepatorenal syndrome have a median survival of fewer than two weeks and should be urgently referred to a transplant center for expedited transplant evaluation, as should patients with other evidence for rapid hepatic decompensation
