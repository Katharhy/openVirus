<p id="p0030">Despite being potentially transmitted by organ donation, recent recommendations suggest that LTX could be performed during the COVID-19 pandemic 
 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. As the organism is predominantly found in respiratory secretions, lungs are considered high-risk organs for transmission of COVID-19infection if the donor is infected. However, all other organs could be considered at risk as the virus was isolated from blood in nearly 15% of cases 
 <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. These observations are supported by evidence from the SARS epidemic in 2003 in which autopsy results could demonstrate the virus in almost all body organs
