<p id="p0090">A fixed-dose combination for the prevention and treatment of HIV infection. The cytochrome P450 inhibitory effects of ritonavir prolong the half-life of Lopinavir and extend its protease inhibitory action but, on the other hand, increases its liability for many drug interactions 
 <xref rid="b0275" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. This combination is not recommended to be co-administer with many steroids forms, simvastatin, atorvastatin, domperidone, and sirolimus. There is also a potential interaction with ciclosporin, mycophenolate, tacrolimus, which makes its use in the setting of LTX is questionable. However, a recent case report confirmed successful COVID-19 treatment by Lopinavir/ritonavir in liver transplant recipients 
 <xref rid="b0290" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. Lopinavir/ritonavir can increase chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine concentrations. Also, Lopinavir/ritonavir induces QT interval prolongation that may potentiate chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine toxicity
