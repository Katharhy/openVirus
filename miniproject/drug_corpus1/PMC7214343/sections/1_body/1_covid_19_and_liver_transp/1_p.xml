<p id="p0010">Based on previous observations for SARS and other related viruses, a theoretical risk of liver damage exists with COVID-19 infection 
 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, available data only reported hepatic dysfunction in the form of abnormal levels of liver aminotransferases and slightly elevated bilirubin levels, mainly in critically ill patients 
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. On the other hand, reports during an influenza outbreak in Germany in winter 2017/2018 showed increased organ failure scores of patients with liver cirrhosis where 5 out of 11 patients with liver cirrhosis developed acute liver failure during influenza infection 
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. No data available on the impact of COVID-19 on decompensated liver disease patients awaiting LTX, but because of the known immunocompromised state of these patients, adequate protective measures should be maintained. Although healthcare facilities are overwhelmed with management of COVID-19 patients &amp; health resources are being rapidly consumed, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), recommended against postponing transplantation. Moreover, they advised each program to consider its capability regarding intensive care unit (ICU) beds, ventilators availability, and blood donation 
 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Prioritization of transplant candidates is another problem that may face clinicians due to limited resources during the pandemic, as well as the exclusion of donors infected with COVID-19 
 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Immunosuppression in the post-transplant recipients may be protective against cytokine storm induced by COVID-19, which is responsible for the severe illness on the one hand. However, and on the other hand, recipients on immunosuppression may have more intense and prolonged shedding of the virus, increasing the risk of transmission to contacts, including healthcare workers 
 <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. This could emphasize the crucial role of implementing infection control measures to avoid losing candidates on the LTX waiting list because of the closed transplantation centers
