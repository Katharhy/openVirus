Scientists worldwide are engaged in attempts to elucidate the transmission and pathogenic mechanisms of the causative coronavirus. COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, making it critical to track and review the state of research on COVID-19 to provide guidance for further investigations. Here, bibliometric and knowledge mapping analyses of studies on COVID-19 were performed, including more than 1,500 papers on COVID-19 available in the PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases from January 1, 2020 to March 8, 2020. In this review, we found that because of the rapid response of researchers worldwide, the number of COVID-19-related publications showed a high growth trend in the first 10&#x000a0;days of February; among these, the largest number of studies originated in China, the country most affected by pandemic in its early stages. Our findings revealed that the epidemic situation and data accessibility of different research teams have caused obvious difference in emphases of the publications. Besides, there was an unprecedented level of close cooperation and information sharing within the global scientific community relative to previous coronavirus research. We combed and drew the knowledge map of the SARS-CoV-2 literature, explored early status of research on etiology, pathology, epidemiology, treatment, prevention, and control, and discussed knowledge gaps that remain to be urgently addressed. Future perspectives on treatment, prevention, and control are also presented to provide fundamental references for current and future coronavirus research.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0015"><title>Graphical Abstract</title><fig id="undfig1" position="anchor"><graphic xlink:href="fx1_lrg"/></fig></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="abs0020"><title>Public Summary</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">China initiated COVID-19-related research in considerable scope and depth at the early stage of the outbreak</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">Researchers all over the world have rapidly launched unprecedented joint research efforts</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">The knowledge map of SARS-CoV-2 is becoming increasingly comprehensive, and knowledge gaps to be filled have been identified</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0025">The next step is to consider other factors conducive to research innovation, such as public and private's cooperation, equitable health system</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>bibliometric analysis</kwd><kwd>research status</kwd><kwd>knowledge scape</kwd><kwd>knowledge map</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><p id="misc0010">Published: August 28, 2020</p></notes></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0030">In December 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia with unknown cause was detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. A novel coronavirus was identified as the causative virus by Chinese authorities on January 7, 2020. The Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses designated the causative virus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease, which subsequently spread globally, was named coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-2019) by the World Health Organization (WHO). In March 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic.</p><p id="p0035">Like other major epidemics caused by coronaviruses (such as SARS and MERS), COVID-19 is a substantial threat to public health, with severe economic implications. The COVID-19 pandemic calls for increased research on traceability analysis, transmission, diagnosis methods, epidemiology, treatment, prevention, and containment of the disease.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref>
</p><p id="p0040">In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which the WHO declared the sixth Public Health Emergency of International Concern, researchers worldwide raced to characterize the virus through joint scientific research efforts. Around 60 key research organizations and journals, including BMJ, signed a joint statement pledging to &#x0201c;rapidly and openly&#x0201d; share research data and findings relevant to the outbreak. Medical journals, such as the Lancet, the New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA, BMJ, Springer Nature, National Medical Journal of China, and China Biotechnology set up a special hub to support the global response to COVID-19 by enabling fast and direct access to the latest available research, evidence, and data.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> As of March 8, 2020, more than 1,500 studies on COVID-19, covering topics, such as etiology, diagnosis, epidemiology, treatment, prognosis, nursing, prevention, and control, were available in PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI)databases.</p><p id="p0045">In this review, the global literature related to COVID-19 were analyzed using bibliometric methods, citation analysis, and knowledge mapping methods. Studies reporting temporal patterns, main countries affected, and core subjects were identified, and the status and trends in COVID-19 research were explored from January 2020 to March 2020 to reveal the conceptual knowledge map in SARS-CoV-2. The results provide a reference for current and future coronavirus research and policymaking worldwide.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Temporal Distribution</title><p id="p0050">Since the outbreak and global spread of COVID-19, researchers worldwide have embarked on intense research efforts, and the number of publications on COVID-19 has shown an increasing trend, with fluctuations, over time. The first related study, which was published on January 22, 2020, discussed the transmission of COVID-19 across species.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Before February 5, 2020, the number of daily publications increased by single digits, and thereafter by double digits. In terms of research topic, etiology, epidemiology, and prevention research were the focus of early published papers. As the outbreak progressed, the focus of publications shifted to diagnosis and prevention. There were relatively fewer studies on prognosis and nursing as of March 8, 2020.</p><p id="p0055">The number of Chinese articles published was larger than that of English articles, especially after the middle of February, by more than 2.5 times. This may be because China was the most severely affected country in the early stages of the pandemic. The first article appearing in Chinese journals was published on January 21, 2020. In this article, Gao and other scholars from the School of Life Sciences of Nankai University discovered, through traceability analysis, that the horseshoe bat was the original host of the virus, and suggested that this virus may be a new variant of coronavirus that mutates quickly, with a wide host range and strong host adaptability.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> In terms of research subdomains, treatment and prevention were the focus of these Chinese articles (details in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>

China was one of the most severely affected countries in the early stages of the epidemic until late February; therefore, COVID-19-related studies were carried out rapidly. As a result, China (including Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan) ranked no. 1 with 353 published articles. Because of its firm foundations in medical and scientific research as well as its recent experience in the prevention and control of seasonal influenza, the US ranked second, with 97 published studies related to COVID-19. European countries, such as the UK (27 papers), Germany (15 papers) and Italy (15 papers) were among the countries with the highest number of publications focusing on the epidemiology of COVID-19.</p><p id="p0065">The specific focus of COVID-19 studies has varied across different regions worldwide. China has mainly focused on the epidemiology of COVID-19. Patients in the early outbreak provided large samples of clinical characteristics and predictive spread of COVID-19. Research institutions on the Chinese mainland, such as Tongji Hospital, conducted numerous studies on the clinical characteristics and biochemical markers of COVID-19.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> A research foundation in Hong Kong, with 26 articles on SARS, rapidly initiated studies on the effective control of the spread of COVID-19. Research institutions in Hong Kong include universities (such as the University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Polytechnic University) as well as hospitals (such as the Queen Mary Hospital), have focused on epidemiology as well as preventative and control measures for COVID-19.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> The Government of Macau has placed greater emphasis on studies related to the prevention and control (one paper) and nursing care (one paper), and has taken early, proactive measures against transmission of COVID-19. Furthermore, studies performed by hospitals, in Taiwan (nine papers) (such as the National Taiwan University College of Medicine and regional general hospitals), have mainly focused on routes of transmission and clinical characteristics of COVID-19.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref>
</p><p id="p0070">In the US, considerable studies on the epidemiology (30 papers), prevention and control, and etiology of COVID-19 have been published. For instance, the University of Washington has studied the impacts of travel restrictions on disease spread, the Mayo Clinic has investigated the establishment and rationality of prevention and control measures, and the University of Chicago has explored the pathological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. Studies in the UK have mainly focused on the epidemiology and prevention and control of COVID-19; for example, University College London and the London School of Hygiene &#x00026; Tropical Medicine have studied the effects of the disease on public health and the corresponding prevention and control measures to be undertaken at different phases of epidemic development. Research in Canada has focused on the epidemiology of COVID-19, such as the study from University of Toronto about the transmission dynamics and risk assessment. Japan has placed significant emphasis on epidemiological studies, with studies published by Hokkaido University and the Japan Science and Technology Agency describing the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 and quarantine duration. Similarly, Germany has mainly focused on epidemiological studies; for example, Heidelberg University established a model to assess the epidemic potential of SARS-CoV-2 and predict its transmission dynamics and impact. Studies in Italy have placed a relatively higher focus on the epidemiological and etiological aspects of COVID-19. Scientists at the Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases have reported an unusual radiological presentation of COVID-19 using chest computed tomography (CT) scans. The Biomedical University of Rome has focused on investigating the pathogenesis and evolutionary pattern of SARS-CoV-2.</p><p id="p0075">Journal publications on COVID-19 suggested that scientists from different countries worldwide have strengthened their research collaborations and launched joint research projects for the prevention and control of the epidemic. China has collaborated with 21 countries, including the US, Canada, and Japan, and published 80 related articles on the subject before March 8, dominating COVID-19 research. Furthermore, collaborative networks have been established among the US, Europe, and Southeast Asia as well as within European countries, which have jointly conducted studies on the virus and its pathogenic mechanism, as well as related clinical studies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>

These cities and provinces also represented the seat of medical research power in China. Beijing, which has the strongest medical research capacity, ranked first with 256 papers, while Hubei, the region most severely affected by the epidemic in China, ranked second (177 papers). Furthermore, the numbers of COVID-19-related research papers in Guangdong (105 papers), Shanghai (100 papers), and Sichuan (100 papers) were also prominent. Research carried out in Beijing has covered all aspects of SARS-CoV-2, with a focus on treatment, prevention, etiology, and prognosis, ranking first in China in terms of number of publications. In addition to treatment and prevention, researchers in Hubei have focused on diagnosis of COVID-19 and nursing practice; research performed in Guangdong and Sichuan has mainly covered etiology, diagnosis, and nursing; studies in Shanghai have focused on etiology, prognosis, and nursing; publications from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shaanxi mainly focus on etiology, while research in Chongqing has been centered around diagnosis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>
