<p id="p0240">The sources of literature used in this review were PubMed (for publications in English) and CNKI(for publications in Chinese), and studies published between January 1, 2020, and March 8, 2020, were retrieved. The search strategy was: TS = ((COVID-19) OR (2019-nCoV) OR (2019 novel coronavirus) OR (SARS-CoV-2) OR (Wuhan coronavirus) OR (Wuhan novel coronavirus) OR (COVID) OR (novel coronavirus) OR (Wuhan nCoV) OR (Wuhan coronavirus) OR (2019 novel CoV)) (Expressions with “Wuhan” were included in the search strategy to guarantee the comprehensiveness of the retrieval, as in the early stage of the outbreak of the COVID-19, certain scholars used “Wuhan” in their manuscripts before WHO gave the formal name. The authors insist that SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 should be used when referred to as the new coronavirus.) The source publications were Chinese articles in research journals, and English articles limited to article and review, excluding letters and commentary, and so forth. Temporal distribution, regional distribution, and organization distribution of the literature were characterized by bibliometric analysis and clustering classification. Visualization of data was performed in Excel 2013, Visio 2013, and UCINET v.6.186, and all figures were redesigned by Adobe Illustrator 2020 and Adobe Photoshop 2020.</p>
