<p id="p0060">Regional distribution showed that the number of articles on COVID-19 is positively correlated with the severity in that particular country. China was one of the most severely affected countries in the early stages of the epidemic until late February; therefore, COVID-19-related studies were carried out rapidly. As a result, China (including Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan) ranked no. 1 with 353 published articles. Because of its firm foundations in medical and scientific research as well as its recent experience in the prevention and control of seasonal influenza, the US ranked second, with 97 published studies related to COVID-19. European countries, such as the UK (27 papers), Germany (15 papers) and Italy (15 papers) were among the countries with the highest number of publications focusing on the epidemiology of COVID-19.</p>
