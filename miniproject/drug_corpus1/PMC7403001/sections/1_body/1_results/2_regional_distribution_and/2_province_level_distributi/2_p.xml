<p id="p0090">In terms of research subdomains, Chinese articles on the novel coronavirus have mainly focused on treatment and prevention, accounting for more than 85%. In addition to treatment and prevention, other research subdomains have been the focus of studies from different cities and provinces. The publication data also showed active collaborations on COVID-19 research across China. Among the around 1,000 retrieved research papers, the proportion of publications resulting from inter-provincial/city cooperation is 18%. From the perspective of research topic, about 20% of papers in the subdomains of treatment, prevention, and etiology resulted from inter-provincial/city research cooperation, while the corresponding percentages for studies on diagnosis and nursing were comparatively low, at about 13% and 6%, respectively. From the perspective of provinces and cities, about half of Beijing's papers were published in cooperation across provinces and cities, and almost all the provinces and cities established cooperative research relationships with Beijing. For Hubei, the number of inter-provincial collaborative papers was the second highest in China, and about 80% of institutions in other provinces and cities established joint research efforts with Hubei institutions. However, Hubei's inter-provincial collaborative rate was slightly lower. The numbers of publications resulting from inter-provincial collaboration in Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Guangdong were relatively similar. Among them, Jiangsu had the highest proportion of inter-provincial collaborative publications, exceeding 50%, and the corresponding percentages for Tianjin, Sichuan, and Liaoning were relatively close. However, their inter-provincial collaborative rates were quite different: Liaoning, over 70%; Tianjin, over 50%; and Sichuan, only about 22% (
