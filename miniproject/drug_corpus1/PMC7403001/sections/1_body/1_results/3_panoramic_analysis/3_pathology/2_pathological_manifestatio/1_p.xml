No thrombus was found in the umbilical cord blood vessels, and nucleated red blood cells were not observed in the blood vessels of the placental villi, and transaminase levels were normal in three infected pregnant women. Recent research, however, suggested possible vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from an infected mother to her newborn.
