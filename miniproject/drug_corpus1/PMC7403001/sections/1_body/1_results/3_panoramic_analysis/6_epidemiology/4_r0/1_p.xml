<p id="p0175">Studies on the basic reproduction number (R0), based on various epidemiological models, have been performed. The real-time changes in R0 were found to be an unstable trend, with large variances at the beginning of the outbreak, with a shift to a downward trend in late January that corresponded to the strengthening of the prevention and control strategies; this trend stabilized in late February, ranging from 1.4 to 4.1, and the estimated doubling time was 3.6 to 4.1Â days.
