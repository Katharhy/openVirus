<p id="p0150">There have been several methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection, which can mainly be classified into three categories: nucleic acid detection, immunological detection, and clinical feature identification. Among these, nucleic acid amplification detection methods, mainly including reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time RT-PCR, diagnosis using gene chips, and whole-genome sequencing identification and classification

The study was publicized by WHO, and the scheme was recommended as a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory diagnostic technique. Immunological identification methods, which are reported to enable rapid and convenient viral detection, mainly include ELISA enzyme-linked immune assays and monoclonal antibody-based detection. Methods for evaluating clinical features include chest CT images, peripheral blood leukocyte counts, and determination of the liver enzyme index.
