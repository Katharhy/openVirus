<p id="p0115">Many countries are affected by the rapid outbreak of SAR-CoV-2 infections so there is an urgent need to develop a safe and effective SARCoV-2 vaccine. Various research groups around the world have been able to start SAR-CoV-2 vaccine development by gaining knowledge from SARS and MERS vaccines development strategies. In this review we have extensively discussed the various vaccine targets or strategies based on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccine studies. The receptor-binding domain (RDB) of Spike protein (S) might be considered as a good vaccine antigen because it induces neutralizing antibodies that prevent host cell attachment and infection [

In order to make effective SAR-CoV-2 vaccine possible, target antigen(s)/nucleotide identification, immunization route, immune protection, suitable animal models, scalability, production facility, target product profile (TPP), outbreak forecasting and target population etc. are important parameters. As it is already known for some of the recent epidemics (Zika and Ebola) whose successful vaccine has not been developed yet. Lesson-learned from these epidemics in order to speed up the available vaccine during ongoing outbreak, preclinical studies of SAR-CoV-2 vaccine candidates may need to be performed in parallel with clinical trials. But in reality, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will not be available for another 12–18 months because of the limitations such as unavailability of appropriate animal models to check the efficacy and toxicity before going for the clinical trials. Further it should comply with Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) to ensure the safety in humans. Post animal studies and cGMP clinical trial might be initiated in three phases (Phase I, II and III). Finally it require more time for the distribution and administration of the vaccine in a population currently naïve to SARS-CoV-2 infection. So there is a need of tight coordination and technology transfer among governments, regulatory agencies, pharmaceutical companies, and the World Health Organization (WHO), for the global production of effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 [

As the COVID-19 causes serious global health concerns, investigation into the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, its interaction with the host immune responses could provide a clearer picture of how the pathogen causes diseases in some individuals and mild or no infection in others. Further, the evaluation of immunity and long-term memory of COVID-19 recovered individuals may be helpful in designing of a potential prophylactic and therapeutic agent not only against SARS-CoV-2 but other similar coronaviruses during future outbreaks.
