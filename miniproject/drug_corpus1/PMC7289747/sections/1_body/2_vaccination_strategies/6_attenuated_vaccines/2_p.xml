<p id="p0105">Historical evidences demonstrate that live attenuated vaccines are the most successful vaccines against intracellular pathogens as they have already proven in case of various bacterial and viral pathogens [
 <xref rid="bb0515" ref-type="bibr">[103]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0520" ref-type="bibr">[104]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0525" ref-type="bibr">[105]</xref>]. It is an attractive approach where attenuated live virus confers immune responses similar to natural infection, without posing any risk of infection and provides long lasting protective immunity. Development of a vaccine should follow some stringent criteria where safety, efficacy and reproducibility are of paramount significance. These vaccines are more efficient as they persists for longer period of time, showcases the entire viral antigens complement to the host immune system, deliver antigen to the appropriate compartments of cells and tissues to produce endogenous proteins, efficient in MHC class I presentation and finally help in generating a strong cytotoxic T-cell response. Further it improves the potential of live attenuated vaccines to support antigen-specific effectors and memory immune responses so that a long term protective immunity can be achieved. However, attenuated vaccination is a promising approach in the field of viral infection, but the main difficulty is the reversion of the pathogen to its virulent form as happened in the case of oral vaccine of poliovirus [

From the safety point of view, it is often very difficult to get vaccine regulatory approval and using such vaccines without strong evidence is a huge risk. Although this limit for SARS has not yet been met, but some attractive attenuated mutants have been developed. Deletion of E protein encoding gene abrogated the virulence of CoVs, and several studies have explored the potential of recombinant SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV with a mutated E protein [

 <xref rid="bb0540" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Further, vaccination of hamsters with this mutant have shown raised level of serum-neutralizing antibodies and protected from clinical sign and replication of homologous (SARS-CoV, Urbani) and heterologous (GD03) SARS-CoV in the respiratory tract (both the upper and lower respiratory tract) [
 <xref rid="bb0545" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Thus, deletion of the structural E gene may prove to be the first step in the field of developing a live-attenuated vaccine against SARS-CoV. Moreover, 
 <italic>nsp-1</italic> gene deleted CoV mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) has also been reported with high efficacy thus can also be used for developing a SARS-attenuated vaccine [
 <xref rid="bb0550" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Two studies related to gene deletion and attenuation effects suggests that removal of ORFs 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b or 9b results in very little and no viral replication during in-vitro and in vivo conditions [
 <xref rid="bb0540" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0555" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. However the outcomes of the studies conducted so far are not so convincing because it takes longer time to create non-infectious clones of coronavirus due to larger genome size and also requires extensive safety testing [
 <xref rid="bb0560" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Furthermore, reversion of the pathogen to the virulent form can be protected using gene replacement knockout strategy that can be safer as compared to the lines developed by other means like chemical treatment and irradiation etc.
