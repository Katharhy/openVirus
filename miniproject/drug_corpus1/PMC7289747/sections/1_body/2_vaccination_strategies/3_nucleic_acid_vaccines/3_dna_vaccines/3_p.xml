<p id="p0040">DNA vaccine made up of plasmid DNA encoding protein from pathogens have been demonstrated for inducing both T and B cell responses, after showing the similar effects of live viruses, that antigenic proteins are produced endogenously and presented efficiently by MHC class I, thus help in inducing CD8+ T-cell responses [
 <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Further as the DNA vaccines are simple, stable, safe and can be easily produced it can be possible option to the use of live vaccines [
 <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. There are numbers of SARS-CoV proteins viz. S [

 <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>,

 <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>], M [
 <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and N [
 <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] proteins reported to induce cellular and humoral responses have been utilized as DNA vaccine candidates [
 <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In a study DNA vaccine associated expression of S protein have generated both T-cell and neutralizing antibody responses, and lowered the replication of SARS-CoV in the respiratory tract this manifested that protective efficacy to the S gene in mice was antibody mediated not T-cell dependent [
 <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Further in a study S plasmid improved the gene expression of spike (S) protein by heterologous viral RNA export elements and protection in mouse model [
 <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], but their role have not been recorded in case of other in vivo models. Vaccination of mice with multi-epitope DNA vaccine has elicited specific antibody response to two candidate epitopes, S(437–459) and M(1−20) which reduced the virulence of SARS-CoV in-vitro, but there was no report on the protective efficacy [
 <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In another study mice Immunized with N-DNA vaccine induced N-specific antibody response and Tc-cell activity [
 <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], moreover a strong delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and CD8(+) CTL responses to N protein was observed [
 <xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In an another study of N-DNA vaccination, expression of N protein and its linkage to LAMP for better presentation of MHC II has amplified memory response [
 <xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Moreover vaccination of C57BL/6 mice with naked CRT/N DNA for improved MHC class I presentation not only induced N-specific humoral and cellular immunity but also considerably reduced the titer of challenging vaccinia virus against the cells expressing N protein [
 <xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In addition to other animal models, an N-DNA vaccine candidate has also been evaluated in HLA-transgenic mice that induced a specific CD8+ T-cell response [
 <xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Besides the expression of S and N proteins, M protein have also been reported to be expressed in mice and found to induce neutralizing antibodies, human monoclonal antibodies and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response [
 <xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In a comprehensive study of DNA vaccine using different gene fragments (S-, M- and N), M DNA vaccine was reported with the highest cellular immunity in mice [
 <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Although DNA vaccines works efficiently during preclinical stages, but their efficacy in field conditions are quite unsatisfactory and have lower immunogenicity [
 <xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], as compared to other vaccines such as inactivated and live-attenuated virus vaccines and need further improvement regarding the efficacy. To confront this problem different prime–boost approaches such as heterologous prime or boost with proteins, inactivated viral vaccine candidates or viral vectors have been constructed [
