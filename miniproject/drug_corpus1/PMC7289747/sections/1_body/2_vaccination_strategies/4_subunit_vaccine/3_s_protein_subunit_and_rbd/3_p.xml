<p id="p0070">RBD is a segment in the centre of S1 subunit of S protein which is ~193 AA residues and binds to receptors present in the target cells. It has been illustrated that antisera of SARS infected person and that of animals inoculated with inactivated SARS-CoV, effectively responded with RBD [
 <xref rid="bb0325" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0330" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. A lot of the neutralizing antibodies were removed of these antisera by RBD through antibodies absorption, while the antibodies specific to RBD, having effective neutralizing action were obtained from these antisera [
 <xref rid="bb0330" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. It has also been represented that the RBD vaccinated mice and rabbits produces counteracting antibodies in high number against the SARS-CoV having 50% neutralizing titers at a &gt;1:10,000 serum dilution [
 <xref rid="bb0335" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. As compared to S protein of full length, high number of neutralizing antibodies were induced with RBD [
 <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0335" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0340" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] because in contrast to S protein with full length, no immunodominant regions are present in RBD that elicits antibodies that are not neutralizing. To prevent the infection from SARS-CoV, with different genotypes RBD containing recombinant proteins or vectors that encodes RBD could be used. Thus, the generation of antibodies targeting the RBD subunit of SARS-CoV-2 would be an important preventive and treatment strategy that can be tested further in suitable models before clinical trials.
