<p id="p0110">Inactivated virus vaccines also known as the WKV (whole Killed Virus) vaccines represent a pathogen whose ability to infect and replicate has been ceased, consequently making it sterile but retaining its ability to act as an immunogen, so that the immune system could still work if such a pathogen is injected into a host. Inactivated vaccines are prepared by neutralizing the pathogen as a whole by chemicals or by heat and radiation. It is thought that inactivated vaccines can be prepared with much less effort which makes them one of the attractive types of vaccines prepared in the market today. These vaccines work by exposing the same epitopes which a virus otherwise would have presented, thus eliciting an immune response. When sera of the infected person were tested, presence of antibodies against minimum eight different proteins suggests the presence of diverse moieties exposed on the membrane of the pathogen [

In order to search targets for the protective antibodies further investigations has been done and it is found that additional structural proteins that can be targeted are encoded by (Open Reading Frame) ORFs (3a, 6, 7a and 7b), envelope (E), spike (S), and matrix (M) [

 <xref rid="bb0575" ref-type="bibr">[115]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0580" ref-type="bibr">[116]</xref>]. By interpreting these data we can assume that multiple targets are present for the protective antibodies. 3CL, nucleocapsid (N), S, M etc. are the proteins against which the antibodies were induced when a mice was vaccinated with SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="bb0585" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Despite many advantages there are some limitations for the development of inactivated vaccines viz. budding pathogens in bulk (biosafety level 3) and complete sterilization of the grown pathogens. Successful sterilization of SARS-CoV, in bulk has been demonstrated with the help of UV radiations [
 <xref rid="bb0590" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. During the last two decades many investigators have demonstrated that inactivated whole SARS-CoV can induce SARS-CoV neutralizing antibody [

 <xref rid="bb0605" ref-type="bibr">[121]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0610" ref-type="bibr">[122]</xref>] but there have no study been reported against the live SARS-CoV challenge. A study in BALB/c mice, WKV vaccine was observed to provide resistance by ceasing the multiplication of pulmonary SARS-CoV, however immunological responses are yet to be verified [
 <xref rid="bb0615" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. Further, β-propiolactone inactivated WKV SARS-CoV (Tor-2 strain) reported to be a potential vaccine candidate as it induced neutralizing antibodies and was able to minimize the virus load in the pulmonary tract of the mouse model [
 <xref rid="bb0435" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. However, there are less evidences of the mouse models being infected by such a diseases clinically, thus studying models where this strain is more virulent and sustainable is imperative. So WKV has also been tested in ferrets, a model which show significant lung pathology and clinical sign [
 <xref rid="bb0445" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0450" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Formalin inactivated Urbani strain of SARS-CoV did not demonstrated strong immune response [
 <xref rid="bb0620" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>] but β-propiolactone inactivated WKV SARS-CoV induced significant neutralizing antibody and reduced virus replication in respiratory tract of ferrets [
 <xref rid="bb0445" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Rhesus monkeys were also been tested for the formaldehyde inactivated SARS-CoV vaccines and shown to be safe and immunogenic [
 <xref rid="bb0625" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. WKV SARS-CoV has also been tested in humans and found to be safe and elicited SARS-CoV specific neutralizing antibodies, however the efficiency the vaccine in humans yet to be reported [
 <xref rid="bb0630" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. These data suggested that WKV vaccines are safe and they are able to induce SARS-CoV specific neutralizing antibodies so inactivated viral vaccines could also be evaluated as potential vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2.
