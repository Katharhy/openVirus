<p id="p0010">Coronaviruses (CoVs) are the largest group of viruses belonging to family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales [
 <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. They are either pleomorphic or spherical in shape with a diameter of 125 nm [
 <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Further they are characterized by club shaped spike projections on its surface. Transmission of COVID-19 is mainly caused by respiratory droplets, direct human to human contact and fecal to oral transmission might be also associated [
 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. COVID-19 prominently affect the respiratory tract (both lower and upper respiratory tract), with the initial symptoms of common cold, fever, dry cough, fatigue, nasal congestion, sore throat and diarrhea to severe pneumonia, difficulty in breathing and ends with the patient death [
 <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The incubation period of the disease is 14 days and the time from onset of symptom to developing pneumonia is 4 days [
 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The reservoir hosts of the disease are bats and Himalayan palm civets [
 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] but the scientists in Guangzhou have reported coronavirus from Pangolin the ant eating mammal with 99% homology with a receptor binding domain matching to that of SARS-CoV-2. However, this is not confirmed yet [
 <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These are the enveloped viruses that contain, segmented, positive sense, SS-RNA genome of approximately 30 kb which is the largest among all the RNA viruses [
 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The genetic material of CoV is highly prone to frequent recombination process that results into the formation of new strains with altered virulence [
 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. There are four relatively ‘benign’ strains of human coronaviruses (hCoVs) 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 causing mild respiratory flu like seasonal illnesses, however three strains (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) are reported to be extremely pathogenic. It is thought that SARS-CoV-2 might be the next series of the previous two outbreaks (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV) as the CoVs are the emerging viruses, which are highly adapted to the changing environment. Further with its genome closely related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and the accumulated clinical and experimental data on these previous viruses we can precisely predict the possible vaccine candidates to prevent against CoV infection in the future [
 <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Currently there is no specific antiviral drug against SARS-CoV-2, finding a vaccine for this virus therefore remains a high priority [
 <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In this review we aim to discuss about different approaches for developing an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
