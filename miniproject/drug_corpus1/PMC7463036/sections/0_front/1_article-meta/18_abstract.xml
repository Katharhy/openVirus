  <title>Background</title>
  <p>Oseltamivir is a first-line antiviral drug, especially in primary hospitals. During the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), most patients with COVID-19 who are symptomatic have used oseltamivir. Considering its popular and important role as an antiviral drug, it is necessary to evaluate oseltamivir in the treatment of COVID-19.</p>

  <title>Objective</title>
  <p>To evaluate the effect of oseltamivir against COVID-19.</p>

 <sec>
  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>Swiss-model was used to construct the structure of the 
   <italic>N</italic>-terminal RNA-binding domain (NRBD) of the nucleoprotein (NC), papain-like protease (PLpro), and RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRp) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). TM-align program was performed to compare the structure of the viral proteins with the structure of the neuraminidase of influenza A. Molecular docking was used to analyze the theoretical possibility of effective binding of oseltamivir with the active centers of the viral proteins. 
   <italic>In vitro</italic> study was used to evaluate the antiviral efficiency of oseltamivir against SARS-CoV-2. By clinical case analysis, we statistically evaluated whether the history of oseltamivir use influenced the progression of the disease.

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>The structures of NRBD, PLpro, and RdRp were built successfully. The results from TM-align suggested that the S protein, NRBD, 3C-like protease (3CLpro), PLPrO, and RdRp were structurally similar to the influenza A neuraminidase, with TM-scores of 0.30077, 0.19254, 0.28766, 0.30666, and 0.34047, respectively. Interestingly, the active center of 3CL pro was found to be similar to the active center from the neuraminidase of influenza A. Through an analysis of molecular docking, we discovered that oseltamivir carboxylic acid was more favorable to bind to the active site of 3CLpro effectively, but its inhibitory effect was not strong compared with the positive group. Finally, we used 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> study and retrospective case analysis to verify our speculations. We found that oseltamivir is ineffective against SARS-CoV-2 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> study and the clinical use of oseltamivir did not improve the patients’ symptoms and signs and did not slow the disease progression.

  <title>Conclusions</title>
  <p>We consider that oseltamivir isn’t suitable for the treatment of COVID-19. During the outbreak of novel coronavirus, when oseltamivir is not effective for the patients after they take it, health workers should be highly vigilant about the possibility of COVID-19.</p>
