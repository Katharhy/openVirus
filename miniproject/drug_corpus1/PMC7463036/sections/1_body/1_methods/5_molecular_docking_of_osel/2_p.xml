<p id="p0055">We used ChemBioDraw Ultra 17.0 software to draw the structure of the active metabolite oseltamivir carboxylic acid and N3 inhibitor, then converted them into three-dimensional (3D) structure using ChemBio3D Ultra 17.0 software. Then the structures of agents were preprocessing by MMFF94 Force Field. AutoDock Tools 1.5.6 software was used to remove water molecules and ligands in the proteins, and then add hydrogen atoms, combine non-polar hydrogen atoms, add charges. And converted proteins and agents into the format of PDBQT. The GridBox module was used to generate a 3D ensemble around the active site, and the grid points in the ensemble were calculated for energy score evaluation. AutoDock Vina was used for molecular docking 
 <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Exhaustiveness was set at 20 and other parameters were used default value. Finally, we selected the conformation with the highest docking score to analyze the result using Free Maestro 11.9.
