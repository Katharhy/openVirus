<p id="p0065">We retrospectively analyzed 627 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection at the Second Hospital of Wuhan, Wuhan Union Hospital, and Wuhan Union Hospital West Campus, Hubei Province from January 19, 2020, to February 20, 2020, which was approved by the institutional ethics board of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. The enrollment criteria were: 1. patients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and negative for influenza A and B nucleic acid tests; 2. there were no other underlying diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, malignant diseases, no respiratory tract diseases, such as COPD, asthma, and pulmonary heart disease, and no hypoproteinemia and hypokalemia. We defined the period from the start of antiviral therapy to clinical evaluation as a patientsâ€™ treatment period. We defined the patients with relieved symptoms and stable or absorbed lesions in CT during the treatment period as the remission group, and the patients without symptom improvement or no significant changes or progression of the lesions in CT as the non-remission group. They all were evaluated by front-line medical workers of union hospital based on Guidelines of the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (version 7) of National Health Commission of China. Whether the history of oseltamivir use influenced the progression of the disease was statistically evaluated.</p>
