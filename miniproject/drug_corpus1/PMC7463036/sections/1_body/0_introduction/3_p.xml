<p id="p0030">SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Î²-genus of the coronavirus family and is the seventh coronavirus found to infect humans. Therefore, it has the structural features of coronaviruses, such as structural proteins, including S protein and Nucleoprotein (NC), and also non-structural proteins, including the main key enzymes 3C-like protease (3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro), and RNA-directed RNA polymerase (Pol/RdRp). These main structural proteins and key enzymes of SARS-CoV-2 are important targets for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection
