<p id="p0025">As a neuraminidase inhibitor, oseltamivir was approved by the Food and Drug Admission (FDA) in 1999 
 <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Since then, it has played an essential role in treating against influenza A and influenza B and is becoming more widespread. The atypical pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that broke out in Guangzhou, China, in 2003, linked oseltamivir to coronavirus. Zhang et al. found that the active site of the Spike (S) 1 Protein of SARS is similar to that of neuraminidase, suggesting that neuraminidase inhibitors may be useful to treat SARS-CoV 
 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. However, despite this similarity, no clinical data suggest that oseltamivir is effective in treating SARS-CoV. With the epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2, oseltamivir has once again become a hot topic. A study from Thailand reported that a 71-year-old patient with severe COVID-19 on January 29, 2020 underwent a 48h treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir combined with oseltamivir, which improved the patientâ€™s condition, and the throat swab test became negative 
 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Although a single case report does not prove the effectiveness of oseltamivir for COVID-19, it once again linked oseltamivir to the treatment of a coronavirus-induced disease. As frontline healthcare workers fighting against COVID-19, we were interested in the treatment regimen of this case and found most patients with COVID-19 who were symptomatic have used oseltamivir. We believed that it is of practical significance to further study the effect of oseltamivir on COVID-19. Because of its significant effectiveness on influenza and being sold over the counter, oseltamivir is not only stocked in common households but also a common antiviral drug in primary hospitals. Therefore, if oseltamivir is effective for COVID-19, the treatment could be family-oriented. If, instead, the treatment effectiveness is not significant, the use of oseltamivir should be stopped, which will avoid delaying other treatments and multiple oseltamivir adverse reactions, such as nausea, vomiting, epilepsy, elevated liver enzymes, and arrhythmias 
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Therefore, the study of the antiviral effect of oseltamivir against SARS-CoV-2 could have a positive effect on the treatment of COVID-19.
