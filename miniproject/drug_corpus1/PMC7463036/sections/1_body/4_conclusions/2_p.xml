<p id="p0125">In summary, we consider that oseltamivir isnâ€™t suitable for the treatment of COVID-19. During the outbreak of novel coronavirus, when oseltamivir is not effective for the patients after they take it, health workers should be highly vigilant about the possibility of COVID-19. At the same time, it should be noted that we are still in the influenza season, and we have also found five cases of influenza A in combined with COVID-19. Therefore, oseltamivir should be combined in the treatment regimen in a timely manner when influenza occurs.</p>
