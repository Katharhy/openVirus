<p id="p0110">In this article, we constructed protein models of NRBD, PLpro, and Pol/RdRp of SARS-CoV-2. We used structural alignment to find that the active center of 3CLpro was similar to that of influenza A neuraminidase. Subsequently, we used a molecular docking method to explore whether oseltamivir could effectively bind to the NRBD, 3CLPro, PLpro, and Pol/RdRp of SARS-CoV-2. It was found that oseltamivir carboxylic acid was more favorable to bind to the active site of 3CLpro effectively, but its inhibitory effects was not strong compared with the positive group. Finally, we used
