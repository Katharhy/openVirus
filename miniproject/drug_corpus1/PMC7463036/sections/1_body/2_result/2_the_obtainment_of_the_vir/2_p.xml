<p id="p0080">The structures of the S protein (PDB ID: 6VSB) and 3CL pro (PDB ID: 6LU7) of SARS-CoV-2 were obtained from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (

Then the structures of NC, PLpro, and Pol/RdRp were built through the method of homology modeling. The models were constructed successfully and shown in 
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A–C. Among them, the NC of SARS-CoV-2 contains 419 amino acid residues. The search of a homology template using the Swissmodel found that the 35–174 residues of NC have an identity of 92.37% with the NRBD of NC from SARS-CoV(PDB ID: 1ssk), which is the active region for the binding of NC of SARS-CoV with RNA. Inhibiting NRBD activity can affect coronavirus RNA transcription and replication, and virion assembly 
 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Thus, it is one of the targets for inhibiting coronaviruses. Therefore, NRBD is the main activity center of NC, and this model can be used for the active site of NC from SARS-CoV-2 for further research.
