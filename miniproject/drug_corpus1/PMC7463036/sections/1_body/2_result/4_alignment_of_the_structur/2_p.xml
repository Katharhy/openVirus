<p id="p0090">To explore whether oseltamivir is effective for SARS-CoV-2, we first analyzed whether there was structural similarity between the structure of viral protein and influenza A neuraminidase (PDB ID: 3Ti6), especially whether there was a similarity in the active center. TM-align program (

 <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The alignment of the structure of influenza B neuraminidase (PDB ID: 4CPY) with 3Ti6 was selected as a positive control. TM-score was used to analyze the structural similarity. The active site of influenza A and B neuraminidase were determined based on the location of ligand in crystal structure (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A) 
 <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. By comparing 4CPY with 3Ti6, the TM-score of the two was found to be 0.94460, which proved that the two were structurally homologous. Subsequently, we aligned the structures of S protein, NRBD, 3CL pro, PLpro, and Pol/RdRp with 3Ti6; the TM-scores were 0.30077, 0.19254, 0.28766, 0.30666, and 0.34047, respectively (
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> ). The results suggested that there was only a structural similarity between the protein structure of the above SARS-CoV-2 and 3Ti6. The active center of the S protein was mainly the RBD domain (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B green region) and S2 subunit heptad-repeat 1 domain (HR1) (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B blue region), which were also two important targets for studying the inhibition of S protein 
 <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. We found that the similar structure of 3Ti6 and S protein is located in the 
 <italic>N</italic>-terminal domain (NTD) region of S protein. As the active center of NC, we found that NRBD did not match the active center of 3Ti6 (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C). The active center of 3CLpro was determined based on that it is homologous to the 3CLpro from SARS-CoV. Previous studies have confirmed the active center of 3CLpro of SARS-CoV. Thus, this region was used as the active center of 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2 
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. By alignment, we found that the active centers of the two proteins were similar (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D). Subsequently, we also determined the active center of the PLpro and Pol/RdRp based on the homology of the proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and those of SARS-CoV. And we found that the active center of PLpro did not match the active center from 3Ti6 through the alignment of structure (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>E) 
 <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In studies focused on the Pol/RdRp of SARS-CoV, it has found that Thr680, Asn691, and Asp623 can bind nucleotides and promote viral gene transcription, and Val557 also plays an important role in the replication of the virus 
 <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Thus, the region where the above residues are located was determined as the active center of SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>F). It was found that the similar structure between Pol/RdRp and neuraminidase was not located in the active center. The above results suggested that there was a theoretical possibility of effective binding of oseltamivir with the active center of 3CLpro because it was found to be similar to the active center from the neuraminidase.
