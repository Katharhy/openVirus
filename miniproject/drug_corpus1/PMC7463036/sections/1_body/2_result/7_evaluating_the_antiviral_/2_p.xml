<p id="p0105">To further verify the efficacy of oseltamivir on SARS-CoV-2, we retrospectively analyzed a total of 627 patients from the Second Hospital of Wuhan, Wuhan Union Hospital, and Wuhan Union Hospital West Campus, Hubei Province. Finally, 79 patients were included for analysis. Among them, there were 31 patients in remission group, aged 50.68 ± 14.912. There were 48 non-remission patients, and their age was 50.33 ± 15.099. There was no significant difference in age between the two groups (P = 0.921). In the remission group, there were 12 males (with a proportion of 38.71%), and in the non-remission group there were 25 males (52.10%); there was no statistical difference in sex between the two groups (P = 0.261). We analyzed the use of oseltamivir in the two groups. In the remission group, a total of seven patients used oseltamivir with a proportion of 22.58%. In the non-remission group, a total of 35 patients used oseltamivir, with a proportion of 72.92%. The chi-square value was 19.166, and there was a significant statistical difference between the two groups. The number of patients receiving oseltamivir in the non-remission group was significantly higher than the number in the remission group (P &lt; 0.001) (

To compare the difference of response rate at different course of using oseltamivir, we divided the patients who had history of time of taking oseltamivir being recorded into groups according to the course of using oseltamivir: group A: 75 mg Bis In Die (bid, twice daily) 1–3 days; group B: 75 mg bid 3–5 days; group C:75 mg bid 5-7days. We found that the response rate of three group were 0%, 31%, 29%, respectively. (P = 0.405) (
 <xref rid="t0025" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> ), suggesting that in term of standard quantity of influenza (75 mg bid), the course of using oseltamivir didn’t seem to improve the response rate. We next compared the difference of hospitalization days between the oseltamivir group and the Non-use oseltamivir group. The mean hospital stay for oseltamivir group was 9 days, and the days of Non-use oseltamivir group were 12. There was no statistical difference in hospitalization days between the two groups (P = 0.506) (
