<p id="Par14">The ability of CD137 signaling to evoke robust αβ-T cell effector responses has been extensively demonstrated in infectious disease models. However, the role of CD137 signaling in Vγ9Vδ2-T cells remains poorly understood in the context of influenza virus infection. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that CD137 ligation enhances Vγ9Vδ2-T cell proliferation, survival and antiviral activity against influenza virus. The CD137
 <sup>+</sup> Vγ9Vδ2-T cell population exhibited an enhanced capability to treat influenza when employed as an adoptive γδ-T cell therapy. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a tetrameric form of a recombinant human CD137L protein, SA-hCD137L, could boost the effect of PAM therapy on influenza by costimulating Vγ9Vδ2-T cells. Our study provides a relatively effective strategy to treat influenza virus by targeting CD137 to improve the antiviral activity of human Vγ9Vδ2-T cells.
