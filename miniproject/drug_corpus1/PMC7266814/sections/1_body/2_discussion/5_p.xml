<p id="Par18">The expression of CD137 correlates well with effective antiviral immune responses; however, anti-CD137 agonistic antibodies can induce a variety of pathologies that may limit their utility in patients.

 </sup> An alternative approach to the application of CD137-specific antibodies lies in the use of the natural CD137 ligand to stimulate antitumor T cell responses. Work from the Shirwan lab has elegantly demonstrated the therapeutic ability of a streptavidin-conjugated murine CD137L (SA-mCD137L) complex to induce effective antitumor immune responses.

 </sup> SA-mCD137L induces less lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly than antibody therapy, suggesting that SA-mCD137L has a higher therapeutic index. Here, we generated streptavidin-conjugated human CD137L protein and demonstrated that recombinant SA-hCD137L could promote the cytolytic effector function of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells against influenza-infected MDMs by promoting the release of cytolytic granules (containing perforin and granzyme B) and an antiviral cytokine (IFN-γ) from Vγ9Vδ2-T cells, suggesting that SA-hCD137L offers a compelling alternative to anti-CD137 agonistic antibody-mediated stimulation for influenza immunotherapy.
