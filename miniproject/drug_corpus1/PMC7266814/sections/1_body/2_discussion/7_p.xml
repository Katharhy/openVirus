<p id="Par20">Adoptive transfer requires the expansion and activation of autologous Vγ9Vδ2-T cells ex vivo and their reinfusion into patients; this approach is becoming a popular cellular immunotherapy paradigm for patients with infectious disease or cancer. The potential to expand Vγ9Vδ2-T cells in vivo using phosphoantigens such as PAM offers a comparatively cheaper and straightforward delivery alternative. However, repeated stimulation of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells by phosphoantigens often leads to Vγ9Vδ2-T cell exhaustion.

 </sup> An effort to avoid this exhaustion was recently made by another research group, who provided vitamin C during the ex vivo expansion of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells.

 </sup> Here, we further demonstrated that activation of the CD137/CD137L pathway could maintain the survival of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells. The strategy of targeting CD137 costimulation may provide a new solution to avoid Vγ9Vδ2-T cell exhaustion and improve γδ-T cell-based immunotherapy.
