<p id="Par21">This study improves our understanding of the role of CD137 in the antiviral activity of human γδ-T cells. It also provides proof-of-concept data for a novel strategy for treating influenza virus infection by targeting CD137 to improve the antiviral activity of human γδ-T cells and increase the efficacy of γδ-T cell-based immunotherapy by using the combination of a phosphoantigen and CD137 agonist.</p>
