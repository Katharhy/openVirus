 <sup>+</sup> Vγ9Vδ2-T cells, CD137
 <sup>−</sup> Vγ9Vδ2-T cells or whole Vγ9Vδ2-T cells (effector cells, E) were cocultured with PR8-infected MDMs (target cells, T) at an E/T ratio of 10:1 for 6 h. In some experiments, neutralizing antibodies against CD137 (5 μg/ml, BBK-2, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used to block CD137-mediated pathways, SA-hCD137L (500 ng/ml) was used to activate CD137-mediated pathways, or mouse IgG1 (5 μg/ml, MG1-45, BioLegend) or PBS was used as a control. Afterward, nonadherent cells were harvested directly. Adherent cells were detached with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA. All adherent and nonadherent cells were stained with an anti-CD3 antibody to identify Vγ9Vδ2-T cells and ethidium homodimer-2 (EthD-2; Gibco-Life Technologies) to identify dead cells. The cytotoxicity of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells against virus-infected MDMs was assessed by flow cytometry as the percentage of EthD-2
