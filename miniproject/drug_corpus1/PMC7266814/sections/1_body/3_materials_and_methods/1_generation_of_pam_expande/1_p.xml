 </sup> Briefly, huPBMC were isolated from the buffy coats of healthy donor samples from the Hong Kong Red Cross by Ficoll-Hypaque (Pharmacia, Sweden) gradient centrifugation. The huPBMC were cultured in 10% FBS RPMI-1640 medium with the addition of PAM on day 0 and day 3 at a final concentration of 9 µg/ml. Recombinant human IL-2 (Invitrogen, USA) was added at a final concentration of 500 IU/ml every 3 days beginning on day 3. After 14 days of culture, Vγ9Vδ2-T cells were purified by negative or positive selection with a γδ-T cell isolation kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany). Human MDMs were generated from mononuclear cells as previously described.

 </sup> In brief, adherent monocytes were seeded in 24-well plates at 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 5% autologous serum. Then, they were allowed to differentiate into macrophages for 14 d. The purity of the monocytes, as determined by flow cytometry with an anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody, was consistently &gt;90%.
