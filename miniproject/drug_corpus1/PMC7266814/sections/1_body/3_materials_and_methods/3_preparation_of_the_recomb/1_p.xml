<p id="Par24">The DNA sequence encoding core streptavidin (SA; amino acid residues 16-133) and the extracellular domain of human CD137L (amino acid residues 58-254) with an N-terminal 6×His tag was synthesized by Shanghai Sangon Biological Engineering Technology &amp; Services Company Ltd. The DNA fragments were inserted into the pETH expression vector, and the recombinant SA-hCD137L protein was expressed in the 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BL21 (DE3) as an inclusion body after induction at 37 °C for 4 h with 0.3 mM IPTG. The inclusion bodies were washed and solubilized with 8 M urea in a TBS solution. After filtering through a 0.45-μm membrane filter, the protein was purified with Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography (QIAGEN, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified protein was refolded by dialysis, which gradually removed the urea. Bacterial endotoxin contaminants were removed by using DetoxiGel Endotoxin Removing Gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The prepared recombinant SA-hCD137L protein was then filtered through a 0.2-μm membrane and quantitatively measured with the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, USA).
