<p id="Par25">A mouse-adapted influenza H1N1 (A/PR/8/34) virus was cultured in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, as described previously.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup> Viral titers were determined by daily observation of the cytopathic effect on cells infected with serial dilutions of virus stock; the median tissue culture infective dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated according to the Reed-Muench formula. For in vitro experiments, day 14-differentiated MDMs were infected with influenza virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2. After 1 h of viral absorption, the cells were washed with PBS to remove unabsorbed virus. Humanized mice were generated with 4- to 5-week-old male or female Rag2
 <sup>−/−</sup> γc
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice by reconstitution with whole huPBMC or Vγ9Vδ2-T cell-depleted huPBMC as we described previously.

 </sup> Four weeks after huPBMC transplantation, mice were successfully engrafted and became stable with a functional human immune system. Established humanized mice or 6- to 8-week-old Rag2
 <sup>−/−</sup> γc
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice were infected intranasally (i.n.) with the PR8 virus strain (25 µl, 10
 <sup>4</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) under anesthesia. For Rag2
 <sup>−/−</sup> γc
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice, CD137
 <sup>+</sup> Vγ9Vδ2-T cells, CD137
 <sup>−</sup> Vγ9Vδ2-T cells or whole Vγ9Vδ2-T cells (5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>/mouse) in 200 µl of PBS were adoptively transferred intravenously (i.v.) after infection with PR8 at the indicated time. For humanized mice, SA-hCD137L (15 µg/mouse) and PAM (5 mg/kg body weight; Pamisol; Hospira NZ) were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) at the indicated time. Mice treated with an equivalent volume of PBS were used as controls. Survival was monitored, and the infected mice were weighed daily. The lungs were collected at the indicated time for viral titer and histology assays.
