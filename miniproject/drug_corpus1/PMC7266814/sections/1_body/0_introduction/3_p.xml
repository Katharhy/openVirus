 </sup> The interaction of CD137 with its major ligand, CD137L, has been shown to result in the survival, expansion, and differentiation of αβ-T cells, particularly CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, into effectors and the establishment of long-term memory.

 </sup> Agonistic anti-CD137 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been shown to enhance the efficacy of vaccines against influenza virus and poxvirus by enhancing CD8
 <sup>+</sup> or CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses.
