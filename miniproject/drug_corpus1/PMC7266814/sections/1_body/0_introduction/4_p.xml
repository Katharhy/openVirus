<p id="Par5">In this study, we demonstrated critical roles for CD137-CD137L interactions in the proliferation, survival and effector functions of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells in response to influenza virus infection in vitro and in vivo. Using a recombinant human SA-hCD137L protein containing the extracellular domains of human CD137L (hCD137L) fused to a core streptavidin (SA) molecule, we demonstrated that SA-hCD137L is an efficient adjuvant for PAM therapy for influenza virus infection that functions by improving the antiviral activity of human Vγ9Vδ2-T cells in humanized mice. Our study suggests the novel strategy of targeting CD137 to improve the antiviral activity of human Vγ9Vδ2-T cells.</p>
