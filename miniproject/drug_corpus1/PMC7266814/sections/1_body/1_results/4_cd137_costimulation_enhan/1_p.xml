<p id="Par10">We have shown that CD137
 <sup>+</sup> Vγ9Vδ2-T cells display more potent antiviral activity than their CD137
 <sup>−</sup> counterparts in vitro and in vivo. To determine whether CD137 costimulation is involved in the antiviral activity of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells, a recombinant SA-hCD137L protein containing the extracellular domains of human CD137L (hCD137L) fused to a core streptavidin (SA) molecule was generated. The addition of the recombinant SA-hCD137L protein to a coculture of whole Vγ9Vδ2-T cells with influenza virus-infected MDMs significantly enhanced the expression of CD107a, cytolytic granule molecules (perforin and granzyme B) and an antiviral cytokine (IFN-γ) in the Vγ9Vδ2-T cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). In contrast, there were no significant changes in the expression of CD25, CD69, FasL and TRAIL after treatment with the recombinant SA-hCD137L protein (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Similar to that induced by costimulation with an anti-CD137 agonistic mAb, the increased expression of CD107a induced by costimulation with SA-hCD137L was completely abrogated when CD137/CD137L signaling was blocked with an anti-CD137 antagonistic mAb (Supplemental Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). These data confirmed that the SA-CD137L protein could specifically activate the CD137/CD137L pathway. Importantly, the recombinant protein significantly increased the cytotoxicity of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells against influenza virus-infected MDMs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). These data demonstrated that CD137 engagement was important for the antiviral activity of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells.
