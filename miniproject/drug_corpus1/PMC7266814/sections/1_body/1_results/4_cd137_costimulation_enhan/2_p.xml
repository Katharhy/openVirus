<p id="Par11">To further confirm the costimulatory role of CD137 in the antiviral activity of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells against influenza virus, an anti-CD137 neutralizing mAb was used to block CD137 signaling when Vγ9Vδ2-T cells were cocultured with virus-infected MDMs. The blockade of CD137 signaling significantly decreased the expression of CD107a, cytolytic granule molecules (perforin and granzyme B) and an antiviral cytokine (IFN-γ) in the Vγ9Vδ2-T cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). In contrast, there were no significant changes in the expressions of CD25, CD69, TRAIL and FasL after treatment with the anti-CD137 neutralizing mAb (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Moreover, compared with PBS or mIgG1 treatment, blocking CD137 significantly abrogated the cytolytic activity of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells against H1N1-infected MDMs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrated that CD137 costimulation could enhance the antiviral activity of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells against influenza virus.
