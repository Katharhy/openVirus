<p id="Par8">To further compare the antiviral activities of CD137
 <sup>+</sup> and CD137
 <sup>−</sup> Vγ9Vδ2-T cells, we sorted these two subsets and detected their cytotoxic activity against influenza virus-infected MDMs. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, both CD137
 <sup>+</sup> and CD137
 <sup>−</sup> Vγ9Vδ2-T cells could efficiently kill virus-infected cells, but the CD137
 <sup>+</sup> Vγ9Vδ2-T cells displayed superior cytotoxic activity toward virus-infected cells. These data demonstrated that CD137 expressed on Vγ9Vδ2-T cells could be a useful marker for identifying the γδ-T cell subset with superior activation and antiviral activity.
