<p id="Par7">We further compared the phenotype and function of CD137
 <sup>+</sup> and CD137
 <sup>-</sup> Vγ9Vδ2-T cells during coculture with influenza virus-infected MDMs. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, CD137
 <sup>+</sup> Vγ9Vδ2-T cells expressed higher levels of activation markers (CD25, CD69 and NKG2D) and cell death-related receptor ligands (Fas, FasL and TRAIL) than their CD137
 <sup>-</sup> counterparts. Importantly, the expression of CD107a, a marker associated with the degranulation of NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs),
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
 </sup> was significantly higher in CD137
 <sup>+</sup> Vγ9Vδ2-T cells than CD137
 <sup>-</sup> Vγ9Vδ2-T cells after coculture with influenza virus-infected MDMs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), which suggested that influenza virus-infected MDMs triggered more intensive granule release from CD137
 <sup>+</sup> Vγ9Vδ2-T cells than from their CD137
 <sup>-</sup> counterparts. Furthermore, CD137
 <sup>+</sup> Vγ9Vδ2-T expressed dramatically more cytolytic granule molecules (perforin and granzyme B) and antiviral cytokines (IFN-γ) than their CD137
 <sup>−</sup> counterparts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). These data indicated that CD137
 <sup>+</sup> Vγ9Vδ2-T cells had a superior activation status and should have much higher antiviral activities than CD137
 <sup>-</sup> Vγ9Vδ2-T cells.
