 </sup> were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with the recombinant SA-hCD137L protein and PAM 3 days after influenza virus infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). During the 20 days of the experimental period, compared with PAM alone, the SA-hCD137L protein in combination with PAM significantly decreased the weight loss and prolonged the survival of the virus-infected whole-huPBMC humanized mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b, c</xref>). Furthermore, reduced pathological severity and decreased viral loads in the lungs were observed in virus-infected whole-huPBMC humanized mice treated with SA-hCD137L and PAM compared with mice treated with PAM alone on day 10 postinfection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d, e</xref>). To determine whether the effect of SA-hCD137L costimulation on the control of influenza virus infection in humanized mice was mediated by Vγ9Vδ2-T cells, humanized mice reconstituted with Vγ9Vδ2-T-cell-depleted huPBMC were also included (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, there were no therapeutic improvements achieved by administering SA-hCD137L to virus-infected humanized mice without Vγ9Vδ2-T cells. These data demonstrated that the recombinant SA-hCD137L protein had a synergistic effect with PAM to control influenza disease in vivo and that their antiviral activity against influenza virus was mainly mediated by Vγ9Vδ2-T cells.
