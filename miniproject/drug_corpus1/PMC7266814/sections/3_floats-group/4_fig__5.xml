  <p>CD137 costimulation promoted the proliferation and prolonged the survival of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells. 
   <bold>a</bold>–
   <bold>c</bold> Vγ9Vδ2-T cells were expanded from huPBMC with PAM/IL-2 for 7 days in the presence of anti-CD137 neutralizing antibody (αCD137), mouse IgG1 (mIgG1) or PBS. The percentage (
   <bold>a</bold>, 
   <bold>b</bold>) and absolute cell number (
   <bold>c</bold>) of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells were detected by flow cytometry. 
   <bold>d</bold>, 
   <bold>e</bold> Vγ9Vδ2-T cells were expanded from CFSE-labeled huPBMC with PAM/IL-2 for 7 days. 
   <bold>d</bold> Representative histograms show the proliferation of CFSE-labeled Vγ9Vδ2-T cells. 
   <bold>e</bold> The proliferation index was calculated with FlowJo software and is presented in bar graphs. The proliferation index is the total number of divisions divided by the number of cells that underwent division. 
   <bold>f</bold> Human Vγ9Vδ2-T cells were isolated from huPBMC by positive selection and cultured with the SA-hCD137L protein (500ng/ml) or human IL-2 (50 IU/ml) in the presence of PAM (9µg/ml) for 5 days. Fold changes in the Vδ2
   <sup>+</sup> cell number in the indicated groups compared to that in the IL-2 group were calculated by flow cytometry with counting beads. 
   <bold>g</bold>–
   <bold>i</bold> PAM-expanded Vγ9Vδ2-T cells were purified and activated with an anti-γδ-TCR antibody (0.5µg/ml) for 24h in the presence of PBS, mIgG1 or an αCD137 antibody. Apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry with Annexin V (AV) and PI staining. The data shown in the bar graphs are the mean ± SEM. **
