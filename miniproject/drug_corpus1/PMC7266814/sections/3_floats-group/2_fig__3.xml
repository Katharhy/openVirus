   <sup>−/−</sup> mice. Rag2
   <sup>−/−</sup> γc
   <sup>−/−</sup> mice were infected with a sublethal dose of influenza virus (25μl, 10
   <sup>4</sup> TCID50) intranasally (i.n.) on day 0. Highly purified CD137

   <sup>−</sup> or whole Vγ9Vδ2-T cells (5×10
   <sup>6</sup> cells/mouse) or the same volume of PBS was adoptively transferred intravenously (i.v.) into virus-infected mice at the indicated time.

   <bold>c</bold> The body weight changes (
   <bold>b</bold>) and survival (
   <bold>c</bold>) of virus-infected mice were measured at the indicated time.

   <bold>e</bold> Lung tissues from infected mice were collected on day 8 post infection for histological analysis and viral load testing. Histological sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (
   <bold>d</bold>). Bars, 100 μm; the number of viral RNA copies in the lungs (
   <bold>e</bold>) was determined by RT-PCR. Error bars indicate the mean ± SEM. *
