  <p>CD137 costimulation improved the therapeutic effect of PAM on influenza virus infection in vivo. 
   <bold>a</bold> Protocol for evaluation of the synergistic therapeutic effect of PAM and SA-hCD137L on influenza virus-infected humanized mice. Humanized mice reconstituted with whole huPBMC (PBMC) or Vγ9Vδ2-T cell-depleted huPBMC (PBMC-γδT) were infected with a sublethal dose of influenza virus (25μl, 10
   <sup>4</sup> TCID50) intranasally (
   <italic>i.n.)</italic>, and then treated with PAM/SA-CD137 or PAM/PBS on days 3, 5, 7 and 9 post infection. 
   <bold>b</bold>, 
   <bold>c</bold> The body weight changes (
   <bold>b</bold>) and survival (
   <bold>c</bold>) of influenza virus-infected humanized mice were measured at the indicated time after infection. 
   <bold>d</bold>, 
   <bold>e</bold> Lung tissues from infected mice were collected on day 10 post infection for histological analysis and viral load testing. Histological sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and representative histopathological changes are shown (
   <bold>d</bold>). Bars, 100 μm; the number of viral RNA copies in the lungs (
   <bold>e</bold>) was determined by RT-PCR. Error bars indicate the mean ± SEM. *
