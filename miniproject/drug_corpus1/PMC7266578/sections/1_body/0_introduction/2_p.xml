<p id="p0020">A third wave of coronavirus (CoV) infections has swept the world and brought it to its knees. This new CoV infection called as COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019 [

 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Previous epidemics of coronavirus include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which originated in China in 2002 [

 <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The disease spread rapidly from the initial epicenter, Wuhan to rest of the world and has become a pandemic. A total number of 53,07,298 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed as of 25 May 2020 and more than 342,000 cases of deaths have been reported worldwide [
 <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The main risk factors include pneumonia, acute kidney failure, acute heart failure. The global COVID-19 outbreak has placed devastating impact on every community. People with underlying health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease and the elderly above 60 years are most susceptible to COVID-19. There is currently no treatment available although vaccine development is under progress. This has led many researchers and clinicians to look for alternate or drug repurposing strategies that can lower the number of active COVID-19 cases and lead to subsequent reduction in the mortality rate.
