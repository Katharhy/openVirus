<p id="Par16">In Tanzania, IDU has been reported since the 1990s [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Recognizing the scale of PWID, primarily the use of heroin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and high prevalence of HIV infection among them [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], a special outreach program was established inÂ 2007, that offers a variety of preventive and supportive services including; education and communication materials, psychosocial support services and family group therapy meetings [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, it is unclear as to whether these interventions, among several others taken by different stakeholders, have had an effect on the prevalence of the major blood-borne viral infections of public health importance. We conducted this study to provide the current status of seroprevalence of HIV, HBV and HCV infections among PWID in Dar es Salaam, recruited from their hotspot sites.
