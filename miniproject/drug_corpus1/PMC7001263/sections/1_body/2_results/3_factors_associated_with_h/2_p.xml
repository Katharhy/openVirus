<p id="Par26">Multivariable logistic regression model was performed to measure the adjusted relationship between independent variables and occurrence of HIV, HCV, and HBV. Marital status was the only factor independently associated with HIV infection (AOR 2.04, 95%CI -1.10 – 3.79), while HCV infection was associated with drug usage for more than 3 years (AOR; 2.04, 95% CI – 1.11- 3.74). PWID who used condom regularly decreased odds of getting HCV infection (AOR = 0.42, 95% CI – 0.22 – 0.79) (Table
