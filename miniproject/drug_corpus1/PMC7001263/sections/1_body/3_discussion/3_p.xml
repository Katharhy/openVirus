<p id="Par30">The association between condom use and HCV infection is interesting with the fact that HCV is not typically sexually transmitted. Previous studies have provided evidence that sexual transmission of HCV within low-risk heterosexual partnerships occurs at most with very low frequency [

However, in a population where there is a large pool of HCV infected persons like what our study found and sexual intercourse is common, even a low rate of sexual transmission can account for a large number of new cases. This may explain the decreased odds of HCV infection among those reported regular use of condom.
