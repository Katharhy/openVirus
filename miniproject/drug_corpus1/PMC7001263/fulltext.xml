It is uncertain whether this decline has also occurred among people who inject drugs (PWID). This study aimed to determine the seroprevalence of HIV, Hepatitis B and C viruses infection among PWID recruited from their hotspot sites in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A cross-sectional study conducted between June and September 2017 recruited PWID from pre-identified hotspot sites using a snowball referral sampling technique. A structured questionnaire was used to obtain information regarding socio-demographic characteristics, behaviour and drug use. Blood was tested for the presence of IgG antibodies against HIV and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Data were entered in the computer using excel software and analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 20.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">A total of 219 PWID were recruited, the majority of whom were males (74.9%), unmarried (60.7%), had low education (62.6%) and low income (57.1%). The median age was 39&#x02009;years, with an inter-quartile range of 35&#x02013;43. Approximately 32.0% had a history of drug injection for more than 3&#x02009;years, 79.9% were injecting drugs more than 3 times per day and 47.5% were sharing needles. The overall prevalence of HIV, HBsAg, and HCV was 33.8, 7.8, and 50.2%, respectively. There was serologic evidence of at least one infection for 68.9%, while 22.4% had two or more infections. HIV infection was independently associated with being married, while HCV was associated with injecting drugs for more than 3&#x02009;years and unprotected sex.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Over two-third of PWID had serologic evidence of infection with at least one virus while 22.4% having at least two infections.

However, it is unclear as to whether these interventions, among several others taken by different stakeholders, have had an effect on the prevalence of the major blood-borne viral infections of public health importance.

The sample size was estimated to be 155 using Kish Leslie formula, and considering an 11&#x02219;3% prevalence of HIV among PWID in Zanzibar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and a 5% margin of error.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recruitment and data collection</title><p id="Par19">Participants were recruited following snowball chain referral sampling. First, we identified 30 PWID attending Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) Methadone Clinic, who were requested to link researchers to PWID at hotspot sites. The selection of initial participants and their respective sites was based on information provided by 30 contacts at MNH methadone. At the hotspot site, the research assistant first introduced the study and those consented to join were recruited after signing a written consent. After completion of the interview and specimen collection, each participant was asked to refer other PWID to the study, continuously until the predetermined sample size was reached.

Categorical variables were summarized as proportions while continuous variables were summarized as median with inter-quartile range. The seroprevalence of HIV, HCV, and HBsAg among PWID was expressed in percentages and comparisons between the groups were done using Chi-Square. Low income was defined as earning less or equal to 45 US dollars per month. Binary simple logistic regression was first performed, followed by a multivariable logistic regression model to determine factors independently associated with HIV, HBV or HCV infection. All variables with <italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c;&#x02009;0.2 in simple binary regression were included in the multivariable model. Associations in the multivariable logistic model were presented as adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Interactions between independent variables were examined, and the Wald test was used to test the associations of the variables and interactions. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test was used to examine the overall fitness of the model. The level of significance was specified at 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Participants&#x02019; characteristics</title><p id="Par23">The study recruited a total of 219 PWID.

About one-third of the participants were HIV positive, half had evidence of HCV infection and 8% HBV infection. These findings are higher in comparison with latest systematic review of studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa, showing estimates of 21.8% for HCV, 18.3% for HIV and 3.7% for HBV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Our findings are also higher compared with the previous report from Tanzania [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], possibly indicating an increase of infection with these three viruses among PWID. The rate of infections with these three viruses has shown a steady rise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The findings indicate that PWID is a key population that needs urgent attention as a strategy to achieve control of HIV and viral hepatitis infections.</p><p id="Par29">Alarmingly none of our study participants knew their status of infection with any of the three viruses before enrolment, which may indicate limited access to testing services. The higher prevalence of the three viruses among PWID compared to previous studies could be attributed, at least in part, due to a number of factors such low access to testing services and therefore not being able to access care and treatment services, multiple sexual partners and high frequency of partner change with low condom usage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Indeed, regular condom use was associated with a 60% decreased odds of having HCV infection among those reported regular use of condom.</p><p id="Par30">The association between condom use and HCV infection is interesting with the fact that HCV is not typically sexually transmitted. Previous studies have provided evidence that sexual transmission of HCV within low-risk heterosexual partnerships occurs at most with very low frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, in a population where there is a large pool of HCV infected persons like what our study found and sexual intercourse is common, even a low rate of sexual transmission can account for a large number of new cases. This may explain the decreased odds of HCV infection among those reported regular use of condom.</p><p id="Par31">In the univariate analysis model, consistent condoms use showed a negative association with HIV infection, while marriage showed a positive association. However, in multivariable analysis condom use was not independently associated with HIV status. There was no&#x000a0;evidence from the analysis to explain the absence of association of condom use and HIV infection in the adjusted analysis. The assumption that marriage could have an effect on the use of condom was not supported by the multivariable logistic regression model which included interaction term of marital status and condom use. Conversely, other previous studies have shown low condom usage among married couples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">Our findings seem to indicate significant challenges in dealing with PWID that have certainly limited the impact of the initiatives undertaken by the Tanzania AIDS control program, including the outreach services. We recommend targeting PWID in their hideouts given illegality and stigma associated with drug use. The emphasis should be on social and psychological support, aiming at reducing high-risk behaviour, as well as increased access to HIV and viral hepatitis testing services and enrolment to antiretroviral and methadone schemes, which have shown clear benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. We did not observe a significant relationship between monthly income and needle sharing practice, supporting findings of previous studies conducted in Tanzania [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and disputing a common belief in the society that shared injection for drug use is due to financial constraints.</p><p id="Par33">Our study may have several limitations. We acknowledge that reliance on self-reported information and dependency on the willingness of PWID to participate may have introduced selection and information biases and clustering of events and failure to recall. Reporting error may have occurred for some measures such as the frequency of injection and condom since this was based on participants&#x02019; ability to recall events in the last 6&#x02009;months. HBV vaccination status was not evaluated and therefore the risk of acquiring HBV infection cannot be determined. Finally, the snowball sampling approach employed in this study may have resulted in a biased sample that cannot be corrected by weighting schemes, limiting inferences of our findings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par34">The high prevalence of HIV, HBV, and HCV infections among PWID may hamper efforts to control these viruses in Tanzania. PWID should be actively screened at hotspots and linked to friendlier and more tailored care and treatment services for HIV, HBV, and HCV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec15"><p>
