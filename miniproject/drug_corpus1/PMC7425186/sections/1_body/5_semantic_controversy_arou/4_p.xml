<p>Moreover, we would like to stress some important points for clinicians. Patients with fever, systemic inflammation and presenting with extreme fatigue, pallor, difficulty breathing, blood pressure instability, hepatomegaly and significant digestive signs (diarrhoea, ileus) may require early referral to intensive care units for hemodynamic assistance and close monitoring. Elevated serum ferritin and ProBNP, elevation of D-dimers, together with hypoalbuminaemia, thrombocytopenia and strikingly elevated acute phase reactants are in line with an intense cytokine storm. PCR assay of SARS-COV-2 requires either nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal swab or stool sampling, but search of specific antibodies may be necessary in case PCR tests are negative. Prompt treatment with IVIG 2Â g/kg may be effective, but as it implies infusion of large fluid volumes, it may be preferable to infuse them divided into two separate doses and to use preferably highly concentrated products. In case of obesity (BMI &gt;30), reducing 20% of therapeutic dose may avoid renal complications linked to the increase in oncotic pressure and blood viscosity. Treatment with corticosteroids and in some cases anti-IL-1 agents may be advisable even if trials cannot justify it. Of note, in adults with severe COVID-severe infections trials with anakinra are ongoing, and the drug worked satisfactorily in cases of resistant KD.

 </sup> The outcome of reported cases of KD does not seem to be any different from in the past, and outcome of the cases with multisystem involvement seems generally quite good with early recognition and treatment, even if few deaths occurred.
