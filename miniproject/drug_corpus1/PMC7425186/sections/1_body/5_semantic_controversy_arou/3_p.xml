 </sup> often inaugural and without the typical mucocutaneous symptoms, but toxic shock has also been associated for years with bacterial toxins, especially from streptococcus and staphylococcus, playing a role of superantigen with subsequent immunologic reaction similar to anaphylaxis. At present, little is known on the link between viral infection and shock syndrome. Of interest, a retrospective cohort of 1099 SARS-COV-2 confirmed patients in China reported 12 (1.1%) with shock syndrome, the direct role of the virus may, however, be only speculative, as these patients may have had coinfections suffered from treatment-related anaphylactic reactions.
