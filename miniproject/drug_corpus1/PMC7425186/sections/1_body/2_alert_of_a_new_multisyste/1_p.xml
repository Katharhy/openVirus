<p>At the end of April 2020 and coming from the UK, a first alert of severe pediatric cases referred in intensive care unit for a feature possibly related to SARS-COV-2 and overlapping with myocarditis and toxic shock syndrome changed the initial idea of a favourable outcome of COVID-19 in childhood as one of the eight patients died. It also generated some confusion as some of the patients presented clinical signs of KD, a medium-sized vasculitis of young children. Since then there have been multiple reports of similar cases, even though up to the writing of the present review (May 15, 2020) only two series have been published in peer-reviewed journals.

 </sup> The definitions of this condition now include ‘hyper-inflammatory shock’, ‘hyper-inflammatory syndrome with multiorgan involvement’, ‘pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS)’ (with or without the suffix—TS, that is, temporally associated with SARS-COV-2), ‘Kawasaki-like syndrome’, ‘Kawasaki-like disease’. Regardless of the name given, we think it more important to understand what could be its pathophysiology, its exact clinical characteristics and best treatment options. In light of the first published cases and the growing experience of European and American pediatric centers, it looks that different clinical scenarios can be described, as follows.
