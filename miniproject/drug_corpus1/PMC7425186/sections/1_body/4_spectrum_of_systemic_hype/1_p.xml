<p>Unusual cases of acute myocarditis with features of toxic shock and heart failure requiring hemodynamic stabilisation in the context of marked systemic inflammation raised first alert. Most of these children had fever, skin rash, conjunctivitis, painful oedema at the extremities and significant gastrointestinal symptoms. Another somewhat milder phenotype has also appeared including children of all age groups, again with prominent gastrointestinal symptoms but with more subtle myocardial involvement. Features of macrophage activation syndrome with elevated ferritinaemia were seen in many cases.</p>
