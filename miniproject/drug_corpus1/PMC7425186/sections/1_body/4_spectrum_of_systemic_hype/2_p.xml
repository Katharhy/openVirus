<p>The only two published series relate to English and Italian cases. The English case series recently been published showed a cluster of eight patients with shock, high inflammatory indices and different types of cardiologic involvement.

 </sup> Six out of eight were of Afro-Caribbean origin. The clinical features were similar: continuous fever, rash, conjunctivitis, peripheral oedema, pain in the extremities and significant gastrointestinal involvement. Most of them did not experience significant respiratory involvement, unlike typical COVID-19. The Italian series

 </sup> comprised 10 patients, 8 of which were positive for SARS-COV-2 either by swab or by serology, aged 2.9–16 years (mean 7.5). Myocardial involvement and features of macrophage activation syndrome were common in this cohort. Although patients met criteria for typical and atypical KD, their clinical and biochemical features differed from the historical cohort of KD patients seen in the previous years, hence the name of Kawasaki-like disease. Notably, all 10 patients recovered without sequelae.
