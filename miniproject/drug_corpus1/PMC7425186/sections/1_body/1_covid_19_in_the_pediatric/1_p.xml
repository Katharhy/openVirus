<p>The global pandemic of COVID-19 initially seemed to affect children only mildly. Indeed, in March 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the pediatric population represented only 1% of the 72 314 cases compiled in Wuhan, the focus of the pandemic.

 </sup> One study evaluating 1391 children systematically tested retrieved 171 (12.3%), confirmed with SARS-COV-2 infection, and in whom 27 (15.8%) had neither clinical nor radiologic symptoms. Their median age was 6.7 years with a slight male predominance (60.8%); pneumonia (bilateral ground-glass opacity) and upper respiratory tract infection were the most common features, and only one death occurred. Later, a Chinese epidemiologic survey among 2135 SARS-COV-2-exposed children gave approximately the same findings.

 </sup> Eight hundred and fifteen articles including 18 studies with 1065 participants (444 patients younger than 10 years and 553 aged 10–19 years) with confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection were included in the final analysis. Children at any age had mild respiratory symptoms, namely fever, dry cough and fatigue, or were even asymptomatic. Bronchial thickening and ground-glass opacities were the main radiologic features. Among the included articles, there was only one case of severe COVID-19 infection, which occurred in a 13-month-old infant.
