<p>Epidemiologic evidence of a viral role in triggering KD is suggested by seasonal epidemics,

 </sup> and a number of viruses such as adenovirus, rhinovirus, influenza, Boca virus and enterovirus have been implicated.

 </sup> Of note, coronaviruses are included in the list of viruses known to trigger KD, and a high suspicion for the two species HCoV-NH and HCoV-NL63 raised, but studies eventually gave conflicting results.

 </sup> The possible role of SARS-COV-2 in ‘classic’ KD pathogenesis has yet to be determined but in view of what previously discussed current evidence does not seem to support this hypothesis.
