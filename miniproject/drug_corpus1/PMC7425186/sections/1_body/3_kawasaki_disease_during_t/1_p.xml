 </sup> and was just the first description of a child with classic KD, who also screened positive for COVID-19 in the setting of fever and minimal respiratory symptoms. There are clear-cut cases of KD (complete, incomplete and atypical), but without shock syndrome, that as every year are continuing to appear in all countries. Whether these cases are more prevalent during the SARS-COV-2 pandemic is still unclear, but preliminary unpublished data do not, in general, seem to support this hypothesis. In fact, there are hints that the contrary might be the case, and the fear of contracting hospital-acquired infections might contribute to less emergency department consultations. Indeed, an international panel that include member of the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines Committee for KD gave recommendations in this regard.

 </sup> In Japan, where the incidence of this disorder is higher than in any other country, they surveyed members of the Japanese Society for Kawasaki Disease. In just 2 days, 31 medical institution in 17 prefectures replied, and compared to the average year the number of patients were mostly unchanged, or even decreased (C. Shimizu and Takahashi, personal communication). The majority answered that there was no change in severity compared to the average year, and there were no reports of severe cases of KD or KD-like cases that could lead to ICU management. Due to the relative rarity of this disease, analyses of data collected in Europe will occur only at the end of the year, or at least when sufficient numbers will be available.
