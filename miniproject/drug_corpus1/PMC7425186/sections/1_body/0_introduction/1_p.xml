<p>Since the last few weeks, there have been cases in the pediatric age characterised by shock, myocarditis and variable signs of multisystem inflammation. Cases occurred more frequently in some areas, such as Europe and Eastern US, where the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has hit the most. Precise epidemiological data are not yet available, but several countries including Italy, France, Spain and UK have started national registries, and media attention has risen so much that there have been concerns even in the general population, previously rarely aware of Kawasaki disease (KD), that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) could cause a vasculitis in their children. Moreover, there have been multiple calls to physicians and hospitals from parents of children previously affected with KD that they might be at higher risks. Aim of this review is, therefore, to try to clarify what the current situation stands with regard to KD during the pandemic, in particular to its relation with to this multisystemic inflammatory syndrome.</p>
