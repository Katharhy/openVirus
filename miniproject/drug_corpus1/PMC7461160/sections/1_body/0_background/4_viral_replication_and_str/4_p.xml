<p id="Par13">The RTC comprises multiple proteins; the non-structural proteins Nsp3, Nsp4, and Nsp6 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] that participate in the formation of sites for viral RNA synthesis, the principal protease (Nsp5), the Nsp7–Nsp8 primase complex, the main RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Nsp12), the helicase/triphosphatase (Nsp13), the exoribonuclease (Nsp14), the endonuclease (Nsp15), and the N7- and 2′O- methyltransferases (Nsp10/Nsp16). The replicase-transcriptase proteins are expected to be great targets for anti-coronaviral drugs.
