<p id="Par17">The co-expression of all three SARS-CoV NSPs (Nsp3, Nsp4, and Nsp6) is essential to induce DMVs that are comparable to those described in SARS-CoV-infected cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These proteins contain particular multiple transmembrane domains that help the virus replication complex via the recruitment of intracellular membranes. The rough ER outer membrane forms an RVN of membranes that includes convoluted membranes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and DMVs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. DMVs are found in hepatitis C, poliovirus, coxsackievirus, and SARS-CoV infected cells. Therefore, knowing how the virus uses the host cell to hide in DMVs and replicate will lead to the development of therapies, not only against human CoV but against other pathogens that use the same mechanism, as well. In this regard, K22 was identified as a small compound targeting membrane-bound coronaviral RNA synthesis inhibiting DMV formation, viral replication, and infectivity in a wide range of coronaviruses HCoV-229E, FCoV, MHV, IBV, MERS, and SARS-CoV [
