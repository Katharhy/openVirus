 <italic>NSP6</italic> is a membrane protein of approximately 34 kDa with six transmembrane helices and a highly conserved C-terminus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). Inserted in the ER membrane [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], it associates with Nsp3 and Nsp4 multi-pass transmembrane proteins during the assembly of coronavirus replication complex to form DMVs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Transfection of Nsp6 produces single-membrane small vesicle clustering around the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC). Interestingly, its co-transfection with Nsp4 has a negative effect on this phenotype and Nsp6 is relocalized outside the MTOC area. The microtubule scaffolding does not seem necessary for productive infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]; however, several members of the RTC circulate in the cell through the microtubules.
