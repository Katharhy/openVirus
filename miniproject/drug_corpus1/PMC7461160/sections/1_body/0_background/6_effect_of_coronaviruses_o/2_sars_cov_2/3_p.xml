<p id="Par26">It is too premature to know the long-term neurological complications of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and coronaviruses have not been linked so far with particular long-term neurological sequelae. However, the long-term neurocognitive consequences of SARS-CoV-2 should not be ignored. Additionally, the presence of anosmia and ageusia is intriguing, since hyposmia is a feature of early Parkinsonâ€™s disease and the accumulation of alpha-synuclein in the olfactory system is often seen in the prodrome. Several studies suggest that HCoV RNA frequently persists in human brains [
