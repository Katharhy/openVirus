<p id="Par23">The histological examination of brain tissue harvested during the 2003 SARS epidemic has shown degeneration and necrosis of neurons, extensive glial cell hyperplasia, edema, and cellular infiltration [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Electron microscopy studies detected viral genomes and viral particles in the cytoplasm of neurons, mostly in the cortex and the hippocampus [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], confirming that the virus can cross the bloodâ€“brain barrier. Interestingly, in patients infected with SARS-CoV, the virus localized almost exclusively to neurons. This observation is congruent with studies showing a distinct neuronal tropism in infected
