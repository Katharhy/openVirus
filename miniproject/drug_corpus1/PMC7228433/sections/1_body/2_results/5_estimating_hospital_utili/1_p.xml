<p id="Par18">There are 33 facilities without hospitals within 10 miles of the ICE facility while all facilities have a hospital within 50 miles. A COVID-19 outbreak at a number of detention facilities would potentially overwhelm local ICU capacity within a 10- and 50-mile radius of each facility (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Under the most optimistic scenario (R0 = 2.5), and imagining synchronized epidemics across all facilities, estimated median aggregate ICU admissions from 56 facilities by day 30, 62 facilities by day 60, and 65 facilities by day 90 would exceed ICU capacity within 10 miles of the facility. These numbers include those facilities with no ICU capacity within 10 miles. Under the least optimistic scenario (R0 = 7), the numbers of facilities where ICU beds within 10 miles would not be adequate increases to 66 facilities within 30 days of onset and this persists through 60 and 90 days. A small number of facilities are also estimated to generate more ICU needs than ICU beds within 50 miles during the first 30 days of onset (six such facilities for R0 = 2.5 or 3.5 and eight such facilities for R0 = 7). For R0 = 2.5 and R0 = 7, the aggregate number of patients requiring ICU admission exceeds available beds within 50 miles for 8 and 10 facilities at 90 days, respectively.
