<p id="Par17">Focusing now on estimating ICU admissions, we estimate that with R0 = 2.5, and again imagining that all epidemics are synchronized, there will be a median of 139 detainees infected who will require ICU admission after 30 days, growing to an aggregate of 475 patients by day 60 and 745 patients by day 90 (approximately 1.8% of the total population). Under the pessimistic scenario of R0 = 7, the corresponding numbers of patients are 782, 971, and 973 on days 30, 60, and 90, respectively. This corresponds to approximately 2.3% of the total population.</p>
