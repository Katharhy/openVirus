<p id="Par24">Finally, we presented the results here where all outbreaks were synchronized to start on the same day. There would likely be variation in the date of initial case within each facility, and subsequent peaks would potentially be distributed over a long time period. However, the analysis compared each facility’s hospital needs with their corresponding community’s ability to meet them using estimates that would not change based on such dates. Asynchronicity would principally mean that the model’s results would not aggregate as demonstrated, but the individual facility-level analyses would still be illustrative of local challenges no matter how they were timed relative to those of other facilities.</p>
