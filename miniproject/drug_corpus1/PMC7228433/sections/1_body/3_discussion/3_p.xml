<p id="Par21">Interventions within ICE facilities pose significant challenges, and reducing their R0 while maintaining detainee populations would require changes to a facilityâ€™s physical space that may not be possible. The CDC [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and the Federal Bureau of Prisons [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] outline best practices for reducing the spread of infectious diseases in correctional settings, such as careful attention to hygiene and disinfecting surfaces, prompt quarantine, isolation and treatment measures, awareness and mitigation of the risks of physical contact between persons, and designing daily routines and systems that minimize interpersonal interaction in the event of outbreaks. It is unknown if distribution of PPE and strict hand washing protocols, for example, could help slow transmission (i.e., lower the R0) nor how quickly this could improve matters. Even when aligned with published standards, detention facilities are typically overcrowded [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], house multiple individuals in bunk bed settings, and offer limited potential for social distancing, reducing the effectiveness of these measures even when they are carefully followed. The recommended six feet of separation for social distancing necessitates an approximate 28 sq. foot area for each detainee; however, this exceeds the minimum 25 sq. foot standard published by the American Correctional Association. Many ICE holding areas are not able to meet that standard, and some only afford detainees 3 sq. feet of space in holding areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. To at least some extent, this crowding is by design: the emphasis at these facilities is on behavior regulation techniques of control and surveillance made possible by a high population density and lower operating costs by minimizing the size of the facilities necessary to carry out this function [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Regardless of what the actual R0 of COVID-19 in ICE detention facilities turns out to be, it is likely to be higher than returning the same population of individuals to the wider community.
