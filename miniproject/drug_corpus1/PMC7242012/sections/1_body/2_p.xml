 </xref> On January 30, 2020, WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. On March 11, 2020, WHO designated COVID‐19 a pandemic. Almost all countries are implementing public health measures to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission and are marshaling clinical care for patients with COVID‐19. This review highlights key features of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, the epidemiology and clinical course of COVID‐19, and interventions to stop the growing COVID‐19 pandemic.
