<p>The search for effective therapies and a vaccine is occurring at a remarkable pace, with at least 29 studies of therapeutic agents and 5 studies of candidate vaccines registered on ClinicalTrials.org (

On May 1, 2020, the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization of remdesivir, a broad‐spectrum antiviral nucleotide prodrug for treatment of severe COVID‐19. Studies of monoclonal antibodies against IL‐6 and hyperimmune immunoglobulin are in progress. Following reports of serious cardiac arrythmias, the FDA cautioned clinicians of prescribing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for treatment of COVID‐19. A safe and effective vaccine, if successfully developed, probably will not be available for 12 to 18 months.
