<p>The risk for severe COVID‐19 disease is highest for men, older adults, and patients with certain comorbidities. In the United States, 80% of reported COVID‐19–related deaths are among people aged ≥65 years.

 <xref rid="cld973-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Although listed by the CDC as a comorbid condition associated with severe COVID‐19, chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis, has not been a common comorbidity associated with hospitalization in the United States (Table 
 <xref rid="cld973-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The high prevalence of comorbid conditions can explain, in part, African Americans’ increased risk for hospitalization with COVID‐19 disease.

 </xref> Variable comorbidity prevalence contributes to differences in national COVID mortality. Globally, crude fatality rates for COVID‐19 range from 0.2% in Singapore, to 2.0% to 3.0% in South Korea and Germany, to 4.3% for the United States, and to 10% to 13% in Spain, Italy, and the United Kingdom.
