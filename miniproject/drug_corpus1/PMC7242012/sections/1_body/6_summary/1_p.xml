<p>SARS‐CoV‐2 is a new human pathogen, readily spread via respiratory droplets and the cause of the growing COVID‐19 pandemic. Men, older adults (&gt;65 years old), and persons with comorbidities are at risk for severe COVID‐19 and death. Countries have successfully suppressed transmission and mitigated needs for intensive care with robust case/contact detection (testing), isolation of infected/exposed persons, and social distancing. To stop the COVID‐19 pandemic, the challenge is for all countries to scale up and sustain prevention measures while awaiting the arrival of effective vaccines and therapies.</p>
