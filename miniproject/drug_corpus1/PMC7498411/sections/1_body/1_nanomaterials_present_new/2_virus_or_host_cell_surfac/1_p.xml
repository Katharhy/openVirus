<p id="par0035">A virus is an extremely small particle with an outer protein shell called a capsid and an inner core of nucleic acids (either RNA or DNA). For self-replication, the virus has to invade host cells through binding itself to specific “cell surface receptor molecules” (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>a), such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Antiviral nanoagents can be used to disrupt the viral replication cycle. As shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, multifarious nanoagents have been widely investigated for their antiviral activities, such as metallic (
 <italic>e.g.</italic>, silver), metal oxide (
 <italic>e.g.,</italic> titanium dioxide), and carbonaceous (
 <italic>e.g.</italic>, graphene oxide (GO)) nanomaterials. The controllable physicochemical properties (
 <italic>e.g.</italic>, size, shape, and surface) of ENMs facilitate their direct interactions with viral particles or host cell surface receptors to inhibit virus-cell interactions [
 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For instance, silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) can directly interact with virus envelope proteins [

 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and nucleic acids [
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Furthermore, our recent study revealed that AgNPs could block the primary infection of Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) by directly destroying its virion protein [
 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In addition, GO and its derivatives were reported to inhibit virus infections through competitive binding with the cell receptors [
 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], or inducing conformational damage of the viral protein [
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Analogously, by mimicking heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the eukaryotic cell surface, viral attachment ligand (VAL)-modified gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) exhibit a broad-spectrum nontoxic antiviral activity [
