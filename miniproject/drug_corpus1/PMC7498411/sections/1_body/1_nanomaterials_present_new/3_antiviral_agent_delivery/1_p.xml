<p id="par0040">Many antiviral agents have been approved for clinical use or in preclinical tests based on the basis of disturbing the virus life cycle, which can be used to develop new antiviral approaches in combination with ENMs (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>b). In this way, ENMs can not only function as an ideal vehicle for these agents to improve targeting efficiency, bioavailability and blood circulation, but also reduce side effects [
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For instance, as an approved antiviral drug, acyclovir can be used to treat herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection through disruption of the viral DNA polymerase function by acting as an analog of deoxyguanosine triphosphate to compete with 2′-deoxyaguanosine-5′-triphosphate [
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, its clinical application is hampered by its short half-life of less than 3 h and low bioavailability (only 10 %−20 %) through oral administration [
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These limitations can be overcome by using poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) as an ideal biodegradable vehicle for drug delivery, which has been approved for clinical application by U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Encapsulation of acyclovir into PLGA-based NPs for oral administration has been demonstrated as an effective way that resulted in a 2.6-fold improvement in its bioavailability [
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Furthermore, liposomes hold promise as a kind of antiviral drug delivery agent. For instance, although suramin is an active antiretroviral agent that can inhibit HBV, HIV, ZIKV and norovirus (NV) [
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], its lipophilicity and high negative charge lead to low membrane permeability and limited cell internalization [
 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, its encapsulation into cationic liposomal NPs has been reported to result in better inhibition of murine NV infections [
