<p id="par0030">Engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) offer many therapeutic advantages over traditional drugs, such as higher efficiency of drug delivery to lesions, more broad-spectrum drug activity, fewer side effects on the human body, easily tunable physicochemical properties, lower cost and higher throughput synthesis, 
 <italic>etc.</italic> These superior properties of ENMs could be considered as an emerging solution to the problems faced during novel drug development. Hence, ENMs have been intensively investigated for their applications in next-generation therapeutics, such as anticancer and antibacterial treatments. However, antiviral applications of ENMs are still in their infancy (
