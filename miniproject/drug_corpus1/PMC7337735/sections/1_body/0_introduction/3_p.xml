<p>The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic requires detailed consideration of many factors especially in decisions about long-distance travel, although many of the same issues apply to domestic travel by car and return to the workplace and other daily activities. As COVID-19 erupted in Asia during the early phase, pre-travel evaluations weighed the ‘go-or-no-go’ decision heavily. This continues to be a key determination and must incorporate the assessment of the level of risk to that individual. Some activities can be controlled by the individual traveller in ways to manage or reduce risk. Also important to consider but outside of individual control are policy elements imposed on the traveller and the itinerary.</p>
