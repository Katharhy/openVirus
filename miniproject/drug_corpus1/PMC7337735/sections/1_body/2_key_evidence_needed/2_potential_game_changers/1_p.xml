   <p>2) Highly effective and safe treatment can prevent severe disease and death and that is widely available.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>3) Finding genetic or other markers that would allow identification of the 5â€“15% of individuals at risk for severe and fatal disease. Such markers should be accessible, sensitive, specific and inexpensive to allow wide testing. Those who tested negative should be aware that they might still become infected and could infect others.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>4) Identification of safe, effective, available oral drug that could prevent infection, to be used prophylactically or in the event of probable exposure. The drug would need to prevent all severe infection and death.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>5) Finding that immune plasma, concentrated coronavirus immune globulin or monoclonal antibodies could reliably prevent infection for some specified duration. Ideally the agent could be given via intramuscular route in many settings.</p>
