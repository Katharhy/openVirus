 </xref> Travel medicine clinicians have the expertise and knowledge to help the population return to work and resume travel. Travel medicine clinicians understand how and where infections are transmitted. They have experience interpreting serologies and administering vaccines. They can interpret antibody, antigen and other tests, and the use of vaccines and immune globulins, should those become available. New roles for travel medicine emerge: When and how is it safe to return to the workplace? Domestic travel in countries with geographic diversity in COVID-19 epidemiology and differing in requirements for social distancing/quarantine/face covering would also benefit from thoughtful consideration and advice. Should travel medicine clinics become places that offer testing and counselling, testing and travel centres and ultimately vaccination? Travel is integral to our lives and not a separate dimension. Many preparations and framing of issues for travel will overlap with those for returning to work and travel medicine clinicians are well prepared to help guide the reopening of work and travel safely.
