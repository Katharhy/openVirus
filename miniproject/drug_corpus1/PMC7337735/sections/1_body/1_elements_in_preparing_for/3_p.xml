<p>Two resources provide insights on the health infrastructure and support for tourism that may help a traveller determine the appeal of a destination during the pandemic (

The global health security index (GHSI), a determination of healthcare facilities and public health infrastructure, is a massive collaborative effort of multiple organizations. The GHSI is a detailed and comprehensive framework that assesses a ‘country’s capability to prevent and mitigate epidemics and pandemic’: prevent emergence or release of pathogens, detect and report epidemics of potential concern, respond rapidly and mitigate spread, have sufficient robust health system to treat the sick and protect health workers, and comply with international norms. It also assesses overall risk environment and country vulnerability to biological threats. The GHSI can give prospective traveller some idea of the preparedness of a country.
