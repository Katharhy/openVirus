<p>Opening borders are decisions outside of the control of travellers or travel medicine providers. Restarting safe travel assumes that testing to identify acute infection in symptomatic persons and screening their close contacts are widely available. When travel resumes, it involves some elements under personal control and those that the individual cannot control (
 <xref rid="TB1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Elements for which the traveller has partial control during travel include the use of mask, frequency of handwashing; types of meetings with others, number of persons at meetings and types of activities. Travellers need to be aware of risks from large sports events, concerts and mass events—especially indoors. In general, many outdoor activities are safe when accompanied by physical distancing ≥2 metres. Travellers must do homework on the trip details and assemble background information to develop a comprehensive plan for safe travel. The 2020 travel kit has expanded and should include abundant supply of hand sanitizer, masks, sanitizing wipes, thermometer and possibly pulse oximeter for some. The travel medicine clinician can assist individuals to make informed choices about whether to travel, which trips to choose, and how to make travel safer.
