The first component considers the individual traveller’s risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease (age and underlying diseases including cardiac, diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension, renal failure, respiratory disorder), threshold for risk (individual risk tolerance taking into account the necessity to travel and the nature of the trip) and assessment of immunity—assuming that sufficient scientific evidence will correlate the presence of antibodies to immunity.

 </xref> Those at highest risk of death from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (age ≥ 65 years and one or more high-risk conditions) may decide to defer international travel until an effective vaccine is available or there is some other game changer (see below). It is unlikely that circulation of the virus will have ceased in most parts of the world within 2020.
