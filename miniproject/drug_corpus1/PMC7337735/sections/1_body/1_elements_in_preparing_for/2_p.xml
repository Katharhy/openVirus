<p>The second component assesses trip details that may influence the risk of exposure to COVID-19 (

 </xref> which will require much more specific planning. A private vehicle that is disinfected meticulously between passengers is safer than crowded buses, trains or subway systems. The airport location, size, volume of traffic and time spent in them will influence the level of potential exposure because of travellers co-mingling along the journey. Airplane-related exposure depends on the plane’s size, seating configuration, density of seats, commitment of airline to cleaning, and air exchange and filtering. The destination country’s level of risk is related to its socioeconomic status, capacity to identify and interrupt spread and current level of SARS-CoV-2 circulation, which can change quickly. Accommodations also contribute possible exposures related to their measures to disinfect, limit the density of guests and promote physical distancing. Planned activities differ in their levels of risk, e.g. outdoor versus indoor events, presence of large crowds, composition of crowds, proximity and duration of close contact, and season of year. Knowledge about healthcare facilities at destination is helpful, regarding their adequacy of services, capacity, access and service for foreigners. Finally, public health infrastructure at the destination can determine the capacity to test, isolate and quarantine as needed.
