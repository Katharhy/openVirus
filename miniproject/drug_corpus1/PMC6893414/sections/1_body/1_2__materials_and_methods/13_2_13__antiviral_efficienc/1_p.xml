<p>Antiviral efficiency of Ery-Est in pregnant mice was performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Briefly, twenty pregnant C57BL/6 mice (10–12 weeks old, E12–14) were randomly assigned into four groups (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5). One group infected with heat-inactivated ZIKV (iZIKV) was used as mock controls, and other three groups were i.p. infected with ZIKV strain SZ01 at a dose of 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU/mouse. After 1 h, infected mice were i.p. administrated with Ery-Est and Ery at 50 mg/kg of body weight or vehicle. At 1 day post infection, pregnant mice were retro-orbitally bled to measure viraemia by RT-qPCR. Three embryos of each mouse were randomly collected to detect viral RNA loads of placentas and fetal heads from those collected embryos.
