<p>To confirm the inhibitory activity of Ery-Est on ZIKV infection, BHK21 and Vero cells were seeded onto coverslips at a density of 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well in 24-well plates and incubated for 24 h. The mixture of 2 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU of ZIKV and the equal volume of serially diluted Ery-Est (20, 10, and 5 µM) and Ery (20 µM) was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and then added to cells. After 24 h, the culture supernatant was replaced by DMEM with 2% FBS. About 4 days later, cells were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), perforated by 0.2% Triton X-100, blocked with 3% BSA (Amresco, LLC, Solon, OH), and incubated with anti-E mAb 4G2 (10 µg/mL) at 4 °C overnight. After 5 washes, the cells were incubated with FITC-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:1000, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) for 1 h at room temperature. After 5 washes, the coverslips were sealed with Prolong Gold Antifade reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and scanned with a Leica SP8 confocal microscope.
