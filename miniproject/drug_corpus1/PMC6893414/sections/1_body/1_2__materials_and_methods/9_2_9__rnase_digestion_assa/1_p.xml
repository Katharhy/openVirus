<p>To detect the genomic RNA released from the ZIKV particles, the RNase digestion assay and RT-qPCR were developed as previously described [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Briefly, Ery-Est and Ery were incubated with ZIKV (1 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU) at 37 °C for 2 h. Then, the released RNA from treated ZIKV was digested by micrococcal nuclease (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by the inactivation of the residual RNase. Then, the undigested genomic RNA inside the unbroken virus was extracted using the EasyPure Viral DNA/RNA Kit (Transgen Biotech, Beijing, China) and detected using TransScript II Green One-Step qRT-PCR SuperMix (Transgen Biotech, Beijing, China) and the Master Cycler Ep Realplex PCR system (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) in accordance with the manufactures’ instructions. The primers used to detect the RNA sequences coding viral E protein were as follows: F1 (5′-TGGAGGCTGAGATGGATGG-3′)/R1 (5′-GAACGCTGCGGTACACAAGGA-3′).
