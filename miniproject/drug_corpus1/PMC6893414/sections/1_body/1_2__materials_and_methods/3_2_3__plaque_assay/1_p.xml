<p>Viral titers were determined by plaque assay performed on BHK21 cells as previously described [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. BHK21 cells were seeded in cell plates and incubated to a confluent monolayer at 37 Â°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for the experiments. Virus stocks or samples were serially diluted and added to cells, then incubated for 2 h. After incubation, the media of viruses or sample dilutions were removed from BHK21 cells, and the infected cells were covered with an overlay of DMEM containing 2% FBS and 1% low melting-point (LMP) agarose (Promega Co., Madison, WI, USA). The plates with infected cells were further incubated for approximately 5 days, then fixed by 4% formaldehyde and stained with 1% crystal violet for plaque visualization. The titer of virus stock was expressed as plaque forming units (PFU)/mL.
