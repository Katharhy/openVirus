<p>To test the inhibitory activity of Ery-Est against ZIKV in neuronal cells, U-251 MG cells were used. Briefly, Ery-Est and Ery were serially diluted in serum-free DMEM and mixed with 2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU of viruses and then incubated 1 h at 37 °C, and the mixture was then added to U-251 MG cells (2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>). After incubation at 37 °C for 48 h, the percentage of infected cells was determined by flow cytometry and normalized to untreated infected cells.
