<p>The pseudotyped MERS-CoV and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) were chosen as control enveloped viruses and prepared as previously described [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. 293T cells were co-transfected with plasmid encoding VSV-G protein or MERS-CoV S protein and PNL4-3.luc.RE using VigoFect (Vigorous Biotechnology, Beijing, China). After 48 h, the supernatants of pseudotyped MERS-CoV and VSV were collected to infect Huh7 cells. The inhibitory activity of Ery-Est on these viruses was measured after 3 days by the luciferase assay system (Promega Co., Madison, WI, USA).
