<p>The inhibition of Ery-Est against ZIKV in multiple rounds of infection was performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. BHK21 cells (2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>) were infected by 2 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU of ZIKV treated with Ery-Est (20 µM), Ery (20 µM), and vehicle (control) and incubated at 37 °C. The supernatant was collected at different timepoints after infection, and the ZIKV titers of collected supernatants were respectively detected by the plaque assay. Additionally, to test the inhibitory activity of Ery-Est against high viral doses of ZIKV, the experiment was performed with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 as previously described [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Briefly, BHK21 cells (2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>) were infected with 2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU of viruses treated by Ery-Est (20 µM, 10 µM, 5 µM), Ery (20 µM), and vehicle (control). The supernatant was respectively collected at 48 h post infection, and the ZIKV titers of collected supernatants were detected by the plaque assay.
