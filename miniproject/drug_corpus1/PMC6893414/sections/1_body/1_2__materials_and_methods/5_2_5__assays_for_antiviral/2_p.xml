<p>To evaluate the antiviral efficacy against ZIKV (SZ01, FLR, and MR766) and DENV II New Guinea C and YFV 17D, Ery-Est and Ery were serially diluted in serum-free DMEM and mixed with 100 PFU of viruses, and then incubated 1 h at 37 °C. For the plaque assay, the mixture was then added to cells seeded in cell plates. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the supernatant was replaced with DMEM containing 1% LMP agarose and 2% FBS. When the viral plaque became obvious, the plaque visualization was carried out as described above. Besides the plaque assay, CCK8 was also used to test the inhibitory activity. The mixture was added to the cells seeded in 96-well plates and incubated at 37 °C for 12 h, followed by replacing the culture supernatant with fresh DMEM containing 2% FBS. When the ZIKV-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) was obvious, CCK8 was used to detect the antiviral activity according to the instruction manual. Data were collected by microplate reader (Infinite M200PRO, Tecan, Morrisville, NC, USA).</p>
