<p>The above study of the inhibitory mechanism of Ery-Est demonstrates that it mainly obstructs ZIKV attachment, implying that Ery-Est may bind to viral particles to reduce its infectivity. We, thus, further investigated whether Ery-Est could inactivate ZIKV directly. PEG-8000 was used to separate the treated ZIKV virions from the free Ery-Est after the incubation of ZIKV and Ery-Est or Ery as previously described [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The infectivity of treated ZIKV was then detected by plaque assay. Results showed that Ery-Est decreased the infectivity of ZIKV in a dose-dependent manner with 50% effective concentration of 5.21 ± 0.85 µM, while Ery showed no inactivated activity against ZIKV (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01064-f003">Figure 3</xref>D,E, Ery-Est potently inactivated DENV II and YFV 17D with 50% effective concentrations of 2.56 ± 0.11 and 3.46 ± 0.41 µM respectively. These data indicate that Ery-Est inhibits virus infections through directly inactivating viral particles.
