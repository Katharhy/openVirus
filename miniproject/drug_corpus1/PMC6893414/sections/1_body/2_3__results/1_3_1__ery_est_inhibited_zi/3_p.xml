<p>In addition, to monitor the inhibitory activity of Ery-Est against viral growth, Ery-Est was tested to inhibit ZIKV infection in a multistep growth curve. It was demonstrated that Ery-Est greatly decreased ZIKV titers (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-01064">supplementary Figure S2A</xref>) in multiple rounds of infection, suggesting that Ery-Est has a strong and lasting inhibitory effect on ZIKV infection. Besides, it was also shown that Ery-Est could exhibit inhibitory activity against ZIKV infection even with relatively higher viral doses (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-01064">Figure S2B</xref>), and viral titers were reduced by treatment of different concentrations of Ery-Est. Treatment of 5 ÂµM Ery-Est decreased viral titers by approximately 80% compared with control group, indicating that Ery-Est remained effective against relatively higher dose infection of ZIKV.
