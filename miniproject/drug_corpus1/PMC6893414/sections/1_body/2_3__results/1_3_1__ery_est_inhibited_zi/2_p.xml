<p>We also developed the immunofluorescence staining assay to verify the anti-ZIKV activity of Ery-Est at three different concentrations, and the results were in accordance with the data from the plaque assay. The expression of ZIKV E protein was almost completely blocked by Ery-Est at the concentration of 10 µM and nearly 50% inhibited at the concentration of 5 µM both in BHK21 and Vero cells (

Furthermore, CPE of ZIKV in BHK21 and Vero cells would make cells progress to necrosis and abscission, and their viabilities, thus, could be detected by CCK8, which could evaluate ZIKV infection indirectly. As a result, Ery-Est was testified to inhibit ZIKV strain SZ01 infection with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 3.55 ± 0.46 and 3.97 ± 0.09 µM in BHK21 and Vero cells respectively (
