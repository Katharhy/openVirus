<p>To determine whether Ery-Est could block the vertical transmission of ZIKV, pregnant C57BL/6 mice were infected by iZIKV (mock infected controls) or 2 Ã— 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU ZIKV as described previously [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], followed by treatments of Ery-Est (50 mg/kg), Ery (50 mg/kg), and vehicle respectively. It was demonstrated that the viraemia of mice treated with Ery-Est was reduced with statistical significance in comparison to groups of Ery or vehicle treatments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01064-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). Meanwhile, the viral load of ZIKV in placentas and fetal heads from pregnant mice with Ery-Est treatment was significantly lower than that from mice with Ery or vehicle treatments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01064-f005">Figure 5</xref>B,C). Besides, the infection rates of placentas and fetal heads were decreased by Ery-Est treatment. These results suggest that Ery-Est may directly inactivate some ZIKV virions before they have penetrated to the placenta and then the fetus, thus reducing infection rates of placentas and fetuses, as well as blocking vertical transmission of ZIKV in pregnant mice.
