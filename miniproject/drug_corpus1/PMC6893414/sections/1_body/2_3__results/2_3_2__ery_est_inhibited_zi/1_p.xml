<p>As Ery-Est was demonstrated to potently inhibit ZIKV strain SZ01, we then evaluated its inhibitory activity against other ZIKV strains through plaque assay. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01064-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B, Ery-Est significantly inhibited the infections of ZIKV strains FLR and MR766 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 7.65 ± 1.77 and 7.15 ± 0.96 µM respectively. Similar to strain SZ01, ZIKV strains MR766 and FLR were approximately half inhibited by micromole Ery-Est, suggesting that Ery-Est could broadly inhibit ZIKV strains that were isolated from rhesus monkeys or patients in different areas of the world.
