<p>Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne enveloped RNA virus, is a member of the genus of 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> in the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family. The 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family also contains other enveloped viruses, such as dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus, which have resulted in epidemics and threatened public health around the world. ZIKV was initially isolated from a sentinel rhesus monkey in Zika forest, Uganda in 1947 [

However, since 2007, the threat to public health from ZIKV has steadily increased due to outbreaks in varying places, such as Yap Island, French Polynesia, and Micronesia [

More recently, unexpected outbreaks of ZIKV infection have occurred in Brazil and rapidly spread from South America to Central-American and Asian countries, involving millions of residents [
