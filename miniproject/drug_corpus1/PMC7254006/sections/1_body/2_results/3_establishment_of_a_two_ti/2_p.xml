<p id="par0060">The signal window is determined by the upper and lower boundaries of the assay readout and is considered a major parameter for the overall assay quality measurement. The qRT-PCR assay exhibited the highest signal window (∼4 log difference between SARS-CoV-2-infected and non-infected samples) but was laborious, and was thus inefficient as a high-throughput drug compound screening assay. On the other hand, the ELISA (∼6 folds) and cell viability assay (∼4 folds) also exhibited reasonably high signal differences between infected cells and baseline at 72 hpi and provided a wide signal window. Therefore, we exploited the combination of ELISA and cell viability assay as a two-tier drug screening system for finding potential SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. This combinational screening system is rapid, non-labor-intensive, and can easily exclude false-positive results due to cytotoxicity. Using this newly established system, we screened an FDA-approved drug library containing 1528 drug compounds under the optimized conditions of 0.004 MOI at 72 hpi with each drug concentration fixed at 10μM. At 72 hpi, 20 μL/well of cell culture supernatant was harvested for SARS-CoV-2-N detection before addition of another 40 μL/well CellTiter-Glo® substrate for determination of cell viability (

 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ). Notably, hydroxychloroquine, nafamostat, and ivermectin which were previously shown to exhibit anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity were also identified in our primary screen with ELISA, but they showed &gt;10 % CPE at 72 hpi and were therefore excluded from the 19 drug compound list. Camostat was not detected in the primary screen but this might be related to its EC
 <sub>50</sub> being higher than 10μM which was used in our primary screen. Remdesivir was not included in the library and was therefore not identified.
