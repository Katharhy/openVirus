<p id="par0025">ELISA was performed to determine the amount of viral N protein expression in the culture supernatant of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells using a similar approach as previously described [
 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Briefly, 500 ng/well of mouse-anti-SARS-CoV-N monoclonal antibody (clone 14E7A11A8) was coated in 96-well ELISA plates for overnight incubation at 4 °C, followed by blocking with 2.5 % FBS plus 2.5 % FBS in PBS with Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 2 h at 37 °C. After washing, the infectious culture supernatants were transferred to the ELISA plates accordingly (50 μL, incubated at room temperature for 2 h), followed by intensive wash and addition of another 50 μL/well rabbit anti-SARS-CoV-N polyclonal antibody (1:4000), the secondary goat-anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP) antibody (1:1500, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), the 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) solution (Invitrogen), and the stop solution (0.1 M HCl). Subsequently, the optical density of each well was read at 450 nm (OD450) using VICTOR 3 multi-label plate reader (PerkinElmer, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). The rabbit anti-SARS-CoV-N monoclonal antibody showed good cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV-2-N [
