 <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Briefly, VeroE6 cells were seeded in 24-well plates (2 Ã— 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well). The cells were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI = 0.500) and then incubated for 1 h for virus internalization. Drugs were added at different time points of the virus replication cycle, including: pre-treatment (From -2 h post infection (hpi) to -1 hpi), co-infection with virus (-1 to 0 hpi) or post-infection (0 to +1 hpi). Dimethyl sulfoxide (0.5 %) was included as a negative control. Other details were depicted as schematic representations in
