<p id="par0040">Plaque reduction assay was performed to plot the 50 % antiviral effective dose (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) as we previously described with slight modifications [
 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Briefly, VeroE6 cells were seeded at 4 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well in 12-well tissue culture plates on the day before carrying out the assay. After 24 h of incubation, 50 plaque-forming units (PFU) of SARS-CoV-2 were added to the cell monolayer with or without the addition of drug compounds and the plates were further incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> before removal of unbound viral particles by aspiration of the media and washing once with DMEM. Monolayers were then overlaid with media containing 1% low melting agarose (Cambrex Corporation, New Jersey, USA) in DMEM and appropriate concentrations of individual compound, inverted and incubated as above for another 72 h. The wells were then fixed with 10 % formaldehyde (BDH, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) overnight. After removal of the agarose plugs, the monolayers were stained with 0.7 % crystal violet (BDH, Merck) and the plaques counted. The percentage of plaque inhibition relative to the control (
 <italic>i.e.</italic> without the addition of compound) wells were determined for each drug compound concentration. The EC
 <sub>50</sub> was calculated using Sigma plot (SPSS) in an Excel add-in ED50V10. The plaque reduction assay experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated twice for confirmation.
