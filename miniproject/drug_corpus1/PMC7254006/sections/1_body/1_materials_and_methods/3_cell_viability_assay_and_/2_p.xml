<p id="par0020">The CellTiterGlo® luminescent assay (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) was performed to detect the cytotoxicity of the selected drug compounds as previously described [
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Briefly, VeroE6 cells (4 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) were incubated with different concentrations of the individual compound for 48 h, followed by the addition of substrate and measurement of luminance 10 min later. The CC
 <sub>50</sub> of the drug compounds were calculated by Sigma plot (SPSS) in an Excel add-in ED50V10. The CPE inhibition assay was performed as previously described with slight modifications to evaluate the individual drug compounds’ cell protection effects against SARS-CoV-2 infection [
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Briefly, VeroE6 cells seeded in 96-well plates were infected with SARS-CoV-2 for 1 h with 0.01 multiplicity of infection (MOI), followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and replacement of fresh DMEM medium containing serially diluted drug compounds and 0.1 % DMSO as negative control. The cell viability of each well was determined at 3 days post-infection (dpi) by the CellTiterGlo® luminescent assay.
