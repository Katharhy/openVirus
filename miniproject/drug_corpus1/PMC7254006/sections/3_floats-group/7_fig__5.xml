   <bold>Characterization of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of each of the four selected drug compounds 
    <italic>in vitro</italic>.
   </bold> (A) VeroE6 and (B) Caco2 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and treated with different concentrations of the selected drug compounds as indicated. The viral load under each condition was collected at 48 hpi for viral load reduction assay by qRT-PCR. Intracellular viral loads were normalized by human β-actin. (C) VeroE6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and treated with different concentrations of the selected drug compounds as indicated and evaluated by the CPE inhibition assay at 72 hpi. Remdesivir was used as a positive control in all of these experiments. One-way ANOVA was used to compare the treatment groups with the 0μM (negative control) group. *P indicates &lt; 0.05 and ** indicates P &lt; 0.01 (Student’s t-test). All the experiments were performed in triplicate and replicated twice. The results are shown as mean ± standard deviations.
