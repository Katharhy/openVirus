<p id="para40">The contributions of testing, contact tracing, and localised quarantine on reductions in contacts and COVID-19 transmission could be determined via a model that simulates localised clusters throughout the country and estimates their likely coverage by testing, given the number of tests kits made available nationally per day. Promising pooled testing methods, whereby multiple samples (eg, from a household, or local cluster of up to 64 peopleâ€”the limit of pool sample accuracy) are pooled

The testing capacity of a country is likely to be a key bottleneck that determines whether such an alternative non-pharmaceutical intervention strategy could be successful in sufficiently suppressing COVID-19 spread. Adding the effects of emerging drug treatments

Intensive care capacity should be modelled as intensive care beds, including needed ventilator equipment and staff available per day based on national scale-up plans, and empirical data on the speed of achieved scale-ups in the coming weeks. The health-care systems capacity side of the model should also be modelled to include outcomes for all other diseases and conditions requiring hospital treatment, especially intensive care, so that useful estimates of overall effects on population mortality under different scenarios are obtained.
