<p id="para30">New COVID-19 country-specific models should incorporate testing, contract tracing, and localised quarantine of suspected cases as the main alternative intervention strategy to distancing lockdown measures, either at the start of the epidemic, if it is very small, or after the relaxation of lockdown conditions, if lockdown had to be imposed, to prevent health-care system overload in an already mounting epidemic. Modelling such a strategy for the UK, for example, which is just beginning distancing measures, would be extremely useful to guide when such measures could be liftedâ€”ie, at what proportion of the population tested (and, given asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission, how regularly) could we be confident that we are controlling the epidemic sufficiently to considerably delay or even prevent resurgence if lockdown were to be lifted. Emerging data from South Korea, which adopted a widespread testing strategy early (in conjunction with an innovative digital crowd-sourced contact tracing strategy) and has so far avoided the need for widespread lockdown,
