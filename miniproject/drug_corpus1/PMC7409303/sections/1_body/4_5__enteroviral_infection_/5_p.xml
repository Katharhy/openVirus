<p>Once a host is found, the virus creates a variety of smart mechanisms to escape from anti-viral immune response through persistent infection, e.g., blocking autophagy in order to remain in the cell [

 <xref rid="B98-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>] supports such hypothesis. Enteroviral B’s typical 5′ terminal genomic deletions observed in cardiomyocytes [

 <xref rid="B76-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] may lead to a long term stay of viruses in the cell without causing lysis. This probably enables detection of viral RNA in autopsy pancreata even a long time after occurrence of islet auto-antibodies [
 <xref rid="B80-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] as well as after T1D diagnosis [
