<p>This is in line with data showing that the enteroviral signaling cascade, which leads to the IFN response, is increased before auto-antibody conversion and T1D (see above) [

It is very likely that the longer duration of enterovirus abidance in the host is defined by the genes and their unfavorable seasonal changes.
