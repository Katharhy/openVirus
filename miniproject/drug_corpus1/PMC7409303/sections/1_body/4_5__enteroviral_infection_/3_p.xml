<p>The results of this study indeed reproduce a correlation of enteroviral infection and autoimmunity: that the duration of the virus load detectable in stool samples determines the progression to autoimmunity. Mechanistically, one can assume from this and many previous studies that the virus may trigger autoimmunity, but is not conclusively linked to further T1D progression.</p>
