<p>The study confirmed that enterovirus B infections (EVB) were associated with islet autoimmunity, but also examined the role of length of infection since sequential stools from children were available. An association with islet autoimmunity was detected with long-duration enterovirus B infections, indicated by prolonged shedding of the same virus in multiple stool samples. In contrast, multiple independent short-term enterovirus B infections without prolonged shedding neither correlated with autoimmunity nor with T1D progression.</p>
