<p>Highly sensitive virus-captured sequencing methods from stool samples also confirm the association of enteroviral infection with islet autoimmunity [
 <xref rid="B72-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], and enteroviral amplification-enrichment cultures of leukocytes and of cells from duodenal biopsies showed the correlation of enteroviruses B and T1D. A significant association between enterovirus and subsequent risk of autoimmunity in celiac disease was also found in TEDDY and other previous studies [

 <xref rid="B100-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>], where enteroviral positive stool samples correlated with celiac disease only after introduction of gluten to the babiesâ€™ diet [
 <xref rid="B57-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], and higher amounts of gluten consumption potentiated the effect of enteroviruses on the risk of coeliac disease autoimmunity [
 <xref rid="B100-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>], indicating the necessity of the initial autoimmunity trigger.
