<p>T1D is associated with over 60 genetic risk regions across the human genome, identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [
 <xref rid="B124-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>], and these T1D-linked SNPs alter the expression of over 200 genes [
 <xref rid="B125-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>] involved in Œ≤-cell inflammation, function and destruction, immune activation and signaling, including viral response, Toll-like receptor, cytokines and NF-ùúÖB signaling. Among them, several risks as well as protective single nucleotide polymorphisms within the interferon-induced helicase-1 (
 <italic>IFIH1</italic>) gene, which encodes the melanoma differentiation associated protein 5 (MDA5), have been identified in large studies [

 <xref rid="B126-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. IFIH1 is a cytosolic sensor of single strand viral RNA from the picornavirus family. It facilitates the interferon (IFN) response and activates the immune cells towards viral response downstream of TLR signaling. Importantly, expression of the IFN signature genes as well as the type 1 IFN response is increased in children before the T1D-associated auto-antibody conversion [

 <xref rid="B127-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>], which suggests a primary role of IFN signals in the activation of autoimmunity and the potentiation of Œ≤-cell destruction. In Œ≤-cells, IFN signaling leads to HLA class I hyperexpression, which is a well-studied path for T1D initiation [

 <xref rid="B128-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. 
 <italic>IFIH1</italic> is ultimately associated with signals from enteroviruses; its mRNA expression is increased by CVB3 and CVB4 infection in human islets [
 <xref rid="B114-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>] and by synthetic double-stranded RNA Poly(I:C) in INS-1E Œ≤-cells [
 <xref rid="B129-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>], while 
 <italic>IFIH1</italic> silencing potently lowers the chemokine response in Œ≤-cells [
 <xref rid="B129-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. Foremost, a diabetes-associated 
 <italic>IFIH1</italic> polymorphism upregulates the IFN signature in human pancreatic islets in response to Coxsackievirus infection [
