<p>The upregulation of IFN-inducible genes, including 
 <italic>IFIH1</italic> in genetically predisposed children, was also associated with previous upper respiratory tract infections and with increased monocytic expression of the sialic-acid binding immunoglobulin-like-lectin Siglec-1 [

Through the recognition of specific glycans on the cell surface, Siglecs promote cellular interactions within the immune system and with sialylated pathogens; they are important regulators of the innate and adaptive immune systems and serve as checkpoints for immune regulation and autoimmunity [

 <xref rid="B132-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. Several members of the Siglec family do not only play a role in immune–cell–pathogen interactions, but also on the level of the β-cells regulate the inflammatory response. Siglec-7 is down-regulated in both β-cells in the pancreas from patients with T1D and T2D as well as in activated immune cells. Overexpression of Siglec-7 in diabetic islets balances the immune response by reducing cytokine production and monocyte migration, which both facilitate β-cell survival and function [
 <xref rid="B133-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. The evolving field of Siglecs provides a further target to modulate the excess inflammatory/IFN response as a major facilitator for autoimmunity and β-cell failure.
