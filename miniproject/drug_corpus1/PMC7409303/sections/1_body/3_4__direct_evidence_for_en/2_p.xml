<p>In newly diagnosed T1D patients of the DiViD study (3â€“9 weeks after T1D onset), VP1 was detected in biopsy pancreases in all patients in 1.7% of the islets. It is possible that such a 100% correlation of VP1 and T1D was observed because of a higher expression at diagnosis, which would decline at later stages [

Viral RNA in the frozen pancreas was only found in one T1D patient and from cultured enriched islets in only 4 of 6 patients at a very low concentration (by PCR, &gt;40 cycles), which shows no evidence of an acute but, if any, rather a low-grade infection. In confirmation with several previous studies [
 <xref rid="B65-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], classical RT-PCR was not sensitive enough for the analysis of a viral infection, which only occurs in few cells within the whole pancreas. RNA sequencing from the whole pancreas could not identify any viral sequences, again suggesting the threshold of the presence of viral sequences compared to all other genes as sparse to be identified by classical RNASeq methods. Nevertheless, several approaches have confirmed the presence of enteroviruses both in the circulation and in islets of T1D patients [

 <xref rid="B70-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], however, because of a very low expression, many attempts have failed to characterize the localization and the specific enteroviral sequences through PCR-based methods in the pancreas.
