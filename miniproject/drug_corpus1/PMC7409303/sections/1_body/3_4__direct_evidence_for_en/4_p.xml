<p>Viruses that have a specific tropism within the islets could cause the onset of the disease not only by direct cytolysis but also by triggering the host immune response [

The presence of several CVB viruses, including CVB4, together with the Coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CAR) in the β-cell, support the connection of viral infection with T1D. Coxsackieviruses induce a persistent, slowly-replicating infection; this may result from alterations to the viral genome during the progress of infection, such as naturally occurring 5′-deletions [

 <xref rid="B76-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Because of several such limitations to the detection of enteroviruses, we have previously established an adapted method to target single RNA molecules with short (~20 nucleotides) fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides in situ. Probes consist of a mixture of 40 short oligonucleotides covering the whole length of the viral genome and anneal to common regions of the RNA genome of the coxsackievirus family [

Short labeled oligo RNA probes are more resistant to RNAse, and RNA detection is less affected by target RNA degradation and fragmentation. Through the availability of the well-characterized cohort of human pancreatic donor tissue established by nPOD [
