<p>Using this method, we have analyzed whole pancreas sections and quantified enteroviral mRNA by unbiased scans and identified viral mRNA distributed not specifically within or in proximity to islets; enteroviral mRNA was evident through individual dots in single cells throughout the pancreas (

 <xref rid="B82-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>], it is difficult to find what we search for in the dark, and thus, it is possible that several antibody-based stainings were preferentially observed in islets, although the staining has been carefully re-evaluated and VP1 correlates with hyperexpression of HLA class I in islets [
 <xref rid="B83-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. The commonly used DAKO-VP1-Ab detects several other antigens in addition to VP1 and/or exocrine enzymes may degrade enteroviral proteins and thus prevent their detection in the pancreas [
