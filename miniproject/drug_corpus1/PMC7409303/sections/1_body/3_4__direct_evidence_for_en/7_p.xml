<p>Rather than from the virus itself, β-cell destruction may result from “bystander” damage [

 <xref rid="B90-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>], where coxsackie virus infection may lead to a storm of inflammation in cells like the β-cell, which carry an enormous amount of pattern recognition (such as TLR3 and TLR4), cytokine (such as IL-1R1), and chemokine receptors on their surface [
 <xref rid="B44-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Their activation by viruses and by cellular viral responses stop viral replication on one hand, but induce tissue damage on the other. In addition, interferons accelerate expression of surface HLA-I molecules and thus activation of auto-reactive T-cells against β-cells (

 <xref rid="B89-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>] is limited to viral infection [
 <xref rid="B91-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], where β-cell apoptosis is triggered by viral response products, e.g., cytokines and chemokines [
 <xref rid="B92-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Such a pro-inflammatory environment has also been shown to alter the composition of the islet extracellular matrix, which may further facilitate T-cell migration towards pancreatic islets [
 <xref rid="B93-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. The specific and severe β-cell destruction then occurs through their special vulnerability towards an array of cytokines and chemokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β, interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and CXCL10 [
 <xref rid="B94-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>], which induce β-cell destruction in response to viral infection in human islets [

 <xref rid="B95-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-01017-f004">Figure 4</xref>). It is also possible that multiple infections during childhood each time contribute to potentiating the immune response and then lead to β-cell destruction, autoimmunity and T1D.
