<p>Each of the single factors as a sole initiator for autoimmunity and T1D have been debated and thus, such single factor is unlikely to cause T1D. Early studies from Finland within the DiMe and DIPP cohorts have shown the association of enterovirus infection with autoimmunity and T1D [

 <xref rid="B27-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], while this is not supported by previous results from the DAISY [
 <xref rid="B30-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and BABYDIAB [
 <xref rid="B31-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] cohorts. Another example comes from vitamin D: while several studies show a correlation of lower levels of vitamin D with the onset of T1D [
 <xref rid="B25-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], this was not confirmed by others, and several formulations of vitamin D supplementation could not reduce disease progression [
 <xref rid="B33-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Crucially, it may be the seasonal change in vitamin D metabolism together with changes in the expression of its vitamin D receptor [
 <xref rid="B34-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] that serve as the additional factors for autoimmune disease predisposition. Using large gene expression datasets from the German BABYDIET, Australia, United Kingdom/Ireland, United States and Iceland cohorts, a previous study also shows seasonal patterns in gene regulation [
 <xref rid="B34-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Gene expression of both the vitamin D receptor and the anti-inflammatory circadian clock regulator transcription factor, BMAL1 (ARNTL1), is lowest in the winter [
 <xref rid="B34-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], which promotes inflammation through increased levels of soluble IL-6 receptor and C-reactive protein [
 <xref rid="B34-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Several studies in mice and isolated islets show that BMAL1 depletion impairs β-cell survival and disturbs a coordinated insulin secretion which may trigger the onset of diabetes due to defective β-cell function [
 <xref rid="B35-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Conversely, BMAL1 is severely depleted in islets from patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and disrupted by IL-1β exposure of islets in vitro [
 <xref rid="B37-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This suggests a direct causative role for depleted BMAL1 in inflammation and β-cell failure. Physiologically, the circadian clock would inhibit inflammation and also prevent the cell from hypoxia, as shown in the heart [
 <xref rid="B38-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Thus, reduction in BMAL1 disables the cellular antioxidant response and increases HIF-1α and ROS accumulation in immune cells, which would further induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines, i.e., TNFα, IL-1β [
 <xref rid="B39-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] from macrophages, dendritic cells as well as from β-cells themselves [
 <xref rid="B40-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The direct cross-talk of transcription factors regulating clock genes (BMAL; ARNTL1) and hypoxia (HIF1α; ARNT) can have fatal consequences. Both belong to same family of PAS-domain, helix-loop-helix transcription factors and share some overlapping DNA binding sites [
 <xref rid="B38-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. HIF-1α mutations have not only been shown for T1D but also for many other autoimmune diseases [
 <xref rid="B43-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and thus again link seasonal changes with genetic predisposition for autoimmune disease. This is especially deleterious for the β-cell with its very low expression of antioxidants and high expression of cytokine and Toll-like receptors [
 <xref rid="B44-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Any increased inflammation may predispose a body to β-cell failure, and thus it may not be the seasonal virus spread alone which causes auto-immunity but rather the pro-inflammatory environment in the host which potentiates β-cell failure with subsequent diabetes initiation. As such, this may only happen in genetically predisposed individuals. All three events together (viruses, the pro-inflammatory milieu in the host and the genetic profile) and their seasonality in their regulation may then initiate β-cell failure and auto-immunity.
