<p>In the similar way, most autoimmune diseases “go viral” seasonally, e.g., T1D, multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), autoimmune liver diseases (ALDs), autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), coeliac disease, Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) [

Such seasonality disappears in regions closer to the equator. Unfortunately, sparse epidemiological data are available from equatorial regions [
