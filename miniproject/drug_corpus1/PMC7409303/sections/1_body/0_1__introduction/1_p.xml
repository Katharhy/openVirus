Saying this is the same for diabetes as well as for any other autoimmune disease: (1) we do not really know what the real cause of the disease is and (2) apparently, there is no single cause for the disease. Thus, this phrase does describe T1D: it results from multiple triggers, which makes the disease very complex.
