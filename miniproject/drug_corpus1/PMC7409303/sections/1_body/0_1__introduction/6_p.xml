<p>Obviously, T1D is not an acute infectious viral disease, as scenarios of massive infection in the pancreas have never been observed in T1D. The virus is lytic to β-cells in vitro, but such has not been detected in vivo, where rather a persistent infection may trigger the immune response. Most of us have had an asymptomatic enteroviral infection during childhood which did not end up causing T1D. With their positive-sense single stranded RNA genome, coxsackieviruses from the family of picornaviridae are widely spread viruses all over the world ranging from 7–22% in Greece and up to 50% and 80% in Montreal and in parts of China, respectively [
