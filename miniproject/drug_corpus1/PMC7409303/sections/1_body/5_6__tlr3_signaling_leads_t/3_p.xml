<p>Downstream of the viral response pathway is the C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10) which promotes human β-cell apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B94-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. CXCL10 is localized in infected islets [
 <xref rid="B115-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>] in both canonical and fulminant T1D early in disease progression [

 <xref rid="B116-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. The cascade finally ends in the secretion of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines, which further potentiate inflammation and β-cell apoptosis pathways (
