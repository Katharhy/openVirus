<p>TLRs are used by the immune system for pathogen clearance. The endosomal receptor TLR3, found not only in immune but also various non-immune cells such as the β-cell, is one of the signaling complexes implicated in viral-mediated β-cell death, is highly expressed in the pancreas of patients with T1D [

 <xref rid="B113-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Once viral RNA is recognized by TLR3, the TLR3-TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1)-IFN-regulatory factor (IRF)3/7 signaling axis is activated [
 <xref rid="B114-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]; the virus initially induces AKT [
