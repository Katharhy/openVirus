<p>Several studies in mice have shown that TLR3 is an essential element of T1D development in response to viral infection. As a detector of viral signatures, TLR3 is needed for the anti-viral response, and, naturally, will promote cytokine signaling. These two apparent conflicting effects towards beta-cell survival may provide reasons for various different results in mice and imply that a highly balanced physiological function of viral sensors is necessary to prevent damage to β-cells. TLR3 signals contribute to the host’s survival, as CVB4 [

 <xref rid="B118-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>] infections are highly mortal to TLR3 knockout mice due to the impaired antiviral response machinery. Although they present a reduced pro-inflammatory milieu, surviving mice develop T1D [
