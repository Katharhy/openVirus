<p>In summary, pattern recognition receptors identify viral antigens to trigger the host defense. TLR3 signaling through multiple loops leads to virus-mediated inflammatory response, and ongoing inflammation further potentiates the cytokine response through multiple cytokine and chemokine receptors expressed in the β-cell, and finally to β-cell apoptosis in vitro. However, as many examples show, mutations in a single PRR, e.g., TLR3, or its activation alone will not ultimately cause T1D, but may rather act within a pro-inflammatory network to potentiate T1D progression (
