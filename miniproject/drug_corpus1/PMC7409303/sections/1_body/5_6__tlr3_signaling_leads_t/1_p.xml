<p>The innate immune response to virus infection initiates as a fingerprint with the sensing of viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP). Such recognition is mediated by the activation of host’s pattern recognition receptors (PRR) such as Toll-like receptors (TLR) on the surface of cellular membranes and cytosolic receptors including RIG-like receptors (RLR), nucleotide-binding domain-leucine-rich repeat-containing molecules (NLR) and RNA-activated protein kinase R (PKR) [
