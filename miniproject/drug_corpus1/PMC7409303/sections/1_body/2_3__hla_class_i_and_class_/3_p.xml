<p>The very early appearance of asymptomatic autoimmunity and its strong relationship with age and disease severity was found in all the large prospective T1D studies: BABYDIAB, DIPP (Diabetes Prediction and Prevention) and TEDDY (The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young). It is detected by any of the ICA, IAA, GAD, IA-2 and ZnT8 auto-antibodies and follows the exponential decay model starting in the first year of life in genetically at-risk children in affected families with first-degree relatives with T1D (FDR). Indeed, children who developed autoimmunity in the first year of life had the highest risk of T1D [
