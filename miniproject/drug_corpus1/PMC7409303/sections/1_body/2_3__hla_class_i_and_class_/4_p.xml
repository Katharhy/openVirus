<p>The strong correlation of HLA-genetic susceptibility as a prerequisite for enteroviral infection-associated islet autoimmunity was depicted many years ago in the Finish DiMe study: children with a high-risk HLA allele converted to ICA positivity during enteroviral infection more often than those without HLA risk [

Further results from the DiMe (Childhood Diabetes in Finland) and DIPP studies show increased islet auto-antibody appearance with enterovirus infections during pregnancy and early childhood and their correlation to T1D progression [
