<p>Confirmed in all three major T1D pancreatic tissue biobanks (EADB, Exeter Archival Diabetes Biobank; DiViD, Diabetes Virus Detection Study; and nPOD, Network for Pancreatic Organ Donors with Diabetes), the age of onset determines the number of cases with any left residual beta-cells, i.e., an older age of T1D onset strongly correlates with more remaining β-cells and children with diabetes onset &lt; 7 years have fewer β-cells left than at the onset 7–12, and again fewer than those diagnosed at &gt;13 years [
 <xref rid="B52-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Usually seen near disease onset, i.e., within the first 7 years of diagnosis and found located and “hyperexpressed” on the surface of β-cells in T1D [
 <xref rid="B53-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], HLA I molecules present antigens to activated cytotoxic CD8 T-cells which then lead to islet infiltration and all together to subsequent β-cell destruction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-01017-f002">Figure 2</xref>). It is therefore possible that such HLA I hyperexpression may coincide with β-cell failure. Although the stimulus for β-cell specific HLA I hyperexpression in vivo is not clear yet, it is often associated with enteroviral infection, indirectly reported based on viral capsid protein immunofluorescence in insulin containing islet (ICI) clusters [
 <xref rid="B52-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] as well as insulitis. Histological analyses of the human T1D pancreas show all, viral capsid VP1, IFNα, the major cytokine induced by viral infection, and HLA I expressed in or within the islet proximity [

 <xref rid="B56-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. IFNα-mediated HLA class I induces inflammation and ER stress, but is alone insufficient to cause beta-cell apoptosis. Additional exposure of islets to the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β potentiates β-cell apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B56-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], suggesting the necessity of a complex pro-inflammatory milieu to induce β-cell failure.
