 <xref rid="B47-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Children diagnosed at a very young age usually have a more severe T1D than those diagnosed as teenagers or young adults. Early T1D onset (â‰¤5 years) can predict T1D severity, especially for diabetic complications such as retinopathy [
 <xref rid="B50-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. One could assume from these studies that the predisposing HLA class I alleles do not only correlate with age, but also with diabetes severity, although this has not been directly addressed in previous studies. For a possible similar correlation of HLA class II risk alleles with age of onset or severity of disease, only few study results are available. Valdes et al. reported that a DRB1-DQB1 HLA class II at risk allele contributes to the age at onset of T1D. However, a pure prediction of the disease onset from HLA alleles alone has been difficult among populations, since many more factors and their combination, i.e., T1D genetics and auto-antibodies play a major role [
