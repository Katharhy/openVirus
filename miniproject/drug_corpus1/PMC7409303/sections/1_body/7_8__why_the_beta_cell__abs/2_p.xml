<p>One underlying reason could be the absence of YAP in adult β-cells. During endocrine cell differentiation, YAP is suppressed as soon as Ngn3 is expressed [

 <xref rid="B140-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. The lack of YAP expression correlates with the extremely low rate of β-cell proliferation and β-cell quiescence after birth and their limited regenerative capability [
 <xref rid="B141-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. The Hippo element YAP is sufficient to wake β-cells up from quiescence; re-expression of constitutively active YAP leads to a robust induction of human β-cell proliferation [

 <xref rid="B142-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. Similarly, TAZ is extremely low but detectable in both adult human and mouse β- and α-cells [

 <xref rid="B144-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. Bioinformatic analysis identified YAP as a selectively repressed (“disallowed”) gene in the pancreatic islet [
 <xref rid="B145-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]; it is more repressed in purified mouse β-cells compared to α-cells [
 <xref rid="B146-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. Now, we hypothesize this as the reason not only for the much lower proliferative capacity of β-cells compared to any other endocrine cell type, but also for the extreme and suicidal viral response. In contrast, the Hippo kinase MST1 represses antiviral signaling and acts as negative regulator of the antiviral defense by its direct interaction and phosphorylation of IRF3 and inhibition of TBK1 [
 <xref rid="B137-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]; however, underlying mechanisms as well as consequences on host survival are not known. Previous data from our and other labs show that Hippo is an important regulator of β-cell function and survival [
 <xref rid="B139-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>,
 <xref rid="B140-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>,
 <xref rid="B147-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>], and therefore it may also be involved in the pathological viral response associated with T1D.
