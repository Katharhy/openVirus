<p>Despite certain viral tropisms, viral receptors are distributed in many cells in all organs and IFN-induced viral defense mechanisms are in place, which (i) hinder viral reproduction and (ii) attract cytotoxic T-cells. In the largely non-replicative β-cells, such an increase in the IFN response seems deleterious. The intracellular antiviral defence is initiated by TBK1-IRF3-mediated interferon production (see

 <xref rid="B137-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>], which negatively regulate and thus balance the antiviral immune response. Recent studies have linked YAP/TAZ with antiviral sensing [

 <xref rid="B137-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. YAP/TAZ associate with both TBK1 and the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase (IKKε), thereby blocking their activation and subsequently inhibiting IRF3-stimulated transcription of viral response genes. Thus, YAP/TAZ, besides their well-known function in the regulation of cellular contact, development, growth and proliferation as effectors of the Hippo pathway [
 <xref rid="B138-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>], can regulate the host’s cellular response. In the absence of this YAP regulation, virus sensing would trigger an extremely high and uncoordinated cytokine response, as happens in T1D, where virus-infected β-cells show highly increased cytokine production resulting in a vicious cycle and bystander damage of β-cells through their cytokine receptors (
