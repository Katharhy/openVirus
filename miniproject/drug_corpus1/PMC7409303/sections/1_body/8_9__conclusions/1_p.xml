<p>There is large evidence for enteroviral infection initiating the auto-immune response and subsequent β-cell destruction in genetically predisposed individuals, where a viral response is boosted. As an especially vulnerable cell to inflammatory destruction and apoptosis, autoimmunity is directed to the β-cell, causing T1D. Although enteroviruses selectively and severely destroy β-cells in vitro, they are just one stimulating factor in the huge complexity of T1D, and thus, without an unphysiological genetic predisposition towards immune activation and β-cells’ inability for compensation, they would probably not cause T1D. Therefore, it is possible that enteroviral vaccination and antiviral therapies for T1D [
 <xref rid="B148-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>], although they would take away the stimulus, may alone not be sufficient to cure the disease and require combination with further β-cell protection efficacy. This is reminiscent of gluco- and lipotoxicity-mediated β-cell failure associated with T2D [

Although highly toxic for the β-cell in vitro, elevated glucose and free fatty acids only induce some alterations and systemic compensation as long-term consequences of obesity in vivo. However, in genetically predisposed individuals, they finally lead to T2D [
 <xref rid="B150-microorganisms-08-01017" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. Similarly, neither viral infections alone nor predisposing genetic polymorphisms alone ultimately lead to T1D. As there is no single cause for T1D, we will probably not be able to successfully cure diabetes with a single drug. Rather, forces need to join for testing the efficacy of combination therapies, for example antiviral strategies [
