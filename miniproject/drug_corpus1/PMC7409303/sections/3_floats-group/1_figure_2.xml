  <p>β-cell destruction in T1D is associated with viral response pathways. β-cells are highly vulnerable to enteroviral infection. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Several genetic mutations in the viral response pathway in T1D may lead to the potentiation in viral response. (
   <bold>B</bold>) A consequent “storm” of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines lead to HLA I hyperexpression and attract cytotoxic T-cells and macrophages and subsequently to the loss of β-cells (
   <bold>C</bold>) and manifestation of T1D.
