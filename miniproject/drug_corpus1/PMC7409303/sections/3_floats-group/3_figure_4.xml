  <p>β-cell in the storm. Our hypothetical model on how chronic potentiation of proinflammatory pathways leads to β-cell destruction. Coxsackieviruses enter the β-cell through the Coxsackie–adenovirus receptor (CAR) and bind to endosomal TLR3. While the virus promotes the AKT-JNK axis for initial host cell survival, parallel activation of viral response pathways through PKR-TBK-IRF3 leads to the transcriptional activation of the IFN response and production of interferons, which increase surface MHCs, recognized by cytotoxic CD8- and CD4-T-cells causing “bystander damage”, and β-cell apoptosis through a “storm” of cytokines and chemokines, which all find their receptors on the surface of the β-cell, and a vicious cycle is initiated with the full activation of the apoptotic machinery including JNK-MST1-Caspase 3-NFκB. Bacterial toxins as well as chronically elevated free fatty acids (FFA) are also associated with β-cell damage and act through TLR4 activation and similar downstream pro-inflammatory pathways. While many cells can counteract such damage cycles with a potent survival machinery, the β-cell is deficient of the Hippo terminator YAP, which would balance the viral IRF3 response. Furthermore, Siglec-7, which balances immune activation, is diminished in a chronic diabetogenic pro-inflammatory milieu in the β-cell.</p>
