 <p>We would like to thank Kaarthik Sridharan, University of Bremen, for his input and help with manuscript editing. We are grateful for the continuous support from the Network for Pancreatic Organ Donors with Diabetes (nPOD), a collaborative type 1 diabetes research project sponsored by JDRF and Organ Procurement Organizations (OPO) partnering with nPOD to provide research resources (

Without this excellent collection of well-preserved and well-characterized pancreases, lots of the studies discussed in this review would not have been possible. We further thank all members of the nPOD-Virus group headed by Alberto Pugliese, University of Miami for collaboration, discussion and support.
