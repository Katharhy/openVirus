<p>We identified all patients managed at WFBH-WS with a diagnosis of acute hepatitis B during the study period using the institutional infection prevention information system (TheraDoc) database. Then we evaluated each case using electronic health records (EHRs; Epic 2017 HYPERSPACE) for access to internal and external clinical data. Based on the 2012 Centers for Disease Control and Preventionâ€™s case definition, we defined a case of acute hepatitis B with the following criteria: (1) a positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and (2) either jaundice or elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels &gt;100 IU/L without alternative explanation and (3) either (a) an acute illness with a discrete onset of any sign or symptom consistent with acute viral hepatitis (eg, fever, headache, malaise, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain) without alternative explanation or (b) a documented negative HBsAg within the prior 6 months or (c) a positive hepatitis B core (HBc) IgM antibody [
