 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A protracted–severe course was defined as either &gt;4 weeks of an elevated INR (≥1.5) or total bilirubin &gt;3 mg/dL (or direct &gt;1.5 mg/dL) or clinical evidence of encephalopathy or ascites. The lack of these criteria defined an uncomplicated course. Following AASLD guidelines, indications for anti-HBV treatment included protracted–severe course, and acute liver failure was defined as an elevated INR (≥1.5) with evidence of altered sensorium in a patient without preexisting cirrhosis. HBsAg positivity for at least 6 months after the initial HBsAg-positive result defined chronic HBV infection.
