<p>Our data suggest that IVDU has contributed to an increase in acute hepatitis B cases in our community at least since 2017. This coincides with a national uptrend in drug abuse, an epidemic ongoing for more than a decade [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Most patients were white, consistent with national data with regards to both acute HBV and IVDU [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6â€“8</xref>]. The majority were male, unlike the current opioid epidemic, but consistent with national data on acute HBV [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This is not surprising, as sexual transmission, in particular among men who have sex with men, is the most frequent HBV infection route in the United States [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A recent national study highlighted the high prevalence of undetectable immunity against HBV among adults at high risk [
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In the HBV vaccination efforts, new ways of identifying individuals at high risk and additional venues to deliver the vaccine could be considered. On this regard, in our study one-third of the patients had used the hospital emergency room within the prior year, and more than half had psychiatric disease.
