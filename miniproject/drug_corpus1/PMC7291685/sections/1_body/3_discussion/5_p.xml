<p>This study has several limitations. As it is retrospective, some relevant data were missing, which could have caused the exclusion of uncertain cases, and potentially underestimation. It also adds an element of subjectivity that could affect sample validity. Lastly, it is a small sample size from a single medical center, and therefore may not be representative of other practices.</p>
