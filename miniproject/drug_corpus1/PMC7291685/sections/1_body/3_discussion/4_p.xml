<p>Most subjects (53%) were lost to follow-up after the initial encounter, indicating that patients at risk for HBV pose challenges for adequate medical care. For those with follow-up data, 95% cleared the infection, which is consistent with reported clearance rates in adults [

It is unclear if this delay was related to Crohn’s in the absence of immunosuppressive therapy. It suggests, though, that some patients may require monitoring beyond the 6-month hallmark before diagnosing chronic infection. Although our sample was small, age did not affect the elimination of HBsAg, contrary to a prior report [
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Additional studies would help to investigate this, as well as the possibly more severe clinical course in elderly patients suggested by our data.
