<p>Anti-HBc IgM was not available for all patients, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation for case confirmation [

We also observed divergences from national recommendations, as anti-HBV therapy was most often prescribed without indication per the AASLD guidelines. Overtreatment of HBV subjects patients to medication side effects and added costs.
