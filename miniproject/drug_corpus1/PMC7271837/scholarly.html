Abstract</div> <p>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), spreading from Wuhan to worldwide has been emerged since December 2019. Although scientists and researchers have been racing to develop specific therapeutic agents or vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 since the identification of the agent, either a drug or a vaccine has not been approved to treat or to prevent COVID-19 up to date. On the base of historical experiences, Convalescent Plasma (CP), a passive antibody therapy, has been evaluated as a hopeful and potential therapeutic option since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. Immune plasma had been used previously for the treatment of H1N1 influenza virus, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV epidemics successfully. In this scope competent authorities are responsible to set up certain principles and criteria for the collection and clinical use of COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma (CCP). This document has been prepared to aid both for the convalescent plasma suppliers and the clinicians. The first part encompasses the supply of CCP and the second part lead the clinical use of CCP for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 infection.</p> <p>Turkish Ministry of Health developed a guide on collection and clinical use of CCP and created a web-based monitoring system to follow-up the patients treated with convalescent plasma in universal. This follow-up process is thought to be crucial for the creation and development of current and future treatment modalities. This guide would be a pathfinder for clinicians and/or institutions those eager to conduct CCP treatment more effectively.</p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Introduction</div> <p id="par0005">Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause a common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) [<a href="#bib0005">1</a>].</p> <p id="par0010">The novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was isolated from a cluster of patients who developed respiratory tract symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath) in Wuhan Province in late December and named as a new coronavirus COVID-19 [<a href="#bib0010">2</a>]. On 30 January 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) has declared â€œPublic Health Emergency of International Concernâ€� as the 2019-nCoV outbreak continued to be spreaded outside of China and a pandemic on 11 March 2020 to be posed a threat to public health worldwide [<a href="#bib0015">3</a>,<a href="#bib0020">4</a>]. Although the fatality rate of 2019-nCoV was not as high as MERS-CoV it has kept on rather a high rate as the emergence of the outbreak. On the other hand it was likely to be related to all aspects of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 infection that has not been clarified as well as the fact that antiviral treatment for the agent has not been developed yet. Current treatment approaches include supportive therapy, such as prevention and treating seconder infections and complications. In this context, passive immunization has been became the main topic for the treatment based on historical experiences. â€œPassive Immune Transferâ€� is defined as the use of immune plasma for critically ill hospitalized patients for therapeutic purposes. Immune plasma had been used previously for the treatment of 2009â€"2012 H1N1 influenza virus, 2003 SARS-CoV-1 and 2012 MERS-CoV epidemics successfully [<a href="#bib0025">5</a>,<a href="#bib0030">6</a>]. Passive immune antibodies may neutralize viruses or reduce target organ damages. In this scope convalescent plasma or immunoglobulin has been decided to be collected from the patients who had been recovered from COVID-19 to prevent or to treat COVID-19 infection.</p> <p id="par0015">On 28 February 2020, WHO Blood Regulators Network published a position paper on the Use of Convalescent Plasma and Serum or Immune Globulin Concentrates. According to this paper; an organized program, to collect convalescent plasma or serum from recovered patients, could provide a potentially valuable alternative therapy before the availability of effective vaccines and/or antiviral therapies while data on effectiveness and safety of its use are obtained through orderly scientific studies was recommended. WHO has emphasized that those local regulatory authorities should organize administrative and legal arrangements for the collection of plasma or serum [<a href="#bib0035">7</a>].</p> <p id="par0020">Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has worked out on a guidance to provide recommendations to health care providers and investigators on COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma (CCP) during the public health emergency. In this guide, it is recalled that immune plasma has already been studied in other respiratory infections in the past twenty years and stated that the use of CCP might be effective against the infection based on those experiences [<a href="#bib0040">8</a>].</p> <p id="par0025">Since COVID-19 pandemic has been emerged, a number of the scientific studies on vaccine development, the use of existing pharmaceutical agents, or the development of new agents to prevent or to treat infection as well as alternative therapy methods like immune plasma are increasing in day by day. A limited number of studies have been reported the benefits of immune plasma therapy in COVID-19 patients [<a href="#bib0045">[9]</a>, <a href="#bib0050">[10]</a>, <a href="#bib0055">[11]</a>].</p> <p id="par0030">Considering the scientific viewpoints, CCP is an option to treat patients with COVID-19 infection as far as to be collected and stored according to the universal standards. This guide was intended for an additional regulation to support the collection, preparation and clinical use of CCP containing the anti-SARS CoV-2 antibodies for the treatment of COVID-19 patients in Turkey.</p> <div class="supplyofcovid-19convalescentplasma" title="sec"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">1.1</span><div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Patients selection criteria for CCP</div> <p id="par0135">Currently, there is no controlled study available to clearly define the patient group on which the use of CCP is effective. Only case series with a small number of patients have been published to date. In these reports, CCP has been added to the existing treatments in patients who were unresponsive to the existing protocol [<a href="#bib0045">[9]</a>, <a href="#bib0050">[10]</a>, <a href="#bib0055">[11]</a>].</p> <p id="par0140">Duan et al. documented clinical success with the application of CCP to 10 severe COVID-19 patients in 16.5 days (median, range: 11â€"20 days) after the symptoms started. All patients had extensive pulmonary infiltrations and the severity criteria were defined with respiratory distress as; respiratory rate â‰¥30 /min, oxygen saturation &amp;lt; 93 % in resting state, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/oxygen concentration (FiO2) â‰¤ 300 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa). When compared to ten COVID-19 patients who did not receive CCP in the same center, CCP-group had significantly higher rates of survival and recovery with no appreciable adverse effect [<a href="#bib0045">9</a>]. Zang et al. started CCP between 16â€"19 days to four critically ill patients two of which were treated with Vâ€"V ECMO. All four patients (including a pregnant woman) recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection [<a href="#bib0050">10</a>]. Similarly, Shen et al. reported a case series of five critically ill COVID-19 patients. Clinical statuses of all patients were improved after administration of CCP between 10â€"22 days after admission [<a href="#bib0055">11</a>].</p> <p id="par0145">Any serious adverse effects has not been reported in a limited number of observations... However, Fleming and Raabe have emphasized, in their letter to Journal of Medical Virology, that potential adverse events such as allergies, acute lung injury and antibody-dependent enhancement should not be overlooked [<a href="#bib0080">16</a>].</p> <p id="par0150">Convalescent plasma has usually been administered to severely/critically ill patients in the case series reported so far. However, it is not recommended to apply this treatment after the initiation of cytokine storm. In a guidance issued by FDA, CCP is recommended to be administered between 7â€"14 days in COVID-19 patients that comply with the specified criteria [<a href="#bib0040">8</a>].</p> <p id="par0155">The criteria of this guidance for CCP treatment have been determined based on the current literature with the contributions of Turkish scientists Inittialy, CCP is recommended to the confirmed (PCR positive) or probable (clinical/radiological evidence compatible with COVID-19, but PCR test result not yet available) cases with COVID-19 infection who are above 18 years old within the first 14 days of the disease and 7â€"10 days after the symptoms started. It is not recommended beyond 14 days of the disease and the initiation of cytokine storm CCP should not be used in IgA-deficient patients. In case, IgA levels should be tested before the administration of CCP.</p> <p id="par0160">The efficiency of CCP treatment would be improved with correct indication and timing.

Discussion</div> <p id="par0240">Different treatment approaches, including convalescent plasma, are currently being in use based on prior experiences with respiratory viruses since there is no specific therapeutic agent or vaccine for COVID-19 infection. In scope of the COVID-19 outbreak spread to Turkey, convalescent plasma therapy has been included into the treatment protocols of COVID-19 infection in the country as well as in many other countries (17 - 19). In this context, a â€œGuide on Supply and Clinical Use of COVID-19 Immune (Convalescent) Plasmaâ€� has been prepared and published in Turkey in order to standardize the collection, preparation, and use of CCP and to monitor all the processes including the follow-up of the patients those are treated with CCP.</p> <p id="par0245">The content of this guideline has been separated in to two sections. The first part encompasses the supply of CCP and the second part provides the clinical use of CCP for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 infection.</p> <p id="par0250">Various national and international guides were referred to establish donor selection criteria for the eligibility of CCP donation and preparation convalescent plasma [<a href="#bib0040">8</a>,<a href="#bib0070">14</a>,<a href="#bib0085">17</a>]. Candidates that comply with the CCP donor selection criteria were sorted from the electronic health management system of the Turkish Ministry of Health, which was updated for additional questionnaire data for CCP donation. All recovered patients who were considered to meet the criteria for donation were selected and reached via phone at the end of the clinical recovery period, which has been indicated in the guidelines, to ask if they were willing to donate convalescent plasma. The list of the identified eligible volunteer candidates to donate plasma was shared with Turkish Red Crescent to be contacted for donation. An appointment was scheduled for the candidates who were eager to donate plasma. In addition, via social media and websites, to raise wider patients in those recovered from COVID-19 infection were encouraged to donate convalescent plasma. The main goal was to raise wider awareness to reach all donor candidates that are eligible for the convalescent plasma donation.</p> <p id="par0255">Although neutralizing antibody test was indicated as one of the criteria for donor selection, this test was not conducted due to an unavailability in our country. In order to perform neutralizing antibody test after achieving the capacity, blood sample was stored from each plasma donor for the further investigation since it is considered to be critically important in demonstrating the effectiveness of transfused convalescent plasma. With the onset of the outbreak, although plasma inactivation is not routinely performed in our country, pathogen inactivation system is established at Regional Blood Centers in Istanbul and Ankara for CCP, where the outbreak was more intensive.</p> <p id="par0260">The second part of the guideline was prepared for the patients who will receive convalescent plasma therapy. In scope of this section, indications for the clinical use of CCP were defined and the the request form of the CCP was created. In order to follow-up the patients treated with CCP in universal â€œConvalescent Plasma Treatment and Follow-up Care Report Formâ€� was also created. These forms are filled by clinicians for each patient and submitted to the Turkish Ministry of Health via web-based information system to enable to evaluate the effectiveness of convalescent plasma therapy by the authority. This follow-up process is thought to be crucial for the creation and development of current and future treatment modalities.</p> <p id="par0265">Convalescent plasma seems to retain its importance as an alternative treatment method for patients with COVID-19 infection until a specific effective anti-viral agent or vaccine is found. In conclusion, this guideline may be an important reference guide for the collection, preparation and use of CCP, especially with the clinical follow-up section.</p> </div> <div class="funding" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
