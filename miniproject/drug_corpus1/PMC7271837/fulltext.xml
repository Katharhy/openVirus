Although scientists and researchers have been racing to develop specific therapeutic agents or vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 since the identification of the agent, either a drug or a vaccine has not been approved to treat or to prevent COVID-19 up to date. On the base of historical experiences, Convalescent Plasma (CP), a passive antibody therapy, has been evaluated as a hopeful and potential therapeutic option since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. Immune plasma had been used previously for the treatment of H1N1 influenza virus, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV epidemics successfully. In this scope competent authorities are responsible to set up certain principles and criteria for the collection and clinical use of COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma (CCP). This document has been prepared to aid both for the convalescent plasma suppliers and the clinicians. The first part encompasses the supply of CCP and the second part lead the clinical use of CCP for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 infection.</p><p>Turkish Ministry of Health developed a guide on collection and clinical use of CCP and created a web-based monitoring system to follow-up the patients treated with convalescent plasma in universal. This follow-up process is thought to be crucial for the creation and development of current and future treatment modalities. This guide would be a pathfinder for clinicians and/or institutions those eager to conduct CCP treatment more effectively.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwd0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>Convalescent plasma</kwd><kwd>Plasma donation</kwd><kwd>Pandemic</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="par0005">Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause a common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) [<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p id="par0010">The novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was isolated from a cluster of patients who developed respiratory tract symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath) in Wuhan Province in late December and named as a new coronavirus COVID-19 [<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. On 30 January 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) has declared &#x0201c;Public Health Emergency of International Concern&#x0201d; as the 2019-nCoV outbreak continued to be spreaded outside of China and a pandemic on 11 March 2020 to be posed a threat to public health worldwide [<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Although the fatality rate of 2019-nCoV was not as high as MERS-CoV it has kept on rather a high rate as the emergence of the outbreak. On the other hand it was likely to be related to all aspects of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 infection that has not been clarified as well as the fact that antiviral treatment for the agent has not been developed yet. Current treatment approaches include supportive therapy, such as prevention and treating seconder infections and complications. In this context, passive immunization has been became the main topic for the treatment based on historical experiences. &#x0201c;Passive Immune Transfer&#x0201d; is defined as the use of immune plasma for critically ill hospitalized patients for therapeutic purposes. Immune plasma had been used previously for the treatment of 2009&#x02013;2012 H1N1 influenza virus, 2003 SARS-CoV-1 and 2012 MERS-CoV epidemics successfully [<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].

In scope of the COVID-19 outbreak spread to Turkey, convalescent plasma therapy has been included into the treatment protocols of COVID-19 infection in the country as well as in many other countries (17 - 19). In this context, a &#x0201c;Guide on Supply and Clinical Use of COVID-19 Immune (Convalescent) Plasma&#x0201d; has been prepared and published in Turkey in order to standardize the collection, preparation, and use of CCP and to monitor all the processes including the follow-up of the patients those are treated with CCP.</p><p id="par0245">The content of this guideline has been separated in to two sections. The first part encompasses the supply of CCP and the second part provides the clinical use of CCP for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 infection.</p><p id="par0250">Various national and international guides were referred to establish donor selection criteria for the eligibility of CCP donation and preparation convalescent plasma [<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Candidates that comply with the CCP donor selection criteria were sorted from the electronic health management system of the Turkish Ministry of Health, which was updated for additional questionnaire data for CCP donation. All recovered patients who were considered to meet the criteria for donation were selected and reached via phone at the end of the clinical recovery period, which has been indicated in the guidelines, to ask if they were willing to donate convalescent plasma. The list of the identified eligible volunteer candidates to donate plasma was shared with Turkish Red Crescent to be contacted for donation. An appointment was scheduled for the candidates who were eager to donate plasma. In addition, via social media and websites, to raise wider patients in those recovered from COVID-19 infection were encouraged to donate convalescent plasma. The main goal was to raise wider awareness to reach all donor candidates that are eligible for the convalescent plasma donation.</p><p id="par0255">Although neutralizing antibody test was indicated as one of the criteria for donor selection, this test was not conducted due to an unavailability in our country. In order to perform neutralizing antibody test after achieving the capacity, blood sample was stored from each plasma donor for the further investigation since it is considered to be critically important in demonstrating the effectiveness of transfused convalescent plasma. With the onset of the outbreak, although plasma inactivation is not routinely performed in our country, pathogen inactivation system is established at Regional Blood Centers in Istanbul and Ankara for CCP, where the outbreak was more intensive.</p><p id="par0260">The second part of the guideline was prepared for the patients who will receive convalescent plasma therapy. In scope of this section, indications for the clinical use of CCP were defined and the the request form of the CCP was created. In order to follow-up the patients treated with CCP in universal &#x0201c;Convalescent Plasma Treatment and Follow-up Care Report Form&#x0201d; was also created. These forms are filled by clinicians for each patient and submitted to the Turkish Ministry of Health via web-based information system to enable to evaluate the effectiveness of convalescent plasma therapy by the authority. This follow-up process is thought to be crucial for the creation and development of current and future treatment modalities.</p><p id="par0265">Convalescent plasma seems to retain its importance as an alternative treatment method for patients with COVID-19 infection until a specific effective anti-viral agent or vaccine is found. In conclusion, this guideline may be an important reference guide for the collection, preparation and use of CCP, especially with the clinical follow-up section.</p></sec><sec
