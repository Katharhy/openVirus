<p>At present, there are no vaccines or specific pharmacological interventions available to contain the horizontal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, effective COVID-19-specific pharmaceutical interventions and vaccines are not expected to be available for 3–12 months. Therefore, the most effective public health response to the ongoing outbreak is to implement non-pharmacological interventions (NPI) such as early case identification and isolation, vigilant contact tracing of potential secondary cases, travel restrictions and bans, stringent contact reductions, physical (“social”) distancing, improved hygiene, and regular hand washing. Such an approach requires closure of non-essential public spaces, services and facilities, a transition to digital learning modalities for educational institutions, and self-isolation/work from home initiatives for businesses. Modelling estimates indicate that integrated NPIs are likely to achieve the strongest and most rapid effect on lowering the reproductive number and slowing the rate of viral transmission, if implemented early in the outbreak [
