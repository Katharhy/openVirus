<p>The global efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic are primarily aimed to reduce the number and rate of infections, minimize the excessive burden on healthcare systems, and reduce the social and economic impact of the pandemic. These efforts will provide the much-needed respite during the period required for the development, testing, and approval of an effective vaccine. Until vaccines are available, it is likely that non-pharmacological interventions will remain the primary line of defense to contain this pandemic. Therefore, accurate and up-to-date data on the daily number of new cases and the case characteristics can inform modeling of future projections of new cases and planning for anticipated healthcare capacity. Timely and accurate national data on hospital bed and intensive care capacity along with daily census is essential for such planning. National vaccination policies may also impact the severity of the pandemic as it has been hypothesized that universal Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) childhood vaccine may influence the transmission patterns of SARS-CoV-2 as well as COVID-19 morbidity and mortality [
