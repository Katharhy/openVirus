<p>It is certain that COVID-19 will have a significant global impact on the social, cultural, and economic infrastructures that are envisaged to be long lasting and may take many years to recover. Healthcare systems should consider integrating effective regulatory measures to tackle future pandemics. This crucial lesson was learnt by countries which experienced the previous SARS-CoV outbreak and informed the response to this pandemic in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan, for example. Genomic characterization will have implications related to pathogenicity, transmissibility, and response to therapy of the viral isolates for local and global populations. Understanding the genetic makeup of the viral strains is also critical for drug discovery and designing of effective vaccines. To better prepare for the next global pandemic, application of artificial intelligence (AI) should be evaluated to predict and track infections before the outbreak happens. Bluedot Inc., a Canadian AI company for infectious diseases, flagged unusual infection related activity in Wuhan, China and reported the spread nine days before WHO officially declared the outbreak [
