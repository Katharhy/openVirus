    <p>SARS-CoV-2: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2</p>
   </list-item>
   <list-item>
    <p>COVID-19 or Covid-19: Corona virus disease, 2019. COVID-19 is the official name of the disease manifested by SARS-CoV-2.</p>
   </list-item>
   <list-item>
    <p>R
     <sub>0</sub>: Reproduction number that defines the number of secondary cases that will be produced by a single infectious index case in a population that is fully susceptible to the disease. For example, a R
     <sub>0</sub> of 2 means that, on average, one primary index case would infect two other people, generating two secondary cases. Continuous horizontal (human-to-human) transmission will occur if R
     <sub>0</sub> is above the critical threshold of one.

   <list-item>
    <p>Fomite Transmission: A fomite is any inanimate object (i.e., surface) when contaminated with or exposed to infectious agent, can serve as a source to transmit the agent into a new host.</p>
   </list-item>
   <list-item>
    <p>Non-Pharmacological Interventions (NPIs): NPIs are evidence based, non-invasive, mostly policy/regulation driven interventions on human health. NPIs (i.e., physical [“social”] distancing) can be very effective to contain viral shedding.</p>
