<p>The stability of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols as well as on surfaces has been evaluated [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Findings from a series of well-controlled experiments revealed that the virus remained infectious in aerosols throughout the duration of the experiment (3 h; median half-time of 1.1–1.2 h) [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Additionally, in relation to surfaces, SARS-CoV-2 was found to be most stable on plastic and stainless steel with infectious virus detected up to 72 h post-application and no infectious virus was found on copper or cardboard after 4 and 24 h, respectively [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In this experimental model, SARS-CoV-2 exhibited similar stability to SARS-CoV. Therefore, the differences in the epidemiological trends of the 2002–2003 SARS-CoV outbreak and the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are more likely due to other factors such as high viral loads in the upper respiratory tract and the potential for individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 to shed and transmit the virus whilst asymptomatic [

 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Overall, the findings indicate that continued aerosol and fomite transmission (see 
 <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="viruses-12-00526-box001">Box 1</xref>) of SARS-CoV-2 is highly plausible as the virus remains infectious in droplets for numerous hours and on surfaces for up to three days [

 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This has now raised the concern that airborne transmission might be occurring [

 <xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], though epidemiological evidence minimizes the relevance of such transmission to disease spread [
