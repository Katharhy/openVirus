<p>Sequences of SARS-CoV-2 have now been reported from many parts of the world, and these data have proved useful in tracking the global spread of the virus [

 <xref rid="viruses-12-00526-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for resources related to SARS-CoV-2 genomics). For example, an initial analysis of 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes identified two major subtypes (which were designated L and S) that are well-defined by two different single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. RNA viruses tend to harbour error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerases which make occurrence of mutations and recombination events rather frequent [
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. This might play a role in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Within Wuhan, China, the L type was found in ~70% of cases and was observed to be the more aggressive and contagious form compared to the original S type [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The virus has further mutated and expanded into numerous strains and clusters (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00526-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The geographical diversity of different strains may help correlate COVID-19-related severity, mortality rate, and treatment options. For example, using a phylogenetic network analysis approach on 160 full-length genomes, a recent study has shown that the virus seems to be evolving into three distinct clusters, with A being the ancestral type closest to the bat genome and found mostly in Americas and Europe along with the C type, while B being the most common type in East Asia [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 should also shed light on the origins of regional outbreaks, global dispersion, and epidemiological history of the virus (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00526-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. More importantly, in case of an inability to diagnose infections empirically due to the speed of epidemics or lack of test kits, such as the case with COVID-19, genomic epidemiology could be used to estimate virus rate of replication in the population as well as burden of infection, allowing healthcare professionals to make urgent policy decisions appropriately. There is ongoing work geared towards mapping the spread of different SARS-CoV-2 strains across the world.
