<p>SARS-CoV-2 is a β-coronavirus similar to the viruses that cause SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome). Human coronaviruses are not new and have been identified in the population since the late 1960s, causing mild symptoms similar to common colds [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Of the seven virus species known, four infect the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms, while three are associated with the lower respiratory tract, causing severe disease, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and now SARS-CoV-2 (reviewed in Lu et al.) [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with a non-segmented genome ~30 kb in size [

The viral genome codes for 16 non-structural proteins (Nsps) required for virus replication and pathogenesis, four structural proteins, including envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), and spike (S) glycoprotein important for virus subtyping and response to vaccines, and nine other accessory factors [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00526-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The first SARS-CoV-2 genome was published on 24 January 2020, only a few weeks into the outbreak [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and exhibited genomic and phylogenetic similarity to SARS-CoV, particularly in the S gene and receptor-binding domain (RBD), indicating the capability of direct human-to-human transmission. The genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 shows that, although it is 75–80% identical to SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], it is even more closely related to several bat coronaviruses, in particular the Bat SARS-related coronavirus SARSr-CoV RaTG13 [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Phylogenetic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 genomes have identified bats as the primary reservoir of SARS-like coronaviruses [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] displaying high sequence similarity (96.2%) between BatCoV and SARS-CoV-2 genomes [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Sequence analysis of the viral spike protein further suggests new mutations in its RBD determine not only the host range but also the cellular tropism of the virus [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Interestingly, a similar observation was made in viruses from pangolin SARSr-CoVs, one of the putative intermediate host species that may have been used by SARS-CoV-2 for its species jump into humans [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. A few months prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the Pangolin-CoV whole genome was sequenced from a dead Malayan Pangolin (
 <italic>Manis javanica</italic>) that showed 91.02% and 90.55% identical genome sequences to SARS-CoV-2 and BatCoV RaTG13, respectively [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The sequence analysis also revealed that the S1 protein of Pangolin-CoV was much more closely related to SARS-CoV-2 than to RaTG13. Whilst these findings suggest Pangolin species as a reservoir of coronaviruses, the analysis does not prove the potential of Pangolin as the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2.
