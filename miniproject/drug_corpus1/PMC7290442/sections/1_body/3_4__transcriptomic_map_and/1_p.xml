<p>The transcriptome profile of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from COVID-19 patients has recently been constructed using both ”long read DNA/RNA (Nanopore) sequencing” and “sequencing by synthesis” techniques [

 <xref rid="viruses-12-00526-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing and OMICs related resources). Direct RNA sequencing (without requiring reverse transcription) has further allowed detection of RNA modifications on the genomic RNA (
