<p>In humans, the 
 <italic>ACE2</italic> gene encodes the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2. Evidence from recent studies suggests that ACE2 is the host receptor for the novel SARS-CoV-2 similar to SARS-CoV [

 <xref rid="B47-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the ACE2 receptor (via the S protein) [
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] is 10â€“20-fold higher compared to SARS-CoV, which may be one of the reasons for the higher human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The binding between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 has been confirmed by multiple recent independent studies [

 <xref rid="B46-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. ACE2 is primarily found in the lower respiratory tract of humans on epithelial cells lining the lung alveoli and bronchioles as well as the endothelial cells and myocytes of pulmonary blood vessels, partly explaining the severe respiratory syndrome associated with these viruses [
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Its expression in the nasal epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract has recently been confirmed using single cell RNAseq data, suggesting another reason for the high transmission rates of the virus [
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. ACE2 is also found on the enterocytes in the small intestines, which may further explain the gastrointestinal symptoms associated with the viral infection as well as its detection in faeces [
 <xref rid="B50-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In a recent study, it has been shown that the 
 <italic>ACE2</italic> gene displays single nucleotide polymorphims with differential allele frequency accross the globe [
 <xref rid="B51-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The allele frequency for the host gene was also shown to be different between males and females.
