<p>The viral spike (S) protein is responsible for viral entry into susceptible cells by interacting with the ACE2 receptor [
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This process requires “priming” of the S protein by the host transmembrane serine protease 2 (
 <italic>TMPRSS2</italic>) which cleaves the S protein into two functional subunits: S1 and S2. The S1 subunit then is able to interact with the ACE2 receptor, while the S2 subunit facilitates viral fusion with the host cell membrane, allowing virus entry into the target cell [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00526-f001">Figure 1</xref>a). The current knowledge of the cellular infection pathway involving ACE2 and TMPRSS2 thus provide good candidates for therapeutics, such as antibodies that can interfere with virus attachment and fusion with target cells (such as protease inhibitors).
