<p>After cell entry, the virus RNA transcript produces nonstructural proteins (Nsp1 through Nsp16) using two open reading frames (ORF1a and 1b, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00526-f001">Figure 1</xref>a). A recent study on proteinâ€“protein interaction mapping using mass spectrometry identified 332 SARS-CoV-2-human protein interactions, including 69 interactions that can be targeted by existing FDA-approved drugs [

We observed one interesting similarity in both the transcriptomic and proteomic studies, where the last reading frame (ORF10) expression was extremely low. Although the transcriptomic study questioned the annotation of ORF10 due to extremely low RNA expression, the proteomic analysis identified strong interaction of ORF10 with CUL2 complex, an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex that mediates ubiquitination of target proteins [

 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This suggests that the virus may be able to subvert this complex and use it for degradation of host restriction factors that limit virus replication, making it a good target for drug development against the virus.
