<p>Given the need to find effective treatment for symptomatic patients, the approach of repurposing old drugs with antiviral properties and agents approved or under investigation for other viral infections has been adopted. In the abscence of a vaccine, WHO recently launched the SOLIDARITY trial which is an international clinical trial to address this challenge. The drugs included in this trial are lopinavir and ritonavir, lopinavir and ritonavir plus interferon beta as well as chloroquine, and remdesivir. The roles of existing antiretroviral drugs and pathways in COVID-19 treatment are as follows:

    <bold>Lopinavir (LPV)-Ritonavir (RTV) combination (Kaletra):</bold> This is an FDA-approved drug for HIV-1 treatment. Lopinavir is a protease inhibitor that inhibits virus particle maturation, a late step in HIV-1 replication, while ritonavir helps boost the activity of lopinavir by inhibiting CYP3A enzymes that slows down the rate at which lopinavir is broken down in the liver [
    <xref rid="B69-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Findings from in vitro and animal studies against both SARS and MERS indicate its potential for COVID-19 treatment [

    <xref rid="B72-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Lopinavir-Ritonavir has been used either on its own or in combination with either alpha interferon (China) or chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (South Korea) for COVID-19 treatment with some success [

    <xref rid="B74-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. However, new data from China cast doubt on the beneficial effect in seriously ill COVID-19 patients [
    <xref rid="B75-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Thus, results from additional clinical trials are needed to establish the efficacy of this treatment for COVID-19 which are currently underway.

    <bold>Favipiravir (Favilavir or Avigan):</bold> Favipiravir (FPV) is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor developed by Fujifilm Toyama Chemical in Japan that is safe and has been effective in other viral infections, including influenza [
    <xref rid="B76-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,
    <xref rid="B77-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. It has now been shown to be useful against SARS-CoV-2 in initial clinical trials conducted in Wuhan and Shenzhen [
    <xref rid="B78-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. In this study, the effects of FPV versus LPV/RTV were compared during the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The FPV-treated patients demonstrated much better therapeutic response especially with regard to faster viral clearance and improvement rate in chest imaging. Based on these encouraging results, favipiravir has been approved by the National Medical Products Administration of China as the first anti-COVID-19 drug in the country [

    <bold>Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine:</bold> Chloroquine is an inexpensive drug for the treatment of malaria and features on the WHO list of essential medicines. It is also used as an anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Chloroquine is thought to inhibit virus replication by increasing endosomal pH as many viruses such as Ebola and Marburg that require the acidic environment of the endosome for successful replication [
    <xref rid="B79-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,
    <xref rid="B80-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,
    <xref rid="B81-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. However, a recent study showed that the anti-inflammatory effects of chloroquine are mediated by upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21 [
    <xref rid="B82-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. In vitro studies have shown its potent antiviral effect against the SARS-CoV-2 [
    <xref rid="B83-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. A multicenter clinical trial in China has reported efficacy with amelioration of exacerbation of pneumonia and acceptable safety margin with use of chloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 [
    <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Hydroxychloroquine is an analogue of chloroquine which is more stable with better clinical safety profile and has anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. It has been shown to quicken recovery and clearance of the virus in COVID-19 patients and used successfully in combination with the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin [
    <xref rid="B84-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. A recent clinical trial, however, has shown disappointing results with the combination of azithromycin with hydroxychloroquine in critically-ill COVID-19 patients [
    <xref rid="B85-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], suggesting that larger studies with controlled design are needed before conclusive recommendations can be made for chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19. Interestingly, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are zinc ionophores and zinc has been shown to inhibit RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzyme of coronaviruses [
    <xref rid="B86-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>,
    <xref rid="B87-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Thus, one reason for the limited success of some of these clinical trials could be due to absence of zinc supplementation which may be necessary to observe the therapeutic effects of these drugs on SARS-CoV-2 and other RNA virus infections [

    <bold>Remdesivir (GS-5734):</bold> Remdesivir is a nucleotide analogue prodrug with broad spectrum antiviral activity against many RNA viruses [
    <xref rid="B89-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Like Favipiravir, it blocks RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, an enzyme that replicates the viral genome, inhibiting an early step in virus replication, compared to protease inhibitors that target the late steps of virus replication [
    <xref rid="B90-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>,
    <xref rid="B91-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. It has also shown to inhibit replication of MERSCoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 in animal models [
    <xref rid="B83-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,
    <xref rid="B89-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>,
    <xref rid="B92-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>,
    <xref rid="B93-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. So far, it has been used as an investigational drug for the treatment of Ebola, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV2, and other RNA viruses, but has not been approved for any disease [
    <xref rid="B83-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,
    <xref rid="B89-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>,

    <xref rid="B93-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. In a compassionate use of remdesivir in a cohort of patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19, the developers of the drug (Gilead Sciences, City, US State abbrev., USA) reported clinical improvement in 68% (36 of 53) of patients [
    <xref rid="B94-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. The first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial of remdesivir in 237 patients from Hubei, China, has just been published [
    <xref rid="B95-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Unfortunately, it did not show statistically meaningful clinical benefits except for numerical reduction in time to clinical improvement [
    <xref rid="B95-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Furthermore, treatment with remdesivir had to be stopped early in some patients because of undesirable effects in 12% patients versus 5% patients on placebo. Similar results have been announced from the first US clinical trial of the drug at the time of this writing, which are still unpublished. Further results are awaited on multiple clinical trials of remdesivir in several countries for more conclusive guidelines on its use in COVID-19 patients.

    <bold>SNG001:</bold> SNG001 is an inhaled experimental drug (interferon beta) developed by the UK biotech firm Synairgen. The ability to inhale the drug will allow the patients to “self-administer” it by using a small hand-held nebulizer. It was developed for the severe lung disease chronic-obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), but, due to the current COVID-19 crisis, it has been fast-tracked for use in a 100-patient phase II clinical trial (EudraCT2020-001023-14) in the UK (

    <bold>Tocilizumab:</bold> Tocilizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) that is approved by FDA to treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and giant cell arteritis [
    <xref rid="B96-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. IL-6 has been shown to be a key mediator of cytokine release storm (CRS) observed in critically ill COVID-19 [
    <xref rid="B96-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Therefore, it has been proposed as a potential therapy to treat such patients [
    <xref rid="B97-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Thus, Tocilizumab has recently been used as an immunosuppressive agent during CRS observed in severely ill COVID-19 patients in China and Italy with promising results [
    <xref rid="B98-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>,
    <xref rid="B99-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. COVID-19 patients treated with Tocilizumab in China showed marked improvement indicating that Tocilizumab potentially could be very effective in treating patients with severe infection. Consistent with this, administration of tocilizumab in a COVID-19 patient with pneumonia in Italy showed favorable changes of CT findings within 14 days of treatment [
    <xref rid="B100-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. It is turning out to be a promising therapy to treat severely ill COVID-19 patients.

    <bold>Kinases:</bold> p21-activated protein kinases (PAKs) are cytosolic serine/threonine protein kinases downstream of small (p21) GTPases, including members of the Cdc42 and Rac families. Multiple studies have shown that the major pathogenic kinase in this group, PAK1, plays an important role in the entry, replication and spread of several important viruses, including influenza and HIV [
    <xref rid="B101-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>,
    <xref rid="B102-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Coronaviruses exploit macropinocytosis to gain entry into cells and this process has been shown to be dependent on PAK1 activity [
    <xref rid="B103-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>,
    <xref rid="B104-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Targeting of PAK1 to prevent micropinocytosis has been implicated for therapeutic intervention [
    <xref rid="B105-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. This strongly suggests that PAK1-inhibitors could be valuable for the treatment of COVID-19 infection. PAK-1 inhibitors include caffeic acid and its ester, propolis, ketorolac, and triptolide. Unfortunately, all these have problems with solubility and cell penetration. However, newer PAK-1 inhibitors, such as 15K (the 1,2,3-triazolyl ester of ketorolac, that is 500 times more potent at inhibiting PAK1 than the parent compound [
    <xref rid="B106-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>], minnelide (in which a hydroxyl group of triptolide is phosphorylated, boosting its water-solubility over 3000 times [
    <xref rid="B107-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>], and frondoside A [
    <xref rid="B108-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>] are much more potent and may be of value in suppressing the effects of this virus.
