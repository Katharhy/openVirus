<p>As the number of confirmed infections and fatalities continue to increase daily, it is crucial to further our understanding of the virus transmission patterns and epidemiology. Despite only a few months into the outbreak, there is a wealth of information emerging on the virus genomic makeup and evolution, and its transcriptomic mapping, including virus–human protein interactions. Such information is urgently needed for the identification of therapeutic targets for intervention and vaccine development, in addition to informing preventive policies and patient care decisions. The primary purpose of this review is to provide an update on the epidemiology, modes of transmission, a summary of the genomics, and transcriptomics of SARS-CoV-2, as well as therapeutic interventions in the absence of a vaccine. Furthermore, we examine how the viral genomics and molecular epidemiology informs therapeutic and vaccine development as well as public health strategies. We have also compiled a resource table outlining the numerous databases related to SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing, transcriptomic map, strain tracing, SARS-CoV-2-human protein–protein interactions, and clinical trials for repurposed drugs and vaccines (
