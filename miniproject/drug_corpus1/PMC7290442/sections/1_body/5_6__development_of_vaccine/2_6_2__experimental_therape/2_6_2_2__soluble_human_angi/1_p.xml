<p>ACE2 is the host receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection that interacts with the viral spike protein to gain entry into human cells; therefore, it has been suggested that hindering this interaction could potentially be used as an effective treatment in COVID-19 patients [

Consistent with this hypothesis, a recent in vitro study has shown that clinical-grade human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2), but not mouse soluble ACE2, could curtail replication of SARS-CoV-2, resulting in reduced viral loads drastically in Vero cells in a dose dependent manner [

These are promising observations and open a new window of opportunity to use hrsACE2 to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection at a very early stage by blocking its entry into the target cells, thus potentially protecting patients from lung injury.
