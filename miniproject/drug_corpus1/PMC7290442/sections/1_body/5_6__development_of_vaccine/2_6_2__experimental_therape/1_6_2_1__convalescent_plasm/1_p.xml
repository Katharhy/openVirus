<p>This is a classic adaptive immunotherapy that has been applied to many infectious diseases for more than a century for prevention and treatment. CP has been shown to be successful over the last two decades against SARS, MERS, and H1N1 infection [

 <xref rid="B63-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In this therapy, plasma (with neutralizing antibodies) is extracted from a donor who has recovered from the infection, followed by its administration to infected patients. Preliminary work describing administration of CP to severe COVID-19 patients have reported significant improvement and large scale clinical trials are ongoing [

For example, AbCellera, a Canadian biotech (Vancouver, BC, Canada), has discovered &gt;500 unique antibodies from sera of a convalescent COVID-19 patient, and in partnership with Eli Lilly, is developing purely human IgG1 mAbs-based treatments for coronavirus infection. Similarly, InflaRx (Jena, Germany) and Beijing Defengrei Biotechnology (Beijing, China) are using human IgG1 mAbs against complement factor 5a as therapy since C5 has been observed to be the major cause of tissue injury in patients. Such antibodies have already been approved for clinical trials in China. Other novel therapies for COVID-19 include an effort by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (Cambridge, MA, USA) that has developed a technology for delivering aerosolized siRNAs against SARS-CoV-2 directly to lungs which is being tested both in vitro and in vivo. Similarly, nanoviricides are being created in another approach in which the S protein is chemically attached to “virucidal nanomicelles”.
