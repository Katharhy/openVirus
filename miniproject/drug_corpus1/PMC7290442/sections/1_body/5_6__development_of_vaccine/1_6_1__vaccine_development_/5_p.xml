<p>Other than these, there has been an acceleration in developing other novel vaccine approaches and therapeutic interventions to combat viral infection [

 <xref rid="B60-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. For example, Inovio Pharmaceuticals’ INO-4800 (Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA) is a DNA-based vaccine using the 
 <italic>spike</italic> gene. Funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the vaccine has already entered phase I clinical trials for intradermal delivery using electroporation. Codagenix, in collaboration with Serum Institute of India, has used a reverse strategy to create a live-attenuated vaccine in which viral sequences have been changed by swapping its optimized codons with non-optimized ones to weaken the virus. Since live-attenuated vaccines have a higher chance of success, in anticipation, large scale manufacture of this vaccine has already started in India. Shenzhen Geno-Immune Medical Institute, on the other hand, has two vaccines in clinical trial based on dendritic cells and antigen presenting cells modified by lentiviral vectors expressing portions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome as “minigenes”. Johnson and Johnson (New Brunswick, NJ, USA) and Altimmune Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD, USA) are developing intranasal, recombinant adenovirus-based vaccines to stimulate the immune system. Which one of these strategies will be most efficacious is hard to predict and hopefully some of them will be successful; thus, major international vaccine funding agencies are supporting a multitude of innovative efforts to find the best ones for eventual large-scale production. An extensive list of vaccines is under development including those highlighted above, their current status can be found at the Milken Institute COVID-19 Treatment and Vaccine Tracker available at:
