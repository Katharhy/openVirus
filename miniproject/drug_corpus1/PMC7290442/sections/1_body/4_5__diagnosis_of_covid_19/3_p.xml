<p>Besides targeting the genome, another diagnostic approach for SARS-CoV-2 aims at detecting antibodies produced by the patient’s immune system against the virus. Scores of such “antibody” tests have been reported over the past few months for SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="B53-viruses-12-00526" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]; however, confirmation of validity of several of these assays remains underway. Although the antibody associated tests are faster, their use for diagnosis is limited by the fact that it usually takes several days and up to two weeks after an infection takes place for antibodies to be detectable. Therefore, antibody-based testing is not a reliable method to diagnose COVID-19; however, they may be useful for population-based testing to estimate the proportion of the population with immunity (if antibodies are a marker of immunity) and identifying susceptible individuals. Such information may also be useful for public health measures, including return-to-work protocols and social segregation of susceptible individuals. A third type of testing relies on detecting viral proteins (antigens) likely to be useful since they do not depend on a detectable rise in patient-produced antibodies [
