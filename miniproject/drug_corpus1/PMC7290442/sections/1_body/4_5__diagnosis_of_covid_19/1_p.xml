<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread rapidly, there is a growing demand for rapid point-of-care testing of the virus. The current gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19 depends upon detection of the viral genetic material (RNA) in a nasopharyngeal swab or sputum sample. While this technique is sensitive and can detect the virus earlier in the infection, it requires polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a technology that amplifies the amount of genetic material to detectable levels and takes several hours to perform [
