<p id="Par30">Observed scale-up of DAAs to HIV-diagnosed individuals since 2015 (from an estimated 10.5%/year to 33%/year as observed in the HERACLES cohort) likely reduced the number of diagnosed coinfected individuals by 12% (mean 3289 in 2015 to 1324 in 2019 Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). However, the number of newly diagnosed HIV/HCV coinfections was projected to increase, from a mean of 200 in 2015 to 221 in 2019 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b) due to reinfection after successful treatment among those with ongoing risk.
