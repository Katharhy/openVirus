  <title>Background and Aims</title>
  <p>More than 292 million people are living with hepatitis B worldwide and are at risk of death from liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. The World Health Organization (WHO) has set global targets for the elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030. However, current levels of global investment in viral hepatitis elimination programmes are insufficient to achieve these goals.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>To catalyse political commitment and to encourage domestic- and international-financing, we used published modelling data and key stakeholder interviews to develop an investment framework to demonstrate the return on investment for viral hepatitis elimination.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Results</title>
  <p>The framework utilizes a public health approach to identify evidence-based national activities that reduce viral hepatitis-related morbidity and mortality, as well as international activities and critical enablers that allow countries to achieve maximum impact on health outcomes from investment to achieve WHO 2030 elimination targets.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p>Focusing on hepatitis B, this health policy paper employs the investment framework to estimate the substantial economic benefits of investing in the elimination of hepatitis B and demonstrates how such investments could be cost-saving by 2030.</p>
