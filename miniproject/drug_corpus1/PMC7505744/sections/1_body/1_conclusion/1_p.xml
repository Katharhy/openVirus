<p id="p0345">Hepatitis B elimination is achievable but requires greater commitment from governments, international institutions, civil society and donors. Modelling shows that the required financial investment is likely to peak by 2025 but then rapidly fall in 2030 and beyond, with investment in hepatitis B activities likely to be cost-effective and cost-saving in many countries in the medium- to long-term. However, for countries currently not funding hepatitis B elimination activities, affordability of investment at the expense of competing priorities must be addressed. The investment framework presented in this study identifies key activities to achieve hepatitis B elimination targets and solutions to funding shortfalls to achieve maximal impact. Financial support by international agencies and donors for elimination activities are vital for many LMICs to successfully achieve elimination targets.</p>
