<p id="p0335">International agencies, multilateral organisations, NGOs and donors can support advocacy to address funding gaps to strengthen the community sector and civil society (
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>), leverage funding from donors, provide technical expertise including guidelines and training modules, support investment case development, and support regional approaches to drug and diagnostics procurement, particularly price negotiations (
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Tools are available to support national activities including the WHO viral hepatitis continuum of care and the monitoring and evaluation framework (

 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,

 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>) and pool capacity of regulatory authorities for pre-market assessment and registration of new medicines and diagnostics is also important. International agencies and donors can also fund health system improvements such as enhanced data connectivity to support quality assurance and supply chain management (
 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). Greater advocacy by civil society including community-based organisations is paramount to encourage international funding bodies to invest in hepatitis B elimination as has been the case with other infectious diseases such as HIV.
