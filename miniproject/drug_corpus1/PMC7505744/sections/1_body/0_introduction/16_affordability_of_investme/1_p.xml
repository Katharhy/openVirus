<p id="p0190">The challenge to achieve hepatitis B elimination is affordability, particularly in low and middle-income countries. Middle-income countries have the potential to generate additional funds through economic growth over time that can feed into UHC. Countries currently paying for medical costs of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer may leverage investment off the cost-savings generated against existing expenditure on hepatitis B-related disease. However, low income countries have limited scope to increase revenue from sources such as taxation and alternative solutions need to be found (
