<p id="p0055">The WHO 2030 hepatitis B elimination targets are unlikely to be achieved at current levels of investment (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). To date, 194 countries have endorsed the GHSS; however, few have developed national plans for viral hepatitis elimination or made the required investments to make viral hepatitis elimination a reality(2). Rapid scale-up of hepatitis B vaccination has enabled global coverage of three doses of hepatitis B vaccination to reach 84% of infants worldwide, resulting in a reduction in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) prevalence globally in children under five years from 4.7% in 2000 to 1.3% in 2015 (

 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Screening of donated blood for hepatitis B and C has improved over the last decade, yet at 97% it remains below the 2030 target of 100% screened and 5% of healthcare-related injections remain unsafe (

 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) for a 12-month course in many parts of the world, hepatitis B diagnosis and treatment rates remain well short of the WHO 2030 targets of 90% and 80%, respectively (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In 2016, modelling estimates suggest only 10% of the 257-292 million people living with hepatitis B worldwide were diagnosed and only between 5 to 17% of those eligible for treatment in accordance with international guidelines were receiving treatment(1, 2), despite nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy being proven to markedly reduce the risk of death from liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
