<p id="p0340">The final hurdle to achievement of hepatitis B elimination is the lack of a safe, well tolerated, easy-to-administer hepatitis B cure. To achieve hepatitis B cure, international private and public partnerships, agencies and donors need to come together to support research and drug development(70). Such efforts need to ensure up front that the resulting products are affordable to the communities that need access to them. The International Coalition to Eliminate Hepatitis B (ICE-HBV) (
 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>) seeks to increase global awareness, facilitate collaboration for research discovery and support research in hepatitis B cure and mirrors the effective multisector campaign for HIV drug development. Modelling has demonstrated that availability of hepatitis B cure would accelerate achievement of global hepatitis B elimination(15). However, low and middle-income countries with the greatest hepatitis B burden may endure delays in accessing cure due to prohibitive costs, as has been seen with HIV and hepatitis C therapies. If hepatitis B cure becomes a reality, it will be important that low-cost and/or generic drug procurement is rapidly implemented. There should be some optimism this is possible given the price reduction and broad availability of generic drugs observed with hepatitis C therapies. By investing in hepatitis B elimination programmes now, the scene will be set for rapid introduction and scale-up of hepatitis B cure when such treatment becomes available(84).
