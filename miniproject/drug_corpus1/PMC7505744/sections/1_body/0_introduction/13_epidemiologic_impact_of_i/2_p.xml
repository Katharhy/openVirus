<p id="p0155">In this model, the scale-up of three-dose hepatitis B vaccination coverage rates to 90% alone was estimated to avert 4.3 million new infections between 2015-2030, increasing birth dose coverage and perinatal antiviral coverage in third trimester for hepatitis B positive women to 80% would avert a further 19.3 million infections by 2030 and remained cost-effective. Also, additional investment in diagnosis and treatment coverage to 80% of those eligible would reduce annual hepatitis B-related deaths by 65% by 2030 and avert 7.3 million deaths between 2015 and 2030.</p>
