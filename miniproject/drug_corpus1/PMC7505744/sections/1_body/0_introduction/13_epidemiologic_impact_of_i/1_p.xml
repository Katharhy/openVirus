<p id="p0150">A global model was developed in 2016 by Nayagam and colleagues(15) to estimate the costs of global elimination of hepatitis B infection and the impact of scaling-up available public health interventions for its elimination. Under the continued status quo they projected that in 2020 there would be 4.3 million new chronic infections, 270 million people living with hepatitis B worldwide and 1 million deaths from hepatitis B. The continued status quo also projected that by 2050 the number of people living with hepatitis B would fall by 40% to 165 million, as a result of sustained levels of hepatitis B vaccination coverage. However, the annual number of deaths from hepatitis B would continue to increase to a peak of 1.14 million deaths in 2034, and then reduce to 1.06 million in 2050.</p>
