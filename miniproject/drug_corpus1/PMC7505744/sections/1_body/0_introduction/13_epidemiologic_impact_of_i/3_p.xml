<p id="p0160">Tordrup and colleagues (
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) have also developed models for the required investment to achieve WHO hepatitis B and C elimination targets by 2030 and likely outcomes, based on disease prevalence and costs across 67 LMICs with moderate-high prevalence of viral hepatitis. They modelled a progress scenario based on existing WHO screening guidelines, which would not achieve WHO 2030 elimination targets but would result in an increase in hepatitis B testing of 2400 million people compared with the status quo of 93 million people tested by 2030, and treatment for 24.1 million people compared with 1.4 million people (status quo). This scenario would avert an estimated 2.4 million deaths by 2030 and a total estimated 7.3 million deaths beyond 2030. They also modelled an ambitious scenario that would achieve WHO 2030 elimination targets by increasing hepatitis B testing to 5592 million people and treatment of 32.2 million people between 2016 and 2030. This scenario for elimination of hepatitis B and C, provided estimated health investment returns of 4.5 million (4.6%) premature deaths averted and an increase of 51.5 million healthy life-years (9.6%) between 2016 and 2030. Specifically, the ambitious scenario was estimated to avert 3.3 million decompensated liver cirrhosis cases and 4.5 million hepatitis B-related liver cancer cases(37).
