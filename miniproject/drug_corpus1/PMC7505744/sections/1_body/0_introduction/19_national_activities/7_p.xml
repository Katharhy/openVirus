These data are essential to describe national disease burden and guide the scope and scale of investment in elimination activities and monitor progress towards elimination. In 2018, WHO established the Global Reporting system for viral hepatitis, a major milestone for viral hepatitis reporting against elimination targets. In 2017, 62% of WHO members states had functional data collection, surveillance and reporting systems in place: however, many of these systems have not been harnessed for hepatitis B reporting(16). Electronic medical record and data collection systems such as Open MRS (OpenMRS Inc.) supported by WHO can support local data collection activities to monitor hepatitis B elimination programmes.
