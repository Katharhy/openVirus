<p id="p0245">Lack of awareness of hepatitis B and low health literacy both in the general population and among at-risk communities, coupled with stigma and discrimination against people living with hepatitis B, contribute to low demand for diagnosis and treatment globally (

Taking a public health approach to general population hepatitis B awareness educational programmes, non-discriminatory policy and legislation implementation (such as ensuring equitable access to education and employment regardless of hepatitis B status), plus investment in community advocacy organizations and involving them in key hepatitis B policy decisions are critical to increase public demand and leverage funding (Supplementary Table 1) (

Community advocacy has successfully pressured governments to invest in hepatitis B and C elimination activities in countries such as Australia, Brazil, Georgia and Rwanda(26). There is also a clear association between level of engagement between WHO member states and civil society organizations and the development of national hepatitis B strategies and dedicated investment in hepatitis B activities (

Eighty-four percent of WHO member states who had formal engagement with civil society had national action plans and 52% had dedicated hepatitis B funding compared to 44% with national strategies and 23% dedicated investment among WHO members states with no civil society engagement(24).
