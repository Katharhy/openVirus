<p id="p0255">Strategies to overcome financial and logistical barriers to birth dose delivery include utilization of skilled birth attendants outside of health facilities, use of vaccine outside of cold chain and use of auto-disposable syringes (

 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Modelling work by Scott and colleagues(56) demonstrated that adopting a controlled temperature chain strategy for birth dose vaccination was cost-effective in most world regions with high hepatitis B prevalence; this is now supported by Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation (WHO) (
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Integrating hepatitis B birth dose vaccination with Millennium Development Goal 4 (reducing infant and child mortality) and 5 (reducing maternal mortality) activities promotes mutual health system strengthening and efficiency gains(35, 42, 58). GAVI has committed to support birth dose vaccination from 2021(59). Among adults, integration of targeted catch-up immunization programmes with other vaccines such as pertussis reduces costs (

 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) and tenofovir (TDF) for pregnant women with high viral loads should be incorporated into the essential medicines list. Provision of TDF in third trimester for pregnant women with hepatitis B who are HBeAg positive with a high viral load reduces transmission risk to &lt;1%(

 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). This strategy may reduce transmission risk in settings where timely birth dose delivery is difficult to achieve(14). New two-dose hepatitis B vaccines are now available that have high efficacy, which may improve full schedule completion rates due to easier adherence and warrant inclusion in future modelling work.
