<p id="p0225">Development of a national strategy for hepatitis B elimination must incorporate national sustainable financing solutions. Most global donors, including The Global Fund (

Incorporating elimination programmes into UHC and ensuring hepatitis B diagnostics and medications are on national essential medicines lists helps offset costs. Investment in maternal-child health programmes by global donors may also represent avenues to deliver improved birth dose vaccine delivery through increased antenatal care coverage and skilled health-worker birth attendance(43).
