<p id="p0290">Over-reliance on centralized specialist services to deliver hepatitis services, shortage of specialist health workforce and lack of simplified guidelines facilitating community-based care are obstacles to hepatitis B elimination in LMICs(73). Linkage to care and retention in care are vital for successful hepatitis B management(14). Integration of hepatitis B into current community-based models of care and other chronic disease management programmes will improve access, reduce late presentation and costs, improve efficiencies and increase retention in care. Civil society and community organisations can also support linkage and retention in care. Task-shifting and redistribution of existing health staff by integration of hepatitis B programmes within existing programmes can substantially offset the up-front costs and proved viable in HIV programmes in sub-Saharan Africa(33, 76, 77). Policymakers can leverage the roll-out of UHC and existing SDG-related activities for investment in hepatitis programmes that facilitate other disease programmes such as tuberculosis or diabetes (
