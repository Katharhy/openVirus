<p id="p0265">Access to affordable diagnostics is a key barrier for many countries, with diagnostics often costing more than treatment(14, 64). Pooled procurement, national production and supportive legislation are options to drive down the price of current diagnostics. High quality, low-cost viral hepatitis PoC diagnostics that are simple to use with minimal training and meet WHO prequalification criteria are required to improve accessibility and affordability of testing and to promote decentralisation of hepatitis B management(65). Whilst hepatitis B HBsAg PoC rapid diagnostic tests that have WHO prequalified approval are available and have been shown in multiple settings to be cost-effective alternatives to improve diagnosis access(33, 40), PoC RDTs required to determine treatment eligibility and evaluate liver disease severity are urgently needed to increase treatment rates. Novel diagnostics that provide more affordable alternatives to PCR-based HBV DNA quantification such as hepatitis B core-related antigen(66) and LAMP-based HBV DNA quantification (
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>), and novel PoC ALT tests(68) are in development. A PoC core antibody test would also be beneficial to determine previous exposure prior to vaccination and may be cost-saving, and also to determine the risk of occult hepatitis B infection and potential for reactivation wioth immunosuppression. However, modelling of the impact of these tests on elimination targets and their cost-effectiveness compared with status quo is required.
