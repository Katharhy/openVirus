<p id="p0125">Domestic funding is currently the mainstay of hepatitis elimination programmes in most countries (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Progress in investment has been slow: in 2017, a WHO member state survey (70% response globally) identified that only 37% of responding states had dedicated domestic funding for implementation of hepatitis B elimination activities, accounting for only 18% of individuals living with hepatitis B worldwide(24). 25% of low-income members states had dedicated funding, compared with 42% of low-middle and high-income countries(24). Innovative- and blended-financing models should also be employed to augment domestic financing from regular budget sources and sustain the scale up of health programmes. An example of such a model is the use of private-public partnerships to fund roll-out of universal infant vaccination programmes in China with additional support from GAVI (

As the major source of domestic funds will likely come through taxation, evidence justifying an increase in the proportion of taxation and other domestic funds assigned to hepatitis B elimination programmes at the expense of other health-related activities are needed to convince governments and the community alike that investment in hepatitis B elimination is worthwhile. Hence, strong epidemiologic data on the magnitude of the health burden of disease and the projected cross-sectoral gains from investments in health systems to eliminate hepatitis B are critical to inform fiscal decisions related to resource allocation. The ‘Taskforce on Innovative International Financing for Health Systems’ (
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) (2008) identified innovative funding sources for health systems strengthening in LMICs, and since then several innovative financing instruments have been developed to fund large-scale health programmes in these settings (
