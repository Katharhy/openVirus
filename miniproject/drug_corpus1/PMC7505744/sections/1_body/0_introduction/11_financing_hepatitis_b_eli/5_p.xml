<p id="p0140">Significant investment and achievement towards elimination targets for hepatitis C, HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and syphilis demonstrate that domestic funding and resources can be mobilized effectively and these resources can be harnessed towards hepatitis B elimination activities to reduce costs and improve efficiencies(14, 16, 20). Moreover, channeling funding and resources available for chronic non communicable diseases such as diabetes and hypertension may be appropriate in countries with moderate-high general population hepatitis B endemicity, as has been shown effectively in Egypt and Pakistan with hepatitis C(16). The Global Fund has also allowed remaining funds from other projects to be spent on hepatitis B and C-related activities for HIV coinfected patients.</p>
