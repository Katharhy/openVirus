<p id="p0050">In response to the substantial public health threat of hepatitis B, in 2016, the World Health Assembly adopted the WHO Global Health Sector Strategy (GHSS) on Viral Hepatitis 2016â€“2021 (
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). This strategy broadly outlines the key activities to achieve viral hepatitis elimination and sets clear hepatitis B elimination targets to be achieved by 2030: a 90% reduction in new chronic infections and a 65% reduction in mortality compared to 2015 levels(13). Though currently there is no cure for hepatitis B infection, elimination targets are made possible by the availability of a highly-effective low-cost vaccine and safe, effective suppressive treatment that halts viral transmission and liver disease progression, reduces the risk of liver cancer and prolongs life of those affected by hepatitis B (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Despite the availability of vaccines and treatments to achieve elimination and a high global mortality burden from hepatitis B infection comparable to other high-impact diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV and malaria, there has not been an equivalent political commitment to community mobilization and investment in a strong hepatitis B response(2, 14). Lack of community awareness and activism demanding investment in hepatitis B, coupled with a disproportionate burden of disease in low-income countries, have contributed to poor political engagement and insufficient investment in hepatitis B elimination.
