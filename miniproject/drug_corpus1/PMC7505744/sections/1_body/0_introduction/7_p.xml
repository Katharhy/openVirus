 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) which provides a map of the required elimination activities and funding mechanisms to achieve WHO viral hepatitis targets by 2030. In this paper, we focus on hepatitis B elimination and present how policymakers and others can use the investment framework and published cost modelling data to justify funding hepatitis B prevention, treatment, and care activities. We outline the key barriers to achievement of hepatitis B elimination, how to finance elimination activities, the financial return on investment and the key activities required to achieve hepatitis B elimination. Finally, we discuss ways in which investment in national COVID-19 responses can be leveraged to support hepatitis B elimination activities.
