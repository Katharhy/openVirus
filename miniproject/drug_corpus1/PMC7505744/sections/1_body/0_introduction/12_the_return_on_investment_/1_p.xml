<p id="p0145">There are several components to consider when evaluating the return on investment for hepatitis B elimination: the epidemiological impact, the amount of investment required, the cross-sectoral benefits of investment and affordability. Several published global and country-specific cost-effectiveness models outline the clear impact of investment in hepatitis B elimination on morbidity and mortality (

In these settings, highlighting the indirect returns on investment such as socioeconomic development, improved education, strengthening of health systems and economic returns support the argument for investment in hepatitis B elimination. Examples of cost-effectiveness models developed for hepatitis B are outlined in
