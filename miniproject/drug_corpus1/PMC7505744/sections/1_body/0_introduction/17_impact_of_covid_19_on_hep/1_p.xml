<p id="p0195">With the world in the midst of a global pandemic with unpredictable far-reaching health, social, geopolitical and economic impacts, how we sustain chronic disease programmes, revitalize economies and replenish devastated health infrastructure is a critical concern. In all countries, to varying extents, the focus for health services and governments has shifted to pandemic responses. Countries with moderate to high hepatitis B endemicity are also disproportionately represented among the most vulnerable national health systems and economies, which will bear the greatest impact from COVID-19. Beyond the impact on domestic resources and funding, external funding is likely to be massively curtailed due to diversion of the funds to the pandemic and also depletion through contracting economies. Despite these seismic impacts, there are opportunities to harness national and global COVID19 investment for hepatitis B elimination activities. Significant investments in surveillance and reporting systems to track COVID-19 may also be used to collect data on hepatitis B epidemiology and to monitor progress toward elimination. Many elements of the health system response such as rapid training and mobilization of skilled health workers, decentralization of services, novel community-based remote models of care such as telemedicine, resource and task-sharing and integration of multiple health systems to deliver the COVID-19 public health response can be utilized for hepatitis B elimination activities without requiring significant additional investment. Improved universal precautions will reduce spread of hepatitis B in healthcare settings, expanded laboratory capacity and PoC multi-disease platforms can be utilized to deliver hepatitis B diagnostics and strengthened supply chains for medications will also facilitate hepatitis B treatment access in the post-pandemic phase. Negotiation of existing and new trade and intellectual property agreements may also facilitate increased access and affordability of diagnostics and medications. Moreover, investment in hepatitis B programmes also strengthens health systems to allow integration of COVID-19 activities at reduced cost and improved efficiency. Sustained investment in vaccination programs to avoid precipitous drops in hepatitis B vaccine coverage will be essential to deliver high coverage of a future SARS-CoV2 vaccine(44). At this stage, data to support the success of these approaches are lacking and the future remains uncertain. It is vital that all opportunities are taken to minimize the substantial additional economic and health system burden from hepatitis B for countries with high endemicity. Strong advocacy will be essential to ensure CHB is a public health priority post-pandemic.</p>
