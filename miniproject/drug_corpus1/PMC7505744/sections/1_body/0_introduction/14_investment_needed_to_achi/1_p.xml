<p id="p0165">Nayagam and colleagues (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) projected that US$88.7 billion in global funding would be needed to meet the WHO targets by 2030, peaking at US$7.5 billion in 2025 and averaging at US$5.5 billion per year between 2015-2030. LMICs would require 45% of this total investment, with their overall costs peaking at US$3.4 billion annually. Screening (39%) and drug costs (59%) were the main components of the estimated costs (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). From 2030 there would be a rapid decline in annual costs due to screening of unvaccinated people being almost complete across populations and fewer people requiring treatment. If a cure became available, elimination targets would be achieved more rapidly. In this model, the avoided costs of cirrhosis and liver cancer were not included to offset investment in diagnosis and treatment, therefore presented costs are likely to underestimate the cost-effectiveness of investment in hepatitis B elimination in countries where health care is available for people with liver cirrhosis and liver cancer and is at least partially government subsidized.
