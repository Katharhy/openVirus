<p id="p0170">The progress investment scenario modelled by Tordrup and colleagues (
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) estimated that implementation of current WHO screening guidelines for hepatitis B across 67 moderate and high prevalence LMICs would require a total US$19.9 billion investment for hepatitis B diagnostics, monitoring and treatment between 2016-2030 and a further US$9.1 billion is required for programme costs (to support both hepatitis B and C programmes). This compares to the status quo projected hepatitis B costs of US$5.5 billion (

 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), annual estimated costs for screening, assessment and monitoring combined were greater than treatment(37). Achieving the WHO 2030 elimination targets was estimated to require a total US$30.3 billion for hepatitis B between 2016-2030, as well as US$20.0 billion for programme costs (to support both hepatitis B and C elimination) (
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), an amount almost ten times the current level of spending on hepatitis B elimination activities across these 67 LMICs. This represents a US$58.7 billion increase in resource requirements to achieve the WHO SDG ambitious scenario if hepatitis B and C are included (
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>); to place this investment in context, a relative increase in resource requirements is also needed to achieve WHO SDG goals for other infectious diseases, including HIV (US$102 billion), tuberculosis (US$7 billion) and malaria (US$51 billion) (
