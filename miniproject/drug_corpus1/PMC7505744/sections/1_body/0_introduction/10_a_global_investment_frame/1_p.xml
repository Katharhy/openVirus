 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> ) for the global elimination of hepatitis B and hepatitis C by 2030(20). The framework adopts a public health and health systems strengthening approach and identifies national activities for country-level implementation of viral hepatitis elimination strategies, highlighting national and international enablers that facilitate effective scale-up of hepatitis B programmes. The framework also outlines the activities leading to a return on investment from achieving hepatitis B elimination.
