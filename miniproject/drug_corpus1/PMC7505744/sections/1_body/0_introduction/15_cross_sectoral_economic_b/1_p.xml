<p id="p0180">Achieving the SDG 3 target of UHC by 2030 requires global investment in health systems (
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Integrating hepatitis services within existing health systems reduces costs compared to a ‘siloed’ approach because a large proportion of the required costs are for human resources (

Community-based diagnosis, monitoring and treatment for hepatitis B is feasible, particularly with simplified management guidelines(40, 41), making integration into existing healthcare services highly achievable. Adequate human resources to scale-up hepatitis B diagnosis and management may already be available through existing programmes such as antenatal care, HIV, tuberculosis and other non-communicable chronic disease programmes, allowing rapid up-scaling of testing and treatment with less financial, infrastructure and training support than would otherwise be needed for new stand-alone hepatitis treatment programmes, substantially offsetting up-front investment. This programme model has been shown to be highly effective in Egypt for hepatitis C screening when combined with community-based diabetes and hypertension screening (

Modelling work by Tordrup et al(37) estimated to achieve 2030 elimination targets, additional staff time of 432.3 million days for doctors and 247.8 million days for nurses was required for screening, monitoring and treatment, excluding prevention activities (

When combined with hepatitis C elimination costs that would draw on the same estimated programme-related costs, this would increase the WHO SDG investment health-care strengthening scenario costs by 1.5%, which is in line with the proportion of SDG budget currently ascribed to other diseases (HIV 2.5%, tuberculosis 1.4%, malaria 1.3%, and non-communicable diseases 10.7%)(
