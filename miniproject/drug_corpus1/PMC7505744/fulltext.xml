Hepatitis B disproportionately affects economically disadvantaged countries, with an estimated 248 million people living with hepatitis B residing in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in Asia, Africa, the Pacific and Latin America. These regions also bear the greatest hepatitis B-related mortality burden (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p id="p0040">Hepatitis B is transmitted most commonly at birth from mother to baby, in early childhood, or sexually through blood and body fluid contact (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Without treatment, the cumulative incidence of liver cirrhosis over five years is around 10-20% in people with chronic active hepatitis B infection, and 2-5% of those with cirrhosis develop liver cancer each year (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Those infected at birth are at greater risk of disease progression to cirrhosis and liver cancer (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The rising global prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) coupled with hazardous alcohol consumption will likely increase liver-related mortality rates in people living with hepatitis B through accelerated progression of hepatitis B-related liver disease and liver cancer(8).</p><p id="p0045">Hepatitis B also has an adverse impact on the quality of life, employment and personal finances of those living with the virus. In 2016, the estimated global impact of hepatitis B on human health and wellbeing was 5,160,000 age-adjusted disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The broader societal and economic impact of hepatitis B is often overlooked in fiscal decision-making by governments and funders of health programmes due to the long duration of the disease that precedes the development of end-stage complications (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p id="p0050">In response to the substantial public health threat of hepatitis B, in 2016, the World Health Assembly adopted the WHO Global Health Sector Strategy (GHSS) on Viral Hepatitis 2016&#x02013;2021 (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). This strategy broadly outlines the key activities to achieve viral hepatitis elimination and sets clear hepatitis B elimination targets to be achieved by 2030: a 90% reduction in new chronic infections and a 65% reduction in mortality compared to 2015 levels(13). Though currently there is no cure for hepatitis B infection, elimination targets are made possible by the availability of a highly-effective low-cost vaccine and safe, effective suppressive treatment that halts viral transmission and liver disease progression, reduces the risk of liver cancer and prolongs life of those affected by hepatitis B (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Despite the availability of vaccines and treatments to achieve elimination and a high global mortality burden from hepatitis B infection comparable to other high-impact diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV and malaria, there has not been an equivalent political commitment to community mobilization and investment in a strong hepatitis B response(2, 14). Lack of community awareness and activism demanding investment in hepatitis B, coupled with a disproportionate burden of disease in low-income countries, have contributed to poor political engagement and insufficient investment in hepatitis B elimination.</p><p id="p0055">The WHO 2030 hepatitis B elimination targets are unlikely to be achieved at current levels of investment (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). To date, 194 countries have endorsed the GHSS; however, few have developed national plans for viral hepatitis elimination or made the required investments to make viral hepatitis elimination a reality(2). Rapid scale-up of hepatitis B vaccination has enabled global coverage of three doses of hepatitis B vaccination to reach 84% of infants worldwide, resulting in a reduction in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) prevalence globally in children under five years from 4.7% in 2000 to 1.3% in 2015 (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). However, worldwide, birth dose vaccination coverage remains unacceptably low at 39% (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Screening of donated blood for hepatitis B and C has improved over the last decade, yet at 97% it remains below the 2030 target of 100% screened and 5% of healthcare-related injections remain unsafe (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Despite off-patent generic hepatitis B treatment being available for as little as US$48 (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) for a 12-month course in many parts of the world, hepatitis B diagnosis and treatment rates remain well short of the WHO 2030 targets of 90% and 80%, respectively (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In 2016, modelling estimates suggest only 10% of the 257-292 million people living with hepatitis B worldwide were diagnosed and only between 5 to 17% of those eligible for treatment in accordance with international guidelines were receiving treatment(1, 2), despite nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy being proven to markedly reduce the risk of death from liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.</p><p id="p0060">To achieve the elimination targets, major investments and resourcing are required at both national and global levels. In 2020, though there are encouraging signs of national-level investment and achievements, it is clear that investment globally is substantially below target to achieve hepatitis B elimination by 2030(16). Domestic funding mobilisation through innovative financing sources will be critical to implement the GHSS, as the large-scale global investments by donors for HIV, tuberculosis and malaria are unlikely to occur for viral hepatitis in part due to a flattening of overseas development assistance for health (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). As the global community battles the health, social and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, competing priorities and opportunity costs of investment in other infectious and chronic disease management programmes is being weighed against immediate needs and careful justification of investment is essential.</p><p id="p0065">We have therefore developed a strategic investment framework for viral hepatitis (B and C) (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) which provides a map of the required elimination activities and funding mechanisms to achieve WHO viral hepatitis targets by 2030. In this paper, we focus on hepatitis B elimination and present how policymakers and others can use the investment framework and published cost modelling data to justify funding hepatitis B prevention, treatment, and care activities. We outline the key barriers to achievement of hepatitis B elimination, how to finance elimination activities, the financial return on investment and the key activities required to achieve hepatitis B elimination. Finally, we discuss ways in which investment in national COVID-19 responses can be leveraged to support hepatitis B elimination activities.</p><sec id="sec1.1"><title>Key barriers to achievement of hepatitis B elimination</title><p id="p0070">Hepatitis B poses unique challenges to elimination. It is a chronic disease whose mode of transmission, health impact and management change across the lifespan and therefore requires ongoing monitoring throughout its course (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Current international hepatitis B management guidelines are complex, as not all patients are currently recommended to have treatment (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Moreover, unlike hepatitis C there is currently no cure, and even when the disease is well-controlled by treatment there remains a residual risk of liver cancer (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).

) for the global elimination of hepatitis B and hepatitis C by 2030(20). The framework adopts a public health and health systems strengthening approach and identifies national activities for country-level implementation of viral hepatitis elimination strategies, highlighting national and international enablers that facilitate effective scale-up of hepatitis B programmes. The framework also outlines the activities leading to a return on investment from achieving hepatitis B elimination.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Proposed Investment framework for hepatitis B and hepatitis C elimination. <underline>(Source: Pedrana A, Howell J, Scott N, et al.

However, no such financing entity or a financing facility exists for viral hepatitis, despite viral hepatitis being included in the Sustainable Development Goal 3.3(22) with these infections. Hence, to mount an effective large-scale response to hepatitis B, countries must move forward with alternative financing solutions (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), alongside continued advocacy work, to include viral hepatitis on the agendas of global donors.</p><p id="p0125">Domestic funding is currently the mainstay of hepatitis elimination programmes in most countries (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Progress in investment has been slow: in 2017, a WHO member state survey (70% response globally) identified that only 37% of responding states had dedicated domestic funding for implementation of hepatitis B elimination activities, accounting for only 18% of individuals living with hepatitis B worldwide(24). 25% of low-income members states had dedicated funding, compared with 42% of low-middle and high-income countries(24). Innovative- and blended-financing models should also be employed to augment domestic financing from regular budget sources and sustain the scale up of health programmes. An example of such a model is the use of private-public partnerships to fund roll-out of universal infant vaccination programmes in China with additional support from GAVI (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). However, LMICs are constrained by limited health budgets, and have multiple competing health priorities (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). As the major source of domestic funds will likely come through taxation, evidence justifying an increase in the proportion of taxation and other domestic funds assigned to hepatitis B elimination programmes at the expense of other health-related activities are needed to convince governments and the community alike that investment in hepatitis B elimination is worthwhile. Hence, strong epidemiologic data on the magnitude of the health burden of disease and the projected cross-sectoral gains from investments in health systems to eliminate hepatitis B are critical to inform fiscal decisions related to resource allocation. The &#x02018;Taskforce on Innovative International Financing for Health Systems&#x02019; (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) (2008) identified innovative funding sources for health systems strengthening in LMICs, and since then several innovative financing instruments have been developed to fund large-scale health programmes in these settings (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p id="p0130">For scale-up of hepatitis B prevention through vaccination, GAVI, a large global innovative financing mechanism(23), is ideally placed. To date, GAVI has disbursed US$11.2 billion for vaccines across 76 LMICs, including hepatitis B vaccination since 2000. Importantly, GAVI has recently announced the addition of birth dose vaccine in its 2021-2025 Vaccine Investment Strategy to prevent mother to child transmission(28). This will be critical to improve the implementation of birth dose vaccination in low-income countries where the need for timely birth dose vaccination of infants is greatest due to high population prevalence, sub-optimal childhood vaccination rates and lack of hepatitis B immunoglobulin availability for mothers living with hepatitis B infection (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p id="p0135">In 2018, the United Nations Secretary General launched the &#x02018;Financing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development&#x02019; (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) strategy. This strategy highlights key actions to enable countries to finance the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)(<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). SDG funding pools, such as those for reducing maternal and child mortality, could be used to finance hepatitis B elimination activities where they facilitate SDG achievement(30). Investment in viral hepatitis elimination activities should be integrated into universal health coverage (UHC, a target of SDG 3) to maximize service access and efficiencies in resource use in health systems, and reduce direct costs of care to individuals, thus minimizing catastrophic health costs for the population(31, 32).

Moreover, channeling funding and resources available for chronic non communicable diseases such as diabetes and hypertension may be appropriate in countries with moderate-high general population hepatitis B endemicity, as has been shown effectively in Egypt and Pakistan with hepatitis C(16).

Under the continued status quo they projected that in 2020 there would be 4.3 million new chronic infections, 270 million people living with hepatitis B worldwide and 1 million deaths from hepatitis B. The continued status quo also projected that by 2050 the number of people living with hepatitis B would fall by 40% to 165 million, as a result of sustained levels of hepatitis B vaccination coverage. However, the annual number of deaths from hepatitis B would continue to increase to a peak of 1.14 million deaths in 2034, and then reduce to 1.06 million in 2050.</p><p id="p0155">In this model, the scale-up of three-dose hepatitis B vaccination coverage rates to 90% alone was estimated to avert 4.3 million new infections between 2015-2030, increasing birth dose coverage and perinatal antiviral coverage in third trimester for hepatitis B positive women to 80% would avert a further 19.3 million infections by 2030 and remained cost-effective. Also, additional investment in diagnosis and treatment coverage to 80% of those eligible would reduce annual hepatitis B-related deaths by 65% by 2030 and avert 7.3 million deaths between 2015 and 2030.</p><p id="p0160">Tordrup and colleagues (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) have also developed models for the required investment to achieve WHO hepatitis B and C elimination targets by 2030 and likely outcomes, based on disease prevalence and costs across 67 LMICs with moderate-high prevalence of viral hepatitis. They modelled a progress scenario based on existing WHO screening guidelines, which would not achieve WHO 2030 elimination targets but would result in an increase in hepatitis B testing of 2400 million people compared with the status quo of 93 million people tested by 2030, and treatment for 24.1 million people compared with 1.4 million people (status quo). This scenario would avert an estimated 2.4 million deaths by 2030 and a total estimated 7.3 million deaths beyond 2030. They also modelled an ambitious scenario that would achieve WHO 2030 elimination targets by increasing hepatitis B testing to 5592 million people and treatment of 32.2 million people between 2016 and 2030. This scenario for elimination of hepatitis B and C, provided estimated health investment returns of 4.5 million (4.6%) premature deaths averted and an increase of 51.5 million healthy life-years (9.6%) between 2016 and 2030. Specifically, the ambitious scenario was estimated to avert 3.3 million decompensated liver cirrhosis cases and 4.5 million hepatitis B-related liver cancer cases(37).</p></sec><sec id="sec1.7"><title>Investment needed to achieve WHO elimination targets for hepatitis B</title><p id="p0165">Nayagam and colleagues (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) projected that US$88.7 billion in global funding would be needed to meet the WHO targets by 2030, peaking at US$7.5 billion in 2025 and averaging at US$5.5 billion per year between 2015-2030. LMICs would require 45% of this total investment, with their overall costs peaking at US$3.4 billion annually. Screening (39%) and drug costs (59%) were the main components of the estimated costs (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). From 2030 there would be a rapid decline in annual costs due to screening of unvaccinated people being almost complete across populations and fewer people requiring treatment. If a cure became available, elimination targets would be achieved more rapidly. In this model, the avoided costs of cirrhosis and liver cancer were not included to offset investment in diagnosis and treatment, therefore presented costs are likely to underestimate the cost-effectiveness of investment in hepatitis B elimination in countries where health care is available for people with liver cirrhosis and liver cancer and is at least partially government subsidized.</p><p id="p0170">The progress investment scenario modelled by Tordrup and colleagues (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) estimated that implementation of current WHO screening guidelines for hepatitis B across 67 moderate and high prevalence LMICs would require a total US$19.9 billion investment for hepatitis B diagnostics, monitoring and treatment between 2016-2030 and a further US$9.1 billion is required for programme costs (to support both hepatitis B and C programmes). This compares to the status quo projected hepatitis B costs of US$5.5 billion (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Similarly to Nayagam (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), annual estimated costs for screening, assessment and monitoring combined were greater than treatment(37). Achieving the WHO 2030 elimination targets was estimated to require a total US$30.3 billion for hepatitis B between 2016-2030, as well as US$20.0 billion for programme costs (to support both hepatitis B and C elimination) (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), an amount almost ten times the current level of spending on hepatitis B elimination activities across these 67 LMICs. This represents a US$58.7 billion increase in resource requirements to achieve the WHO SDG ambitious scenario if hepatitis B and C are included (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>); to place this investment in context, a relative increase in resource requirements is also needed to achieve WHO SDG goals for other infectious diseases, including HIV (US$102 billion), tuberculosis (US$7 billion) and malaria (US$51 billion) (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p><p id="p0175">Modelling by the Centre for Disease Analysis has estimated the timeframe to break even with national investment in hepatitis B elimination, beyond which investment becomes cost saving (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). For example, investment in hepatitis B elimination is estimated to provide cost savings in the Philippines by 2024 and in Vietnam by 2027. By 2035, for every dollar spent on hepatitis B elimination activities there would be an estimated return of US$2.23 in the Philippines and US$1.70 in Vietnam (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec1.8"><title>Cross-sectoral economic benefits of hepatitis B elimination</title><p id="p0180">Achieving the SDG 3 target of UHC by 2030 requires global investment in health systems (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Integrating hepatitis services within existing health systems reduces costs compared to a &#x02018;siloed&#x02019; approach because a large proportion of the required costs are for human resources (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Community-based diagnosis, monitoring and treatment for hepatitis B is feasible, particularly with simplified management guidelines(40, 41), making integration into existing healthcare services highly achievable. Adequate human resources to scale-up hepatitis B diagnosis and management may already be available through existing programmes such as antenatal care, HIV, tuberculosis and other non-communicable chronic disease programmes, allowing rapid up-scaling of testing and treatment with less financial, infrastructure and training support than would otherwise be needed for new stand-alone hepatitis treatment programmes, substantially offsetting up-front investment. This programme model has been shown to be highly effective in Egypt for hepatitis C screening when combined with community-based diabetes and hypertension screening (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Modelling work by Tordrup et al(37) estimated to achieve 2030 elimination targets, additional staff time of 432.3 million days for doctors and 247.8 million days for nurses was required for screening, monitoring and treatment, excluding prevention activities (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Their costings were based on utilization of existing antenatal screening infrastructure for HIV and syphilis. When combined with hepatitis C elimination costs that would draw on the same estimated programme-related costs, this would increase the WHO SDG investment health-care strengthening scenario costs by 1.5%, which is in line with the proportion of SDG budget currently ascribed to other diseases (HIV 2.5%, tuberculosis 1.4%, malaria 1.3%, and non-communicable diseases 10.7%)(<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p><p id="p0185">Overall health system strengthening would also help reduce transmission through improvements in blood screening and safety, injection safety and infection control to reduce blood-borne virus transmission (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).

Middle-income countries have the potential to generate additional funds through economic growth over time that can feed into UHC. Countries currently paying for medical costs of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer may leverage investment off the cost-savings generated against existing expenditure on hepatitis B-related disease. However, low income countries have limited scope to increase revenue from sources such as taxation and alternative solutions need to be found (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). External catalytic funding to kick-start screening and treatment programmes may be required, coupled with strategies to reduce costs and increase efficiencies (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, Supplementary Table 1), including embedding hepatitis B within existing health infrastructure, leveraging health system strengthening delivered by UHC, and legislative and market strategies to drive down prices of diagnostics and therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.10"><title>Impact of COVID-19 on hepatitis B elimination</title><p id="p0195">With the world in the midst of a global pandemic with unpredictable far-reaching health, social, geopolitical and economic impacts, how we sustain chronic disease programmes, revitalize economies and replenish devastated health infrastructure is a critical concern. In all countries, to varying extents, the focus for health services and governments has shifted to pandemic responses. Countries with moderate to high hepatitis B endemicity are also disproportionately represented among the most vulnerable national health systems and economies, which will bear the greatest impact from COVID-19. Beyond the impact on domestic resources and funding, external funding is likely to be massively curtailed due to diversion of the funds to the pandemic and also depletion through contracting economies. Despite these seismic impacts, there are opportunities to harness national and global COVID19 investment for hepatitis B elimination activities. Significant investments in surveillance and reporting systems to track COVID-19 may also be used to collect data on hepatitis B epidemiology and to monitor progress toward elimination. Many elements of the health system response such as rapid training and mobilization of skilled health workers, decentralization of services, novel community-based remote models of care such as telemedicine, resource and task-sharing and integration of multiple health systems to deliver the COVID-19 public health response can be utilized for hepatitis B elimination activities without requiring significant additional investment. Improved universal precautions will reduce spread of hepatitis B in healthcare settings, expanded laboratory capacity and PoC multi-disease platforms can be utilized to deliver hepatitis B diagnostics and strengthened supply chains for medications will also facilitate hepatitis B treatment access in the post-pandemic phase. Negotiation of existing and new trade and intellectual property agreements may also facilitate increased access and affordability of diagnostics and medications. Moreover, investment in hepatitis B programmes also strengthens health systems to allow integration of COVID-19 activities at reduced cost and improved efficiency. Sustained investment in vaccination programs to avoid precipitous drops in hepatitis B vaccine coverage will be essential to deliver high coverage of a future SARS-CoV2 vaccine(44). At this stage, data to support the success of these approaches are lacking and the future remains uncertain. It is vital that all opportunities are taken to minimize the substantial additional economic and health system burden from hepatitis B for countries with high endemicity. Strong advocacy will be essential to ensure CHB is a public health priority post-pandemic.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.11"><title>Key elimination activities for hepatitis B</title><p id="p0200">The framework identifies key national and international elimination activities and enabling conditions for scaling up hepatitis B testing and treatment to achieve WHO 2030 elimination targets (outlined in Supplementary Table 1 and Panel 2).

Incorporating elimination programmes into UHC and ensuring hepatitis B diagnostics and medications are on national essential medicines lists helps offset costs. Investment in maternal-child health programmes by global donors may also represent avenues to deliver improved birth dose vaccine delivery through increased antenatal care coverage and skilled health-worker birth attendance(43).</p><p id="p0230">3.

The WHO Viral Hepatitis Continuum of Care Monitoring and Evaluation Framework provides guidance for surveillance systems investment (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) for LMICs and high-income countries contexts. These data are essential to describe national disease burden and guide the scope and scale of investment in elimination activities and monitor progress towards elimination. In 2018, WHO established the Global Reporting system for viral hepatitis, a major milestone for viral hepatitis reporting against elimination targets. In 2017, 62% of WHO members states had functional data collection, surveillance and reporting systems in place: however, many of these systems have not been harnessed for hepatitis B reporting(16).

Hepatitis B prevention</p><p id="p0255">Strategies to overcome financial and logistical barriers to birth dose delivery include utilization of skilled birth attendants outside of health facilities, use of vaccine outside of cold chain and use of auto-disposable syringes (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Modelling work by Scott and colleagues(56) demonstrated that adopting a controlled temperature chain strategy for birth dose vaccination was cost-effective in most world regions with high hepatitis B prevalence; this is now supported by Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation (WHO) (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Integrating hepatitis B birth dose vaccination with Millennium Development Goal 4 (reducing infant and child mortality) and 5 (reducing maternal mortality) activities promotes mutual health system strengthening and efficiency gains(35, 42, 58). GAVI has committed to support birth dose vaccination from 2021(59). Among adults, integration of targeted catch-up immunization programmes with other vaccines such as pertussis reduces costs (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Regional pooled procurement could improve hepatitis B immunoglobulin access in LMICs (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) and tenofovir (TDF) for pregnant women with high viral loads should be incorporated into the essential medicines list. Provision of TDF in third trimester for pregnant women with hepatitis B who are HBeAg positive with a high viral load reduces transmission risk to &#x0003c;1%(<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>) and is supported by WHO as a cost-effective strategy for achieving the WHO elimination target of &#x0003c;0.1% prevalence among children by 2030 (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). This strategy may reduce transmission risk in settings where timely birth dose delivery is difficult to achieve(14). New two-dose hepatitis B vaccines are now available that have high efficacy, which may improve full schedule completion rates due to easier adherence and warrant inclusion in future modelling work.</p><p id="p0260">6. Increase coverage and access to affordable diagnosis, linkage to care and treatment</p><p id="p0265">Access to affordable diagnostics is a key barrier for many countries, with diagnostics often costing more than treatment(14, 64). Pooled procurement, national production and supportive legislation are options to drive down the price of current diagnostics. High quality, low-cost viral hepatitis PoC diagnostics that are simple to use with minimal training and meet WHO prequalification criteria are required to improve accessibility and affordability of testing and to promote decentralisation of hepatitis B management(65). Whilst hepatitis B HBsAg PoC rapid diagnostic tests that have WHO prequalified approval are available and have been shown in multiple settings to be cost-effective alternatives to improve diagnosis access(33, 40), PoC RDTs required to determine treatment eligibility and evaluate liver disease severity are urgently needed to increase treatment rates. Novel diagnostics that provide more affordable alternatives to PCR-based HBV DNA quantification such as hepatitis B core-related antigen(66) and LAMP-based HBV DNA quantification (<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>), and novel PoC ALT tests(68) are in development. A PoC core antibody test would also be beneficial to determine previous exposure prior to vaccination and may be cost-saving, and also to determine the risk of occult hepatitis B infection and potential for reactivation wioth immunosuppression. However, modelling of the impact of these tests on elimination targets and their cost-effectiveness compared with status quo is required.</p><p id="p0270">Dried blood spot (DBS) testing circumvents cold chain barriers due to its stability at high temperatures for 14 days and avoids the need for a trained phlebotomist to draw blood(69). DBS sampling in combination with centralised laboratory testing is accurate for HBsAg and HBV DNA measurement and should be supported by diagnostic test registration for DBS(70). Financial and technical support for development and implementation could be provided from industry partners and the Foundation for Innovative Diagnostics (FIND), while the WHO Essential Diagnostics List supports national investment in hepatitis B diagnostic testing(14).</p><p id="p0275">Also, despite entecavir and TDF compound patents having expired in 2010 and 2017 respectively, there are major discrepancies in prices across LMICs (<xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>, <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). Since 2011, TDF patents were licensed to the Medicines Patent Pool including for the indication of hepatitis B. Consequently, quality assured low price TDF has been available well before the patent expired. Today, a year&#x02019;s course of TDF can be purchased for as little as US$32 and entecavir for US$427 (<xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). However, few countries have taken advantage of these prices; even in countries where TDF is licensed, procurement still occurs through private mechanisms at unaffordable prices. Inclusion of TDF and entecavir in the national essential medicines list supported by the WHO 20<sup>th</sup> essential medicines list recommendation allows countries with high prevalence to leverage generic pharmaceutical companies to supply drug at affordable prices, or generate local production markets to boost revenue and drive down costs (Supplementary Table 1)(<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p id="p0280">There is increasing interest in novel approaches to treatment that simplify current guidelines, as was the case with hepatitis C(74), and obviate the need for complex and expensive testing to determine treatment eligibility, such as a &#x0201c;test and treat-all&#x0201d; approach(75). Whilst such an approach has not yet been explored in a clinical trial, a novel pilot study evaluating the cost-effectiveness and affordability of such an approach is currently underway in Uzbekistan (<xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>).</p><p id="p0285">7. Invest to improve quality, access, affordability and coverage of health services and infrastructure</p><p id="p0290">Over-reliance on centralized specialist services to deliver hepatitis services, shortage of specialist health workforce and lack of simplified guidelines facilitating community-based care are obstacles to hepatitis B elimination in LMICs(73). Linkage to care and retention in care are vital for successful hepatitis B management(14). Integration of hepatitis B into current community-based models of care and other chronic disease management programmes will improve access, reduce late presentation and costs, improve efficiencies and increase retention in care. Civil society and community organisations can also support linkage and retention in care. Task-shifting and redistribution of existing health staff by integration of hepatitis B programmes within existing programmes can substantially offset the up-front costs and proved viable in HIV programmes in sub-Saharan Africa(33, 76, 77). Policymakers can leverage the roll-out of UHC and existing SDG-related activities for investment in hepatitis programmes that facilitate other disease programmes such as tuberculosis or diabetes (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>). WHO has developed global recommendations and guidelines on task-shifting; other resources include the GHSS on Viral Hepatitis 2016-2020 (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), the Essential Medicine List (<xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>) and injection safety and blood safety policies (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec1.13"><title>Panel 2: Essential activities requiring investment to achieve hepatitis B elimination</title><p id="p0295">

Tools are available to support national activities including the WHO viral hepatitis continuum of care and the monitoring and evaluation framework (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>). Investment in local production and new technologies for diagnostics and therapeutics can be facilitated through public-private partnerships through access to markets and the scale-up of prevention and treatment programmes (<xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>, <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>, <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>). Accelerating regulatory approval for WHO (or equivalent) prequalified products (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>) and pool capacity of regulatory authorities for pre-market assessment and registration of new medicines and diagnostics is also important. International agencies and donors can also fund health system improvements such as enhanced data connectivity to support quality assurance and supply chain management (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). Greater advocacy by civil society including community-based organisations is paramount to encourage international funding bodies to invest in hepatitis B elimination as has been the case with other infectious diseases such as HIV.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.15"><title>Investment in Hepatitis B Cure</title><p id="p0340">The final hurdle to achievement of hepatitis B elimination is the lack of a safe, well tolerated, easy-to-administer hepatitis B cure. To achieve hepatitis B cure, international private and public partnerships, agencies and donors need to come together to support research and drug development(70). Such efforts need to ensure up front that the resulting products are affordable to the communities that need access to them. The International Coalition to Eliminate Hepatitis B (ICE-HBV) (<xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>) seeks to increase global awareness, facilitate collaboration for research discovery and support research in hepatitis B cure and mirrors the effective multisector campaign for HIV drug development. Modelling has demonstrated that availability of hepatitis B cure would accelerate achievement of global hepatitis B elimination(15). However, low and middle-income countries with the greatest hepatitis B burden may endure delays in accessing cure due to prohibitive costs, as has been seen with HIV and hepatitis C therapies. If hepatitis B cure becomes a reality, it will be important that low-cost and/or generic drug procurement is rapidly implemented. There should be some optimism this is possible given the price reduction and broad availability of generic drugs observed with hepatitis C therapies. By investing in hepatitis B elimination programmes now, the scene will be set for rapid introduction and scale-up of hepatitis B cure when such treatment becomes available(84).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0345">Hepatitis B elimination is achievable but requires greater commitment from governments, international institutions, civil society and donors. Modelling shows that the required financial investment is likely to peak by 2025 but then rapidly fall in 2030 and beyond, with investment in hepatitis B activities likely to be cost-effective and cost-saving in many countries in the medium- to long-term. However, for countries currently not funding hepatitis B elimination activities, affordability of investment at the expense of competing priorities must be addressed. The investment framework presented in this study identifies key activities to achieve hepatitis B elimination targets and solutions to funding shortfalls to achieve maximal impact. Financial support by international agencies and donors for elimination activities are vital for many LMICs to successfully achieve elimination targets.</p><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Key recommendations to achieve hepatitis B elimination</title><p id="p0350">
