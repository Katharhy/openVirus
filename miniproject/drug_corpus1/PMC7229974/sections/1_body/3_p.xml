<p id="para0004">There is currently great interest towards the use of passive immunotherapy by means of transfusion of convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients documented by the high number of ongoing trials and of reviews/perspectives/commentaries published every day. The results of such trials will help us to elucidate the still unanswered issues listed above and related to convalescent plasma collection, biologic validation and treatment modalities. Meanwhile, the data arising from previous coronaviruses epidemics and from COVID-19 case series, although limited, strongly encourage clinicians and investigators to treat COVID-19 patients, particularly at an early stage of the disease, also with convalescent plasma in the frame of registered protocols.</p>
