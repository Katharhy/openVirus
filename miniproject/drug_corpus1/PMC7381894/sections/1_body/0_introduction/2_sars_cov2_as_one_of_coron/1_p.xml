<p id="par0010">Before COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak caused by SARS-CoV during 2002 in Guangdong, China affected 8098 individuals and killed 774 individuals in 29 different countries [
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Only a decade later (during 2012), the world witnessed the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak caused by MERS-CoV in the Middle East [
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Until 2020, MERS-CoV infected 2468 individuals and caused 851 fatalities worldwide [
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. While researchers were still investigating the mechanisms to develop therapeutic strategies against MERS, another member of coronaviruses called SARS-CoV-2, emerged in Wuhan [
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Market civets were thought to be the possible source of SARS-CoV transmission to human, however, the virus strains in civets were found transmitted from horseshoe bats [
 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. MERS-CoV strains obtained from camels were highly similar to those isolated from humans; with highly prevalent MERS-CoV-specific antibodies in camels from the Middle East, Africa, and Asia [

 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>]. These observations suggest that MERS-CoV transmitted from camel to human. However, genome sequencing analysis revealed that MERS-CoV is phylogenetically related to bat coronaviruses [
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The zoonotic source of SARS-CoV-2 is not confirmed, however, its genome sequence exhibited close relatedness with two bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses [
 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thus, it is thought that bats are the possible source of origination for SARS-CoV-2. Like MERS-CoV and SARS- CoV, SARS-CoV-2 belongs to betacoronavirus (subgenus; Sarbecovirus) [
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Reportedly, the genome sequencing analysis has revealed over 80% similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, however, there are some differences at the structural protein levels. For instance, the 8a protein was reported missing while the aminoacids number in 8b and 3c protein were found fluctuating in SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. These differences can help in studying the infectiousness, transmission, and health impacts of COVID-19 infection.
