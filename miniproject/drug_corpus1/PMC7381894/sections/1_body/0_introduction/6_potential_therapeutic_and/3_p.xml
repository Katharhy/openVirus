<p id="par0050">Effective vaccines are important to prevent and control sporadic epidemics of emerging viruses. Although SARS-CoV was fully controlled during 2003, and MERS-CoV spreads poorly, yet the SARS-CoV-2 is spreading efficiently, thus the availability of vaccine is necessary to control further spread of the disease. Viral vectors, recombinant protein, viral-like particles, rhesusÎ¸-defensin-1, and protein cage-nanoparticles are generally effective in prevention against coronaviruses [

Interestingly, some vaccines are in pipelines such as mRNA based vaccine developed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the USA, which is currently in phase 1 clinical trial. INO-4800, a DNA based vaccine has already been developed by the Inovio pharmaceuticals and put under clinical trials in the United States (Inovio pharmaceuticals 2020) [
