    "In patients with severe or critical Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manifestations, a thromboinflammatory syndrome, with diffuse microvascular thrombosis, is increasingly evident as the final step of pro-inflammatory cytokines storm. Actually, no proven effective therapies for novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection exist. Preliminary observations on anticoagulant therapy appear to be associated with better outcomes in moderate and severe COVID-19 patients with signs of coagulopathy and in those requiring mechanical ventilation. The pathophysiology underlying the prothrombotic state elicited by SARS-CoV-2 outlines possible protective mechanisms of antithrombotic therapy (in primis anticoagulants) for this viral illness. The indications for antiplatelet/anticoagulant use (prevention, prophylaxis, therapy) are guided by the clinical context and the COVID-19 severity. We provide a practical approach on antithrombotic therapy management for COVID-19 patients from a multidisciplinary point of view. Highlights • An endothelial thromboinflammatory syndrome is involved in severe COVID-19 manifestations.• A pathophysiological rationale (anti-inflammatory and direct antiviral effects) motivates the use of antithrombotic therapy• Anticoagulant therapy is associated with better outcomes in case of coagulopathy and mechanical ventilation.• A potential role for antithrombotic therapy in COVID-19 prevention and treatment needs further investigation."
