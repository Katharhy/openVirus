<p id="p0055">Considering antihypertensive medications, there are advocates for both use and cessation of consumption. It is still unclear whether the high mortality rate of patients with hypertension comorbidity is due to the pathology of disorder or the treatment used to cure it such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). ACE2 has been shown to be a co-receptor for viral entry and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV (

In addition, serological, radiological, and histomorphological similarities of COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease (CTD-ILD) propose the postulation of triggering or simulating a form of organ-specific autoimmunity in predisposed patients. Also, some patients showed high-titer antiphospholipid antibodies, including anticardiolipin antibodies and anti-β2 glycoprotein antibodies (
