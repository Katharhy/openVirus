<p id="p0120">Over the last decade, the antiviral properties of repurposed drugs have gained considerable attention due to the lack of targeted treatments for specific emerging viruses (
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Law et al., 2013</xref>). Innumerable technical and bureaucratic challenges in 
 <italic>de novo</italic> antiviral drug development have resulted in a very low therapeutic molecule approval rate, and as such, viral diseases such as hepatitis C and HIV are still without a vaccine. In recent years, dengue, Ebola, Zika, and coronaviruses have become public health crises, creating an ongoing demand for immediate and profitable therapeutics solutions by using antiviral drug repurposing approaches (
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Boldescu et al., 2017</xref>). Particularly, when an epidemic occurs, prompt actions by known drugs might help to minimize the damage until virus-specific antiviral drugs or vaccines become available. For instance, niclosamide, a well-known antihelminthic drug, proved its repurposing potential for the treatment of Zika infections (

Another interesting candidate is chloroquine and its derivatives, which are normally indicated for malaria and have been extensively discussed in terms of their ability of the possible use for the treatment of COVID-19, as well as other diseases such as connective tissue disorders and some cancers including bladder, breast, colon, and prostate cancers (
