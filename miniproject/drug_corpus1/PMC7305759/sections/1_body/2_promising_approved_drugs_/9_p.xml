<p id="p0100">Recently, a new promising success was reported. A group of scientists claimed that human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2) can block early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infections (
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Monteil et al., 2020</xref>). ACE2 seems to be a key and common receptor for many coronaviruses as it was reported to be previously critical for SARS-CoV-1 and non-critical for MERS-CoV, and now it is introduced as a crucial receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (

 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Müller et al., 2012</xref>). Accordingly, preventing the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 is proposed as a treatment for patients with COVID-19; however, it is not clear whether hrsACE2 can block the growth of SARS-CoV-2.
