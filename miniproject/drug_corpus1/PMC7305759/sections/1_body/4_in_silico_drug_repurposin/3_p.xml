<p id="p0150">Characterization of viral evolution and the alterations in host cell metabolism through the use of single-cell viral metagenomic studies might shed light on the mechanisms of viral infections, including determination of the molecular signatures associated with virus-induced pathologies (

A computation-based methodology, namely, Viral-Track, applied to bronchoalveolar lavage samples from patients with severe and mild COVID-19 unveils a remarkable impact of the virus on the immune system of the patients with severe condition compared with those with mild condition, including replacement of the tissue-resident alveolar macrophages with recruited inflammatory monocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages and an altered CD8+ T cell cytotoxic response (
