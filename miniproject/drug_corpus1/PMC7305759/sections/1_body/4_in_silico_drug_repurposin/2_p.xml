<p id="p0145">There are considerable opportunities in systematically investigating the dynamic interactions between host and SARS-CoV-2 to identify target human proteins for repurposing known drugs. Targeting the host-virus interactions, which are essential in the virus life cycle and demonstrate less tendency of mutational resistance, might show effectiveness in developing robust treatment options for viral infections (

However, lack of data of the pathophysiology of the SARS-CoV-2 infection restrains the development of small molecule candidates based on the host-targeted strategies. Systematically mapping interactions between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins revealed that inhibitors of mRNA translation and regulators of the Sigma1 and Sigma2 receptors might have antiviral activity (

Even though the role of action of compounds targeting the Sigma receptors is not well defined, receptor ligands and their mechanisms involved in immune modulator activity are considered promising antiviral targets and numerous approved compounds hold the potential to be repurposed (
