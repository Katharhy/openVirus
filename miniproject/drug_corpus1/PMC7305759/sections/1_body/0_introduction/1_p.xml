Accordingly, studying historical epidemics can help us identify patterns of viral outbreaks and design a plan to prepare for the next pandemic. For example, if the unusual influenza-like illness from February to August 1918 was considered a harbinger, then perhaps the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic could have resulted in fewer casualties (

An overview of the deadliest historical pandemics from Antonine Plague in 165 CE to the ongoing COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-2019) pandemic, based on data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is illustrated in
