<p id="p0030">The phylogeny, virology, and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 is being studied extensively. At the genome level, SARS-CoV-2 has 79.5% homology to SARS-CoV-1, the causative agent of SARS in south China; 85%–96% identity with bat-SL-CoVZC45 (

A population genetic analysis of 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from China revealed that the causative agent of COVID-19 consists of two evolution types. Type L (70% prevalence in Wuhan), which is derived from the ancestral type S (30% prevalence in Wuhan), is more aggressive and contagious (

Zhou et al. investigated the COVID-19 agent through full genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, classifying it as a betacoronavirus (a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus), the same subgenus as SARS-CoV as well as several bat coronaviruses (
