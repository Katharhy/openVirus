<p>It is important to note that the “3 Ps” are interrelated and dynamically influence each other in a reciprocal relationship via multiple mechanisms. Hence, controlling one “P” may influence the other two in positive ways. Likewise, failing to account for or neglecting one “P” may negatively impact the other two. A prominent example of this reciprocal relationship can be seen in the 2003 H5N1 avian influenza outbreak in China [

A higher population density in low-and middle-income countries and larger family size were linked to poverty and greater demand for resources. The demand for employment, income, and food caused an intensification of animal husbandry practices without safety and sanitation. In those geographic areas with greater animal–human exposure and unregulated industrialization, H5N1 infections were facilitated by these factors and by weak regulations. The transmission of avian influenza H5N1 in China has been frequently explained via this interrelatedness of population, poverty, and poultry production [
