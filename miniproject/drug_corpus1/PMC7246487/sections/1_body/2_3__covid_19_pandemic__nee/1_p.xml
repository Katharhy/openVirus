 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-17-03171" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, the world has seen many changes since the “3 Ps” concept was originally proposed. Therefore, we believe that an expansion of the “3 Ps” model is warranted to better understand recent pandemics, explore additional determinants of global public health, and to create better plans and prevention strategies for the future. We recommend that the additional “Ps” delineated below be added to the original model.
