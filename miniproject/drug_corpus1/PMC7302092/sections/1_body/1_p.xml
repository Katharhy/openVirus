<p>Past experience with previous coronavirus epidemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) demonstrated that transplant patients had similar presentations to the general population.

 </sup> Data are rapidly accumulating on the impact of COVID-19 within the transplant community. COVID-19 cases have already been reported in 2 HT recipients in China. Both patients survived, one with a mild form of illness allowing for treatment and recovery at home, the other with progressive respiratory failure requiring inpatient admission, intravenous immunoglobulin, and methylprednisolone.

 </sup> Mild-moderate presentations with uncomplicated courses have also been reported after kidney and liver transplant. Since these initial reports, a growing number of solid organ transplant recipients have been hospitalized for COVID-19, particularly in New York City. In-hospital disease transmission is increasing, with hospitals increasingly cohorting patients with COVID-19 in separate intensive care units and wards, irrespective of transplant status. Specific to HT recipients, manifestations of myocarditis—with high troponin levels, ECG changes, and new left ventricular dysfunction—may be mistaken for rejection. Yet endomyocardial biopsies are being restricted because of risks of exposure. The scope and scale of the current epidemic are unmatched, and online reports raise concerns about rapidly progressive disease leading to morbidity and mortality.
