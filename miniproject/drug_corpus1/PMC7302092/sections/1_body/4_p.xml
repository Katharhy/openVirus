<p>These issues of feasibility and safety extend not only to recipients but also to organ donors, organ procurement organizations, and recovery teams. As COVID-19 continues to spread, we must be vigilant in choosing uninfected donors, recognizing that many may be asymptomatic carriers and that current testing has limitations. Chest computed tomography may also be necessary to exclude radiographic pneumonia. In discussing donor offers with listed patients, expanded consent should include the potential risks of a COVID-19–positive donor, despite procedures in place to mitigate risk. It is equally important to protect procurement teams, who are asked to perform time-sensitive, invasive procedures in unfamiliar facilities that may lack appropriate personal protective equipment or experienced operating room staff. Important organ procurement organization measures in the United States include expansion of the Uniform Donor Risk Assessment Interview, which now includes targeted questions on exposure to COVID-19. Mandatory COVID-19 testing for all donors is the goal, which is now occurring with increasing frequency in most regions of the United States. If donors test positive for COVID-19, their organs should not be used for transplant, although they could be considered for scientific purposes to better understand the effects of the virus on the myocardium. COVID-19–specific codes have been used to inform the United Network of Organ Sharing, the federally contracted organization that keeps track of all solid organ transplantation, of the circumstances under which an organ was not accepted.
