<p>Important decisions have already arisen about actively listed patients. At any given time, a significant portion of patients are waiting in-hospital for HT. These patients are at higher risk for contracting the virus compared with others waiting at home. If they are subsequently infected with COVID-19, they are at risk for more severe infection (or coinfection) because of their underlying health conditions, and risk delisting. If possible, these patients should not be cared for by nurses who also have COVID-19–positive patients. However, as cases continue to rise, this may not be feasible. For all listed patients, no matter whether they are hospitalized or at home, transplant centers should highlight the wait list mortality risk–benefit ratio and provide institutional updates by direct telephone communication or a letter followed by a telephone communication.</p>
