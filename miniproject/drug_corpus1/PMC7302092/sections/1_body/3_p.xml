<p>As the pandemic continues to evolve, a centerâ€™s transplant volume may require staged reduction to meet intensive care unit bed, staffing, and medical equipment needs of the majority nontransplant population.

 </sup> Many centers in the United States, particularly in New York, have inactivated most of their HT waiting list, reserving active transplant status for only those patients with a presumed wait list mortality of 1 to 2 weeks, thus limiting transplant to patients in tiers 1 or 2 of the new heart allocation policy. Restrictions are also in effect for highly sensitized patients requiring intensive perioperative care and prolonged immunosuppression and with the need for frequent biopsy surveillance. It is uncertain whether women may be disproportionally affected in access to transplant, given their high sensitivity rates. For listed patients who are hospitalized without a strict contraindication to durable left ventricular assist device implantation, left ventricular assist device as a bridge to transplant may be a viable strategy to get at-risk patients home and out of the hospital, minimizing their exposure to COVID-19. Left ventricular assist device implants should not be performed in elective cases because of resource constraints and potential for nosocomial infection.
