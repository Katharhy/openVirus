<p>The changing landscape also affects the post-HT ambulatory population. To reduce hospital volumes, most outpatient practices have shifted toward telemedicine. Virtual medicine minimizes in-person contact with the healthcare system, reducing patient risk of exposure. However, patients still must go to laboratories for serum drug levels of immunosuppressive agents. One question that arises is how we can or should monitor for rejection in stable outpatients if right heart catheterization and endomyocardial biopsy are deemed nonurgent. Perhaps institutions will shift to increased use of noninvasive monitoring with echocardiography, gene profiling (for acute cellular rejection), or donor-derived cell free DNA (for antibody-mediated rejection). What is considered “medically necessary” for these patients? What will be the implications of postponing some of this routine care on the rates of rejection or cardiac allograft vasculopathy in the longer term?</p>
