<p>For patients who require HT during this pandemic, rapid polymerase chain reaction testing to exclude community- or hospital-acquired COVID-19 infection is required, and extra precautions should be taken to mitigate the risk of postoperative exposure. This extends to visitors (many of whom are restricted at various hospitals across the country), nurses, respiratory therapists, and other intensive care unit staff. Negative pressure rooms in a COVID-19â€“free zone should be standard of care. Recipients should be retested before hospital discharge and receive focused education around disease prevention at home.</p>
