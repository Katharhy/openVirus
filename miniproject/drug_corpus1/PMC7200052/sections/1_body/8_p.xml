<p id="Par10">Specific drugs for SARS-CoV-2 should be developed to target the RdRp regions directly involved in the viral genome replication and transcription. Nucleoside analogs would be the most obvious class of drugs to be repositioned or de novo developed. In particular, few analogs are already available originally developed to target RdRps of other RNA viruses, such as Remdesivir (Ebola virus) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], NHC EIDD-1931 (broad spectrum) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and Sofosbuvir (Hepatitis C virus) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Remdesivir and Favipiravir are currently evaluated in clinical trials to assess the efficacy in SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects (Remdesivir: NCT04292899; NCT04257656) (Favipiravir: NCT04310228). NHC EIDD-1931 has been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro and in a pre-clinical animal model [

However, all three of them have been developed for negative-sense RNA viruses which show a significant difference in the RdRp sequence and structure compared to the positive-sense SARS-CoV-2 RNA virus. In this respect, Sofosbuvir could represent the optimal nucleoside analog to be repositioned to treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indeed, it has been developed for the positive-sense HCV RNA virus which shares high sequence and structural homology with SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, Sofosbuvir has been already shown to be effective for other positive-sense RNA viruses, namely Yellow Fever and Hepatitis A virus [
