<p id="Par4">Inter-human transmission of coronaviruses is mediated by saliva droplets reaching the new host through coughing and sneezing, both in symptomatic and asymptomatic positive subjects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Moreover, active virus replication in the upper respiratory tract is observed in patients also after the peak of respiratory symptoms, which may result in prolonged viral spreading of the infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Therefore, reducing the viral titer represents a major goal in order to slow/block the disease progression as well as to significantly limit the viral shedding. The latter objective would result in the lowering of R0 from 2.5 (2.5 people infected by a positive subject) to a value &lt; 1 (less than one person infected by a positive subject). In this way the spread of the virus would be drastically contained and lastly blocked. Finally, the reduced viral replication would give the opportunity to the adaptive humoral immune system (with the production of antibodies, hopefully neutralizing) enough time to mount a sufficient primary response capable of containing further viral replication and eradicating the infection.
