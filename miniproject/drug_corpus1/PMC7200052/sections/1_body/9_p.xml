<p id="Par11">In conclusion, as for all RNA viruses, the RdRp of the newly identified positive-sense human SARS-CoV-2 RNA virus represents the most optimal target for an antiviral drug. Linear amino acid sequence as well as molecule structure show the highest homology to RdRps of other positive-sense RNA viruses. Therefore, it is highly predictable that an antiviral developed for an RNA virus with a genome of the same polarity (i.e. Sofosbuvir for HCV) could have a higher inhibitory efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2, compared to those developed for negative-sense RNA viruses. Overall, the possibility of repositioning already available drugs will significantly accelerate the containment of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and, hopefully, of future pandemics due to other emerging zoonotic RNA viruses.</p>
