<p id="Par3">Similarly to the two new human CoV emerged in the past 20 years, namely the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], also the current SARS-CoV-2 is suggested to be originated as a zoonosis from bats [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Moreover, evidences show that in bats there is a continuous circulation of additional SARS-like and MERS-like coronaviruses able to replicate efficiently in primary human lung cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It is therefore predictable that new epidemics/pandemics due to zoonotic coronaviruses will emerge in humans in the future. Consequently, together with a preventive vaccine, effective antivirals are needed to be developed within a broader program of Global preparedness.
