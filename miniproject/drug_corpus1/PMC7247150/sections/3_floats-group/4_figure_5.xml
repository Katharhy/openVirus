 <caption>
  <p>Localisation of the evolutionary-correlated residues of Mpros (black sticks). The correlated mutation analysis (CMA) analysis provided four groups of evolutionary-correlated residues. The SARS-CoV-2 Mpro structure is presented as a cartoon, the active site residues are shown as red sticks, the unique residues of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro as blue sticks, and the asterisk (*) indicates the residue belonging to the evolutionary-correlated residues, unique for SARS-CoV Mpro. The loop C44-P52 is coloured black and the F185-T201 loop is orange. Please note that within one of the correlated groups (upper left), the residues from C44-P52 loop are correlated with Q189 from the linker loop and with residue from III domain.</p>
