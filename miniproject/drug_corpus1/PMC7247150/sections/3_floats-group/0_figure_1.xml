  <p>The differences between the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus main protease (SARS-CoV Mpro) and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro structures. (
   <bold>A</bold>) The overall structure of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Mpros with differing amino acids are marked as black (SARS-CoV Mpro) and blue (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro). (
   <bold>B</bold>) Close-up of the active site cavity and bound N3 inhibitor into SARS-CoV (black sticks) and SARS-CoV-2 (blue sticks) Mpros. The catalytic water molecule that resembles the position of the third member of the catalytic triad adopted from the cysteine proteases is shown for both SARS-CoV (black sphere) and SARS-CoV-2 (blue sphere) Mpros. The active site residues are shown as red sticks and the proteinsâ€™ structures are shown in surface representation. The differing residues in position 46 located near the entrance to the active site are marked with an asterisk (*) on the (
   <bold>A</bold>) and as blue and black lines on the (
   <bold>B</bold>) panel.
