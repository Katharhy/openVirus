  <p>Potential mutability of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with the most energetically favourable potential mutations of amino acids marked as green surface. Positions of amino acids that differ from the ones in SARS-CoV Mpro structure marked as blue sticks. Catalytic dyad marked as red. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The catalytic site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro is shown as surface with the most energetically favourable potential mutations shown as green, neutral as white, and unfavourable as red. The C44-P52 loop is shown as black mesh.
