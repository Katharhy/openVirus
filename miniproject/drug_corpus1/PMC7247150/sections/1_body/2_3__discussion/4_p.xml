<p>The continuous effort of Diamond Light Source group [
 <xref rid="B46-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] performing massive XChem crystallographic fragment screen against Mpro has resulted in 22 non-covalent hits in the active site and 44 covalent hits in the active site (March 17th). Interestingly, two hits were identified on the dimer interface. The positions of the hits inside the active site overlap with the position of the maximal accessible volume calculated from MD simulations and supports our finding on large binding site flexibility (
