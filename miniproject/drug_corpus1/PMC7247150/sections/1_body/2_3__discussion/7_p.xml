<p>The initial analysis of the effect of the 12 amino acid replacements in SARS-CoV Mpro on the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro structure stability was expected to provide neutral or stabilising contribution to protein folding. Indeed, all replacements were found to stabilise the protein’s folding (e.g., H134F: −0.85 kcal/mol) or have an almost neutral character (e.g., R88K, S94A, T285A, I286L). The analysis of the potential risk of further Mpro structure evolution within the binding cavity suggests that mutations of residues that contribute to ligand binding or access to the active site are energetically favourable, and are likely to occur. Some of the residues that are prone to mutate would provide the inactive enzyme (e.g., the residues forming the catalytic dyad) and therefore could be considered as a blind alley in enzyme evolution, but others (e.g., amino acids from the C44-P52 loop, T45, S46, E47, L50) could significantly modify the inhibitors binding mode of Mpro. The locations of residues on the regulatory loop, which are prone to mutate puts in question the efforts to design inhibitors of the MPro active site as a viable long-term strategy. However, our results also indicate residues that are energetically unfavourable to mutate (e.g., P39, R40, P52, G143, G146, or L167), which could provide an anchor for successful drug design that can outlast coronavirus Mpro variability in future. Alternatively, we would suggest targeting the region between II and III domains, which contributes to the dimer formation.</p>
