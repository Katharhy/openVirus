<p>In early December 2019, the first atypical pneumonia outbreak associated with the novel coronavirus of zoonotic origin (SARS-CoV-2) appeared in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China [

 <xref rid="B5-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In humans, coronaviruses usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses, such as the common cold, however, the rarer forms of CoVs can be lethal. By the end of 2019, six kinds of human CoV have been identified: HCoV-NL63; HCoV-229E, belonging to Alphacoronavirus genera; HCoV-OC43; HCoV-HKU1; severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV); and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), belonging to Betacoronavirus genera [
 <xref rid="B4-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Of the aforementioned CoVs, the latter two are the most dangerous and have been associated with the outbreak of two epidemics at the beginning of the 21st century [

 <xref rid="B2-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. On the basis of the phylogenetic analysis of the genomic data of SARS-CoV-2, Zhang et al. indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is most closely related to two SARS-CoV sequences isolated from bats in 2015 and 2017. This suggests that the bat CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share a common ancestor, and the new virus can be considered as a SARS-like virus [
