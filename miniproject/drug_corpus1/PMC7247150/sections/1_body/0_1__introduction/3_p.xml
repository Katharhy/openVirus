<p>On the basis of the three sequenced genomes of SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan/IVDC-HB-01/2019, Wuhan/IVDC-HB-04/2019, and Wuhan/IVDC-HB-05/2019, provided by the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, China), Wu et al. performed a detailed genome annotation. The results were further compared to related coronaviruses—1008 human SARS-CoV, 338 bat SARS-like CoV, and 3131 human MERS-CoV, indicating that the three strains of SARS-CoV-2 have almost identical genomes with 14 ORFs, encoding 27 proteins including 15 non-structural proteins (nsp1–10 and nsp12–16), 4 structural proteins (S, E, M, N), and 8 accessory proteins (3a, 3b, p6, 7a, 7b, 8b, 9b, and orf14). The only identified difference in the genome consisting of ≈29.8 kb nucleotides consisted of five nucleotides. The genome annotation revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is fairly similar to SARS-CoV at the amino acid level, however, there are some differences in the occurrence of accessory proteins, such as the fact that the 8a accessory protein, present in SARS-CoV, is absent in SARS-CoV-2, as well as the fact that the lengths of 8b and 3b proteins do not match. The phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 showed it to be most closely related to SARS-like bat viruses, but no strain of SARS-like bat virus was found to cover all equivalent proteins of SARS-CoV-2 [
