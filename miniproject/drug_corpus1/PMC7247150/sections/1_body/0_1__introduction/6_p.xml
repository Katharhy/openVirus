<p>In this study, we investigated how only 12 different residues, located mostly on the protein’s surface, may affect the behaviour of the active site pocket of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protein. To this end, we performed classical molecular dynamics simulations (cMD) of both SARS and SARS-CoV-2 Mpros, as well as mixed-solvents molecular dynamics simulations (MixMD) combined with small molecules’ tracking approach to analyse the conformational changes in the binding site. The experiment setup and methodology workflow is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-03099">Figure S1</xref>. Despite the structural differences in the active sites of both Mpro proteins, major issues involving plasticity and flexibility of the binding site could result in significant difficulties in inhibitor design for this molecular target. Indeed, an in silico attempt has already been made involving a massive virtual screening for Mpro inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 using Deep Docking [

 <xref rid="B24-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, none of such attempts is likely to lead to clinical advances in the fight against SARS-CoV-2 for reasons we elaborate below.
