<p>The genome of coronaviruses typically contains a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA but it differs in size ranging between ≈26 and ≈32 kb. It also includes a variable number of open reading frames (ORFs), from 6 to 11. The first ORF is the largest, encoding nearly 70% of the entire genome and 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) [

 <xref rid="B8-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Of the nsps, the main protease (Mpro, also known as a chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease, 3CLpro), encoded by nsp5, has been found to play a fundamental role in viral gene expression and replication, and thus it is an attractive target for anti-CoV drug design [
