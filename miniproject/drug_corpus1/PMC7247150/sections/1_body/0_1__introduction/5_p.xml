<p>The first released crystal structure of the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB) ID: 6lu7) was obtained by Prof. Yangâ€™s group from ShanghaiTech by co-crystallisation with a peptide-like inhibitor N-[(5 methylisoxazol-3-yl)carbonyl]alanyl-L-valyl-N~1-((1R,2Z)-4-(benzyloxy)-4-oxo-1-{[(3R)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl]methyl}but-2-enyl)-L-leucinamide (N3 or PRD_002214) [

The same inhibitor was co-crystallised with other human coronaviruses, such as HCoV-NL63 (PDB ID: 5gwy), HCoV-KU1 (PDB ID: 3d23), or SARS-CoV (PDB ID: 2amq). This enzyme naturally forms a dimer, each of whose monomer consists of the N-terminal catalytic region and a C-terminal region [

Although 12 residues differ between both CoVs, only one, namely, S46 in SARS-CoV-2 (A46 in SARS-CoV), is located in the proximity of the entrance to the active site. However, such a small structural change would typically be not expected to substantially affect the binding of small molecules [

Such an assumption would routinely involve the generation of a library of derivatives and analogous on the basis of the scaffold of a drug that inhibits the corresponding protein in the SARS-CoV case. As shown in the present paper, regrettably, this strategy is not likely to succeed with SARS-CoV-2 for Mpro as a molecular target.
