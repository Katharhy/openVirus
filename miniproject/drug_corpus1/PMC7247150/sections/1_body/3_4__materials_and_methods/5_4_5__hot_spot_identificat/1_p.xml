<p>AQUA-DUCT [
 <xref rid="B30-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] was used to detect regions occupied by molecules of interest, as well as to identify the densest sites using a local solvent distribution approach. Those so-called hot-spots could be calculated as local and/or global, on the basis of the distribution of tracked molecules that visited the 
 <italic>Object</italic> (local) or just the 
 <italic>Scope</italic> without visiting the 
 <italic>Object</italic> (global); here, they were considered as potential binding sites. For clarity, the size of each sphere representing a particular hot-spot was changed to reflect its occupation level. The selection of the most significant hot-spots consisted of indicating points showing the highest density in particular regions. From the set of points in the space, small groups of hot-spots were determined. Groups were further defined by distance (radius) from each other. Any point found within a distance shorter than the determined radius (3 Ã…) from any other point being part of a given group was counted toward the group. For each so designated group of points, one showing the highest density was chosen as representing the place.
