<p>SARS-CoV Mpro was downloaded from the PDB (PDB ID: 1q2w). Blast [
 <xref rid="B61-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] was run on the basis of the amino acid sequence. As a result, 2643 sequences of viral main proteases similar to chain A SARS-CoV Mpro were obtained. Clustal Omega [
 <xref rid="B62-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] was used to prepare an alignment of those sequences. Comulator [
 <xref rid="B33-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] was then employed to calculate the correlation between amino acids and, on the basis of the results, groups of positions in SARS-CoV Mpro sequence were selected whose amino acid occurrences strongly depended on each other.
