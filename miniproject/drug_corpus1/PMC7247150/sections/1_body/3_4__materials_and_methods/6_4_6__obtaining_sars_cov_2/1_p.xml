<p>SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was downloaded from the PDB as a complex with an N3 inhibitor (PDB ID: 6lu7). Tblastn [
 <xref rid="B59-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] was run on the basis of the protein amino acid sequence. We obtained 100% identity with 10055â€“10972 region of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro complete genome (Sequence ID: 
 <italic>MN985262.1</italic>). Blastx [
 <xref rid="B60-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] calculations were run with the selected region, and orf1a polyprotein (NCBI reference sequence: 
 <italic>YP_009725295.1</italic>) amino acid sequence, identical with the previously downloaded SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, was received.
