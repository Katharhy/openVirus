<p>Because our analysis was focused on the binding site that is surrounded by short loops only, to keep a reasonable combination of the number and length of simulations, the single simulation length was set to 50 ns. As has been shown elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B51-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="B52-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], longer simulations do not provide additional information and could even have a tendency to move away from the native-like structures. This hypothesis was verified on 200 ns long simulations where all observed changes were combined with the movement of the III domain (
