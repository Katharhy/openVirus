<p>The Packmol software [
 <xref rid="B57-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] was used to build the initial systems, consisting of protein (protonated according to the previously described procedure), water, and particular cosolvent molecules. We added 4 and 3 Na
 <sup>+</sup> ions to the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and the SARS-CoV Mpro, respectively. It was assumed that the percentage concentration of the cosolvent should not exceed 5% (in the case of ACN, DMSO, MEO, and URE), or should be about 1% in the case of BNZ and PHN phenol (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-03099">Table S5</xref>). The mixed-solvent MD simulation procedures (minimization, equilibration, and production) carried out using the AMBER 18 package were identical to the classical MD simulations. Only the heating stage differed—it was extended up to 40 ps. PMEMD CUDA package of AMBER 18 software [
 <xref rid="B50-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] was used to run two replicas of 50 ns for each cosolvent of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Mpro systems using apo structures and structure with co-crystalised N3 inhibitor (removed before starting the simulations), thus providing a total of 2.4 μs of MixMD simulations.
