<p>AQUA-DUCT was used to analyse maximal accessible volume (MAV), defined as the 
 <italic>outer</italic> pocket [
 <xref rid="B30-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Pockets were calculated by analysis of paths found during molecules tracking step in AQUA-DUCT. A regular grid was constructed, spanning all paths. The grid size was 1 Ã…. For each grid cell, the density of tracked molecules was calculated. Grid cells with nonzero density were used for pocket detection; the 
 <italic>outer</italic> pocket represented the maximal possible space that could be explored by tracked molecules.
