<p>Six different cosolvents: acetonitrile (ACN), benzene (BNZ), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), methanol (MEO), phenol (PHN), and urea (URE) were selected to perform the mixed-solvent MD simulations. The chemical structures of cosolvent molecules were downloaded from the ChemSpider database [
 <xref rid="B53-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], and a dedicated set of parameters was prepared. Parameters for ACN were adopted from the work by Nikitin and Lyubartsev [
 <xref rid="B54-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and parameters for URE were modified using the 8Mureabox force field to obtain parameters for a single molecule. For the rest of the co-solvent molecules, parameters were prepared using Antechamber [
 <xref rid="B55-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] with Gasteiger charges [
 <xref rid="B56-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The number of added water and cosolvents molecules is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-03099">Table S5</xref>, and the parameters for cosolvents are available in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-03099">Tables S6â€“S11</xref>.
