<p>FoldX software [
 <xref rid="B35-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] was used to insert substitutions into the structures of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Mpros. To analyse the changes in energetic contribution to the protein stability of the two structures, 12 single-point mutations were introduced to the SARS structure using the BuildModel module. The BuildModel module introduces substitution(s) of selected amino acid(s), optimizes the structure of a new variant, and calculates the difference in the Gibbs free energy of protein folding between the wild-type and mutant variant in kilocalories per mole. The lower the difference in energetical terms, the more stable the mutant variant should be. Each of the residues in SARS-CoV Mpro was mutated to the respective SARS-CoV-2 Mpro residue, and the difference in total energies between the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and the mutant structures were calculated. Then, to investigate further possible mutations of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, single nucleotide substitutions were introduced to the SARS-CoV-2 main protease gene. If a substitution of a single nucleotide caused translation to an amino acid different than the corresponding residue in the wild-type structure, an appropriate mutation was proposed with FoldX software.
