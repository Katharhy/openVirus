<p>The general distribution of the global hot-spots from particular cosolvents was quite similar and verified specific interactions with the particular regions of the analysed proteins. A notable number of hot-spots were located around the amino acids that varied between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Mpros (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-03099">Figures S4 and S5</xref>). The largest number and the densest hot-spots are located within the binding cavity and the region essential for Mpro dimerisation [
 <xref rid="B31-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], between the II and III domains. The binding cavity is particularly occupied by urea, benzene, and phenol hot-spots, which is especially interesting because these solvents exhibit different chemical properties. In addition, the analysis performed by PARS server [
 <xref rid="B32-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] detected three cavities located between domain II and III that could contribute significantly to the protein flexibility; however, none of them was found as conserved and therefore were not considered as regulatory sites.
