<p>A close inspection of the binding site cavity provided further details of cosolvent distribution. The benzene hot-spots for the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro structure are localised deep inside the active site cavity, whereas SARS-CoV Mpro features mostly benzene hot-spots at the cavity entrance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03099-f005">Figure 5</xref>). This is interesting because, in the absence of cosolvent molecules, the water accessible volume for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was 50% smaller than in the case of SARS-CoV Mpro, underlining huge plasticity of the binding cavity and suggesting large conformational changes induced by interaction with a potential ligand. It is also interesting that both global and local hot-spots of the SARS-CoV Mpro structure are located in the proximity of the C44-P52 loop, which potentially regulates the access to the active site.
