<p>The mixed-solvent MD simulations were run with six cosolvents: acetonitrile (ACN), benzene (BNZ), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), methanol (MEO), phenol (PHN), and urea (URE). Cosolvents were used as specific molecular probes, representing different chemical properties and functional groups that would complement the different regions of the binding site and the protein itself. Using small molecules tracking approach, we analysed the flow through the Mpros structures and identified the regions in which those molecules were being trapped and/or caged, located within the protein itself (global hot-spots; 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-03099">Figures S4 and S5</xref>) and inside the binding cavity (local hot-spots; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03099-f004">Figure 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-03099">Figure S6</xref>). The size and location of both types of hot-spots differed and provided complementary information. The global hot-spots identified potential binding/interacting sites in the whole protein structure and additionally provided information about regions attracting particular types of molecules, whereas local hot-spots described the actual available binding space of a specific cavity.
