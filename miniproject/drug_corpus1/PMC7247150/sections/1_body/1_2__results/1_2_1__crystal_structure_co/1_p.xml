<p>The first SARS-CoV-2 main protease’s crystallographic structure was made publicly available through the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [
 <xref rid="B25-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] as a complex with an N3 inhibitor (PDB ID: 6lu7) [
 <xref rid="B13-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Next, the structure without the inhibitor was also made available (PDB ID: 6y2e) [
 <xref rid="B26-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We refer to these structures as SARS-CoV-2 Mpro
 <sup>N3</sup> and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, respectively. We also used two structures of the SARS-CoV main protease: one, referred to as SARS-CoV Mpro
 <sup>N3</sup> (PDB ID: 2amq), co-crystallised with the same N3 inhibitor, and the other without an inhibitor (PDB ID: 1q2w), which we refer to as SARS-CoV Mpro. The SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and SARS-CoV Mpro structures differ by only 12 amino acids located mostly on the proteins’ surface (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-03099">Table S1</xref>). Both enzymes share the same structural composition; they comprise three domains: domains I (residues 1–101) and II (residues 102–184) consist of an antiparallel β-barrel, and the α-helical domain III (residues 201–301) is required for the enzymatic activity [
 <xref rid="B27-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Both enzymes resemble the structure of cysteine proteases, although their active site is lacking the third catalytic residue [
 <xref rid="B28-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]; their active site comprises a catalytic dyad, namely, H41 and C145, and a particularly stable water molecule forms at least three hydrogen bond interactions with surrounding residues, including the catalytic histidine, which corresponds to the position of a third catalytic member (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03099-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). It should be also noted that one of the differing amino acids in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, namely, S46, is located on a C44-P52 loop, which is flanking the active site cavity.
