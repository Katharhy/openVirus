<p>A total of 2 µs classical molecular dynamics (cMD) simulations of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Mpros with different starting points were run to examine the plasticity of their binding cavities. As different starting points we used (i) SARS-CoV-2 Mpro apo structure; (ii) SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with an N3 ligand, which was removed before starting the simulation; (iii) SARS-CoV Mpro apo structure; and (iv) SARS-CoV Mpro with the same N3 ligand, which was also removed before starting the simulation. A total of 10 replicas of 50 ns classical molecular dynamics simulations were performed for each protein. To improve conformation sampling, the starting geometry for each system was kept but the initial vectors were randomly assigned. A combination of the cMD approach with water molecules used as molecular probes is assumed to provide a highly detailed picture of the protein’s interior dynamics [

The small molecules tracking approach was used to determine the accessibility of the active site pocket in both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Mpros, and a local distribution approach was used to provide information about an overall distribution of solvent in the proteins’ interior. To properly examine the flexibility of both active site cavities, we used the time-window mode implemented in AQUA-DUCT software [
 <xref rid="B30-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] to analyse the water molecules’ flow through the cavity in a 10 ns time step and combined that with the outer pocket calculations to examine the plasticity and maximal accessible volume (MAV) of the binding cavity.
