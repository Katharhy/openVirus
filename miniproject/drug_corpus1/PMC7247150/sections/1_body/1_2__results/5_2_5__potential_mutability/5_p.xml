<p>Additionally, the potential mutability of the binding cavity was investigated. Residues belonging to the binding cavity were found within 7 â„« from the N3 inhibitor. Then, we calculated the differences in the Gibbs free energy of protein folding with respect to the wild-type protein (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-03099">Table S3</xref>) and presented the results as a heat map. The most energetically favourable potential mutations are shown as green, neutral as white, and unfavourable as red (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03099-f006">Figure 6</xref>B). Interestingly, residues forming the catalytic dyad, namely, H41 and C145, are also prone to mutate. However, probably the most important message comes from the analysis of the potential mutability of the C44-P52 loop. Mutation of four of them has a stabilising effect for the protein, and is near-neutral for the rest the effect. These results indicate that the future evolution of the Mpro protein can significantly reduce the potential use of this protein as a molecular target for coronavirus treatment due to a highly probable development of drug resistance of this virus through mutations.
