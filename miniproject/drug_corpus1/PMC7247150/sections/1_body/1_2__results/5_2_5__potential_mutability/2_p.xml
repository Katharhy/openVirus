<p>Indeed, the analysis performed with Comulator software [
 <xref rid="B33-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] showed that within viral Mpros, evolutionary-correlated residues are dispersed throughout the structure. This indirectly supports our previous findings that distant amino acid mutation can contribute substantially to the binding site plasticity. It is worth adding that among evolutionary-correlated residues, we identified also those that differ between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Mpros, located on the C44-P52 loop (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03099-f005">Figure 5</xref>) and the F185-T201 linker loop. The CMA analysis indicated that particular residues in both loops are evolutionary-correlated. The Q189 from the linker loop correlates with residues from the C44-P52 loop, whereas R188, A191, and A194 correlate with selected residues from all domains, but not with the C44-P52 loop. As was shown, the mutation of amino acids distant from active site residues, which are evolutionary correlated, is most likely to modify the active site accessibility [
