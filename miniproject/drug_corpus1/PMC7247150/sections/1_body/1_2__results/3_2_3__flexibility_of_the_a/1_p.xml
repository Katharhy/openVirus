<p>To further examine the plasticity and flexibility of the main proteases binding cavities, we focused on the movements of loops surrounding their entrances and regulating the active sitesâ€™ accessibility. We found that one of the analysed loops of the SARS-CoV Mpro, namely, C44-P52 loop, was more flexible than the corresponding loops of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro structure, whereas the adjacent loops were mildly flexible (

On the other hand, such flexibility could suggest that the presence of an inhibitor might stabilise the loops surrounding the active site. The analysis of B-factors of all deposited Mpro crystal structures fully confirmed these statements (
