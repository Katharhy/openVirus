In the absence of an effective vaccine, inhibitor repurposing or de novo drug design may offer a longer-term strategy to combat this and future infections due to similar viruses. Here, we report on detailed classical and mixed-solvent molecular dynamics simulations of the main protease (Mpro) enriched by evolutionary and stability analysis of the protein. The results were compared with those for a highly similar severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) Mpro protein. In spite of a high level of sequence similarity, the active sites in both proteins showed major differences in both shape and size, indicating that repurposing SARS drugs for COVID-19 may be futile. Furthermore, analysis of the binding site&#x02019;s conformational changes during the simulation time indicated its flexibility and plasticity, which dashes hopes for rapid and reliable drug design. Conversely, structural stability of the protein with respect to flexible loop mutations indicated that the virus&#x02019; mutability will pose a further challenge to the rational design of small-molecule inhibitors. However, few residues contribute significantly to the protein stability and thus can be considered as key anchoring residues for Mpro inhibitor design.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>coronavirus</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics simulations</kwd><kwd>ligand tracking approach</kwd><kwd>drug design</kwd><kwd>small-molecule inhibitors</kwd><kwd>evolutionary analysis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-ijms-21-03099"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>In early December 2019, the first atypical pneumonia outbreak associated with the novel coronavirus of zoonotic origin (SARS-CoV-2) appeared in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China [<xref rid="B1-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In general, coronaviruses (CoVs) are classified into four major genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus (which primarily infect mammals), Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus (which primarily infect birds) [<xref rid="B3-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In humans, coronaviruses usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses, such as the common cold, however, the rarer forms of CoVs can be lethal. By the end of 2019, six kinds of human CoV have been identified: HCoV-NL63; HCoV-229E, belonging to Alphacoronavirus genera; HCoV-OC43; HCoV-HKU1; severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV); and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), belonging to Betacoronavirus genera [<xref rid="B4-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Of the aforementioned CoVs, the latter two are the most dangerous and have been associated with the outbreak of two epidemics at the beginning of the 21st century [<xref rid="B6-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In January 2020, SARS-CoV-2 was isolated and announced as a new, seventh type of human coronavirus. It was classified as a Betacoronavirus [<xref rid="B2-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. On the basis of the phylogenetic analysis of the genomic data of SARS-CoV-2, Zhang et al. indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is most closely related to two SARS-CoV sequences isolated from bats in 2015 and 2017. This suggests that the bat CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share a common ancestor, and the new virus can be considered as a SARS-like virus [<xref rid="B7-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The genome of coronaviruses typically contains a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA but it differs in size ranging between &#x02248;26 and &#x02248;32 kb. It also includes a variable number of open reading frames (ORFs), from 6 to 11. The first ORF is the largest, encoding nearly 70% of the entire genome and 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) [<xref rid="B3-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Of the nsps, the main protease (Mpro, also known as a chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease, 3CLpro), encoded by nsp5, has been found to play a fundamental role in viral gene expression and replication, and thus it is an attractive target for anti-CoV drug design [<xref rid="B9-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The remaining ORFs encode accessory and structural proteins, including spike surface glycoprotein (S), small envelope protein (E), matrix protein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N).</p><p>On the basis of the three sequenced genomes of SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan/IVDC-HB-01/2019, Wuhan/IVDC-HB-04/2019, and Wuhan/IVDC-HB-05/2019, provided by the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, China), Wu et al. performed a detailed genome annotation. The results were further compared to related coronaviruses&#x02014;1008 human SARS-CoV, 338 bat SARS-like CoV, and 3131 human MERS-CoV, indicating that the three strains of SARS-CoV-2 have almost identical genomes with 14 ORFs, encoding 27 proteins including 15 non-structural proteins (nsp1&#x02013;10 and nsp12&#x02013;16), 4 structural proteins (S, E, M, N), and 8 accessory proteins (3a, 3b, p6, 7a, 7b, 8b, 9b, and orf14). The only identified difference in the genome consisting of &#x02248;29.8 kb nucleotides consisted of five nucleotides. The genome annotation revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is fairly similar to SARS-CoV at the amino acid level, however, there are some differences in the occurrence of accessory proteins, such as the fact that the 8a accessory protein, present in SARS-CoV, is absent in SARS-CoV-2, as well as the fact that the lengths of 8b and 3b proteins do not match. The phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 showed it to be most closely related to SARS-like bat viruses, but no strain of SARS-like bat virus was found to cover all equivalent proteins of SARS-CoV-2 [<xref rid="B10-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>As previously mentioned, the main protease is one of the key enzymes in the viral life cycle. Together with other non-structural proteins (papain-like protease, helicase, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) and the spike glycoprotein structural protein, it is essential for interactions between the virus and host cell receptor during viral entry [<xref rid="B11-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Initial analyses of genomic sequences of the four nsps mentioned above indicate that those enzymes are highly conserved, sharing more than 90% sequence similarity with the corresponding SARS-CoV enzymes [<xref rid="B12-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The first released crystal structure of the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB) ID: 6lu7) was obtained by Prof. Yang&#x02019;s group from ShanghaiTech by co-crystallisation with a peptide-like inhibitor N-[(5 methylisoxazol-3-yl)carbonyl]alanyl-L-valyl-N~1-((1R,2Z)-4-(benzyloxy)-4-oxo-1-{[(3R)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl]methyl}but-2-enyl)-L-leucinamide (N3 or PRD_002214) [<xref rid="B13-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The same inhibitor was co-crystallised with other human coronaviruses, such as HCoV-NL63 (PDB ID: 5gwy), HCoV-KU1 (PDB ID: 3d23), or SARS-CoV (PDB ID: 2amq). This enzyme naturally forms a dimer, each of whose monomer consists of the N-terminal catalytic region and a C-terminal region [<xref rid="B14-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Although 12 residues differ between both CoVs, only one, namely, S46 in SARS-CoV-2 (A46 in SARS-CoV), is located in the proximity of the entrance to the active site. However, such a small structural change would typically be not expected to substantially affect the binding of small molecules [<xref rid="B12-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Such an assumption would routinely involve the generation of a library of derivatives and analogous on the basis of the scaffold of a drug that inhibits the corresponding protein in the SARS-CoV case. As shown in the present paper, regrettably, this strategy is not likely to succeed with SARS-CoV-2 for Mpro as a molecular target.</p><p>In this study, we investigated how only 12 different residues, located mostly on the protein&#x02019;s surface, may affect the behaviour of the active site pocket of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protein. To this end, we performed classical molecular dynamics simulations (cMD) of both SARS and SARS-CoV-2 Mpros, as well as mixed-solvents molecular dynamics simulations (MixMD) combined with small molecules&#x02019; tracking approach to analyse the conformational changes in the binding site. The experiment setup and methodology workflow is presented in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-03099">Figure S1</xref>. Despite the structural differences in the active sites of both Mpro proteins, major issues involving plasticity and flexibility of the binding site could result in significant difficulties in inhibitor design for this molecular target. Indeed, an in silico attempt has already been made involving a massive virtual screening for Mpro inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 using Deep Docking [<xref rid="B15-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Other recent attempts focused on virtual screening for putative inhibitors of the same main protease of SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of the clinically approved drugs [<xref rid="B16-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and also on the basis of the compounds from different databases or libraries [<xref rid="B22-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, none of such attempts is likely to lead to clinical advances in the fight against SARS-CoV-2 for reasons we elaborate below.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-ijms-21-03099"><title>2. Results</title><sec id="sec2dot1-ijms-21-03099"><title>2.1. Crystal Structure Comparison, and Location of the Replaced Amino Acids Distal to the Active Site</title><p>The first SARS-CoV-2 main protease&#x02019;s crystallographic structure was made publicly available through the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [<xref rid="B25-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] as a complex with an N3 inhibitor (PDB ID: 6lu7) [<xref rid="B13-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Next, the structure without the inhibitor was also made available (PDB ID: 6y2e) [<xref rid="B26-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We refer to these structures as SARS-CoV-2 Mpro<sup>N3</sup> and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, respectively. We also used two structures of the SARS-CoV main protease: one, referred to as SARS-CoV Mpro<sup>N3</sup> (PDB ID: 2amq), co-crystallised with the same N3 inhibitor, and the other without an inhibitor (PDB ID: 1q2w), which we refer to as SARS-CoV Mpro. The SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and SARS-CoV Mpro structures differ by only 12 amino acids located mostly on the proteins&#x02019; surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03099-f001">Figure 1</xref>A, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-03099">Table S1</xref>). Both enzymes share the same structural composition; they comprise three domains: domains I (residues 1&#x02013;101) and II (residues 102&#x02013;184) consist of an antiparallel &#x003b2;-barrel, and the &#x003b1;-helical domain III (residues 201&#x02013;301) is required for the enzymatic activity [<xref rid="B27-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Both enzymes resemble the structure of cysteine proteases, although their active site is lacking the third catalytic residue [<xref rid="B28-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]; their active site comprises a catalytic dyad, namely, H41 and C145, and a particularly stable water molecule forms at least three hydrogen bond interactions with surrounding residues, including the catalytic histidine, which corresponds to the position of a third catalytic member (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03099-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). It should be also noted that one of the differing amino acids in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, namely, S46, is located on a C44-P52 loop, which is flanking the active site cavity.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-ijms-21-03099"><title>2.2. Plasticity of the Binding Cavities</title><p>A total of 2 &#x000b5;s classical molecular dynamics (cMD) simulations of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Mpros with different starting points were run to examine the plasticity of their binding cavities. As different starting points we used (i) SARS-CoV-2 Mpro apo structure; (ii) SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with an N3 ligand, which was removed before starting the simulation; (iii) SARS-CoV Mpro apo structure; and (iv) SARS-CoV Mpro with the same N3 ligand, which was also removed before starting the simulation. A total of 10 replicas of 50 ns classical molecular dynamics simulations were performed for each protein. To improve conformation sampling, the starting geometry for each system was kept but the initial vectors were randomly assigned. A combination of the cMD approach with water molecules used as molecular probes is assumed to provide a highly detailed picture of the protein&#x02019;s interior dynamics [<xref rid="B29-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The small molecules tracking approach was used to determine the accessibility of the active site pocket in both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Mpros, and a local distribution approach was used to provide information about an overall distribution of solvent in the proteins&#x02019; interior. To properly examine the flexibility of both active site cavities, we used the time-window mode implemented in AQUA-DUCT software [<xref rid="B30-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] to analyse the water molecules&#x02019; flow through the cavity in a 10 ns time step and combined that with the outer pocket calculations to examine the plasticity and maximal accessible volume (MAV) of the binding cavity.</p><p>Surprisingly, despite their high similarity, the binding cavities of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Mpros showed significantly different MAV (Wald test, z = 2597, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Both proteins reduced their MAV upon inhibitor binding by approximately 20%, but the maximal volume of SARS-CoV was over 50% larger than those of SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03099-f002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-03099">Figure S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-ijms-21-03099"><title>2.3. Flexibility of the Active Site Entrance</title><p>To further examine the plasticity and flexibility of the main proteases binding cavities, we focused on the movements of loops surrounding their entrances and regulating the active sites&#x02019; accessibility. We found that one of the analysed loops of the SARS-CoV Mpro, namely, C44-P52 loop, was more flexible than the corresponding loops of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro structure, whereas the adjacent loops were mildly flexible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03099-f003">Figure 3</xref>). This could be indirectly assumed from the absence of the C44-P52 loop in the crystallographic structure of SARS-CoV Mpro structure. On the other hand, such flexibility could suggest that the presence of an inhibitor might stabilise the loops surrounding the active site. The analysis of B-factors of all deposited Mpro crystal structures fully confirmed these statements (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-03099">Figure S3</xref>). It is worth adding that this loop was carrying the unique SARS-CoV-2 Mpro residue S46.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-ijms-21-03099"><title>2.4. Cosolvent Hot-Spots Analysis</title><p>The mixed-solvent MD simulations were run with six cosolvents: acetonitrile (ACN), benzene (BNZ), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), methanol (MEO), phenol (PHN), and urea (URE). Cosolvents were used as specific molecular probes, representing different chemical properties and functional groups that would complement the different regions of the binding site and the protein itself. Using small molecules tracking approach, we analysed the flow through the Mpros structures and identified the regions in which those molecules were being trapped and/or caged, located within the protein itself (global hot-spots; <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-03099">Figures S4 and S5</xref>) and inside the binding cavity (local hot-spots; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03099-f004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-03099">Figure S6</xref>). The size and location of both types of hot-spots differed and provided complementary information. The global hot-spots identified potential binding/interacting sites in the whole protein structure and additionally provided information about regions attracting particular types of molecules, whereas local hot-spots described the actual available binding space of a specific cavity.</p><p>The general distribution of the global hot-spots from particular cosolvents was quite similar and verified specific interactions with the particular regions of the analysed proteins. A notable number of hot-spots were located around the amino acids that varied between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Mpros (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-03099">Figures S4 and S5</xref>). The largest number and the densest hot-spots are located within the binding cavity and the region essential for Mpro dimerisation [<xref rid="B31-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], between the II and III domains. The binding cavity is particularly occupied by urea, benzene, and phenol hot-spots, which is especially interesting because these solvents exhibit different chemical properties. In addition, the analysis performed by PARS server [<xref rid="B32-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] detected three cavities located between domain II and III that could contribute significantly to the protein flexibility; however, none of them was found as conserved and therefore were not considered as regulatory sites.</p><p>A close inspection of the binding site cavity provided further details of cosolvent distribution. The benzene hot-spots for the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro structure are localised deep inside the active site cavity, whereas SARS-CoV Mpro features mostly benzene hot-spots at the cavity entrance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03099-f005">Figure 5</xref>). This is interesting because, in the absence of cosolvent molecules, the water accessible volume for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was 50% smaller than in the case of SARS-CoV Mpro, underlining huge plasticity of the binding cavity and suggesting large conformational changes induced by interaction with a potential ligand. It is also interesting that both global and local hot-spots of the SARS-CoV Mpro structure are located in the proximity of the C44-P52 loop, which potentially regulates the access to the active site.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-ijms-21-03099"><title>2.5. Potential Mutability of SARS-CoV-2</title><p>In general, all the above-mentioned findings indicate potential difficulties in the identification of specific inhibitors toward Mpro proteins. First, the binding site itself is characterised by large plasticity (over 20% change of the MAV upon ligand binding) and probably even distant to active site mutations modify Mpro binding properties. Secondly, the C44-P52 loop regulates access to the active site and can contribute to the discrimination of potential inhibitors. Therefore, additional mutations in the above-mentioned regions, which could appear during further SARS-CoV-2 evolution, can significantly change the affinity between Mpro and its ligands. To verify potential threat of further mutability of the Mpro protein, we performed (i) correlated mutation analysis (CMA) on multiple sequence alignment, (ii) the analysis of the contribution of already identified differences between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Mpros to protein stability, and (iii) prediction of further possible mutations caused by the most probable mutations, the substitution of single nucleotides in the mRNA sequence of Mpro.</p><p>Indeed, the analysis performed with Comulator software [<xref rid="B33-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] showed that within viral Mpros, evolutionary-correlated residues are dispersed throughout the structure. This indirectly supports our previous findings that distant amino acid mutation can contribute substantially to the binding site plasticity. It is worth adding that among evolutionary-correlated residues, we identified also those that differ between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Mpros, located on the C44-P52 loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03099-f005">Figure 5</xref>) and the F185-T201 linker loop. The CMA analysis indicated that particular residues in both loops are evolutionary-correlated. The Q189 from the linker loop correlates with residues from the C44-P52 loop, whereas R188, A191, and A194 correlate with selected residues from all domains, but not with the C44-P52 loop. As was shown, the mutation of amino acids distant from active site residues, which are evolutionary correlated, is most likely to modify the active site accessibility [<xref rid="B34-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>In the interest of examining the energetical effect of the 12 amino acid replacement in the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro structure, we calculated their energetic contributions to the protein&#x02019;s stability using FoldX [<xref rid="B35-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. As expected, the differences in total energies of the SARS-CoV Mpro and variants with introduced mutation from SARS-CoV-2 Mpro residue did not represent a significant energy change (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-03099">Table S1</xref>). The biggest energy reduction was found for mutation H134F (&#x02212;0.85 kcal/mol) and mutations R88K, S94A, T285A, and I286L only slightly reduced the total energy (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-03099">Table S1</xref>).</p><p>To investigate further possible mutations of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, single nucleotide substitutions were introduced to the SARS-CoV-2 main protease gene. If a substitution of a single nucleotide caused translation to a different amino acid compared to the corresponding residue in the wild-type structure, an appropriate mutation was proposed with FoldX calculations. The most energetically favourable potential mutations were chosen on the basis of a &#x02212;1.5 kcal/mol threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03099-f006">Figure 6</xref>A, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-03099">Table S2</xref>). Most of the energetically favourable potential mutations include amino acids that are solvent-exposed on the protein&#x02019;s surface, according to NetSurfP [<xref rid="B36-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] results. These results show that in general, exposed amino acids are more likely to mutate.</p><p>Additionally, the potential mutability of the binding cavity was investigated. Residues belonging to the binding cavity were found within 7 &#x0212b; from the N3 inhibitor. Then, we calculated the differences in the Gibbs free energy of protein folding with respect to the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-03099">Table S3</xref>) and presented the results as a heat map. The most energetically favourable potential mutations are shown as green, neutral as white, and unfavourable as red (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03099-f006">Figure 6</xref>B). Interestingly, residues forming the catalytic dyad, namely, H41 and C145, are also prone to mutate. However, probably the most important message comes from the analysis of the potential mutability of the C44-P52 loop. Mutation of four of them has a stabilising effect for the protein, and is near-neutral for the rest the effect. These results indicate that the future evolution of the Mpro protein can significantly reduce the potential use of this protein as a molecular target for coronavirus treatment due to a highly probable development of drug resistance of this virus through mutations.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3-ijms-21-03099"><title>3. Discussion</title><p>The analysis of water molecules&#x02019; distribution and trajectories can be used for the analysis of proteins&#x02019; structural features and biochemical properties. It also provides additional support to the drug design and investigation of protein interior [<xref rid="B29-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B37-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. As we have shown in previous research, tracking of water molecules in the binding cavity combined with the local distribution approach can identify catalytic water positions [<xref rid="B39-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Indeed, despite differences in the size and dynamics of the binding cavities of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Mpros, the main identified water was always found in a position next to the H41 residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03099-f002">Figure 2</xref>), and this location is assumed to indicate catalytic water of Mpro replacing the missing third catalytic site amino acid [<xref rid="B28-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. That was the first quality check of our methodology that approved our approach, and has initiated further investigations.</p><p>As reported in the previous research, the overall plasticity of Mpro is required for proper enzyme functioning [<xref rid="B26-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B40-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In the case of SARS-CoV the truncation of the linker loop (F185-T201) gave rise to a significant reduction in protein activity and confirmed that the proper orientation of the linker allows the shift between dimeric and monomeric forms [<xref rid="B41-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Dimerisation of the enzyme is necessary for its catalytic activity, and the proper conformation of the seven N-terminal residues (N-finger) is required [<xref rid="B42-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, the T285 is replaced by alanine, and the I286 by leucine. It has been shown that replacing S284, T285, and I286 by alanine residues in SARS-CoV Mpro leads to a 3.6-fold enhancement of the catalytic activity of the enzyme. This is accompanied by changes in the structural dynamics of the enzyme that transmit the effect of the mutation to the catalytic centre. Indeed, the T285A replacement observed in the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro allows the two domains III to approach each other a little closer [<xref rid="B43-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>The comparison of MD simulations of both main proteases initiated from different starting conformations (with and without N3 inhibitor) suggests that besides plasticity of the whole protein, there can be large differences between the accessibility to the binding cavity and/or the accommodation of the shape of the cavity in response to the inhibitor that can be bound. There are also differences in the outer pockets&#x02019; maximal accessible volumes between the two structures of SARS-CoV main proteases; the apo SARS-CoV Mpro structure used as a starting point of MD simulations has shown the largest MAV of all the analysed systems. These results suggest that the SARS-CoV main proteases&#x02019; binding cavity is highly flexible and changes both in volume and shape, significantly altering the ligand binding. This finding indicates a serious obstacle for a classical virtual screening approach and drug design in general. Numerous novel compounds that are considered as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV have not reached the stage of clinical trials. The lack of success might be related to the above-mentioned plasticity of the binding cavity. Some of these compounds have been used for docking and virtual screening research aimed not only at SARS-CoV [<xref rid="B44-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] but also at the novel SARS-CoV-2 [<xref rid="B15-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Such an approach focuses mostly on the structural similarity between the binding pockets, but ignores the fact that the actual available binding space differs significantly. In general, a rational drug design can be a very successful tool in the identification of possible inhibitors in cases where the atomic resolution structure of the target protein is known. For a new target, when a highly homologous structure is available, a very logical strategy would be seeking chemically similar compounds or creating derivatives of this inhibitor, as well as finding those compounds that are predicted to have a higher affinity for the new target structure than the original one. This would be expected to work for SARS-CoV-2 proteins (such as Mpro) using SARS-CoV proteins as templates. However, our in-depth analysis indicates a very different situation taking place, with major shape and size differences emerging due to the binding site flexibility. Therefore, repurposing SARS drugs against COVID-19 may not be successful due to major shape and size differences, and despite docking methods, the enhanced sampling should be considered.</p><p>The continuous effort of Diamond Light Source group [<xref rid="B46-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] performing massive XChem crystallographic fragment screen against Mpro has resulted in 22 non-covalent hits in the active site and 44 covalent hits in the active site (March 17th). Interestingly, two hits were identified on the dimer interface. The positions of the hits inside the active site overlap with the position of the maximal accessible volume calculated from MD simulations and supports our finding on large binding site flexibility (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-03099">Figure S7</xref>).</p><p>The analysis of the water hot-spots shows the catalytic water hot-spot dominated water distribution inside the binding cavity. The remaining water hot-spots corresponded to a much lower water density level and were on the borders of the binding cavity, which suggests a rather hydrophobic or neutral interior of the binding cavity. The MixMD simulations performed with various cosolvents further confirmed these observations. The largest number and the densest hot-spots were located within the binding cavity and the region essential for Mpro dimerisation [<xref rid="B31-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], between the II and III domains. The deep insight into the local hot-spot distribution of the various cosolvents underlines the large differences in binding sites plasticity. The smaller binding cavity of the SARS-CoV-2 enlarged significantly in the presence of a highly hydrophobic cosolvent. The benzene hot-spots were detected deep inside the cavity, and also near the C44-P52 loop. In contrast, in the case of SARS-CoV, benzene hot-spots were located only in the vicinity of the C44-P52 loop. Such a conclusion may also imply that a sufficiently potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV and/or SARS-CoV-2 Mpros needs to be able to open its way to the active site before it can successfully bind to its cavity. These results support the regulatory role of the C44-P52 loop and again alert against unwarranted use of simplified approaches for drug repositioning or docking.</p><p>The difficulties in targeting the active site of the Mpros are also explained by evolutionary study and potential mutability analysis. As already pointed out, the C44-P52 loop is likely to regulate the access to the active site by enabling entrance of favourable small molecules and blocking the entry of unfavourable ones. The second important loop, F185-T201, which starts in the vicinity of the binding site and links I and II domains with the III domain contributes significantly to Mpro dimerisation [<xref rid="B41-ijms-21-03099" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>The initial analysis of the effect of the 12 amino acid replacements in SARS-CoV Mpro on the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro structure stability was expected to provide neutral or stabilising contribution to protein folding. Indeed, all replacements were found to stabilise the protein&#x02019;s folding (e.g., H134F: &#x02212;0.85 kcal/mol) or have an almost neutral character (e.g., R88K, S94A, T285A, I286L). The analysis of the potential risk of further Mpro structure evolution within the binding cavity suggests that mutations of residues that contribute to ligand binding or access to the active site are energetically favourable, and are likely to occur. Some of the residues that are prone to mutate would provide the inactive enzyme (e.g., the residues forming the catalytic dyad) and therefore could be considered as a blind alley in enzyme evolution, but others (e.g., amino acids from the C44-P52 loop, T45, S46, E47, L50) could significantly modify the inhibitors binding mode of Mpro. The locations of residues on the regulatory loop, which are prone to mutate puts in question the efforts to design inhibitors of the MPro active site as a viable long-term strategy. However, our results also indicate residues that are energetically unfavourable to mutate (e.g., P39, R40, P52, G143, G146, or L167), which could provide an anchor for successful drug design that can outlast coronavirus Mpro variability in future. Alternatively, we would suggest targeting the region between II and III domains, which contributes to the dimer formation.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-ijms-21-03099"><title>4.

Conclusions</title><p>In this paper, we reported on molecular dynamics simulations of the main protease (Mpro), whose crystal structures have been released. We compared the Mpro for SARS-CoV-2 with a highly similar SARS-CoV protein. In spite of a high level of sequence similarity between these two homologous proteins, their active sites showed major differences in both shape and size, indicating that repurposing SARS drugs for COVID-19 may be futile. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the binding pocket&#x02019;s conformational changes during simulation time indicated its flexibility and plasticity, which dashes hope for rapid and reliable drug design. Moreover, our findings show the presence of a flexible C44-P52 loop regulating the access to the binding site pocket. A successful inhibitor may need to have an ability to relocate the loop from the entrance to bind to the catalytic pocket. However, mutations leading to changes in the amino acid sequence of the C44-P52 loop, although not affecting the folding of the protein, may result in the putative inhibitors&#x02019; inability to access the binding pocket and provide a probable development of drug resistance. To avoid this situation in which the future evolution of the Mpros can undermine all our efforts, we should focus on key functional residues or those whose further mutation will destabilise the protein (e.g., P39, R40, P52, G143, G146, or L167). Alternatively, we would suggest targeting the region between II and III domains, which contributes to the dimer formation. Our results provide the basis for drug design efforts aimed at this important protein target as part of the multifaceted global effort to eradicate COVID-19. In view of the presented challenges to finding a potent drug targeting Mpro, in our opinion, the most successful strategy would be to screen a large database of compounds with diverse structures involving or designing inhibitors de novo using a fragment-based approach. Both of these strategies, unfortunately, take much longer than a currently preferred approach based on repurposing existing FDA-approved compounds and hence should be pursued as a long-term plan of preparedness for future outbreaks of COVID epidemics involving this and other strains of the virus.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank Tomasz Skalski for his helpful advice in statistical analysis of data.</p></ack><app-group><app id="app1-ijms-21-03099"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>Supplementary materials can be found at <uri xlink:href="https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/21/9/3099/s1">https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/21/9/3099/s1</uri>.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ijms-21-03099-s001"><media xlink:href="ijms-21-03099-s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></app></app-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization, A.G.; methodology, M.B., K.M., A.R., and A.S.; software, M.B., K.M., A.R., and A.S.; validation, M.B., K.M., and A.G.; formal analysis, M.B., K.M., A.R., and A.S.; investigation, M.B., K.M., A.R., and A.S.; resources, M.B. and K.M.; data curation, M.B. and K.M.; writing&#x02014;original draft preparation, M.B. and K.M.; writing&#x02014;review and editing, J.A.T. and A.G.; visualization, M.B., K.M., A.R., and A.G; supervision, A.G.; project administration, A.G.; funding acquisition, J.A.T. and A.G.
