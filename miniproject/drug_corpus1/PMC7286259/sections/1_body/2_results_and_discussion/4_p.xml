<p id="p0050">The top 5 leads for the third target-MERS-CoV M
 <sup>pro</sup> were found to be Ergotamine (ZINC000052955754), Ak-Fluor (ZINC000003860453), Avodart (ZINC000003932831), Dihydroergotamine (ZINC000003978005) and Saquinavir (ZINC000026664090) with binding energies of −9.6 kcal/mol, −9.4 kcal/mol, −9.3 kcal/mol, −9.3 kcal/mol, −9.3 kcal/mol and −8.1 kcal/mol respectively (
 <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The best lead molecule- Ergotamine (ZINC000052955754) binds to a region within the Cys148-His41 catalytic dyad pocket and establishes one hydrogen bond with side chain sulphur (SG) atom of Cys148 and hydrophobic interactions with twelve important residues (Met25, His41, Leu49, Asp190, Leu144, Cys145, Met168, Glu169, Lys191, Gln192, Val193 and His194) (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A). The control, inhibitor GC813 (AW4) shows binding energy of −8.1 kcal/mol with the target enzyme and the molecular interaction is reinforced by seven hydrogen bonds (four hydrogen bonds with the backbone atoms oxygen (O) atom of Leu144, nitrogen (N) atom of Ser147, nitrogen (N) atom of Gly146 and nitrogen (N) atom of Cys148 and three hydrogen bonds with side-chain oxygen (OG) atom of Ser147, sulphur (SG) atom of Cys148 and oxygen (OE1) atom of Gln192) and hydrophobic interactions via eleven residues- Met25, His41, Leu49, Tyr54, Cys145, Met168, Glu169, Asp190, Lys191, Val193 and His194 (
