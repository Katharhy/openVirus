<p id="p0015">The lack of effective therapeutics against human coronaviral infections (
 <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Graham et al., 2013</xref>) and the high mortality rates due to the recent emergence of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) have necessitated the discovery of new vaccines or drugs. In the present study, we have explored the possibility of the FDA approved drugs as potential inhibitors of M
 <sup>pro</sup> enzyme which will help in halting the virus replication and curtail the progression of the disease. We have used molecular docking study to explore the binding interaction of the FDA approved drugs with three target enzymes (SARS-CoV M
 <sup>pro</sup>, SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> and MERS-CoV M
 <sup>pro</sup>) and shortlisted suitable lead molecules for each target.
