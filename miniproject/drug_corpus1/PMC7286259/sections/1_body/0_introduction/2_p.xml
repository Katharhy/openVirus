<p id="p0005">Coronaviruses are enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses which have crown-like appearance under the electron microscope and usually ranges from 60 to 140 nm in diameter (

The cross-species transmission of animal beta coronaviruses to humans have been reported since last two decades-the first event which occurred in 2002–2003 when the bat originated coronaviruses crossed over to humans via palm civet cats as intermediary host and caused severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans and was known as SARS coronaviruses (SARS-CoV) which infected 8422 people in China and Hong Kong and caused 916 deaths with a mortality rate of 11% (

In 2012, almost a decade later, another bat-originated virus emerged in Saudi Arabia and the transmission to humans was via dromedary camels. The virus was designated as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) which infected 2494 people and caused 858 deaths with fatality rate of 34% (

There is a recent global health emergency around the world with the rapid emergence and spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which has caused a pandemic known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The outbreak was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 2019 (

According to the WHO report, there has been 25, 49,632 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 1, 75,825 confirmed deaths to date (23/04/2020) (Coronavirus disease Pandemic, 2020).
