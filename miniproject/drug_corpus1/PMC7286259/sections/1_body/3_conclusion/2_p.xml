<p id="p0060">Understanding the global health emergency and the immediate need for drugs and vaccines for the treatment of coronaviral infection, the present study is undertaken to identify promising inhibitors for main protease enzymes of coronaviruses through molecular docking approach. Our study suggests that anti-migraine drugs such as Ergotamine (ZINC000052955754) and its derivative, Dihydroergotamine (ZINC000003978005) are the most potent lead molecules which can be taken for further studies in wet lab experimentations.</p>
