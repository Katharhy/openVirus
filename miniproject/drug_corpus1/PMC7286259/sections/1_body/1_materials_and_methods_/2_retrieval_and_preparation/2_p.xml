<p id="p0020">A set of 1390 chemical structures of FDA approved drugs were downloaded from ZINC 15 database (
 <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">Sterling and Irwin, 2015</xref>). The 3D structures of the molecules in SDF format were retrieved and the molecules having only 2D structure available were processed into 3D structures using Open Babel version 2.4.1 software (
 <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">Oâ€™Boyle et al., 2011</xref>) and subsequently energy-optimized using MMFF force field (
 <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">Halgren, 1996</xref>) following our previously described protocol (
 <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">Gurung et al., 2016</xref>). The molecules were prepared for docking using AutoDock Toos-1.5.6 by the addition of Gasteiger charges and hydrogen atoms and torsions for each molecule were optimally defined. The structures of the compounds were saved in PDBQT format.
