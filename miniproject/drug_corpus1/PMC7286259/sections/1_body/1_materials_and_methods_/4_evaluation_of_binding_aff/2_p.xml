<p id="p0030">The binding affinity of each molecule along with the control inhibitors was evaluated against the three enzyme targets using molecular docking approach. The binding sites for the compounds were defined by choosing grid box of dimensions of 25 × 25 × 25 Å
 <sup>3</sup> with exhaustiveness value of 8 centred at x:9.6421, y:−0.3396, z:18.3327; x:25.6069, y:44.4317, z:−5.6802 and x:−21.9764, y:24.4145, z:4.8599 of SARS-CoV-2 M
