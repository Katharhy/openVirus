 <sup>pro</sup> (PDB ID: 6Y2F), SARS-CoV M
 <sup>pro</sup> (PDB ID: 3TNT) and MERS-CoV M
 <sup>pro</sup> (PDB ID: 5WKK) solved through high-resolution X-ray crystallographic technique at a resolution of 1.95 Å, 1.59 Å and 1.55 Å respectively were retrieved from Protein Data Bank (

Each target enzyme was prepared by removing the heteroatoms including ions, co-crystallized ligands (O6Y, G85 and AW4 corresponding to PDB IDs: 6Y2F, 3TNT and 5WKK respectively) and water molecules. Further, an optimum number of polar hydrogen atoms and Kolmann charges were added to each protein target using AutoDock Toos-1.5.6 and the structures were saved in PDBQT format.
