<p id="p0115">As a result of their potentially severe toxicities, the safety of CQ and HCQ in COVID-19 is in question. In a retrospective analysis of 95 patients receiving CQ for COVID-19 in the Netherlands, 23% of patients had a corrected QT interval exceeding 500 ms during treatment,

 </xref> One arm of a double-blind randomized trial of CQ in Brazil with a dosage of 600 mg twice daily was halted by the data safety monitoring board after 6 days as a result of QT prolongation. Fatality rates for the duration of the trial were not different from historical data from similar patients, and only 7% of patients tested negative for virus during that time.
