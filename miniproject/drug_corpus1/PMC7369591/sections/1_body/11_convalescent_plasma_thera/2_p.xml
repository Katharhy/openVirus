<p id="p0125">On March 24, the US Food and Drug Administration made CPT available for use in patients with serious COVID-19 infections through emergency investigational new drug applications.

 </xref> Actual data on the use of CPT in COVID-19 to date are limited, but increasing. Case series in China, Korea, Mexico, and the United States have reported varying clinical improvement due to CPT, ranging from improvement in laboratory and respiratory parameters without change in overall status to improvements in viral clearance and status as determined by the WHO ordinal scale.

 </xref> An open-label, multicenter, randomized clinical trial of 101 patients in China reported clinical improvement on a 6-point scale within 28 days of treatment for 51.9% of patients receiving CPT compared with 43.1% in the control group (
 <italic>P</italic>=.26), but viral clearance was achieved in 87.2% of patients in the treatment group compared with 37.5% in the control group (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;.001); interpretation of these results is limited, however, because the trial was terminated early because of containment of COVID-19 in the area.

  <sup>113</sup>
 </xref> In all these studies, patients treated with CPT also received other treatments, including antiviral therapies, so the contribution of CPT to patient recovery is currently unclear. However, a study of 5000 patients receiving CPT as part of the US Food and Drug Administration Expanded Access Program resulted in a serious adverse event rate less than 1%, suggesting that CPT in COVID-19 appears to be safe.
