<p id="p0065">Clinically, multiple case reports and series from Canada, Europe, Japan, and the United States have provided early promising results of treatment with remdesivir, usually in combination with other agents.

 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In the first reported double-blind, RCT of remdesivir, the time to clinical improvement was similar to the control group (hazard ratio, 1.27, 95% confidence interval, 0.89 to 1.80) but numerically shorter for patients treated within 10 days of symptom onset (hazard ratio, 1.52, 95% confidence interval, 0.95 to 2.43). This trial unfortunately did not attain the predetermined sample size owing to containment of the outbreak in China.

 </xref> A global, double-blind, RCT of remdesivir in 1063 patients, funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, reported an 11-day median recovery time compared with 15 days for patients receiving placebo (P&lt;.001).

 </xref> However, a randomized, multicountry, open-label trial of remdesivir treatment for 5 or 10 days in 397 patients with severe COVID-19 but not receiving mechanical ventilation determined no difference in 14-day clinical improvement between treatment groups on an ordinal scale (64% of patients improving vs 54% in the 10-day group, P=.14).
