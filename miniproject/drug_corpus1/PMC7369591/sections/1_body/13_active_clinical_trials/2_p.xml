<p id="p0140">The scientific community has responded to the COVID-19 pandemic with rapid implementation and execution of well-designed and accessible RCTs (examples shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> ). An illustrative example is the SOLIDARITY trial,

 </xref> a WHO-sponsored, adaptive RCT open to any patient with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection worldwide. On the basis of institutional drug availability, patients were initially randomized to standard of care or to any of the 4 arms: remdesivir, CQ/HCQ, LPV/RTV, or LPV/RTV plus interferon β-1a. Strengths of SOLIDARITY are the simplicity of eligibility criteria that enable enrollment of a large volume of patients along with a robust scientific methodology, electronic end point data capture, and an adaptive design to allow the modification of treatment arms on the basis of evolving evidence. An example of adaptation is the halting of the HCQ arm of SOLIDARITY on June 17, 2020, on the basis of the initial results not indicating reduction in mortality compared with standard of care.
