<p id="p0150">Most publications from this review were of observational studies of patients who received more than 1 therapy and lacked control groups or randomization.

These studies do, however, provide the basis for the estimation of effect sizes and evidence of safety to allow ethical enrollment in the RCTs that will definitively measure treatment safety and efficacy.</p>
