<p id="p0145">This review of available data about the efficacy and safety of emerging therapies for COVID-19 provides a few promising results, but the evidence base is growing and evolving rapidly. According to preliminary clinical data and in vitro studies, remdesivir is a leading antiviral candidate for the treatment of COVID-19. The results of CQ and HCQ clinical studies are conflicting; many involve confounding concurrent administration of antiviral therapies and increasingly suggest limited, if any, benefit for the treatment of COVID-19. Similarly, reports of the use of convalescent plasma, usually in late-stage disease and after other treatments, provide some support for clinical efficacy. The preliminary results of the low- to moderate-dose dexamethasone arm of the Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) Trial indicate reduced mortality in patients requiring oxygen and/or ventilation support. These findings suggest that immunomodulatory therapies may play an important role in controlling severe COVID-19. However, more studies are needed to confirm the safety and efficacy of glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive drugs for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2–associated cytokine storm, including timing, dose, and duration of these therapies.</p>
