 <p>The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the causal agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), quickly spread around the world, resulting in the most aggressive pandemic experienced in more than 100 years. Research on targeted therapies and vaccines has been initiated on an unprecedented scale and speed but will take months and even years to come to fruition. Meanwhile, the efficacy of emerging therapeutics for use in treating COVID-19 is feverishly being investigated to identify the best available treatment options for dealing with the current wave of disease. This review of publications with a "treatment" tag through June 29, 2020 in the National Library of Medicine's LitCovid literature hub, provides frontline clinicians with a pragmatic summary of the current state of the rapidly evolving evidence supporting emerging candidate therapeutics for COVID-19. Two main categories of pharmaceutical therapeutics are showing promise: those with antiviral activity directly addressing infection and those that counteract the inflammatory cytokine storm induced by severe disease. Preliminary results suggest that other approaches such as convalescent plasma therapy and lung radiation therapy may have some efficacy. The current clinical evidence for potential treatments is preliminary—often small retrospective series or early results of randomized trials—and the science is evolving rapidly. The long-term results from large, well-designed randomized controlled trials will provide definitive evidence for therapeutic effectiveness and are likely months away. The trial landscape for promising therapies is described.</p>
