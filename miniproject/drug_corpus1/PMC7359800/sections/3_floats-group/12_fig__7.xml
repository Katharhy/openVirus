  <p>Detection of antibody responses to recombinant SARS-CoV-2 proteins in patients with COVID-19. (A) Serological responses of 12 patients with COVID-19 to recombinant NP (top) and S-RBD (bottom). The experiment was performed in duplicate. (B) Measurement of neutralizing antibody titers by pseudovirus-based assay. The experiment was performed in triplicate. NP, nucleocapsid protein. S-RBD receptor binding domain of spike protein. HD, healthy donor. Pt, patient. HD#1, serum was collected in 2018. HD#2–4, the sera were from close contact. *P &lt; **P [
