 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The key player in the immune system is the white blood cells, which can travel throughout the body through the blood vessels. To monitor for invading microbes, the body exchanges cells and fluids between blood and lymphatic vessels and enables the lymphatic system. The lymphatic vessels carry lymph. Each lymph node contains specialized compartments where they can encounter antigens. Through the incoming lymphatic vessels, the immune cells and foreign particles enter the lymph nodes. When they are in the bloodstream, they are transported to tissues throughout the body. They continue the cycle all over by patrolling for foreign antigens everywhere and then gradually drift back into the lymphatic system. The immune cells gather, work, and serve to confront antigens in lymph nodes and the spleenâ€™s compartments [
