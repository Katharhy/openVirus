<p id="par0020">COVID-19 is an RNA virus with a crown-like appearance. Its diameter is approximately 60–140 nm. On one side, it has a concave surface with a ridge. It makes a larger binding interface, as well as more contacts with ACE2. It can make better contact with the N-terminal helix of ACE2 and have higher affinity [
 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It is transmitted through respiratory droplets from coughing and sneezing and enters the nasal system by inhaling and starts replicating. ACE2 is the main receptor for the COVID-19 virus [
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The spike protein (S protein) present on the surface of COVID-19 is pinched inside the host cell binding to the ACE2 receptor. Here, the enzyme furin is present in the host cell and plays a vital role for the virus to enter, which was absent in SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Next, the virus starts to propagate with limited innate immune response and can be detected by nasal swabs. The virus then propagates and reaches the respiratory tract, where it faces a more robust innate immune response. At this stage, the disease is clinically manifest and an innate response cytokine may be predictive of the subsequent clinical course [

 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. With conservative symptomatic therapy, these individuals may be monitored and monitored at home. Approximately 20% of the infected patients develop pulmonary infiltrates and some of these develop very severe disease [
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The mortality rate of severe patients with COVID-19 can be as high as 49%, based on a recent epidemiological by China CDC [
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In Wuhan, 292 patients with COVID-19 were studied. Age was the risk factor of patients with a severe condition, as shown by the Lasso algorithm. When the age of patients with a severe condition increased by 5 years, the risk increased by 15.15%. Most of the patients with COVD-19 were elderly patients in the severe group, with basic diseases. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, malignant tumor, coronary heart disease, and chronic kidney disease were more frequent in the severe group than in the mild group. Of 145 severe cases, 51 patients died (34.69%), and 90.2% of the patients who dies were over 60 years old. Forty patients had basic disease out of 51 deaths (78.43%). Reports have demonstrated that patients aged older than 60 years who have comorbidities, especially hypertension, are at risk for severe disease and death from SARS-CoV-2 infection [
