<p id="par0110">The change of R
 <sub>0</sub> and R
 <sub>t</sub> is connected to the proportion of individuals who have immunity in their body to that pathogen in that population. The alternative method of estimating R
 <sub>t</sub> for a pathogen including the population is by multiplying R
 <sub>0</sub> through the proportion of the population of individuals considered non-immune to that pathogen. In this perception, R
 <sub>0</sub> will only have a similar level of R
 <sub>t</sub> if there are no immune persons in the population. It indicates that any partial pre-existing immunity to the infecting elements is able to decrease the number of expected secondary cases emerging.
