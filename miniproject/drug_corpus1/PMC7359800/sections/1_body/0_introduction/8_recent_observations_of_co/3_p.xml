<p id="par0095">At the University of Copenhagen, researchers net MHC made in-silicon predictions of epitopes presented by 11 MHC-1 alleles that covered approx. 90% of the Asian population. Using that approach, they compiled a list of 100 candidate epitopes for the following MHC alleles—A*0101, A*0201, A*0301, A*11:01, A*2402, B*40:01, C*0401, C*0701, C*0702, and DRB1*0401—resulting in 1100 MHC/peptide binding studies. For the project, they partnered with Intavis and Intavis, who synthesized the COVID-19 epitopes assessed in the study. Using their unique neoscreen technology, they performed in vitro binding studies of the epitopes. The study identified 159 epitopes that stably bind the MHC-1 allele and 22 that bind the tested MHC-II alleles [
