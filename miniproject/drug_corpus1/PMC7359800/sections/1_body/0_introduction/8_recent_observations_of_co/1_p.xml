<p id="par0085">Researchers are attempting to improve the immune system against COVID-19 and here some of the data reviewed. Ten proteins are encoded by the COVID-19 genome; one of them is the S protein, as aforementioned, because a glycoprotein exists in the virus-infected region (
 <xref rid="fig0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> ). The S protein is a significant therapeutic target, ensured its location, and targetable using antibodies [

 <xref rid="bib0460" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. If human cells are infected by virus entities, epitopes from any of that viruses’ proteins can theoretically be bound and presented by MHC-1 receptors on host cell surfaces, leading to the stimulation of CD4 and CD8 T cells to provoke antibody-mediated and cell-mediated immune responses.
