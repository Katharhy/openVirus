<p id="par0040">After being affected by virus immune responses to mediate antibody. The B cells are assisted by T cells to differentiate into plasma cells, which then produce antibodies specific to a viral antigen. A neutralizing nature antibody is efficient in fully blocking the virus from entering into host cells to limit the infection and plays a very intense protective role at the later stage of infection and prevents relapse of infection. By contrast, a cellular immunity response can be observed inside the infected cells, which is mediated by T-lymphocytes. The overall adaptive immune response is directed by helper T cells, and cytotoxic T cells play a vital role in the clearance and cleaning of viral-infected cells [
