<p id="par0045">Information from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may allow the exploration of knowledge to understand how SARS-CoV-2 escapes the host’s immune response, because data on SARS-CoV-2 remain limited. Notably, 80% of the RNA sequence of SARS-CoV and 50% of the RNA sequence of MERS-CoV match the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and SARS-CoV-2 exhibits additional genomic regions. Compared with SARS-CoV and other closely related coronaviruses, its S protein is 20–30 amino acids longer. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 has similar immune evasion strategies, but an additional mechanism remains undiscovered [
