<p id="p0070">It has been reported that SDR leads to several immune response alterations in both humans and animals. Using a rhesus monkey model, 
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Capitanio and Cole (2015)</xref> demonstrated that social instability adversely impacted metabolites of epinephrine and norepinephrine, and expression of immune response genes, as well as behavior. Additionally, the authors used sympathomimetic drugs to challenge the sympathetic nervous system. It was demonstrated that the responses in lymph nodes tracked the social, and not the drug, condition: social instability upregulated the density of sympathetic nervous system fibres in lymph nodes and downregulated Type I interferon gene expression, which is related to induce protection against viruses. This demonstrates the sympathetic nervous system is extremely sensitive to social conditions, altering the expression of this gene.
