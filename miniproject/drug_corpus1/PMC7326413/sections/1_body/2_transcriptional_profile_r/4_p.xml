<p id="p0115">Interestingly, a transcriptome representation analysis showed relative expansion of the immature proinflammatory monocyte transcriptome in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from people subject to chronic social stress (low socioeconomic status) and non-human (mice) subject to repeated social defeat. Mouse cell transcriptome confirmed these results, and promoter-based bioinformatic analyses indicated increased activity of transcription factors involved in early myeloid lineage differentiation and proinflammatory effector function (notably PU.1, NF-κB, EGR1, MZF1, NRF2). Myeloid lineage immune cells and their innate effector molecules, such as proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferons, are regulated by β-adrenergic signaling and adverse socioenvironmental conditions. The authors suggest that sympathetic nervous system-induced up-regulation of myelopoiesis mediates the proinflammatory component of the leukocyte CTRA dynamic and may contribute to the increased risk of inflammation-related disease associated with adverse social conditions (
