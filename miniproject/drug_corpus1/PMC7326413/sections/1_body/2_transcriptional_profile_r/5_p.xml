<p id="p0120">This transcriptional profile has also been related to socioeconomic status. In a study, 53 CTRA candidate genes were evaluated. Both down-regulation in response to stress (antiviral-response genes) and up-regulation in response to stress (proinflammatory genes) were related to low socioeconomic status participants compared to higher status individuals. In the same work, the authors conducted a hypothesis-free genome-wide screening of the roughly 35,000 transcripts assayed for association with socioeconomic status. They observed a group of 141 unique genes as being differentially expressed in the low-versus higher-socioeconomic status groups. Of these genes, enriched for binding sites of 3 transcription factors implicated in CTRA gene regulation, including the proinflammatory NF-κB family of transcription factors, which is a key regulator of the biological response to stress (
