<p>Rituximab (RTX) is a chimeric monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody that causes depletion of CD20-expressing B cells (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Early treatment with rituximab has resulted in higher remission rates, long term clinical response, lower incidence of serious adverse events and rapid prednisone tapering compared to old immunosuppressive therapies making its approval as a first-line therapy in pemphigus possible (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Rituximab is generally considered safe in patients with pemphigus vulgaris and serious infections, while reported, are rare. Although single RTX infusions do not seem to impair memory responses against known pathogens (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), patients may exert a defective immune reaction against new pathogens and life-threatening infections, including sepsis, have been reported following RTX treatment (

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The risk of reactivation of hepatitis B and C viruses as well as tuberculosis has also been reported (
