<p id="Par26">The current strategies followed by the government to reduce the spread of COVID-19 are based on the paradigm of social distancing, which includes identification of cases, tracing the contacts, and restrict them to quarantine and isolation. The current pharmacological therapy given is only restricted to supportive care and interventions that mitigate the associated symptoms. Many studies are being conducted nowadays in search of effective drugs for COVID-19 and also to develop efficient vaccines as a preventive therapy against COVID-19, yet to date, no licensed vaccines or effective antiviral drugs exist against SARS-CoV-2 infections. So, many individuals may turn to validated Ayurvedic and herbal medicines to boost the immune system. However, considering such therapies requires consideration of the potential benefits and harms. The need of the hour is to develop specific antiviral drugs for COVID-19, which would stop the viral replication at the beginning and might reduce the associated degree of immunopathological damage. Also, the role of immunologically directed strategies and anti-cytokine therapy is indispensable in SARS-CoV-2 infection as a notable proportion of COVID-19 patients have reported an impaired immune system and cytokine storm, which might damage the lungs and also lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In this regard, many drugs previously used to treat SARS and MERS and other viral diseases, including Ebola, HIV, and Influenza, have been evaluated and demonstrated effect in various in vitro studies or patients of COVID-19. Also, traditionally used medicinal compounds such as purified natural and herbal medicines, and Ayurvedic and traditional Chinese medicines are being evaluated and many of them have evidence supporting efficacy against COVID-19. Nonetheless, additional data are urgently needed. Herein we discuss the novel strategies and targets that could be approached for the development of drugs against COVID-19. This review highlights the majority of pipeline drugs that are currently being studied in clinical trials for COVID-19 and discuss the present and future aspects of most promising drugs under investigation.</p>
