<p id="Par38">Another cell-based therapy that has shown promising results in COVID-19 is mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transfusion. Various studies have shown the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory role of MSCs and their ability to alleviate lung injury and ARDS [

Recently, a pilot study conducted in China on seven COVID-19 patients, who had received intravenous infusions of donor mesenchymal stem cells (multipotent cells thought to have immunomodulatory capacities), has reported the recovery of all seven patients and has shown improvement in the clinical outcome [

Also, on April 5, 2020, the US FDA has approved mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) treatments for use in the serious COVID-19 patients. Although, the rationale of using MSC is not very clear and it is said that this therapy might help combat the cytokine storm reported in COVID-19 patients and hence prevents the progression of the disease and reduces mortality. However, more clinical trials with a larger number of patients are required to establish its role in COVID-19.
