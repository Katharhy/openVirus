<p id="Par36">Biologics such as monoclonal antibodies are being developed as targeted specific therapeutic agents for SARS-CoV-2 infections. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) in spike protein is the key target of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Moreover, cytokine storm (CS), i.e., uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines has been reported to correlate with disease severity in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and it might lead to acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and death [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Several reports have confirmed that patients admitted to an ICU had higher concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Therefore, targeting IL-6 and its receptor (IL6R) by tocilizumab and siltuximab monoclonal antibodies could mitigate cytokine storm-related symptoms in severe COVID-19 patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Tocilizumab and Sarilumab are IL-6 receptor antagonists and proposed to be beneficial in preventing cytokine storms involved in COVID-19 pathogenesis. These recombinant human monoclonal antibodies are indicated for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Till now, several clinical trials of tocilizumab and sarilumab, alone or in combination with other drugs, have been registered in patients with COVID-19 with severe pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In a retrospective study in China, the administration of 400 mg of tocilizumab to 21 patients with COVID-19 has shown improvement in clinical outcomes such as improved respiratory function in 91% of patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Also, sarilumab is studied in a multicenter, double-blind, phase 2/3 trial for hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. Their safety and efficacy in COVID-19 patients will only be established after the completion of the ongoing clinical trials. However, a recent open-label phase 2 trial (NCT04346355) conducted in the Italy was stopped early because of lack of benefit of tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients. So, more trials with adequate sample size and design are needed to confirm or deny the efficacy of tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients.
