<p id="Par28">Research for testing the safety and efficacy of different types of interventions for COVID-19 is carried out at an exceptional rate. The conventional drug development process is not feasible in the current scenario of the pandemic, so, the majority of studies in clinical trials for COVID-19 include the drugs already in use for other diseases. Various classes of drugs including antivirals, immunomodulators, anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, antibiotics, and traditional Chinese medicine have been investigated so far in search of new treatment avenues or interventions to combat COVID-19. Among them, remdesivir, convalescent plasma, anti-inflammatory drugs like interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitors (tocilizumab and sarilumab), and traditional Chinese medicines prove to be the most promising therapies [

Apart from various antivirals, immunomodulators, and IL-6 inhibitors, the current emerging therapies focus on cell-based therapy (natural killer (NK) cells and mesenchymal stem cells), biologics (monoclonal antibodies, interleukins, cytokines), ACE2 receptor blocker, angiotensin II type I receptor blockers (ARB), fibrinolytic therapy, and combination therapy of various antivirals with immunomodulators, antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs), etc.
