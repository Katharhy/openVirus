<p id="Par30">Another approach for reducing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic is to develop COVID-19 vaccines that can be available to people across the globe. Many vaccines are being studied in animal models, and some of them have entered the clinical trials. However, months are needed before the vaccines are developed, approved, and marketed. Some researchers and clinicians have proposed the role of bacillus Calmette Gu√©rin (BCG) vaccines, levamisole, and Isoprinosine, as prophylactic therapy for COVID-19. BCG vaccine is assumed to enhance the innate immune response by inducing metabolic and epigenetic changes. Clinical trials are underway in Australia and Netherlands for determining the efficacy of BCG vaccines in healthcare workers, while some recent studies do not favor the role of BCG vaccine in COVID-19. As of July 4, more than 900 interventional trials have been registered to
