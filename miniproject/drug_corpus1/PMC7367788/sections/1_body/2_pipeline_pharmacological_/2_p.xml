<p id="Par29">To combat various comorbidities associated with COVID-19, many conventional antidiabetic (sitagliptin, dapagliflozin), antihypertensive (ramipril, prazosin, amiodarone, spironolactone), and lipid lowering agents (atorvastatin) have been studied in clinical trials along with standard treatment regimen. Various antineoplastic drugs (etoposide, methotrexate, melphalan, isotretinoin plus tamoxifen, nintedanib, lenalidomide, etc.) and drugs like thalidomide, oxytocin, chlorpromazine, montelukast, povidone-iodine, famotidine, cholecalciferol, N-acetylcysteine, and pyridostigmine bromide have also been studied in clinical trials for COVID-19. To address the respiratory distress associated with COVID-19, the role of drugs like valsartan and sirolimus is being investigated in various clinical trials. There is an emerging role of recombinant bacterial ACE2 receptors like the enzyme of B38-CAP (rbACE2) for COVID-19. It works like human-ACE2 and decreases angiotensin II level, thereby reducing the release of proinflammatory cytokines and the development of ARDS. It has been proposed that due to bacterial origin, it might not get recognized by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and hence possess added advantage over conventional ACE2 inhibitors (ACEI) and ARBs. However, it is yet to determine whether long-term use of ACEI, ARBs, and rbACE2 will increase or alleviate the SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
