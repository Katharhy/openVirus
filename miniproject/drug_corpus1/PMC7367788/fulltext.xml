The COVID-19 epidemic has emerged in late December 2019 in Wuhan city of China and spread rapidly to other parts of the world. This quick spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection to many states across the globe affecting many people has led WHO to declare it a pandemic on March 12, 2020. As of July 4, 2020, more than 523,011 people lost their lives worldwide because of this deadly SARS-CoV-2. The current situation becomes more frightening as no FDA-approved drugs or vaccines are available to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. The current therapeutic options for COVID-19 are limited only to supportive measures and non-specific interventions. So, the need of the hour is to search for SARS-CoV-2-specific antiviral treatments and to develop vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. Also, it is equally important to maintain our immunity, and natural products and Ayurvedic medicines are indispensable in this regard. In this review, we discuss recent updates regarding various therapeutic approaches to combat COVID-19 pandemic and enlist the major pipeline drugs and traditional medicines that are under trial for COVID-19. Also, possible mechanisms involved in viral pathogenesis are discussed, which further allow us to understand various drug targets and helps in discovering novel therapeutic approaches for COVID-19. Altogether, the information provided in this review will work as an intellectual groundwork and provides an insight into the ongoing development of various therapeutic agents.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>Pipeline drugs</kwd><kwd>Pharmacological therapy</kwd><kwd>A recent update</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par25">The current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a great threat to public health and has attracted the attention of the majority of scientists and researchers to develop a specific drug or vaccine to outweigh the threat to this pandemic. It was initially originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China, in December 2019, as pneumonia-like symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and spread rapidly to other parts of the world, affecting 10,922,324 individuals, causing more than 523,011 fatalities in over 210 countries by July 4, 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It was discovered to cause by a novel coronavirus having more than 79% sequence homology with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and 96% genome similarity with bat coronavirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Owing to the alarming level of its severity and rapid spread to many countries in a short period, the World health organization (WHO) has declared this epidemic as pandemic on March 12, 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. COVID-19 pandemic is a pandemic of respiratory illness characterized by flu-like symptoms, sometimes associated with immune dysfunction and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which might lead to death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It is the third time in the twenty-first century, after severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 when a highly pathogenic coronavirus of zoonotic origin has affected humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. To date, this has affected the lives of many people worldwide and put pressure on the health system and the global economy. SARS-CoV-2 has a high potential to cause infection with a higher transmission rate in comparison to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, making it difficult to control and thereby increasing its pandemic potential.</p><p id="Par26">The current strategies followed by the government to reduce the spread of COVID-19 are based on the paradigm of social distancing, which includes identification of cases, tracing the contacts, and restrict them to quarantine and isolation. The current pharmacological therapy given is only restricted to supportive care and interventions that mitigate the associated symptoms. Many studies are being conducted nowadays in search of effective drugs for COVID-19 and also to develop efficient vaccines as a preventive therapy against COVID-19, yet to date, no licensed vaccines or effective antiviral drugs exist against SARS-CoV-2 infections. So, many individuals may turn to validated Ayurvedic and herbal medicines to boost the immune system. However, considering such therapies requires consideration of the potential benefits and harms. The need of the hour is to develop specific antiviral drugs for COVID-19, which would stop the viral replication at the beginning and might reduce the associated degree of immunopathological damage. Also, the role of immunologically directed strategies and anti-cytokine therapy is indispensable in SARS-CoV-2 infection as a notable proportion of COVID-19 patients have reported an impaired immune system and cytokine storm, which might damage the lungs and also lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In this regard, many drugs previously used to treat SARS and MERS and other viral diseases, including Ebola, HIV, and Influenza, have been evaluated and demonstrated effect in various in vitro studies or patients of COVID-19. Also, traditionally used medicinal compounds such as purified natural and herbal medicines, and Ayurvedic and traditional Chinese medicines are being evaluated and many of them have evidence supporting efficacy against COVID-19. Nonetheless, additional data are urgently needed. Herein we discuss the novel strategies and targets that could be approached for the development of drugs against COVID-19. This review highlights the majority of pipeline drugs that are currently being studied in clinical trials for COVID-19 and discuss the present and future aspects of most promising drugs under investigation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>SARS-CoV-2: Virology and Targets for Drug Development</title><p id="Par27">SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped non-segmented positive sense single-strand RNA viruses classified into the genus Betacoronavirus in the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. After SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it has become the seventh coronavirus that causes infection in human beings. The receptor-binding domain present in the S1 subunit of the spike protein (S) is responsible for targeting the host cells. It binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor present on the host&#x02019;s cells surface, and the binding affinity is 10&#x02013;20 times more than SARS-CoV, which might explain its higher transmission rate among humans. After attachment, S protein undergoes conformational changes that help in the fusion of viral and endosomal membranes. The viral RNA is then released into the host cell, and this is facilitated by host transmembrane protease serine-type 2 (TMPRSS2). After entering the cell, the viral RNA gets uncoated and translated into viral polymerase protein. After this, the viral RNA gets replicated using its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Structural proteins are then synthesized, assembled, and released outside the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The various steps involved in the viral lifecycle provide potential targets for drug discovery and facilitates drug repurposing. The promising drug targets are 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLPro) and papain-like protease (proteolysis of viral polyprotein), RdRp (involved in viral replication), S protein (helps in viral entry by binding to ACE2), and TMPRSS2 (helps in priming of S protein to facilitate its binding to ACE2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Apart from these, immune regulation and inflammatory pathways, which involve Th-17, interferons, proinflammatory cytokines, lymphocytes as natural killer cells, JAK proteins, and checkpoints such as programmed cell death protein 1(PD1), are also targeted in search of the therapeutic molecules for COVID-19. Biologics such as monoclonal antibodies are being developed to target various pathogenic molecules involved in SARS-CoV-2 infections.

The conventional drug development process is not feasible in the current scenario of the pandemic, so, the majority of studies in clinical trials for COVID-19 include the drugs already in use for other diseases. Various classes of drugs including antivirals, immunomodulators, anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, antibiotics, and traditional Chinese medicine have been investigated so far in search of new treatment avenues or interventions to combat COVID-19. Among them, remdesivir, convalescent plasma, anti-inflammatory drugs like interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitors (tocilizumab and sarilumab), and traditional Chinese medicines prove to be the most promising therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Apart from various antivirals, immunomodulators, and IL-6 inhibitors, the current emerging therapies focus on cell-based therapy (natural killer (NK) cells and mesenchymal stem cells), biologics (monoclonal antibodies, interleukins, cytokines), ACE2 receptor blocker, angiotensin II type I receptor blockers (ARB), fibrinolytic therapy, and combination therapy of various antivirals with immunomodulators, antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs), etc.</p><p id="Par29">To combat various comorbidities associated with COVID-19, many conventional antidiabetic (sitagliptin, dapagliflozin), antihypertensive (ramipril, prazosin, amiodarone, spironolactone), and lipid lowering agents (atorvastatin) have been studied in clinical trials along with standard treatment regimen. Various antineoplastic drugs (etoposide, methotrexate, melphalan, isotretinoin plus tamoxifen, nintedanib, lenalidomide, etc.) and drugs like thalidomide, oxytocin, chlorpromazine, montelukast, povidone-iodine, famotidine, cholecalciferol, N-acetylcysteine, and pyridostigmine bromide have also been studied in clinical trials for COVID-19. To address the respiratory distress associated with COVID-19, the role of drugs like valsartan and sirolimus is being investigated in various clinical trials. There is an emerging role of recombinant bacterial ACE2 receptors like the enzyme of B38-CAP (rbACE2) for COVID-19. It works like human-ACE2 and decreases angiotensin II level, thereby reducing the release of proinflammatory cytokines and the development of ARDS. It has been proposed that due to bacterial origin, it might not get recognized by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and hence possess added advantage over conventional ACE2 inhibitors (ACEI) and ARBs. However, it is yet to determine whether long-term use of ACEI, ARBs, and rbACE2 will increase or alleviate the SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p><p id="Par30">Another approach for reducing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic is to develop COVID-19 vaccines that can be available to people across the globe. Many vaccines are being studied in animal models, and some of them have entered the clinical trials. However, months are needed before the vaccines are developed, approved, and marketed. Some researchers and clinicians have proposed the role of bacillus Calmette Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG) vaccines, levamisole, and Isoprinosine, as prophylactic therapy for COVID-19. BCG vaccine is assumed to enhance the innate immune response by inducing metabolic and epigenetic changes. Clinical trials are underway in Australia and Netherlands for determining the efficacy of BCG vaccines in healthcare workers, while some recent studies do not favor the role of BCG vaccine in COVID-19. As of July 4, more than 900 interventional trials have been registered to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> targeting pharmacological drugs for COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].

But, a recently published report of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial at ten hospitals in Hubei, China, has documented the statistically non-significant clinical benefits in the remdesivir group, although the numerical reduction in time to clinical improvement in those treated earlier was numerically shorter in the remdesivir group than the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The dose used in this study was a single 200-mg loading dose, followed by a 100-mg daily infusion, and the most common adverse events seen in the remdesivir group were constipation, hypoalbuminemia, hypokalemia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and increased total bilirubin. Moreover, the preliminary report of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of remdesivir in 1059 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (538 in remdesivir and 521 in the placebo group) has reported that remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in COVID-19 patients. In this study, remdesivir was administered intravenously at 200&#x000a0;mg loading dose on day 1 and 100&#x000a0;mg daily from day 2 to day 10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Another randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial in 397 (200 patients for 5&#x000a0;days and 197 for 10&#x000a0;days) COVID-19 patients not requiring mechanical ventilation has reported no significant difference between a 5-day course and a 10-day course of remdesivir. All the patients received 200&#x000a0;mg of intravenous remdesivir on day 1 and 100&#x000a0;mg once daily on subsequent days. The limitation of this study was the open-label design and the absence of a placebo control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, whether remdesivir is associated with more benefit or might cause harm needs to be confirmed in a randomized control trial (RCT) of a larger sample size.

Recently, remdesivir is certified for an emergency use authorization (EUA) for treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Promising signals from various studies are available yet more data are needed to conclude its efficacy for COVID-19. The risk&#x02013;benefit ratio needs to be optimized in a larger population size with an early start of remdesivir treatment in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, the adequate dose should be selected, which produces clinically beneficial effects and causes less harm.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Favipiravir (T-705 or Avigan)</title><p id="Par32">It is another most promising purine nucleoside analog being studied for COVID-19 and was developed by Fujifilm Toyama, Japan.

Recently, chloroquine has demonstrated the efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells 19. Being a weak diprotic base both CQ and HCQ act by increasing the pH of endosomes and prevent the fusion of viral and host cell membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. They also interfere with the glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 receptors and also act at the post-entry stage of the virus.

HCQ (EC50&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.14&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) is more potent and safer than CQ (EC50&#x02009;=&#x02009;23.90&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) and found to have a role in preventing cytokine storm that occurs in serious cases of COVID-19. An open-label nonrandomized French study of 36 patients (20 in the HCQ group and 16 in the control group) reported improved viral clearance with HCQ compared with control group patients receiving standard supportive care.

Also, some adverse events were reported with the CQ and HCQ group including arrhythmia and the survival rates were also less in these groups in comparison to the control group. Many RCTs on both CQ and HCQ are still in the clinical trial, evaluating their role against COVID-19 treatment, but whether it is efficacious or not, it would be ascertained only after completion of these trials.

Although many compounds have been tested in both non-clinical (simulations, in vitro, and studies in animals) and clinical settings, but unfortunately, there are no FDA-approved vaccines and specific therapeutic interventions for COVID-19 to date. Several strategies have been employed to target the COVID-19 treatment regimen, and three major strategies that are targeted nowadays are repurposing drugs, investigating the efficacy of antibodies, and developing vaccines. Clinical trials are underway in search of a targeted and efficacious treatment for COVID-19; however, certain barriers have limited the results of previous trials, and these need to be addressed for getting a more reliable and conclusive outcome. The four major issues that need to be pondered upon to avoid the inconclusive results from previous trials are dose optimization, well-defined therapeutic timing window, trial designs (randomized and adequate powered), and selection of specific outcome measures. Further, there is a need for international collaborative work to fight this pandemic and develop a more robust infrastructure to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, innovative computational&#x02013;based methods like artificial intelligence should be applied to accelerate the traditional drug discovery process, so that this can reduce the total time taken and could be helpful in faster development of drugs during any emergency conditions or pandemic. Keeping in view the emergence of novel life-threatening diseases from mutating RNA viruses with a potential of cross-species transmission, there is a need for a broad-spectrum antiviral agent that could effectively reduce the viral load targeting a wide group of viruses and helps in reducing the massive consequences on human health. Further, we recommend the use of combination therapy that includes both antivirals and non-antiviral regimens to combat both viremia and associated immunopathological symptoms like lymphocytopenia and cytokine storm that might lead to acute lung injury and respiratory failure. Also, emphasis should be given to the rational and adequate use of drugs to prevent the resistance, which is quite common with these mutating RNA viruses. Moreover, the heritage of traditionally used medicinal and herbal compounds should be explored more and needs to be validated via clinical trials, so that their clinical efficacy could be established and would help provide protection for any epidemics like COVID-19. Finally, we hope that the current ongoing efforts will be successful and sooner the drugs and vaccines for COVID-19 will be available, and the world will emerge with better and robust infrastructure, funding, and regulatory measures to combat such future pandemics.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>This article is part of the Topical Collection on <italic>Covid-19</italic></p></fn><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes><title>Compliance with Ethical Standards</title><notes id="FPar8" notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p id="Par42">The authors do not disclose any conflict of interest.</p></notes><notes id="FPar9"><title>Human and Animal Rights and Informed Consent</title><p id="Par43">This article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects performed by any of the authors.</p></notes></notes><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>X</given-names></name><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>X</given-names></name><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Niu</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhan</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>X</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>GF</given-names></name><name><surname>Tan</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><collab>China Novel Coronavirus Investigating and Research Team</collab></person-group><article-title>A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019</article-title><source>N Engl J Med</source><year>2020</year><volume>382</volume><fpage>727</fpage><lpage>733</lpage><?supplied-pmid 31978945?><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">31978945</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">World Health Organisation.
