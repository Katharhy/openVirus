<p id="par0020">There has been considerable discussion on the origin of the causative virus SARS-CoV-2 after the first reports of COVID-19 in Wuhan [

 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Rapid sequencing of the nearly 30,000-nucleotide SARS-CoV-2 genome was accomplished and announced worldwide on January 10, 2020, by Zhang's group and several others in China. CoV is an enveloped RNA virus that primarily causes respiratory and gastrointestinal infections [
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Studies have shown that the nucleotide sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV genes are less than 80% identical [
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, the amino acid sequences of the seven conserved replicase domains in ORF1ab that are used for CoV species classification are 94.4% identical between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, suggesting that the two viruses belong to the same species. Notably, studies have confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same cell entry receptor—angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) - as SARS-CoV [

 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Wrapp et al. found that the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 was approximately 10–20 times that of SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which can provide one explanation for why SARS-CoV-2 has more human-to-human transmission than SARS-CoV. However, there is no clear evidence suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 has evolved from SARS-CoV.
