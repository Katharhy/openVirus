<p id="par0170">SARS-CoV-2 poses a threat to public health because it is highly infectious, has a high incidence of susceptibility and can cause serious illness or death. A total of 668,073 people in 216 countries have died from COVID-19. The emergence of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 suggests that coronaviruses will pose a lasting threat to humans and that the current epidemic will eventually be brought under control. The collective memory of SARS and SARS-CoV-2 may gradually fade, but we must not forget the lessons learned from the SARS and current SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. More accurate and effective drugs and vaccines need to be studied. At the same time, nations worldwide need to work together to fight COVID-19 to shorten hospital stays and reduce the consumption of healthcare resources, and we must prepare for the next epidemic.</p>
