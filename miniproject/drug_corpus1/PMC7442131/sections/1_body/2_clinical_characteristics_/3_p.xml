<p id="par0045">Laboratory examination showed that the white blood cell count in peripheral blood was normal or decreased, that the lymphocyte count was decreased, and that the degree of lymphocyte decline was correlated with disease severity [
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In most patients, CRP and blood sedimentation were increased, and in some patients, liver enzymes, myoglobin, LDH, and D-dimer were increased. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids can be detected in a variety of specimens, including pharyngeal swabs, sputum, lower respiratory tract secretions, blood and feces [
 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. RT-PCR and/or NGS methods have been used to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids in lower respiratory tract specimens (sputum or airway extracts) more accurately. By serological monitoring, positivity for the new coronavirus-specific IgM antibody is evident in most cases from 3 to 5 days after onset, and the titer of IgG antibody in the recovery stage is 4 times higher than that in the acute stage. Regarding pathological changes, the mucus and mucus accumulation in the airway are mainly caused by damage to the lungs and immune system. Other organs show mostly secondary damage due to different underlying diseases. Data from Zhong Nanshan's team showed that on admission, a ground-glass shadow was the most common radiological manifestation on chest CT (56.4%). Lymphocytopenia at admission affected for 83.2% of cases [

The first autopsy report of the COVID-19 in China indicated that the gross view of the lung had large amounts of airway viscous secretions, mainly caused by distal alveolar injury. Findings from a local histological study of COVID-19 cadaver biopsy samples published in 
 <italic>Lancet Respiratory Medicine</italic> showed that the pathological features of COVID-19 were similar to those of SARS and MERS [
