<p>A good example is a hypothesis associating mandatory vaccinations against measles and other known viral diseases with cross-resistance to COVID-19 in children.
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The idea of the cross-reactivity is based on an observation suggesting that subjects who recover from measles and those vaccinated with measles, mumps and rubella vaccine produce antibodies to a variety of HIV-1 proteins.
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> This hypothesis might shed light on milder or asymptomatic course of COVID-19 and low mortality in Chinese children who are mandatory vaccinated against measles.
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Although harshly criticized and withdrawn for revision, a preprint of structural similarities between some glycoproteins of the novel coronavirus and HIV-1 may provide a point further stimulating the global interest toward the cross-reactivity phenomenon.
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The hypothesized structural similarities may justify the empirical use of HIV protease inhibitors, such as lopinavir and ritonavir, that proved effective in some COVID-19 patients.
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Additionally, the first case of early clearance of the novel coronavirus in a patient with HIV and hepatitis C virus co-infection and successful recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia also points to a crucial role of cross-reactive antibodies.
