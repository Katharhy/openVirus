<p>The COVID-19 pandemic necessitates mobilizing all available resources for containing the virus spread. It is apparent that isolation, social distancing, use of personal protective equipment, and proper individual and population hygiene decrease exposure to the deadly virus and minimize risk of severe COVID-19. Such protective measures can primarily save lives of high-risk individuals, such as children, pregnant women, medics, patients with underlying immunosuppressive and other chronic diseases, and the elderly. It is hypothesized that individuals regularly vaccinated against some infections, such measles and tuberculosis, may demonstrate better outcomes when exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Considering all safety issues, high-risk populations should undergo regular vaccinations to train their immunity and actively produce antibodies that may cross-react with SARS-CoV-2. Given the limitations of the cross-reactivity, particularly exhaustion of active immune response over time and with aging, passive antibody therapy can be indicated in subjects with early symptoms of COVID-19 and those with recent contacts with patients. Observational studies suggest that convalescent plasma with high amount of virus-neutralizing antibodies is effective for emergency use, well before the virus-related multiple organ affections become evident.</p>
