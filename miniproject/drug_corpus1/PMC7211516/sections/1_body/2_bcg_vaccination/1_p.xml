<p>An interesting hypothesis is generated suggesting that multiple doses of tuberculosis vaccine bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) could be protective against COVID-19 due to the so-called trained immunity phenomenon.
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The same strategy is proved to be safe and effective in autoimmune disorders, such as type 1 diabetes mellitus and multiple sclerosis. A recent preprint revealed nonspecific beneficial effects of universal BCG vaccination on hindering COVID-19 spread and its complications in some countries (e.g., Japan).
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The observed differing COVID-19 mortality rates across countries allow hypothesizing that increasing/implementing BCG vaccination may be protective during this pandemic, particularly in countries with no mandatory vaccination policy. The nonspecific protective effect of BCG vaccine can be clarified when results of the two ongoing trials become available.
