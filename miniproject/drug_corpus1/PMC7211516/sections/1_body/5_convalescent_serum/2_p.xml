<p>The required amount of antibodies in convalescent serum and duration of therapy depend on the viral load and severity of COVID-19. It is believed that virus-neutralizing antibodies, even in small quantities, can be effective when used for prevention or treatment of early symptoms of COVID-19. The emergency administration of the serum is primarily indicated in individuals with chronic underlying diseases, healthcare workers, and healthy subjects who have contacted infected patients. The resultant passive immunity may last for weeks and months.
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Although antibodies can be collected and stored for a long time, timing for their optimal use depends on the likelihood of mutations that may change the virus characteristics. Ideally, antibodies should be used within days of collection. The same antibodies cannot be effective if used beyond a seasonal outbreak.
