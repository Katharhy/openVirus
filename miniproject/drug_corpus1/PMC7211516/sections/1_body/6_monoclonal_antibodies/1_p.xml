<p>Specific human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) blocking SARS-CoV-2 interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2) receptors and virus entry to human cells may offer more targeted options.
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Collecting B lymphocytes from patients who have recovered from COVID-19, identifying cells capable of producing the required neutralizing antibodies, and cloning blocking mAbs is a labor-intensive task. Identifying and standardizing the required mAbs is even more sophisticated task since the variability of the receptor-binding proteins can yield irreproducible results.
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> One of the initial in-vitro studies that aimed to clone mAbs reported high titers of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) 1 subunit of the surface protein and its receptor-binding locus in the majority of recovered patients.
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Reportedly, only a small fraction of these antibodies potently blocks the interaction with ACE2. The results of harvesting these blocking mAbs by using human B cells are promising, although no any attempt has been made to conduct related clinical study and explore the risk of adverse effects such as transfusion-related acute lung injury.
