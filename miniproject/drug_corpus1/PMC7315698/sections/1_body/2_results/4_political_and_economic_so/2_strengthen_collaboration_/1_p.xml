<p id="Par44">A cross-cutting theme identified was the need to strengthen collaboration and coordination between organisations involved in outbreak response at all levels [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Effective partnerships between countries and international organisations, such as public health, clinical research organisations, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), pharmaceutical companies and regulatory agencies, were described as instrumental for success [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. International research collaborations should be tied to capacity building and be genuinely collaborative [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], with local stakeholders engaged from inception [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Continuous dialogue, led by governments of affected nations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], was identified as a facilitator for ensuring politically acceptable prioritisation and resource allocation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. This was illustrated by Doe-Anderson et al., where the implementation of a vaccine RCT during an Ebola outbreak was attributed to decisive action by the national government and an effective partnership between the USA and Liberia, with strong leadership from both nations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. By employing and training local doctors and scientists and renovation of existing sites for use in the trial, the study also strengthened the research capacity for future trials [
