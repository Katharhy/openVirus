<p id="Par47">Administrative and regulatory procedures and limited access to staff with research training were persistent challenges in LMICs and HICs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Medical evacuation insurance requirements [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and delays in recruiting international staff [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] posed additional challenges in LMICs. This can pose a risk of over-reliance on unpaid staff doing research [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] on top of normal duties, with potential risk to routine patient care [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Multiple ethics committees, bureaucratic processes and inconsistency between required documentation were additional hurdles in LMICs and HICs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>], together with staff [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and trial insurance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>] cover. The longest delays were often experienced in gaining site [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and/or data sharing agreements, as documented in a time-in-motion study by Rishu et al. (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The infrastructure, staff time and an agreed standard required for dissemination of data were also often absent during times of crisis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and were further compounded by long delays in institutions establishing data sharing agreements [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Some attributed a competitive research culture and a fear of losing power [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] to a reluctance to share data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,
