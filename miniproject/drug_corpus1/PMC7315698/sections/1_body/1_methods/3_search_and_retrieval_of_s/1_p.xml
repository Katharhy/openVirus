 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) and terms were developed collaboratively with an information specialist who systematically searched six databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Global Health, Ovid PsycINFO, Scopus, Epistemonikos) for publications in English from 2008 to July 2018, to include up-to-date information relevant to clinical research responses today. The limits were set to capture recent, relevant clinical research responses to Public Health Emergencies of International Concern (PHEIC), where a clinical research response is vital to forward knowledge into risk factors and optimal clinical care to improve patient outcomes and outbreak control. The search terms were piloted by an information specialist and two reviewers. To ensure the search results were relevant and appropriate, after a review of the pilot search, restrictions were implemented using Boolean operators, before the strategy was finalised [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The search strategy was adapted for the Ovid databases to include the relevant thesaurus terms, in addition to searching the title or abstract fields (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Two reviewers independently screened the title and abstracts of the retrieved articles. If either of the reviewers considered a study potentially eligible, the full-text article was assessed independently for inclusion by two reviewers. Disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer. References were checked for additional potentially eligible studies.
