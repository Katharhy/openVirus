<p id="Par59">A key strength of this study is that it is the first to consider the wide range of challenges to the design and delivery of clinical research during emergency epidemics from a global perspective. The search strategy was comprehensive, spanning multiple databases and incorporating a range of peer-reviewed literature types. Nevertheless, due to the paucity of empirical evidence in this area, we did not carry out a formal quality assessment of included studies. Although findings are limited by restriction to English language publications, most articles addressed challenges to research responses in LMICs. Most studies were set in West Africa during the Ebola outbreak or in Europe and Northern America during the H1N1 pandemic, highlighting the limited information on research preparedness in LMICs and collective preparedness to deliver timely, coordinated research responses to emergency epidemics globally.</p>
