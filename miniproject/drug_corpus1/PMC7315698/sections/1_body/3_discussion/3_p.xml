<p id="Par58">The Platform for European Preparedness Against (Re-) emerging Epidemics (PREPARE) is an example of a clinical network primed to respond through a suite of active, syndromic studies across Europe [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. These could serve as models for similar networks globally. Importantly, these and similar initiatives need to be evaluated and sustained to capitalise on existing investments. Strategic strengthening of local research capability globally will reduce reliance on external agencies to deliver research responses, while ensuring research responses are locally acceptable, ethical in the context and address local needs and interest. Local and regional empowerment may also reduce the risk of unethical studies on vulnerable populations [

Integration of research into outbreak response facilitated the further assessment of a candidate Ebola vaccine during the current outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), aiding the containment of the outbreak, illustrating the importance of clinical research for outbreak control [

A recent RCT of four Ebola treatments in DRC shows that well-planned scientifically and ethically sound clinical research can be delivered during prolonged outbreaks, through coordinated collaborative efforts between a wide range of stakeholders, including frontline staff and patients [
