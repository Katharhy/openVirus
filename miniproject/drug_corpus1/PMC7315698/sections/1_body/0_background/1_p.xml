<p id="Par34">Clinical research forms the basis for evidence-based clinical management of patients and can contribute to effective outbreak control. Although activities have improved collective preparedness to respond to public health emergencies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], experiences from previous outbreaks have highlighted many ongoing challenges for clinical research responses to epidemics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Some of these stem from the inherently unpredictable nature of emerging infections. Epidemics occur intermittently across geopolitical and cultural boundaries. Some can be forecast, and others emerge unexpectedly and disproportionally affect resource-poor settings with fragile healthcare systems and infrastructure, adding additional challenges to responses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Previous epidemics have generated important information that has helped inform preparedness and response; however, it has also highlighted systemic challenges to our global capability to address important clinical research questions in these environments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Clinical research takes time to plan, conduct and disseminate, a luxury that is rarely available during an outbreak. Ethical and regulatory frameworks designed for non-acute epidemics are not necessarily fit for the purpose of acute epidemic research [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Conducting research under emergency conditions requires agility, intense activity, flexibility and adaptability to context [
