<p id="Par25">AZM has antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro
 <italic>,</italic> being shown to reduce viral replication in combination with hydroxychloroquine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Azithromycin was also associated with a reduced viral load of non-SARS-CoV-2 alpha- and betacoronaviruses in children receiving AZM during a mass distribution programme [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In a separate drug screen of 1520 approved drugs, AZM was also a key hit with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 2.1 μM [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Macrolides have also shown efficacy in vitro against a wide range of other viruses. These include the flavivirus Zika, where AZM was a key hit in a drug screen of 2177 compounds and markedly reduce viral proliferation and virus-induced cytopathic effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In Zika, AZM upregulates type 1 and type III interferon responses and the viral pathogen recognition receptors MDA5 and RIG-I and increases the levels of phosphorylated TBK1 and IRF3 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. There is also evidence of in vitro activity against enteroviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], Ebola [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and SARS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], with in vivo activity against influenza A, with reduction in IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, CXCL9, sTNF and CRP in a small open-label RCT [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].
