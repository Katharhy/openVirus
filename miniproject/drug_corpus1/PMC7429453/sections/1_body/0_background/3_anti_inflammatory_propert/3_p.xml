<p id="Par28">A key cell in the steroid-resistant ARDS which develops in COVID-19 are pro-inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], which are increased in severe disease, replacing alveolar macrophages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Macrophage-derived cytokines tend to be resistant to corticosteroids. It is also a cell type markedly impaired by diabetes, a dominant risk factor for COVID-19-related death. An important property of macrolides is that they accumulate 100–1000-fold [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] in lysosomes of phagocytes and are released in those sites when they die. Within the alveolar macrophage, AZM attenuates LPS-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines through inhibition of AP-1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]; it inhibits arachidonic acid release in LPS-stimulated macrophages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], inhibits GM-CSF [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and increases phagocytosis, likely by upregulation of CD206, the macrophage mannose receptor [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. AZM attenuates type 1 response and shifts macrophage polarisation to a more immunosuppressive, tissue repair M2-phenotype [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Thus, AZM reduces M1 macrophage markers CCR7, CXCL11, IL-12p70 and enhanced IL-10 and CCL18.
