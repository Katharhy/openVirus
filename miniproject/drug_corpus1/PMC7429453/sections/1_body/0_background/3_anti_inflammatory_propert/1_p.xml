<p id="Par26">It is likely that AZM’s anti-inflammatory properties—rather than antiviral—will be more important in the treatment of severe COVID-19 disease in secondary care. Antivirals are likely to have limited efficacy in severe disease as they are administered late in the disease, after viraemia has peaked [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In stark contrast to the early cytokine storm responsible for 50% of deaths from influenza A, most COVID-19-related deaths occur due to sudden, late respiratory decompensation, peaking at day 14 after the onset of symptoms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. By this time, viral loads are low, and it is during the adaptive immunity stage that a late increase of innate/acute phase inflammatory cytokines occurs, including IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, GCSF, MCP, MIP1a and TNF [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and is associated with poor outcome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. These dysregulated cytokines are associated with features of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, dominated by lymphocytes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This points to a failure not of viral control, but of the ability to halt an over-exuberant inflammatory cascade. Therefore, the priority should be to target the off switch for these signalling cascades, which are characteristically steroid-resistant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and associated with pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung damage in SARS patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and MERS-CoV [
