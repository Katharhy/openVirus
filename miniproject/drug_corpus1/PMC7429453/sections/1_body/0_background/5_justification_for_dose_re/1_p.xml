<p id="Par30">AZM is generally well-tolerated with a very good and well-documented safety record. It is associated with diarrhoea. Whilst there have been concerns about cardiovascular risk, huge epidemiological studies suggest these are very small effects (e.g. 47 extra deaths/million prescriptions) or perhaps have no effect when corrected for confounding. It is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to the drug. It can be used in pregnancy. It should be used in caution in those receiving some other drugs including fluoroquinolones such as moxifloxacin and levofloxacin and in patients with ongoing proarrhythmic conditions.</p>
