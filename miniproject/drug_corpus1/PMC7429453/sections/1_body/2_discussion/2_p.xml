<p id="Par39">The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is now the third novel coronavirus to emerge in the last two decades, each with pandemic potential, and the emergence of further novel coronaviruses is to be expected. Despite widespread use in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, no randomised data yet exist. Therefore, well-designed randomised trials are urgently required. If efficacy is proven in such studies, then there is urgency in discovering, communicating and translating these findings. Equally, if robust randomised trials find convincing evidence of no therapeutic benefit, then this is also essential information to disseminate. Azithromycin is an extremely useful drug for a wide variety of indications including treatment or prevention of a range of bacterial infections of the respiratory tract, ear, skin and soft tissue, genital tract, and eye [
