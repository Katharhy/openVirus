<p id="Par40">Several other trials of AZM in COVID-19 have been initiated including two national studies in UK [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. However, given the strong rationale for investigating this molecule, multiple trials are needed. If one trial provides evidence of clinical efficacy in one particular population or clinical setting, then further studies will be needed to provide data on which other populations and settings and dose regimens are appropriate. These trials differ in several significant aspects. Firstly, they are studying different time points in the disease course: for instance, the PRINCIPLE trial is investigating people within the first 7 days of symptoms, the RECOVERY trial in late disease after hospitalisation with severe clinical features. Secondly, they are recruiting in different settings, the former in primary care, the latter in secondary care. Thirdly, they are using different dose regimens, the former just 3 days of therapy, the latter 5 days. Together, these studies are therefore likely to be assessing different properties of AZM: in early disease, PRINCIPLE will explore antiviral effects, in very late disease RECOVERY is likely to expose anti-bacterial activities against secondary infection, whilst ATOMIC2 is intermediate and predominantly assessing AZM’s anti-inflammatory effects.
