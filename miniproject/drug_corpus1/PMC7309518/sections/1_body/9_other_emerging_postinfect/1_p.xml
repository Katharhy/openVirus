<p>Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, as described for the other coronaviruses, or postinfectious brainstem encephalitis, myelitis, and radiculoneuropathies will not be unexpected. An atypical case of acute necrotizing encephalopathy, attributed to immune-mediated process and proinflammatory cytokines, and another with meningoencephalitis and leptomeningeal enhancement have been already noted.

 </sup> This picture is now becoming more clear with 2 reports in this issue of the Journal, documented by impressive MRIs; one, a case of acute necrotizing brainstem encephalopathy, presented with epilepsy and changes in the right mesial temporal lobe and hippocampus

 </sup> and another with altered mental status and multiple white matter tumefactive lesions with postgadolinium enhancement in periventricular areas and corpus callosum suggestive of demyelination.

 </sup> Not underestimating the overwhelming burden of acute COVID-19 to medical staff, vigilance for these disorders is needed along with screening for autoimmune encephalitis autoantibodies

 </sup> because these cases can potentially respond to early initiation of immunotherapy, especially with IVIg, whenever indicated, which may additionally offer various potentially protective antibodies and anticytokine effects.
