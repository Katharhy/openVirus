 </sup> All presented with subacute onset of upper and lower extremity weakness, distal paresthesias, and sensory deficits 3â€“10 days after experiencing cough, anosmia, ageusia, and sore throat. On admission, all had lymphocytopenia and high C-reactive protein (CRP) that led to diagnosis of COVID-19. One patient had facial diplegia and sensory ataxia.

 </sup> The CSF showed elevated protein concentration but was negative for COVID-19. Electrophysiology was consistent with demyelinating or axonal GBS. MRI showed enhancement of the caudal nerve roots or facial nerve. Symptoms rapidly progressed to tetraplegia requiring mechanical ventilation. Antiganglioside antibodies in 3/6 tested patients were negative. All received IVIg with variable recovery; 1 died.
