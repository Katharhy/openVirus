<p>First and foremost, the practicing neurologists in this pandemic should now be aware that a patient who presents with an acute paralytic disease—like GBS, encephalomyelitis, or myositis—even without fever, dyspnea, or any systemic symptoms, may represent the first manifestation of COVID-19. This is compelling, considering that only 43% of COVID-19–positive patients on admission have fever,

 </sup> and many of the present patients with GBS did not have any COVID-19 symptoms at presentation. These early GBS cases also highlight that 2 clinical and laboratory signs, anosmia/ageusia and lymphocytopenia/thrombocytopenia, are red flags in suspecting COVID-19 in otherwise asymptomatic patients with acute neurologic events. They further confirm what we had feared from other viral pandemics that COVID-19 can trigger neurologic autoimmunity; in contrast to the other postviral neurologic diseases, however, COVID-19 requires high degree of suspicion as a potential hidden trigger to prevent inadvertent viral transmission to health care personnel and patient relatives, as in the Wuhan case.

 </sup> The series also highlights that GBS peaks 5–10 days after the first COVID-19 symptoms, which in intensive care unit (ICU) settings helps to distinguish GBS from critical illness neuropathy that usually appears later in the course of very sick ICU patients.
