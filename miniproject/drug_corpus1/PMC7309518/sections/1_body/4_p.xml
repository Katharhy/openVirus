 </sup> The patient with MFS presented with oculomotor nerve palsies, diplopia, perioral paresthesias, areflexia, ataxia, and elevated CSF protein concentration and the other with diplopia, bilateral abducens nerve palsy, and anosmia. Both had lymphopenia and tested positive for COVID-19; their SCF was COVID-19 negative. The patient with MFS was positive for GD1b ganglioside antibodies and improved with IVIg. In both, the neurologic features completely resolved, except for residual anosmia and ageusia. Last, 2 cases from France, a 43-year-old man and a 70-year-old woman, also presented with acute anosmia, followed by rapidly progressive weakness, paresthesias, ataxia, areflexia, and multiple cranial palsies (including III, V, VI, VII, and VIII), MRI enhancement of cranial nerves, roots, and plexus, high CSF protein concentration but negative for COVID-19, typical features of acute demyelinating neuropathy by electrophysiology, and clinical improvement after IVIg.
