<p>International institutions use experiment‐based understandings of nature to combat public health issues with a militaristic approach, which can be traced directly back to European industrial expansion of the 19th and 20th centuries. This tactic, however, ignores the ecological knowledge we have of microorganisms. Promising alternatives to antibiotics, for instance, can be found in a century‐old branch of research focused on bacteriophages or phages, a class of viruses that can selectively degrade the membranes of bacteria and other microorganisms.
