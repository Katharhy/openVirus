<p>Before World War II, Gerhard Domagk showed that sulphonamides could kill bacteria.

 </xref> During the war, penicillin was produced at an industrial scale, representing the first biotechnological endeavour in which the engineering of productive processes backed up drug manufacture. As a “magic” solution against infectious diseases, penicillin was soon produced at an industrial scale and saved the lives of many. A century of widespread industrial usage of antibiotics instigated a so‐called antibiotic resistance, aggravated in recent years to the point that some describe it as an epidemic.

 </xref> Even though antibiotic resistance has been observed for about a century in response to penicillin and other human‐made drugs and chemicals, the industrial production of antibiotics has increased annually as a result of expanding activities based on the extraction and refinement of coal and oil.

 </xref> Massive industrial spills of antibiotics into natural environments resulted in antibiotic resistant genes that are exchanged horizontally among bacteria and viruses—natural guests of all living beings. For these reasons, several regulatory agencies and international health organizations, such as the European Medicines Agency, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration are in a phase of lowering the tolerance of antibiotics use in both veterinary and human medicine. In addition to tracking and monitoring antibiotic resistance, these institutions focus on how industrial activities, through the global production and trade of food, propagate the material conditions, both social and ecological, needed for their very existence. As Heather Paxson notes, these microbiological materialisations “are the stuff of which politics can be made,” and are used to propagate diverse laws and regulations, such as stricter regulations for migrant workers and imported food commodities.
