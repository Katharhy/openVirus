<p>The scientific methodologies underpinning decisions made by experts hide unstable historical, environmental, and political legacies that have fragmented agencies across wide geographical and temporal networks. To historically map the social and biological impact of scientific methodologies is a particularly complex task. On the one hand, it involves the understanding of scientific models that are able to describe and interact with a world made of diverse living and non‚Äêliving interacting entities. On the other hand, it involves the understanding of the aims and impact that these scientific models have, not only on our societies and within the national and international health institutions, but also on a material, biological level. A right approach to historical and political analyses needs to clearly see that national and international health institutions constantly mediate between the social and political dimensions of scientific knowledge.</p>
