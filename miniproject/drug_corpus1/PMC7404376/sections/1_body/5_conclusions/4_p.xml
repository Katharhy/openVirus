<p>The selective pressures exerted by humans, mainly through industrial and scientific endeavours, have revealed the global impact that anthropic activities can have on microorganisms—for instance, through the widespread use of antibiotics or the acceleration of climate change.

 </xref> We have shown how industrial activities have physically altered our environments on a microbiological level across the globe. We have also traced how fundamental conceptions of scientific research subjects—such as bacteria, viruses, and microorganisms—change synchronously with human societies and civilisations over time (for example, we showed how bacteria changed their genome to resist man‐made antibiotics). How historical and biological changes of living entities and of their relationships are narrated depends on how selective pressures exerted by human institutions, such as industry and science, are conceived.
