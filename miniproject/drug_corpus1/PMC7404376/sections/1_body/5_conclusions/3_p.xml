<p>The concept of the “invisible enemy,” fuelled by germ theory and realized within programs of colonial biomedicine and national security, has been nurtured since the advent of microbiological, bacteriological, and virologic sciences in the 19th century. Portrayed so as to reinforce national and international economic agendas, this concept has uniquely cast microbes as harmful agents. A broader framework of environmental and ecological research that engages with the understanding of microbes as both elements necessary to all life processes and potentially pathogenic entities represents a compelling alternative to the “invisible enemy” framework.</p>
