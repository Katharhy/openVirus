<p>After decades of disregard in microbial research, there is a renewed interest today in bacteria and viruses as elemental subjects of biological, geological and atmospheric dynamics. The recent attention is shifting notions of microorganisms as threats to human and non‐human health by acknowledging their key roles in Earth systems.

 </xref> Viruses and bacteria facilitate the construction of genetic patterns that underlie all organisms. Together with other microbes, they co‐maintain environmental equilibria, which make them key actors in both evolutionary and ecological dynamics. Maureen O'Malley looks at viruses beyond their small‐scale interactions with hosts and their role as disease‐causing agents. She emphasizes that understanding viruses from an ecological perspective allows us to consider that they “should be conceptualized as ecological actors that are at least comparable and possibly equal to organismal actors.” She further argues that, despite ongoing disputes, “organismality does not matter.” Viral ecologies and epistemologies allow us to grasp “
 <italic>that life may be best understood as the combined and often non‐linear interactions of biological agents not all of which are living things</italic>.”

 </xref> Concerned about the misinterpretations of biological systems, Lynn Margulis traces the human‐virus relationship back within the evolutionary landscape to highlight the imbrication between animals, plants, and viruses: “Viruses are no more 'germs' or 'enemies' than are bacteria or human cells. Like bacterial symbionts, viruses are sources of evolutionary variation. Viruses today spread genes among bacteria and humans and other cells, as they always have.”
