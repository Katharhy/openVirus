<p>In 1950, about a century after Pasteur's studies and following unvaried appreciation of environmental factors, it was shown that once viruses are stimulated by environmental stress, they emerge from dormancy and multiply inside the bacterium in which they live. They then erupt from the bacterium, kill the host, and spread copies of themselves, along with some of the bacterial genes of the host, into the environment.
