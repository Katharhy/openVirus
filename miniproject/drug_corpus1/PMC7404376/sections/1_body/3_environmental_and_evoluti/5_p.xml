<p>The controversial 19th‐century clinical observations of asymptomatic carriers, coupled with the systematic study of the microscopic world in the laboratory, sparked a heated debate on the transformative dynamics of microbes and their relationships with their host organisms. Fixity of species was maintained by Linnaeans like Ferdinand Cohn, who structured the most successful taxonomy of microbes.

 </xref> Since the beginning of his studies, and cautiously countering any Linnaean idea of microbial fixity, Pasteur had rejected any species‐specific characteristic of bacteria, and he maintained this belief as he developed experimental practices to modulate the virulence of these microorganisms.
