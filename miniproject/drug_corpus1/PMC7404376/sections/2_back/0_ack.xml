 <title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title>
 <p>We are grateful to Erica Charters, whose thorough comments have helped us to shape, re‐shape, and sharpen our text. We would also like to thank Koen Vermeir and the three anonymous reviewers for their thought‐provoking and insightful comments. Moreover, we are thankful to the librarians of the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, especially Urte Brauckmann and Matthias Schwerdt who helped us access literary resources, and Lindy Divarci and Elizabeth Hughes who supported us with their prompt linguistic assistance. A special thanks goes to the colleagues of Department 1 of the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science and, especially, colleagues of the research group “Knowledge in and of the Anthropocene.”</p>
