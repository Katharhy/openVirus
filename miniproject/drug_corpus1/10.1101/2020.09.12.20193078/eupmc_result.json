    "This work details the study of critical containment zones in Maharashtra within a time (April 9 2020 - July 31 2020) in the context of COVID-19. The effects of lockdown implementation, community isolation, environmental factors, demographic aspects, behavioural factors, diet etc. have been investigated. The effect of the aforementioned factors on the infected cases, cumulative infected cases, recoveries, cumulative recoveries, active cases, deaths and cumulative deaths are analyzed. The integrated effects of the aforementioned factors on COVID- 19 outcomes are further amplified due to adequate and inadequate health facilities. The study will be helpful to scientists, researchers, pharmacists and biotechnologists in new vaccine design & to accommodate above factors for the betterment of susceptible & infected people of Maharashtra and similar demographies across the globe. Further, it pinpoints the need for more awareness and control strategies among the people to reduce the havoc, stress, fear, anxiety, pathogenicity and thereby reducing mortality."
