    "The novel Coronavirus pathogen Covid-19 is a cause of concern across the world as the human-to-human infection caused by it is spreading at a fast pace. The virus that first manifested in Wuhan, China has travelled across continents. The increase in number of deaths in Italy, Iran, USA, and other countries has alarmed both the developed and developing countries. Scientists are working hard to develop a vaccine against the virus, but until now no breakthrough has been achieved. India, the second most populated country in the world, is working hard in all dimensions to stop the spread of community infection. Health care facilities are being updated; medical and paramedical staffs are getting trained, and many agencies are raising awareness on the issues related to this virus and its transmission. The administration is leaving no stone unturned to prepare the country to mitigate the adverse effects. However, as the number of infected patients, and those getting cured is changing differently in different states everyday it is difficult to predict the spread of the virus and its fate in Indian context. Different states have adopted measures to stop the community spread. Considering the vast size of the country, the population size and other socio-economic conditions of the states, a single uniform policy may not work to contain the disease. In this paper, we discuss a predictive mathematical model that can give us some idea of the fate of the virus, an indicative data and future projections to understand the further course this pandemic can take. The data can be used by the health care agencies, the Government Organizations and the Planning Commission to make suitable arrangements to fight the pandemic. Though the model is preliminary, it can be used at regional level to manage the health care system in the present scenario. The recommendations can be made, and advisories prepared based on the predictive results that can be implemented at regional levels."
