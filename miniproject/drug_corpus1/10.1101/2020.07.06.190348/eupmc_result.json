    "Abstract The outbreak of a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 responsible for COVID-19 pandemic has caused worldwide public health emergency. Due to the constantly evolving nature of the coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 mediated alteration on post-transcriptional gene regulation across human tissues remains elusive. In this study, we analyze publicly available genomic datasets to systematically dissect the crosstalk and dysregulation of human post-transcriptional regulatory networks governed by RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and micro-RNAs (miRs), due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We uncovered that 13 out of 29 SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins directly interact with 51 human RBPs of which majority of them were abundantly expressed in gonadal tissues and immune cells. We further performed a functional analysis of differentially expressed genes in mock-treated versus SARS-CoV-2 infected lung cells that revealed enrichment for immune response, cytokine-mediated signaling, and metabolism associated genes. This study also characterized the alternative splicing events in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells compared to control demonstrating that skipped exons and mutually exclusive exons were the most abundant events that potentially contributed to differential outcomes in response to viral infection. Motif enrichment analysis on the RNA genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 clearly revealed the enrichment for RBPs such as SRSFs, PCBPs, ELAVs, and HNRNPs suggesting the sponging of RBPs by SARS-CoV-2 genome. A similar analysis to study the interactions of miRs with SARS-CoV-2 revealed functionally important miRs that were highly expressed in immune cells, suggesting that these interactions may contribute to the progression of the viral infection and modulate host immune response across other human tissues. Given the need to understand the interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with key post-transcriptional regulators in the human genome, this study provides a systematic computational analysis to dissect the role of dysregulated post-transcriptional regulatory networks controlled by RBPs and miRs, across tissues types during SARS-CoV-2 infection."
