    "Background Recent evidence has established a beneficial effect of systemic corticosteroids for treatment of moderate-to-severe COVID-19. However, it is unknown if inhaled corticosteroid use is associated with reduced morbidity of the disease.  Methods In a nationwide cohort of hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 test-positive individuals in Denmark, we estimated the 30-day hazard ratio of intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death among users of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) compared with users of non-ICS inhalers (Î²2-agonist/muscarinic-antagonists), or non-users of ICS, with Cox regression adjusted for age, sex, and other confounders. We repeated these analyses among influenza test-positive patients during 2010-2018. Results Among 2,180 hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients, 282 were admitted to ICU and 421 died within 30 days. ICS use was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.25 (95% CI [CI], 0.60 to 2.61) for ICU admission and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.54 to 1.31) for death compared with non-ICS inhaler use. Compared with no ICS use, the hazard ratio of ICU admission or death was 1.22 (95% CI, 0.77 to 1.94) and 1.05 (95% CI, 0.75 to 1.47), respectively. Among 10,279 hospitalized influenza patients, the hazard ratios were 1.43 (95% CI, 0.89 to 2.30) and 1.11 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.46) for ICU admission, and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.63 to 1.01) and 1.03 (95% CI, 0.87 to 1.22) for death compared with non-ICS inhaler use and no ICS use, respectively. Conclusions Our results do not support an effect of inhaled corticosteroid use on COVID-19 morbidity, however we can only rule out moderate-to-large reduced or increased risks."
