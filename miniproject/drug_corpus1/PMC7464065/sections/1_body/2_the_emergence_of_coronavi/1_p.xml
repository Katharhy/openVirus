<p id="Par16">The Coronaviruses were known to cause only mild respiratory disease in humans, with severe infections in the immunocompromised cases and young population mostly acting as an asymptomatic carrier because disease symptoms are not much prominent in young ones [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Coronaviruses have the highest known frequency of recombination of any positive-strand RNA virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Earlier reports suggested the emergence of SARS-CoV by recombination between bat SARS related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) followed by mutations in civets before its spillover[
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Similarly, the MERS-CoV also circulated and attained mutations for around 30 years in camels before the MERS pandemic happened [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], suggesting the adaptation of the viruses to the environment and different host before their spillover to humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Coronaviruses also have an essential replication process, which involves a 2-step replication mechanism. Many RNA virus genomes contain a single open reading frame (ORF), but coronaviruses can contain up to 10 separate ORFs except for SARS-CoV-2, which has single intact ORF [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. That can lead to the emergence of CoV at times.
