<p id="Par21">The origin of SARS-CoV-2 was postulated to be from bats, considering them the natural reservoirs of the virus [

Recently, a study suggested the pangolins to serve as a natural reservoir host of SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses (Pangolin-CoV) based on 91.02% sequence similarities at the whole-genome level between pangolin-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, the S1 protein of pangolin coronavirus was reported to be closer to SARS-CoV-2 than bat coronavirus (RaTG13)[

In nearby places like clinics and hospitals, CoV can be transmitted through the air if people remain there for a long duration of time, suggesting the risk of aerosolÂ transmission [
