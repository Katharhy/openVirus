 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], but even dysgeusia and anosmia [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Moreover, SARS-CoV infection has been reported in the nervous tissue of experimental animals and patients with heavy involvement of the brainstem. In this context, acute respiratory failure among COVID-19 patients suggests the probable invasion of the brain by SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Recently, a study supported the neurotropic potential of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as 36.4% of involved COVID-19 patients manifested neurological signs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. Those who developed severe pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, hypoxemic respiratory failure, gastrointestinal infection, multiple system failure, or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) succumb to the disease. The threat is still looming high in the event of this deadly virus created a pandemic situation [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. Destruction of microvasculature in various organs is believed to be one of the pathogenic mechanisms of the COVID-19 [
