<p id="Par42">It is already known that ACE2 is a crucial player in the coronavirus infection by promoting cell entry [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR181">181</xref>]. The metallopeptidase, ACE2, has been identified as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">182</xref>]and a potent receptor for SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The B domain of S
 <sub>1</sub> in SARS-CoV-2 engages human ACE2 (hACE2) with comparable affinity found in SARS-CoV SB from viral isolates associated with the 2002â€“2003 epidemic (i.e., binding with high affinity to hACE2). The tight binding to hACE2 could partially explain the efficient transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in humans, as was the case for SARS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">183</xref>]. ACE2 is an important drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular and kidney diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184">184</xref>]. Recently, Lei et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185">185</xref>] demonstrated the potential of ACE2 based therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2, which could further be exploited alone or in combination, and they elucidate the molecular mechanisms of their potent and broad neutralizing activity. These ACE2 fusion proteins could be used for diagnosis and as research reagents in the development of vaccines and inhibitors. ACE2 and AT1R (angiotensin receptor one blocker) molecules such as losartan as inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) could be a useful therapeutic option in reducing the lung inflammation and treating pneumonia in COVID-19 patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR186">186</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR187">187</xref>]. The virus attachment through spike glycoprotein (S) to ACE2 receptors and subsequent priming of S protein by the host cell serine protease TMPRSS2 has been exploited as therapeutic targets. In this context, the role of TMPRSS2 protease in SARS-CoV-2 replication has been reported, further supporting their probable role in the development of an active therapeutic agent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR188">188</xref>]. The TMPRSS2 inhibitor proved useful in blocking the virus entry and could work as a therapeutic option [
