 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">135</xref>]have recommended the application of broad-spectrum antivirals like lopinavir/ritonavir, neuraminidase inhibitors, peptide (EK1), RNA synthesis inhibitors for the time being till specific antivirals are evaluated. Chen et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] have used oseltamivir, lopinavir, ritonavir, ganciclovir in COVID-19 infected patients with excellent results; however, the combination of antiviral drugs is believed to be controversial [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">165</xref>]. Other medications used are antibiotics (cephalosporins, quinolones, carbapenems, tigecycline against methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, linezolid, moxifloxacin or levofloxacin, azithromycin or amoxicillin, and antifungal drugs), corticosteroids (prednisolone, dexamethasone), antipyretics (ibuprofen), anticoagulants (heparin) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] used antibiotics, methylprednisolone corticosteroid (40–120 mg per day), and oseltamivir (orally 75 mg twice daily) in COVID-19 patients along with oxygen support. However, the use of antibiotics should be taken care of as patients may not always develop bacterial complications [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Other trials involved the use of lopinavir–ritonavir and interferon-α 2b in COVID-19 patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR191">191</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR192">192</xref>]. National Health Commission of China recommended a combination of ribavirin and interferon-α as a treatment regimen for COVID-19 in its fifth edition; however, the efficacy of remdisivir and ritonavir/lopinavir needs to be determined by randomized controlled trial [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Rigorous preclinical and clinical both kinds of trials are required before the commencement of the commercialization of combination therapy against COVID-19 [
