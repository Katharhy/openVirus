<p id="Par37">Drug repurposing is a promising, fast, and cost-effective method that can overcome traditional de novo drug discovery and development challenges of targeting various diseases and disorders. Drug repurposing, the process of identifying new uses for the existing or candidate drugs, is an effective strategy for drug discovery in multiple diseases, including infectious viral diseases. In combating the nCoV-2019 viral outbreak, the use of already approved small drug molecules could inhibit the biological aspects of the viral life cycle like replication, transcriptions, host protein interaction, boosting immunity, among others. Viral polymerase and protease inhibitors of HIV and hepatitis C virus are two potential antiviral regimens that can be repurposed against 2019-nCoV [
