<p id="Par29">In general, the infection of coronavirus starts with the entry of S protein, which binds to the surface of the cells. This S protein fuses with the cell membrane and helps the syncytial formation and delivering of viral nucleocapsids into the cell for further replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>] and as per reports, neutralizing antibodies against receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein of SARS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>] and MERS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>] successfully neutralized those infections. In this context, neutralizing antibodies may prove highly useful in treating the COVID-19 as long as the SARS-CoV-2 shares the sequences in the RBD with SARS-CoV and MERS-COV [
