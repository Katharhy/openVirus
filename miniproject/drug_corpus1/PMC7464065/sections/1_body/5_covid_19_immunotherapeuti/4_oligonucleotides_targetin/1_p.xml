<p id="Par32">Apart from targeting S-protein of the nCoV-2019 virus using neutralizing antibodies, targeting of viral genomes could be another option to reduce the infectivity by degrading its genome. Recently, the RNA genome of the nCoV-2019 virus has been published (Gen Bank: MN908947.3). GS-5734, a nucleotide prodrug, showed broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus activity against bat CoV, pre-pandemic bat CoV, and existing human CoV in vitro and over primary human lung epithelial cell cultures and was found promising for treating epidemic and zoonotic coronaviruses of the near future [
