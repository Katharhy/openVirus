<p id="Par33">Nevertheless, there are a few challenges associated with these methods, such as conserved RNA sequence in the genome of coronaviruses is still not known. Since the conserved sequences are essential in siRNA targeting to avoid viral escape from the oligonucleotides targeting strategy. Second, the delivery of oligonucleotides (siRNA and ASO) would be very challenging. Lipid nanoparticle technology can mediate the delivery of these oligonucleotides into the lungs [
