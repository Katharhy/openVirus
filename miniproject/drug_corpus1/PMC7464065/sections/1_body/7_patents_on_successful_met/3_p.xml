<p id="Par58">Specifically, with regards to COVID-19, three drugs are in the race for patents. These include remdesivir of Gilead Sciences
 <sup>®</sup>, hydroxychloroquine of Sanofi
 <sup>®</sup> and Kaletra (Lopinavir+Ritonavir) of Abbvie
 <sup>®</sup>. They are patented for use against viruses (Ebola), malaria and HIV/AIDS, respectively, however, have shown potential for application in COVID-19 hence being evaluated in clinical trials (

Wuhan Institute of Virology in China has filed a patent for the application of remdesivir in COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR240">240</xref>] and Suzhou-based BrightGene Bio-Medical Technology for the synthesis of its active ingredient [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR241">241</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR242">242</xref>]. Chinese were first to evaluate the effectiveness of remdesivir, chloroquine and Kaletra in treating COVID-19 patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">136</xref>]. However, simultaneous intentions for patent applications raised global concerns [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR242">242</xref>]. This led to a sort of conflict between Chinese institutes and the pharmaceutical companies having original patents for the drugs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR242">242</xref>]. Thus, avoiding such differences and focusing on improving the health of people in times of pandemic need to be the priority rather than personnel monetary gains [
