<p id="Par56">Global research focuses on coronavirus infections, especially the recently happened outbreaks of SARS, MERS, and the most newly COVID-19. That involves the exploration of diagnostics, prophylactics, and therapeutics. Accordingly, the patenting of successful methodologies has gained immense importance, safeguarding the interests of scientists and institutions. Various patents are being filed, and many approved on diagnostic, prophylactic, and therapeutic aspects of coronaviruses and their diseases, especially SARS-CoV caused by SARS, MERS-CoV caused by MERS and the most newly SARS-CoV-2 caused COVID-19. As per one study, around 80% of patents are related to therapeutics, 35% for vaccines, and 28% for diagnostics agents or methods [
