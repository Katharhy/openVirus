<p id="Par26">Diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2/ COVID-19 cases include viral genome sequencing, RT-PCR, real-time RT-PCR (rRT-qPCR), POCT/bedside testing, reverse transcriptional loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), serological assays (enzyme-linked immunoassay, ELISA), computed tomography technique (CT) imaging, X-ray [

A reverse real-time PCR assay (rRT-PCR) is required for useful and timely screening of COVID-19 patients, which can be carried out in clinical samples like fibre bronchoscope brush biopsies, bronchoalveolar lavage, nasal swabs, pharyngeal swabs, sputum, blood and faeces [

Moreover, testing for COVID-19 requires travelling to a clinical setting that could lead to increased risk of disease transmission; hence a rapid, cheap, user-friendly, and sensitive diagnostic tool must be developed for use by ordinary people in their homes [

 <sup>®</sup>). There are several quick tests for detection of IgM and IgG, but they were not extensively validated, and results are not reliable.
