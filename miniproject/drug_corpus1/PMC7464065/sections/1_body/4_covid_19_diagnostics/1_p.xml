<p id="Par25">Several molecular diagnostics tests such as Real Time-PCR for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and Spike’s receptor binding domain, full genome analysis by next-generation sequencing (NGS), isothermal loop-mediated amplification of coronavirus (i-LACO), multiplex nucleic acid amplification, and microarray-based assays are in use currently for the laboratory confirmation of coronavirus infection [
