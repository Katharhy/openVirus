<p id="Par52">Recently, antigenicity, along with structure and function of spike glycoprotein, especially of linear epitope S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 has been evaluated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">183</xref>]. Neutralizing antibodies have been raised against the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 that cross-react and neutralize both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">183</xref>] hence, can be explored as candidates for subunit vaccines. Subunit vaccines have limitations of low immunity, the requirement of adjuvants, and sometimes inefficient protective immunity. In contrast, DNA and mRNA based vaccines are more accessible and quick to clinical trials, recombinant vaccines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR201">201</xref>]. Viral-vector based vaccines can be constructed and used without adjuvant. These vaccines are possible only when the antigens having neutralizing epitopes are explored [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR201">201</xref>]. Mutated SARS-CoV-2, especially with altered E protein, can be exploited as a recombinant vaccine as N protein is conserved across CoVs hence not a suitable vaccine candidate [
