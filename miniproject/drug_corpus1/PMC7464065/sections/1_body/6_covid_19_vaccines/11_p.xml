<p id="Par55">The speed of COVID-19 vaccine development under the influence of pandemic is remarkable as only in six months from the first release of SARS-CoV-2 sequences the vaccines enter clinical trials. In contrast, a typical of 3 to 9 years are required for the same [

However, the rapid pace should not interfere with the quality of vaccines, and a substandard vaccine must be avoided to be commercialized even under the extreme global demand and pressure.
