<p>Nearly all participants reported staying indoors and away from public places to avoid contracting COVID-19. Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref> shows the frequency of COVID-19 protective behaviors in the early days of the pandemic. Most participants had canceled plans, asked others to stay away, and avoided public transportation to mitigate their risk for contracting COVID-19. On average, participants had taken multiple steps to reduce their risks. However, there were gender differences in COVID-19 protective actions, with women more likely to stay indoors and away from public places than men. Consistent with this pattern, women also rated greater concern about contracting COVID-19 than men. Poisson regression indicated that participant gender, Wald χ

 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, predicted the number of COVID-19 protective behaviors practiced; women engaged in more protective behaviors than men (B = −0.255, se = 0.085, 95% confidence interval: −0.422 to −0.088), and greater concern was related to engaging in more protective behaviors (B = 0.006, se = 0.001, 95% confidence interval: 0.004 to 0.008). The remaining factors in the model were not significantly associated with COVID-19 protective behaviors: years of education, Wald χ

 <sup>2</sup> = 0.1, ns, and number of risks for COVID-19 severity, Wald χ
