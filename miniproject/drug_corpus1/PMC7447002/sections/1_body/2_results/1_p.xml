<p>Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows the participant demographic and health characteristics. Most participants demonstrated a history of underlying health risks for severe COVID-19. As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, half of participants did not know their CD4 cell count, an indicator of not being fully engaged in HIV care. Among those participants who did know their most recent CD4 cell count, more than 1 in 4 indicated CD4 cell counts under 350 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup>. In addition, 1 in 4 participants were not HIV suppressed and 1 in 3 tested positive for at least 1 underlying renal condition. Most participants were actively using substances, including 40% tobacco, 19% alcohol, 65% cannabis (THC), and 29% testing positive for other drugs.
