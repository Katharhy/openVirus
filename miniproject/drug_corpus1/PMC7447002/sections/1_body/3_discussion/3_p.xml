<p>The current findings should be interpreted in light of their methodological limitations. The sample for this study was one of convenience and cannot be considered representative of people living with HIV. Although large enough for the number of variables tested, the sample was relatively small. In addition, the sample was largely male and African American and therefore limited in its generalizability. In addition, we assessed substance use with biological testing and could not discern whether some drugs, particularly methamphetamine and cocaine, we smoked, with greater implications for complicating COVID-19. The study was undertaken in immediate response to the COVID-19 public health crisis, and our findings may be transient and specific to this time period. Although the results have implications for future spikes in COVID-19 outbreaks and potential future emerging infections, they may also be unique to this time period and this pandemic. Nevertheless, these findings have implications for managing HIV infection during the response to COVID-19.</p>
