<p>To determine HIV RNA concentrations (viral load), participants provided 80 ÂµL of fingerstick blood for dried blood spots collected in HemaSpot HF devices that were frozen before laboratory delivery. HIV-1 viral load testing was conducted using the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 assay, a reverse transcription PCR assay performed on the automated Abbott m2000 platform (Abbott Molecular Inc, Des Plaines, IL).

 </sup> The target sequence for the assay is the highly conserved pol/integrase region of the HIV-1 genome. The limit of detection of the assay is 2.92 log copies/mL, and it can quantify up to 7.0 log copies/mL.

 </sup> All samples required an upfront processing to improve assay sensitivity before subjecting to RNA extraction. Forty-nine (30%) participants were unable or unwilling to provide a blood sample and were given the option to provide a recent viral load test result obtained within 90 days of the assessment from a health care provider. Because HIV viremia indicates greater immune suppression, a detectable viral load was coded as an indicator of COVID-19 severity risk.
