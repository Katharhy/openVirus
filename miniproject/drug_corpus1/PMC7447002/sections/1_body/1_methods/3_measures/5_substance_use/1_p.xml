<p>Because any substance use is a known immune suppressant, we conducted a multipanel urine dip test to detect common drug use. The test strip uses a lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay for the qualitative detection of 12 drugs and drug metabolites (Redwood Toxicology Labs—Reditest-12). These tests are FDA approved and are reliable and valid for initial screening of drug use in the previous 72–96 hours. We considered THC as a separate marker because it is prevalent and its administration is typically smoked, posing specific risks for compromised lung function.

 </sup> For alcohol use, we used the 500 ng/mL cutoff for ethyl glucuronide from a separate dip test with detection of ethyl glucuronide up to 80 hours after drinking.
