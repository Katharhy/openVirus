<p>Participants reported whether they heard of the novel coronavirus/COVID-19, how much they had heard about it, whether they had been tested for COVID-19, and whether they had been diagnosed with COVID-19. We also asked participants whether they had engaged in 5 recommended actions to mitigate their risk for contracting COVID-19. All behaviors assessed were recommended by the US Federal Government and the state of GA to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 at the time the study commenced. The specific actions are shown in the results. We created an index of COVID-19 protective actions by summing the use/nonuse of the 5 behaviors. We also assessed participant concerns that they may contract COVID-19 using a 100-point rating scale in response to the question: “From 0 to 100, how concerned are you about catching the new coronavirus, with 0 = not at all concerned and 100 = extremely concerned.”</p>
