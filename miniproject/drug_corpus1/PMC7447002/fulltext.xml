In addition, indicators of renal disease that are commonly observed with HIV infection can lead to more severe COVID-19 outcomes.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Liu et al,<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> for example, found that COVID-19 severity is significantly greater in patients with urinary glucose and protein markers. Furthermore, conditions of poverty, particularly poor nutrition resulting from food insecurity, can impede immune functioning.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>Substance use also raises concerns for increased COVID-19 severity. Tobacco use, particularly cigarette smoking, is associated with COVID-19 severity,<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and tobacco use may interact with other substances to further compromise the immune system.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Alcohol and other drug use also suppresses immune responses,<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> particularly among people living with HIV.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Along with underlying health conditions, substance use raises concerns for COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in people living with HIV.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> High prevalence of substance use and co-occurring underlying health conditions have the potential to amplify the severity of COVID-19 in people living with HIV.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><p>The increased vulnerability for COVID-19 severity in people living with HIV shines a light on the necessity of adopting COVID-19 protective behaviors, avoiding public gatherings, reducing social contacts, and physical distancing. COVID-19 protective behaviors were recommended in early March 2020 as some states (eg, California, Washington, and New York) responded to the unfolding health crisis. By contrast and in the absence of a national COVID-19 strategy, the state of Georgia was late in response. On March 13, 2020, the US government declared a national state of emergency, and on March 15, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations to avoid social gatherings.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Initial reports from HIV clinical settings indicated the potential for interruptions in essential HIV care services.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Concerns have also been raised that stay-at-home orders and physical distancing could exacerbate what is already a high prevalence of food insecurity among people living with HIV.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p>Here, we report the results of a rapid-response interview with men and women living with HIV in Atlanta, GA, conducted at the start of the US COVID-19 epidemic. There were 2397 diagnosed cases and 12 deaths in the state of GA on March 17, 2020, and 20,058 diagnosed cases and 749 deaths 1 month later.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> During the final week of data collection for the current study, the 7-day average number of COVID-19 diagnoses in the state of Georgia was greater than 600, and the average daily deaths was greater than 25. More than 40% of cases and 40% of deaths in Georgia occurred in the Atlanta metro area. The City of Atlanta acted to issue orders for protective policies before the state government. On March 16, 2020, the Mayor of Atlanta issued a state of emergency, and on March 19, 2020, all nonessential businesses closed,<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> which remained in effect throughout the data collection period. We examined social responses to COVID-19 including physical distancing and reducing social contacts in response to the earliest public alerts. We specifically tested the association between COVID-19 protective actions and their impact on HIV-related care and treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants in the current study were men and women living with HIV in Atlanta, GA, who were between the ages of 20 and 37 years and screened positive for active substance use. The current sample was actively participating in an ongoing antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence study at the time of the COVID-19 outbreak.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Procedures</title><p>Participants were taking part in an 18-month longitudinal HIV treatment engagement and adherence study. Men and women living with HIV were recruited through social media websites, targeted online ads, and a participant-driven adaptation of snowball-sampling techniques. Specifically, participants were encouraged to refer their HIV-positive friends to the study and were offered a modest incentive for their efforts.</p><p>After informed consent, participants completed measures of demographic and health characteristics, including audio-computer&#x02013;assisted self-interviews, blood samples for HIV viral load testing, and urine samples for substance use testing and urinary health markers. After the baseline assessment, participants were contacted monthly to complete health care engagement and health behavior interviews. All interviews were conducted by telephone as part of the original study protocol using methods consistent with best practices for conducting remote research.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> During a 1-month period, median 9 months from baseline, participants due for their routine telephone interview completed questions regarding their experience with COVID-19.

We also administered the Centers for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale to assess symptoms of depression (alpha = 0.87) and the 3-item consumption subscale of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C).<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> To assess food insecurity, we used items adapted from the US Food Security Scale that have been validated in the past research and used by the US Census Bureau.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="s2-3-2"><title>History of COVID-19 Severity Risks</title><p>We constructed an unweighted index of 6 underlying health indicators for increased risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. The markers include HIV viremia, renal health markers, tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, and other drug use that were collected at the baseline assessment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-3"><title>HIV Viremia</title><p>To determine HIV RNA concentrations (viral load), participants provided 80 &#x000b5;L of fingerstick blood for dried blood spots collected in HemaSpot HF devices that were frozen before laboratory delivery. HIV-1 viral load testing was conducted using the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 assay, a reverse transcription PCR assay performed on the automated Abbott m2000 platform (Abbott Molecular Inc, Des Plaines, IL).<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> The target sequence for the assay is the highly conserved pol/integrase region of the HIV-1 genome. The limit of detection of the assay is 2.92 log copies/mL, and it can quantify up to 7.0 log copies/mL.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> All samples required an upfront processing to improve assay sensitivity before subjecting to RNA extraction. Forty-nine (30%) participants were unable or unwilling to provide a blood sample and were given the option to provide a recent viral load test result obtained within 90 days of the assessment from a health care provider. Because HIV viremia indicates greater immune suppression, a detectable viral load was coded as an indicator of COVID-19 severity risk.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-4"><title>Renal Health Markers</title><p>Urine specimens were collected and tested on site for 4 health markers: glucose, an indicator of diabetes or renal disease; leukocytes, an indicator of urinary system inflammation<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>; protein as indicative of kidney disease; and blood as an indicator of multiple disease processes.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> We used any positive urine health indicator as a marker for a potential underlying renal condition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-5"><title>Substance Use</title><p>Because any substance use is a known immune suppressant, we conducted a multipanel urine dip test to detect common drug use. The test strip uses a lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay for the qualitative detection of 12 drugs and drug metabolites (Redwood Toxicology Labs&#x02014;Reditest-12). These tests are FDA approved and are reliable and valid for initial screening of drug use in the previous 72&#x02013;96 hours. We considered THC as a separate marker because it is prevalent and its administration is typically smoked, posing specific risks for compromised lung function.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> For alcohol use, we used the 500 ng/mL cutoff for ethyl glucuronide from a separate dip test with detection of ethyl glucuronide up to 80 hours after drinking.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Finally, participants reported smoked tobacco products with items adapted from the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST).<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="s2-3-6"><title>Health Care and HIV Treatment</title><p>Telephone interviews assessed current HIV care engagement, treatment status, and ART adherence. Measures of health care engagement were adapted from the HIV Cost and Services Utilization Study consortium<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> and include attending and not attending scheduled care appointments. To assess ART adherence, we used the 3-item self-report instrument for retrospective adherence (IRA) developed and validated by Wilson et al.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> The items represent the number of days medications were taken over the previous 7 days, the frequency of taking medications as directed, and a self-perception rating of how well medications were taken over the previous week. We used methods suggested by Wilson et al to convert scores for each item on a scale of 0&#x02013;100 using linear transformations and calculating the mean to a single adherence score with a range from 0 to 100, interpreted as percent adherence over the past week (alpha = 0.73). Wilson et al<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> found that the IRA correlates 0.74 with electronically monitored ART adherence.

All behaviors assessed were recommended by the US Federal Government and the state of GA to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 at the time the study commenced. The specific actions are shown in the results. We created an index of COVID-19 protective actions by summing the use/nonuse of the 5 behaviors. We also assessed participant concerns that they may contract COVID-19 using a 100-point rating scale in response to the question: &#x0201c;From 0 to 100, how concerned are you about catching the new coronavirus, with 0 = not at all concerned and 100 = extremely concerned.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-8"><title>COVID-19 Interruptions to Care</title><p>We asked participants whether they had been unable to get the food they need, get to the pharmacy, and get their medicines in relation to their response to COVID-19.

Most participants were polysubstance users, demonstrated clinical indications of depression, and experienced food insecurity as severe as hunger. We found that all participants were aware of COVID-19 at the earliest days of response by their city officials. Nearly all participants were taking some steps to mitigate their risk for COVID-19. Their immediate response, however, exacerbated food insecurity, with more than 1 in 3 participants reporting difficulty accessing food, including individuals who were not previously food insecure reporting an inability to access food. COVID-19 protective behaviors also impeded their health care, created barriers to accessing medications, and disrupted social services. Similar impacts of COVID-19 on HIV care have been reported by others<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> and have implications for widening what are already entrenched HIV-related health disparities.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup></p><p>We also observed an unexpected significant increase in ART adherence over the 1 month of response to COVID-19. Participants may have improved their ART adherence out of health concerns or because they were home more, or possibly other reasons.<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> This positive change occurred despite interruption in accessing medications. It is possible that this increase in adherence is a blip and will subside, especially if barriers in accessing medications are not resolved. Nevertheless, the heightened and uncontrollable health concerns brought by COVID-19 may have motivated health behaviors for which individuals do have control, such as taking their medications. Monitoring ART adherence over the course of COVID-19 should be a priority in ongoing studies.</p><p>The current findings should be interpreted in light of their methodological limitations. The sample for this study was one of convenience and cannot be considered representative of people living with HIV. Although large enough for the number of variables tested, the sample was relatively small. In addition, the sample was largely male and African American and therefore limited in its generalizability. In addition, we assessed substance use with biological testing and could not discern whether some drugs, particularly methamphetamine and cocaine, we smoked, with greater implications for complicating COVID-19. The study was undertaken in immediate response to the COVID-19 public health crisis, and our findings may be transient and specific to this time period. Although the results have implications for future spikes in COVID-19 outbreaks and potential future emerging infections, they may also be unique to this time period and this pandemic. Nevertheless, these findings have implications for managing HIV infection during the response to COVID-19.</p><p>People living with HIV may be at increased risk for a more severe clinical course of COVID-19, and our sample demonstrated a history of multiple factors that would likely contribute further to their risks for greater severity of COVID-19. Of particular concern were high rates of HIV viremia, smoking,<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> other substance use,<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> and depression symptoms.<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> We found that at baseline 1-in-3 participants had evidence of a potential underlying renal condition. Of particular concern are 10% and 15% of participants testing positive for urinary glucose and protein, respectively, both of which are associated with COVID-19 severity.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> The accumulation of risk factors for severe COVID-19 among people living with HIV, who are already immune compromised, signals an urgent need to mitigate their exposure to SARS-CoV-2. We found that women engaged in more protective behaviors than men and that protective behaviors were associated with how concerned participants were about contracting COVID-19. However, there was no association between the number of underlying risks for severe COVID-19 and the number of protective actions taken. At the time of this study, public health messaging focused on increased COVID-19 risks for the elderly and people with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and immune suppression.<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Although people with HIV will recognize their increased risks due to an immune suppressive condition, the added burden of smoking and other substance use, as well as underlying conditions common to HIV infection, have not been included in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports of severe case outcomes and have not been included in public health messaging.<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> Patients should be fully informed of their risks for severe COVID-19 to understand the importance of long-term mitigation.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse Grant R01-DA033067.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no funding or conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="R1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Tang</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name></person-group>
