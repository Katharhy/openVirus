Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that have been presented as the causative agents of different clinical manifestations that range from a common cold to severe and great global public health concerns such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).

 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). However, an update on its clinical and laboratory presentations has reported fever, respiratory symptoms, cough, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, and breathing difficulties as the common presentations of the confirmed cases (
