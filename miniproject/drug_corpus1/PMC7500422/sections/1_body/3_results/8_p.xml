<p> Use of a numerical scale which coded as 0 (no smell/taste, significantly decreased quality of life) to 10 (full smell/taste, normal quality of life) showed that a significant number of patients still had smell and taste problems at the time of responding to the questionnaire; however, some improvements could also be noted (
