  <p>Our findings determined a significant linear correlation between the prevalence of COVID-19 and olfactory dysfunction. In an online survey, 76.24% of the participations reported a sudden onset of olfactory dysfunction. Findings of this study could lead to the worldwide awareness of researchers to conduct further clinical studies to find any correlation between disease severity and olfactory dysfunction to complete clinical manifestations of COVID-19.</p>
