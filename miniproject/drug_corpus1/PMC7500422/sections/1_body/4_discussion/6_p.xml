<p> There are some limitations to our study. As our data were collected via an online self-reported questionnaire, it was limited to the population who was literate and had access to the internet, personal computers or smart-phones, and were active in social networks. Another limitation of this study is that the participants had not been evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 test. As this was an online survey, the main goal was to confirm the outbreak of olfactory dysfunction during the COVID-19 epidemic.</p>
