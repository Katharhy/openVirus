<p> The recent outbreak of olfactory dysfunction following flu-like symptoms (75%), higher incidence in women (71%), and a high incidence of anosmia in family members (48.23%) are suggestive of a postviral epidemic olfactory dysfunction in Iran. Although our study could not establish that COVID-19 was the definite cause of olfactory dysfunction, there are no other recent viral epidemics in Iran except COVID-19. Thus, as the COVID-19 pandemic rises in parallel with olfactory dysfunction, it can be suggested that these 2 are intimately linked. However, later studies in patients with definite diagnosis of COVID-19 showed that olfactory dysfunction had a considerable prevalence in these patients (
