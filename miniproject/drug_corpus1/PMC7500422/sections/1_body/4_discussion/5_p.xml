<p> Although the exact pathophysiology of postviral anosmia is unclear, injury may happen at the level of the neuroepithelium of olfactory receptor cells in the nasal roof or in central olfactory routs. However, many studies have focused on the neuroepithelial changes in patients with postviral olfactory dysfunction because of the accessibility of the olfactory cleft. Various animal studies explained that different viruses could damage central olfactory routs and other regions of the brain (

In addition, central nervous system findings were a more significant form of neurological damage in patients with COVID-19. (
