<p> This cross sectional study was conducted on 10 069 cases in all provinces of Iran from March 12 to 17, 2020. Participants were cases with decreased (hyposmia) or loss of sense of smell (anosmia) during the past 4 weeks, who voluntarily responded to the online questionnaire via the internet (go.irimc.org/smelltest). The inclusion criteria were olfactory dysfunctions in responders within the 4 weeks of the start of COVID-19 epidemic in Iran. Specific groups in the populations were underrepresented because they had less access to the internet, personal computers, or smartphones, or were disable or illiterate to use the internet.</p>
