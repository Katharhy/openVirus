<p> An online questionnaire was developed by a board, including otolaryngologists and epidemiologists, from Ear, Nose, Throat and Head and Neck Surgery Research Center of Iran University of Medical Sciences with the cooperation of Iran Medical Council. The software incorporated into the website of Iran Medical Council for corona epidemics (www.corona.ir). The full online questionnaire, which is in Google document format (go.irimc.org/smelltest), contains 33 questions, of which 18 are about any changes in smell or taste and most of the related comorbidities, 13 about basic characteristics of participants (age, date of birth, gender, city of residence, medical history, habitual history, family history), and 2 multiple-choice questions about past medical history (asthma, diabetes, thyroid disease, hypertension, epilepsy, and Parkinsonâ€™s disease). Participants were asked to report their ability to smell and taste before and during the COVID-19 disease quantitatively via 10-point visual analogue scales.

For example, if participants mentioned that they had hyposmia but pointed to the zero in the Likert scale in the questionnaire, they were excluded from the analysis. To detect and omit duplicated entries, personal information (age, gender, and location) was compared before data analysis. Furthermore, to exclude incomplete responses to the questionnaire, the records with more than 30% missing data were deleted.
