<p> We encountered an outbreak of olfactory dysfunction in Iran during the COVID-19 epidemic, which correlates with the number of patients infected with COVID-19 all over the country. As olfactory dysfunction can affect the quality of life in affected patients, it needs to be assessed worldwide by further clinical studies to find pathogenesis, prognosis, and any correlation between disease severity and olfactory dysfunction. Also, we recommend that sudden onset of anosmia be considered in routine work-up and screening for COVID-19 infection.</p>
