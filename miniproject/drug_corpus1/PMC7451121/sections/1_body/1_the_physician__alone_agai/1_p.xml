<p id="par0020">The COVID-19 pandemic put the Frenchman Didier Raoult on the front page of all Western journals.

Consequently, he is criticised by physicians and scientists from many countries, starting in France because of his unorthodox approach and thinking. Despite this criticism it is now in national guidelines for the management of COVID-19 patients in Italy
