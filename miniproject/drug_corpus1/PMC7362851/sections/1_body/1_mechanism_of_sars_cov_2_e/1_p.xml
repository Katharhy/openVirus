<p id="para0003">The entry mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of SARS-CoV. Viral spike S glycoprotein has to be primed by the host cell proteases before binding with the receptors. The SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as the entry receptor.

 </xref> Viral entry is dependent on the S protein priming by host cell surface-associated transmembrane protease serine 2. In virus infectivity studies, SARS-CoV-2 could not enter the HeLa cells that did not express ACE2 proteins. The binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 S protein with ACE2 is 10-20 folds higher than that of SARS-CoV. The lung alveolar epithelial cells, heart, kidney, and enterocytes of the small intestine express ACE2 protein.
