<p id="para0004">Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) increases the blood pressure by converting the inactive angiotensin I to active angiotensin II which in turn binds with angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) to induce vasoconstriction. ACE2 is a counter-regulatory enzyme in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). It cleaves the angiotensin II into a potent vasodilating heptapeptide known as angiotensin 1-7.

 </xref> Binding of SARS-CoV spike protein to ACE2 in cell lines and SARS-CoV infections in animals reduced the expression of ACE2 protein. The acute lung injury (ALI) resulting from the SARS-CoV infection was shown to be mediated through the down-regulation of ACE2 in mice. ALI deteriorated after SARS-CoV spike protein administration in mice whereas, inhibition of the RAS rescued the animals. Lungs of SARS-CoV infected mice showed decreased ACE2 protein while ACE levels remained normal. ACE2 protected mice from ALI, while ACE and angiotensin II worsened it.
