 </xref> The mortality rate of COVID-19 has been high among older people and those with pre-existing comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension. Decreased levels of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 infections could predispose people to severe COVID-19 complications. Elevating the ACE2 levels in patients may protect them from the lung complications of COVID-19. Treatment with angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) antagonists and vitamin D supplementation may present a simpler and effective way of improving ACE2 levels safely among patients. This review elaborates on the idea of using AT1R antagonists and vitamin D for treating serious lung complications of SARS-CoV-2.
