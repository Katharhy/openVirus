<p id="para0008">Vitamin D has a negative regulatory role on the RAS. Suppression of RAS by AT1R antagonists results in a feedback-induced compensatory increase in renin. Vitamin D blocks the rise in renin at the transcriptional level when given in combination with a RAS inhibitor such as AT1R antagonists or ACE inhibitors.

 </xref> Renin is an enzyme involved in the production of angiotensin II. It converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, a precursor of angiotensin II. Inhibition of renin will decrease the levels of pro-inflammatory angiotensin II and alleviate lung injury. Vitamin D was effective in attenuating the lipopolysaccharide-induced ALI in rats by modulating the RAS. It inhibited renin, ACE and angiotensin II expression and induced ACE2 levels.

 </xref> With its inhibitory effect on renin, the simultaneous administration of vitamin D may complement the effect of AT1R antagonists (

 </xref> A retrospective study on Korean patients with ARDS showed that vitamin D deficiency was prevalent among them, and the serum levels correlated inversely with length of hospital stay and intensive care unit stay among in-hospital survivors.
