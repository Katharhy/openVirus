 </xref> In ACE2 deficient conditions, excessive angiotensin II causes increased vascular permeability, vasoconstriction, and inflammation in the lungs leading to ALI. ACE2 down-regulation by SARS-CoV infection was found in severe lung failure and was associated with mortality in SARS infection.

 </xref> Similarly, in SARS-CoV-2 infection, the ACE2 deficiency after the viral spike binding and the subsequent imbalance in the RAS may mediate the ALI. A recent study on the clinical and biochemical indexes of COVID-19 patients showed angiotensin II levels were markedly higher than healthy individuals and were linearly associated with the viral load and lung injury.
