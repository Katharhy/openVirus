<p id="para0007">As ACE2 protein protects the lungs, and COVID-19 patients have lower levels of ACE2, increasing the ACE2 level is likely to protect against SARS-CoV-2 induced lung injury. Therapeutic approaches to increase ACE2 levels may work as a good strategy in treating SARS-CoV-2 infections. AT1R antagonists can be used to increase ACE2 protein levels. ACE inhibitors are not preferred because they cause cough, a common adverse effect associated with their use. ACE2 being the target molecule of SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein, increasing its level may also increase the viral load. However, the European Society of Cardiology Council on Hypertension stated that there is no evidence supporting any harmful effect of ACE inhibitors in COVID-19 infections. It even hinted about the possible beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors while referring observations from animal studies.
