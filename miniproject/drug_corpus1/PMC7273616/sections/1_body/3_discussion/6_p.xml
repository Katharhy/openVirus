<p>Follow-up imaging has not yet been done to radiographically correlate therapeutic response to antifungal treatment. Differences may exist in the therapeutic response of the right upper lobe chronic cavitation as compared with the multiple ground-glass opacities. In CM, clinical resolution of symptoms typically occurs before radiographic resolution with antifungal therapy. Radiographic resolution may take months to years or not at all for coccidioidal cavitary lesions. Coccidioidal ground-glass opacities are usually more acute findings and subsequent resolution is anticipated earlier.</p>
