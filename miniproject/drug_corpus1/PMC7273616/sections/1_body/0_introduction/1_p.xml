<p>CoV-2 (coronavirus-2) is a worldwide pandemic with variable severity. Inevitably, the high frequency of this disease will coexist in individuals with many other disease entities. We recognize that individuals with chronic comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart failure have increased morbidity and mortality from CoV-2 infection. It has been noted that patients with CoV-2 may be coinfected with influenza and other respiratory viruses.
