<p id="Par4">SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA-enveloped virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. An RNA-based metagenomic next-generation sequencing approach has been applied to characterize its entire genome, which is 29,881â€‰bp in length (GenBank no. MN908947), encoding 9860 amino acids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Gene fragments express structural and nonstructural proteins. The S, E, M, and N genes encode structural proteins, whereas nonstructural proteins, such as 3-chymotrypsin-like protease, papain-like protease, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, are encoded by the ORF region [
