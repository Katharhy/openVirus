<p id="Par11">RBD situated in the S1 subunit binds to the cell receptor ACE2 in the region of aminopeptidase N. The S1 region contains the NTD and CTD, and atomic details at the binding interface demonstrate key residue substitutions in SARS-CoV-2-CTD. In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 S CTD binding interface has more residues that directly interact with the receptor ACE2 than does SARS-RBD (21 versus 17), and a larger surface area is buried with SARS-CoV-2 S CTD in complex with ACE2 than with SARS S RBD. Mutations of key residues play an important role in enhancing the interaction with ACE2.  F486 in SARS-CoV-2, instead of I472 in SARS RBD, forms strong aromatic–aromatic interactions with ACE2 Y83, and E484 in SARS-CoV-2-CTD, instead of P470 in SARS RBD, forms ionic interactions with K31, which leads to higher affinity for receptor binding than RBD of SARS-CoV (Fig.
