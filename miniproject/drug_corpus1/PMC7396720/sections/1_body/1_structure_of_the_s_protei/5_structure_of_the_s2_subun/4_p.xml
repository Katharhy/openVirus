<p id="Par16">RBD binds to ACE2, and S2 changes conformation by inserting FP into the target cell membrane, exposing the prehairpin coiled-coil of the HR1 domain and triggering interaction between the HR2 domain and HR1 trimer to form 6-HB, thus bringing the viral envelope and cell membrane into proximity for viral fusion and entry [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. HR1 forms a homotrimeric assembly in which three highly conserved hydrophobic grooves on the surface that bind to HR2 are exposed. The HR2 domain forms both a rigid helix and a flexible loop to interact with the HR1 domain. In the postfusion hairpin conformation of CoVs, there are many strong interactions between the HR1 and HR2 domains inside the helical region, which is designated the “fusion core region” (HR1core and HR2core regions, respectively).
