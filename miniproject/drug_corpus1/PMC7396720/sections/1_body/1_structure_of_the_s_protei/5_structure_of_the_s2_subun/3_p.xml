<p id="Par15">HR1 and HR2 are composed of a repetitive heptapeptide: HPPHCPC, where H is a hydrophobic or traditionally bulky residue, P is a polar or hydrophilic residue, and C is another charged residue [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. HR1 and HR2 form the six-helical bundle (6-HB) (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>), which is essential for the viral fusion and entry function of the S2 subunit [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. HR1 is located at the C-terminus of a hydrophobic FP, and HR2 is located at the N-terminus of the TM domain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The downstream TM domain anchors the S protein to the viral membrane, and the S2 subunit ends in a CT tail [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].
