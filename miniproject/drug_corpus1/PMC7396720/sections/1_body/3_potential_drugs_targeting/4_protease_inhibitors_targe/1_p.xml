<p id="Par32">SARS-CoV-2 entry requires cleavage of the S protein at the S1/S2 and S2 sites. Proteolysis by TMPRSS2 and cathepsin B and L plays an important role in priming SARS-CoV-2 S for entry. Camostat mesilate is a potent serine protease inhibitor of TMPRSS2. Utilizing research on the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 cell entry mechanism, it has been demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry can be blocked by camostat mesilate [

There are currently five clinical trials registered to evaluate the efficacy of camostat mesilate (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04321096, NCT04353284, NCT04338906, NCT04355052, NCT04374019). In addition, cathepsins in lysosomes are crucial for SARS-CoV entry via endocytosis. E-64d, an inhibitor of cathepsin L, blocks infection with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 PsV [
