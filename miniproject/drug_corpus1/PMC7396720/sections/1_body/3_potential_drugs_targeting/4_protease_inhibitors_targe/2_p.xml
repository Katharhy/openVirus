<p id="Par33">Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate 5-kinase (PIKfyve) is the main enzyme synthesizing PI(3,5)P2 in early endosomes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Apilimod, a potent inhibitor of PIKfyve35, can significantly reduce the entry of SARS-CoV S pseudovirus into 293/hACE2 cells via early endosomes in a dose-dependent manner [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Treating 293/hACE2 cells with another PIKfyve inhibitor, YM201636 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>], also had a similar effect. Moreover, a major downstream effector of PI(3,5)P2, two-pore channel subtype 2 (TPC2) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>], is important for SARS-CoV-2 entry, and tetrandrine (an inhibitor of TPC2) inhibits the activity of SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirus.
