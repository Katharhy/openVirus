<p id="Par27">The sequence and striking structural similarity between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV S proteins emphasize the close relationship between these two viruses, which provides the possibility to treat COVID-19 with antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV S protein [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Compared with SARS-CoV-2 RBD, SARS-CoV-2 interacts with hACE2 via the C-terminal domain (SARS-CoV-2-CTD), showing higher affinity for receptor binding. RBD can induce highly potent nAb responses and has the potential to be developed as an effective and safe subunit vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV S polyclonal antibodies obtained from immunized mice completely inhibited the invasion of SARS-CoV S-MLV (murine leukemia virus), whereas the invasion rate of SARS-CoV-2 S-MLV was reduced to ~10% [
