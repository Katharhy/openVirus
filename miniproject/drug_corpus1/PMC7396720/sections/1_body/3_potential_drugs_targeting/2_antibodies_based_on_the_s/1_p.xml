<p id="Par26">The S protein is the main antigen component in all structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Unlike other functional proteins of SAS-CoV-2, it is responsible for inducing the host immune response, and nAbs targeting the S protein can induce protective immunity against viral infection. Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, research on nAbs of SARS-CoV-2 mainly includes mAbs, antigen-binding fragments, single-chain variable region fragments, and single-domain antibodies (Nbs), which target S1 RBD, S1-NTD, or S2 regions to prevent S2-mediated fusion [
