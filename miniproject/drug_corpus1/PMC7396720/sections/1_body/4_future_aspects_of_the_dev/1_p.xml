<p id="Par35">The SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to the host cell receptor and induces virusâ€“cell membrane fusion, which plays a vital role in the process of virus invasion. Moreover, the high affinity between the S protein and ACE2 increases the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. Mammals including pangolins, pets (dogs and cats), and members of
