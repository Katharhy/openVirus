<p id="Par36">Structural information will also assist in evaluating mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and will help in determining whether these residues have surface exposure and map to known antibody epitopes of S proteins from other coronaviruses. In addition, structural knowledge ensures that the proteins produced by constructs are homogeneous and participate in the prefusion conformation, which should maintain the most neutralization-sensitive epitopes when used as a candidate vaccine or B-cell probe for isolating neutralizing human mAbs. Furthermore, atomic-level details will enable the design and screening of small molecules that inhibit fusion. Since SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBD domains share 75% amino acid sequence identity, future work will be necessary to evaluate whether any of these Abs neutralize newly emerged coronavirus. Overall, interaction between the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 should be further studied to contribute elucidation of the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similarly, focusing on high expression of the S protein or its receptor binding region is also of great significance for the development of vaccines.</p>
