<p>In this study, we achieved the characterization of various compounds, like flavonoids and other phenolic components extracted from lyophilized mulberry leaves and stem barks, from water and hydroalcohol extracts. Identification of mulberry leaves and stem bark constituents was carried out on the basis of the complementary information obtained from high-resolution mass spectrometry (ESI/QTOF). To the best of our knowledge, the list of the identified compounds is consistent with the one reported in the literature in the three cultivars analyzed. Our HRMS analysis revealed the presence of different polyphenolic compounds in the extracts, with coumarins, tannins, triterpenes, and flavonoids being the major ones. We further identified specific compounds found in the majority and in the most effective antiviral extracts, such as alkaloids (1-deoxynojirimycin), prenylated flavonoids (kuwanon G), and stilbenoids (mulberroside A).</p>
