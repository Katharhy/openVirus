<p>Considering HCoV 229E, the inhibition percentages of viral infectivity ranged from 34% to 36% for the aqueous stem bark extracts and from 37% to 45% for the hydromethanolic stem bark extracts. Hydromethanolic stem barks extracts of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> var 
 <italic>rosea</italic> led to production of the lowest HCoV 229E titer of 1.98 and inhibited viral infectivity down to 45%. With aqueous extracts, the highest inhibition percentage is 36% for
