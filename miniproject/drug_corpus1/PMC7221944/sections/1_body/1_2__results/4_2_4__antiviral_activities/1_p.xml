<p>Given that all the 
 <italic>Morus</italic> extracts were more active against the coronavirus, the antiviral activity of kuwanon G, present in the extracts, was evaluated on HCoV 229E. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01876-f003">Figure 3</xref> shows the CPE of HCoV 229E, after 72 h, on L-132 cells treated with several concentrations of kuwanon G. Concentrations of 0.1 and 1 Âµg/mL do not reduce the CPE, which remains respectively at 79% and 76% when the control (infected, nontreated cells) is 81%.
