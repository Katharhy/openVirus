<p>The drug concentrations needed to inhibit 50% of the viral CPE (EC50), as well as to induce 50% cell death (CC50), were determined in the 72-h assays. Kuwanon G antiviral activities (EC50) for the different MOI (0.01, 0.1, and 1) ranged from 0.11 ± 0.13 µg/mL to 0.56 ± 0.2 µg/mL and 5.61 ± 0.67 µg/mL, while the value obtained for CC50 was 9.45 ± 0.55 µg/mL. The resulting selectivity index (SI) (the ratio of CC50 to EC50) for kuwanon G was 86.73, 17.04, and 1.70, respectively (
