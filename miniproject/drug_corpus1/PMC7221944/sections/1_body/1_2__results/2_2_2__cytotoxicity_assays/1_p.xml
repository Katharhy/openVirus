<p>The results of in vitro cytotoxicity of the aqueous and hydromethanolic extracts are presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-01876-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. For hydromethanolic stem barks extracts, the CC50 ranged from 162.33 µg/mL (for 
 <italic>M. rubra</italic> extract) to 253.33 µg/mL (for 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> var. 
 <italic>alba</italic> extract). For hydromethanolic leaves’ extracts, the CC50 ranged, respectively, from 908.20 µg/mL (for 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> var. 
 <italic>rosea</italic> extract) to 1051.66 µg/mL (for 
 <italic>M. rubra</italic> extract). Aqueous stem barks’ extracts had CC50 ranged between 3166.00 µg/mL (for 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> var. 
 <italic>rosea</italic> extract) to 4330.33 µg/mL (for 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> var. 
 <italic>alba</italic> extract). Finally, leaves’ aqueous extracts of the three studied taxa had the same CC50 values, &gt;5000 µg/mL.
