 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01876-f001">Figure 1</xref> presents the cytotoxic effects of kuwanon G on L-132 cells and revealed that a concentration of 5 µg/mL does not induce a decrease in cell viability (99.19% compared to the control). However, cells viability decreases for higher concentrations and reaches 50% for a concentration estimated at 12 µg/mL.
