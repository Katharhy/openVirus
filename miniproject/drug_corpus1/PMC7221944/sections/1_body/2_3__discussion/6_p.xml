<p>The better inhibitions against the enveloped virus (HCoV 229E) than the nonenveloped viruses (PV 1, HPeV 1, HPeV 3, and Echo 11) suggest that the active components might inhibit the interaction between the binding sites of the virus to the host cells by inhibiting a ligand of the viral envelope. The interaction between the virus envelope and the extracts could be related to the binding of phytochemical phenolic compounds with the protein coat of the virus and the viral attachment to the host cells.</p>
