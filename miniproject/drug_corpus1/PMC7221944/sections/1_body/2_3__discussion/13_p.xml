<p>The exploration of the antiviral mechanisms of 
 <italic>Morus</italic> extracts and, particularly, of kuwanon G would need an in-depth molecular investigation like genome quantification, gene expression analysis, and protein expression. Further research on compounds like kuwanon G can result in a more potent inhibitor able to stop the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 strain of HCoV.
