<p>The 50% cytotoxic concentrations (CC50) of studied extracts of the three 
 <italic>Morus</italic> species were different between the aqueous and hydromethanolic extracts and between the leaves and stem barksâ€™ extracts. The fact that methanolic extracts seem to be more toxic indicates that the organic fraction may contain more cytotoxic compounds. Further analyses of the extracts could provide more information about these compounds.
