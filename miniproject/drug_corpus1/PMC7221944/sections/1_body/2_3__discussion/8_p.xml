<p>A number of medicinal plants have been reported to contain compounds possessing strong antiviral activity [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that two prenylated flavonoids, namely leachinone G and mulberroside C, from seven known compounds isolated from 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> root barks, were active principles for anti-HSV-1 activity, presenting 50% inhibitory concentrations of 1.6 μg/mL and 75.4 μg/mL, respectively [

Caffeic acid potentially inhibited the proliferation of HSV2 and adenovirus3 (ADV3) at, respectively, EC50 of 87.3 µg/mL and 14.2 µg/mL [

Chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid were potential inhibitors of hepatitis B virus multiplication, reducing the number of viral particles in the serum by blocking DNA synthesis [
