<p>Given the pressing need for new antiviral agents and the limitations of in vitro antiviral testing for such agents, the results of this screening were promising. The elucidation of the role of active constituents in the leaves and stem barks of 
 <italic>Morus spp</italic>. may provide useful leads in the development of antiviral therapeutics. The results of the present investigation provide further evidence of the importance of ethnopharmacology as a guide to the screening for biologically active plants materials in the context of new viral emergencies and resistances.
