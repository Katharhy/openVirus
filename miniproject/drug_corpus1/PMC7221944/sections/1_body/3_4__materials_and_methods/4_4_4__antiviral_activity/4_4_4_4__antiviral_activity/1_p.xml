<p>Prior to the antiviral tests, the cytotoxicity of kuwanon G was evaluated as described in 4.4.1. The tested concentrations ranged from 0 to 20 µg/mL. The results were calculated after 3 independent experiments, and 4 replicates for each concentration were tested. The cells were then incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. On the day of infection, dilutions of kuwanon G (Biosynth
 <sup>®</sup> carbosynth, CAS No 75629-19-5) from 0.1 to 10 µg/mL were prepared in the culture medium, containing 2% of FBS. These concentrations have been chosen according to the kuwanon G cytotoxicity assay. Cascade dilutions of the HCoV 229E virus were prepared for each kuwanon G dilution in order to test the virus at a multiplicity of infections (MOIs) equal at 1, 0.1, and 0.01, and wells were incubated with the virus/kuwanon G mix. Each test was reproduced in 8 identical wells. The plates were incubated for 72 h at 33 °C. The analysis of the wells was performed by microscopic observation of the cytopathogenic effect of HCoV 229E in the presence and absence of kuwanon G and after staining of the cell monolayers with crystal violet, as previously described.
