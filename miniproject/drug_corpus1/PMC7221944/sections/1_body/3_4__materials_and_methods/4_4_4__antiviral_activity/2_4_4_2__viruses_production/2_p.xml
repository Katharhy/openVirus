<p>For virus titration, the cells (10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) grown in 96-well tissue culture plates were incubated for 72 h at 33 Â°C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere with serial 10-fold diluted virus suspensions. Then, infected wells were recorded. Viral titers and CCID 50 (50% cell culture infectious doses) were calculated using the Reed and Muench method [
