<p>The viral titer and the inhibition percentage of the viral infection were determined as follows:
 <disp-formula>Ivi = [(VTuc − VTtc)/VTtc] × 100
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> with Ivi: inhibition percentage of the viral infection, VTuc: virus titer in the untreated control, and VTtc: virus titer in the treated control.
