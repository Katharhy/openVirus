<p>The antiviral activity of mulberry aqueous and hydromethanolic leaves and stem barks’ extracts were evaluated in vitro by the CPE method using 96-well flat-bottom tissue culture plates and a crystal violet (CV) staining test. In these assays, the concentrations used were 50 µg/mL for aqueous or hydromethanolic stem barks’ extracts and 200 µg/mL for aqueous or hydromethanolic leaves’ extracts. These concentrations have been chosen according to the cytotoxic assay and are much lower than the determined CC50 on the L-132 cells.</p>
