<p>All assay plates were incubated at 33 Â°C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere incubator for 72 h. All wells were then observed and scored for viral-induced CPE under an inverted light microscope and by the CV method, as previously described, to evaluate cell viability [

Briefly, the cells were fixed for 5 min with 3.7% of paraformaldehyde, then stained for 30 min with 0.1% of crystal violet in 1% ethanol. Finally, monolayers were washed 2 times with PBS; then, quantification of the cells was obtained by an absorbance measurement (540 nm) after dissolution in 100 microliters of 50% methanol in PBS. Cytopathogenic effect was calculated as a percentage of infected cells compared to noninfected control cells.
