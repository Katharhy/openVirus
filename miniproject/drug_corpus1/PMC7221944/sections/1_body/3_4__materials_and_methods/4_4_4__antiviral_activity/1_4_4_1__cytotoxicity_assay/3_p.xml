<p>The assays were performed in triplicate using 96-well flat-bottom tissue culture plates. One-hundred microliters of increasing concentrations from 9.76 to 5000 µg/mL of plant extracts were added to the monolayers of L-132 cells at 80% confluence. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. After 72 h, the supernatants were removed, and the wells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Ten microliters of MTT (5 mg/mL, in PBS) were added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Then, 100 µL of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (100 µg/mL, in PBS) were added to the wells to solubilize the MTT crystals. The plates were incubated for 4 h in 37 °C. The absorbance was read at 570 nm using a 96-well plate ELISA reader (MultiSkan GO, Thermo Scientific, Saint Herblain, France), and the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) was then calculated as previously described [
