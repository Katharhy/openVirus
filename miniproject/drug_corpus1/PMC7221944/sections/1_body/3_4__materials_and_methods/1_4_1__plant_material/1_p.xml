 <italic>rosea</italic>, and 
 <italic>Morus rubra</italic> leaves and stem bark were harvested during May 2011 from mulberry trees in Gabes Province (Southern Tunisia: 33°40′N, 10°15′E). The plant was identified and collected by Dr I. Thabti from the Arid Land Institute, Tunisia (Institut des Régions Arides: IRA), and voucher specimens (VS1-MAA2011, VS2-MAR2011, and VS3-MR2011) were deposited at the Herbarium of Arid Land Institute. Plant material was collected, immediately put in aluminum foil on ice and away from direct sunlight, and stored at −20 °C in the laboratory upon arrival. Then, the plant material was washed with distilled water and lyophilized. The dried materials were ground into powder with a blender and stored in an air-tight container at −20 °C until use.
