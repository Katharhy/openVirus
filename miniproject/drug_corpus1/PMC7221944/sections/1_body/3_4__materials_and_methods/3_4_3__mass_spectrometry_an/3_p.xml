<p>To quantify, we used an LC Systeme Advance 
 <sup>TM</sup> (Bruker Daltonics, Bruker, Bremen, Germany) coupled with an ESI-TQ Evoq 
 <sup>TM</sup> (Bruker Daltonics, Bruker, Bremen, Germany). The analytical column used was an InfinityLab Poroshell 120 EC-C18 column (50 mm × 30 mm) and eluted at a flow rate of 800 µL/min, using a gradient ranging from 5% solvent B to 99% solvent B in a time span of 40 min. Solvent A consisted of water with 1% of formic acid, and solvent B consisted of pure acetonitrile. Kuwanon G was detected by MRM mode at 20 eV with one quantifying transition 693 &gt; 203 and two qualifying transitions 693 &gt; 355 and 693 &gt; 421. LCMS control and data processing was performed by MS Workstation 8.2.1. (Bruker Daltonics, Bruker, Bremen, Germany, 2016).
