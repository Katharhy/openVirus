<p>For identification, the LC system consisted of an U3000-Dionex apparatus (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with an injector comprising a 5-µL loop. Two microliters of sample were injected. The analytical column used was an HILIC mixed mode-1 (100 mm × 2.1 mm) and eluted at a flow rate of 200 µL/min using a gradient ranging from 98% solvent B to 80% solvent B in a time span of 40 min. Solvent A consisted of water with 10-mM ammonium acetate, and solvent B consisted of pure acetonitrile. The ESI-HRMS was a microTOFQ
 <sup>TM</sup> (Bruker Daltonics, Bruker, Bremen, Germany) apparatus. The LC coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (ESI/QTOF, Bruker Daltonics, Bruker, Bremen, Germany) was used in order to determine the accuracy mass of compounds in the sample extracts. The identification of compounds was performed by comparing the measured molecular mass with the calculated values ± 10 mDa. The analysis was performed in positive mode, and the compound was confirmed by auto-MSMS experiment when the intensity was higher than 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>. This system was able to detect the compounds in amounts lower than 1 µg/mL. We used a compass for the otof series 1.7 software (Bruker Daltonics, Bruker, Bremen, Germany, 2013), including otof Control 3.4, for acquisition and DataAnalysis 4.2 for data processing.
