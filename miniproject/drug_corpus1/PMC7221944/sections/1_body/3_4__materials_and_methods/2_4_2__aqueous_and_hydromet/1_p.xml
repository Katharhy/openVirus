 <italic>alba</italic>, 
 <italic>Morus alba</italic> var. 
 <italic>rosea</italic>, and 
 <italic>Morus rubra L.</italic> were extracted with 100-mL water/methanol and 50/50 (MeOH 50%) in a water bath at 80 °C for 15 min. The same amount (3 g) of lyophilized leaves and stem barks were extracted with water. Respective MeOH 50% and aqueous phases were filtered and concentrated under vacuum to give the crude extracts, which were lyophilized and stored at −20°C prior to experimentation.
