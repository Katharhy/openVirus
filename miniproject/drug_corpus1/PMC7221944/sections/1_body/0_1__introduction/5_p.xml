<p>For centuries, Asian populations, especially Chinese populations, traditionally used

 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Consequently, the different parts of the plant have been studied for potential biological activities [

 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Several chemical families have been isolated in 
 <italic>Morus</italic> species, like flavonoids, benzofurans, stilbene, polyhydroxylated alkaloids, and kuwanons, showing a large variety of pharmacological activities. For example, flavonoids and oxyresveratrol showed anti-inflammatory activities, while mulberrofuran showed antibacterial activities against pathogens like 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. The group of kuwanons (isoprenylated flavonoids) include various compounds like kuwanon C, E, G, H, J, and S, which exhibit distinct biological activities. Indeed, kuwanon G showed antibacterial activities against 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> and methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> at 12 Âµg/mL (minimal inhibition concentration) [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Kuwanon C has shown an antifungal activity against 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and
