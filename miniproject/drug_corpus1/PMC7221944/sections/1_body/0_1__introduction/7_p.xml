<p>In this context, 
 <italic>Morus</italic> species show a good pharmacological potential against several pathologies, including emerging viruses. Considering the needs of new therapeutic strategies against pathogenic respiratory viruses like coronaviruses and picornaviruses, this study proposes to evaluate the potential activity of aqueous and hydromethanolic extracts from the stem barks and leaves of three different species of mulberry—
 <italic>Morus alba</italic> var. 
 <italic>alba</italic>, 
 <italic>Morus alba</italic> var. 
 <italic>rosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>Morus rubra</italic> on human coronavirus 229E and four different members of the 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> family—human poliovirus 1, human parechovirus 1 and 3, and human echovirus 11. The study was further extended to the analysis of the phytochemistry profiles of the plants by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC–MS) and the quantitative investigation by GC–MS.
