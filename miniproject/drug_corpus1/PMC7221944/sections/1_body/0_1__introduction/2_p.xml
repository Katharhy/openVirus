<p>Viral respiratory infections cause life-threatening diseases in millions of people worldwide every year. Human coronaviruses and several picornaviruses are responsible for regular worldwide epidemic outbreaks, thus representing a growing global public health problem. For instance, picornavirus infections are the most common infections identified in patients of all ages, and during peak season, picornaviruses cause 82% of all episodes of acute nasopharyngitis [

Among these viruses, enteroviruses like poliovirus 1 (PV1), human echoviruses, and parechoviruses share common features—they are small (20–30 nm), nonenveloped, positive single-stranded RNA viruses, causing mild respiratory diseases; however, HPeV type 1 and 3 (HPeV1 and 3) and echovirus 11 (Echo 11) can cause severe systemic diseases in young infants [

Structurally different, human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are bigger (120–160 nm), enveloped, positive single-stranded RNA viruses responsible for a large portion of upper and mild respiratory tract infections, like the common cold, bronchitis, or pneumonia. They have been isolated worldwide. Most established coronaviruses exhibit winter seasonality, with global geographical distributions of the documented cases [

They also can be severe and deadly for newborns, young infants, elderly, or immunosuppressed patients and can be associated with high rates of mortality. Indeed, no treatments, nor vaccines, are available against HCoVs, and the existing treatments are essentially symptomatic. Few new molecules show an interest in this context (i.e., glycyrrhizin and nelfivanir) [
