<p>Studies exploring the antiviral activities of 
 <italic>Morus</italic> extracts are less numerous despite a confirmed potential. Indeed, mulberry juice reduces the cytopathogenic effect of murine norovirus 1 (MNV-1) and feline calicivirus FCV-F9 [

 <italic>Morus</italic> cortex are described like replication inhibitors of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Scientific literature also describes kuwanons (among others chemical structures found in 
 <italic>Morus</italic> spp.) as potentially antiviral. Indeed, the authors of [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] reported kuwanon H as a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) inhibitor, leachianone as a human simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV 1 and 2) inhibitor, and three flavonoids as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and adenoviruses inhibitors [

 <xref rid="B4-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Other kuwanons, like kuwanon G, a prenylated flavon, have been studied for several biological properties, like anti-inflammation activity, anti-oxidant, and antibacterial activities [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Though the bioactivity of kuwanon G is evident, no antiviral activity has yet been described for this compound.
