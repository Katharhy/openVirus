<p id="Par26">The management of chronic HEV infection in immunocompromised requires careful assessment of risks and benefits. The first-line management option in such cases is to boost immune response either by reducing the dose of immunosuppressant or initiating antiretroviral therapy along with HEV RNA monthly monitoring for 3 months [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>•]. This the preferred approach and is successful in nearly 33% of patients but must be balanced against the possibility of solid organ rejection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. In case the risks of reducing immunosuppressants outweigh the benefits, or the first-line option fails, oral ribavirin is the drug of choice, usually administered initially for a period of 3 months. In a retrospective study analyzing the efficacy of ribavirin among 59 transplant patients with chronic hepatitis E, drug ribavirin administered in a median dose of ~ 8.1 mg/kg for 3 months led to a sustained virological response in 78% patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Sustained virological response is defined as undetectable serum HEV RNA at 6 months after stopping ribavirin. A fall in HEV RNA ≥ 0.5 log 
 <sub>10</sub> copies/ml on day 7 of ribavirin is said to be a predictor of sustained virological response [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. However, the study did not show any difference in sustained virological response between those treated for ≤3 months from those treated for &gt; 3 months [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Hence, patients with solid organ transplants who fail to clear HEV RNA within 3 months can be considered for ribavirin treatment. Moreover, the patients who relapsed exhibited sustained virological response after treatment with ribavirin for 6 more months [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Though the exact dose and duration of ribavirin therapy for chronic HEV infection is not defined, treatment courses of 3 to 6 months are typically used. Since chronic hepatitis E patients frequently suffer from anemia and kidney disease and ribavirin pharmacokinetics depend on kidney function, the dose and duration of the therapy must be adjusted according to hemoglobin and eGFR levels in these patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. EASL recommends treating patients with chronic HEV and glomerular diseases with antivirals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>••]. Also, ribavirin resistance is now being reported with increasing frequency in patients with chronic hepatitis E due to G1634R mutation in RNA polymerase [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. In an in vitro system, ribavirin shows a synergistic effect with mycophenolate, which is an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor in depreciating HEV RNA replicative machinery; however, no such evidence has been found in vivo till date [
