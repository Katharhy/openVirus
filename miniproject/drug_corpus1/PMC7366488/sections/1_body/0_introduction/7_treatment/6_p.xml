<p id="Par28">Interferon α (IFNα) is another therapeutic option for chronic hepatitis E and has shown efficacy in achieving a sustained virological response in patients with liver transplants and hemodialysis [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. However, IFNα is contraindicated in patients with transplant recipients due to the risk of acute rejection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Limited evidence exists for the treatment of chronic HEV infection in HIV or hematological disease with IFNα, ribavirin, or both, which could form the template for further research and clinical trials to determine the dose, route, and efficacy of available treatment options. In a case report, corticosteroids were associated with biochemical recovery in patients with HEV infection and may prevent the progression of severe hepatitis to liver failure [
