<p id="Par24">In recent years, ribavirin has gained some spotlight in the treatment of HEV infection. Ribavirin, a prodrug, is a guanosine analog and when metabolized acts as a nucleotide analog to deplete intracellular guanosine triphosphate and, subsequently, RNA replication. It has also been postulated that ribavirin acts by inhibiting viral replication and has a role in immune modulation, increased expression of interferon stimulation genes, and mutagenesis [

Limited evidence with ribavirin suggests a rapid improvement in liver enzyme profile and a decline in HEV RNA levels in patients with HEV genotype 1 and 3 infections. However, its usage in patients with severe acute hepatitis E is based upon anecdotal evidence only.
