<p id="Par21">Viral capsid antigen can be detected in the blood of those infected with HEV even before the patient becomes clinically symptomatic and persists for approximately 4Â weeks. Testing for capsid antigen is technically less demanding and can be performed even without molecular detection laboratories. It can be detected using an indirect sandwich enzyme immunoassay, with an estimated sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 100% [
