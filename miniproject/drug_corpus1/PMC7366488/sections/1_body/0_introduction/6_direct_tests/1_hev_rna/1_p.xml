<p id="Par14">HEV RNA detection in blood or stool is the gold standard for the detection of HEV infection. It becomes detectable even before the patient becomes clinically symptomatic and may persist for nearly 4 weeks in the blood and 6 weeks in the feces [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>•]. Most commercially available assays for detecting HEV RNA are based upon NAT. These NAT-based assays include reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time PCR, and loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The real-time RT-PCR methods are more sensitive than nested RT-PCR methods [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. These methods employ amplification of specific genome sequences mostly ORF3, followed by a nucleotide probe [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Characterization of HEV genotypes or subgenotypes is mostly used for epidemiological purposes, and their clinical significance is yet to be determined. Even though it is the most specific method of establishing HEV infection, its utility is mostly limited by high cost, the requirement of specialized tools and expertise, and limited resources in areas with a high burden of the disease. Subject experts and gastroenterologists have suggested HEV RNA testing in the following clinical scenarios [
