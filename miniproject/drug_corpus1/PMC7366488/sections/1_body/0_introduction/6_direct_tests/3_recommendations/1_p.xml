<p id="Par22">Experts suggest testing for anti-HEV IgM initially for suspected HEV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>â€¢]. A positive test suggests recent or active infection, after which HEV RNA analysis can be done for molecular characterization, while negative test results rule out the disease. The recommended algorithm differs slightly in immunocompromised patients considering the weakened immune response that develops in these patients. Patients who test negative for IgM anti-HEV should be tested for HEV RNA. Positive results for either HEV RNA or anti-HEV IgM confirms recent or active infection, but negative results for both the tests are required to rule out a disease. Also, since immunocompromised patients are at high risk of developing chronic HEV infection, HEV RNA testing in both blood and stools must be done to determine viral clearance before the patient is declared free from infection.
