<p id="Par31">Currently, the management of HEV infection in pregnancy is mainly supportive. The use of ribavirin and PEGylated IFNα among pregnant women with HEV has not been explored due to the high risks of teratogenicity. In recent times, the increasing interest in sofosbuvir for HEV in pregnancy is something to look out for, since it is a pregnancy category B drug [

Also, termination of pregnancy is useful in immunologically mediated liver failures in pregnancy such as HELLP syndrome and acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP). Currently, there is no evidence of any therapeutic benefit of termination of pregnancy in HEV-induced ALF. EASL recommends treatment of HEV genotypes 1 and 2 infections during pregnancy in high-dependency units and prompt transfer to Liver Transplant Unit if liver failure develops [
