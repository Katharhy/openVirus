<p id="Par29">HEV infection in pregnancy caused by genotypes 1 and 2 in developing countries has been associated with poor fetal-maternal outcomes as compared to the relatively benign course of illness in the Western world where infections are more commonly caused by genotypes 3 and 4 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>•]. Data from our previous study shows HEV infection to have a higher incidence, severe and aggressive course of illness, and poor outcomes during pregnancy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. In pregnant women, HEV was the leading cause of acute viral hepatitis and acute liver failure accounting for 80.36% (442/550) and 73.38% (102/139) of cases, respectively. HEV-related liver infection accounted for 98/129 (75.96%) death cases, whereas non-HEV liver infection accounted for 31/129 (24.04%) death cases in comparison among pregnant women. The course of illness is worse if the infection is acquired in the third trimester of pregnancy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>•]. Maternal mortality varies from 15 to 25% for genotype 1 infection acquired in the third trimester [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Life-threatening complications of ALF viz. coagulopathy, DIC, encephalopathy, and cerebral edema can be seen in 70% of HEV-infected pregnant women [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. An interesting study from Egypt showed high anti-HEV prevalence (84.3%) among pregnant women, but many of them never recalled an episode of viral hepatitis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. The differences in severity and prognosis in the different parts of the world could be accounted for by infections caused by different genotypes, differences in the rates of childhood infections, healthcare facility, and maternal nutritional state.
