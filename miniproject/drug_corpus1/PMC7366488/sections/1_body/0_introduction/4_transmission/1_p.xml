 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>••]. Undercooked or raw pork meat, liver, and infected cow’s milk are some known sources of HEV infection in these regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>•]. Though relatively less common, person to person transmission of HEV is also known. It occurs through transfusion of blood, blood products, solid organ transplant, and via vertical transmission [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>•]. Many other European nations, China, and Japan have reported cases of transfusion-transmitted HEV caused by genotypes 3 and 4 predominantly [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Vertical transmission of HEV causes adverse effects on fetus including intrauterine demise or neonatal mortality. Khurro et al. first demonstrated evidence of vertical transmission in 5 out of 8 babies in mothers who developed HEV infection during the third trimester [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In another study, Kumar et al. demonstrated 100% transmission rates from HEV-infected mothers to fetus [
