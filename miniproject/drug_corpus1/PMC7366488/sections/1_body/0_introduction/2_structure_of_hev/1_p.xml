<p id="Par5">HEV is a member of the Orthohepevirus genus and belongs to the Hepeviridae family. It is a small, non-enveloped 27â€“34-nm diameter particle with an icosahedral capsid. The virus was first isolated in the 1980s, from stool suspension of HEV-infected patients, and the excreted form of HEV in stool was found to be non-enveloped [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The virus gets enveloped in the membrane obtained from the host cell [
