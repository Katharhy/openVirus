<p id="Par6">The virus genome is 7.2 kb, linear, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA, with a 7-methylguanine cap at 5′ end, 3 open reading frames, namely, 
 <italic>orf 1–3</italic>, in between and a poly adenine tail at the other end. ORF 1 is responsible for encoding nonstructural proteins, responsible for RNA replication including RNA helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. ORF2 encodes structural proteins responsible for viral capsid formation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These structural proteins represent antigenic sites against which immune response can develop, hence are potential antigens for vaccine development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. ORF3 protein is found in blood-borne enveloped HEV particles only, responsible for viral replication, survival, and extrusion from the host cell [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].
