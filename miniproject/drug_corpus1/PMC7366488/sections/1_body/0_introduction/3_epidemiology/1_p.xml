<p id="Par7">HEV infection occurs throughout the world but predominantly is associated with waterborne outbreaks in Asia and Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. There are seven genotypes of HEV, viz. HEV 1–7, but only a single serotype. HEV 1–4 are known to infect humans, while HEV 5–7 have animals as their host only. There are two different epidemiological patterns of HEV. HEV genotypes 1 and 2 cause outbreaks, mostly in hyperendemic regions of the world. Mostly young adults are affected, and the disease is particularly troublesome for pregnant women who develop a very severe form of the disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>••]. Genotype 1 causes outbreaks in Asia (south, southeast, and central) and North Africa while genotype 2 is usually located in Mexico and western parts of Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>•]. Using epidemiological tools and mathematical models, it has been estimated that HEV 1 and HEV 2 cause together approximately 20.1 million (95% credible interval 2.8–37.0 million) cases in Asia and Africa, with acute hepatitis E accounting for 3.4 million cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. HEV infection is also estimated to cause 70,000 deaths from acute liver failure and ~ 3000 stillbirths [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In the developed parts of the world, such as Europe, the USA, and some high-income areas in Asia, the infection is predominantly caused by HEV 3 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>•]. HEV 4 usually causes infection in China and Japan [
