<p id="Par11">The diagnosis of HEV infection can be established through direct or indirect testing. The direct tests aim to detect either HEV ribonucleic acid (RNA) or viral capsid antigens in the blood. Since they detect parts of the viral particles itself, the specificity of these tests is usually high, but sensitivity is low. The indirect tests are based upon human immune response against HEV particles, i.e., anti-HEV antibodies. Hence, these tests usually have high sensitivity but low specificity. A summary of available tests for HEV infection is represented in Table
