<p id="Par12">The indirect tests for HEV rely upon the human immune response to generate antibodies against antigenic proteins of HEV. The antigenic proteins used in the assays are recombinant ORF2 and/or ORF3 protein of viral capsid, from HEV 1 genotype [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Both IgM and IgG types of antibodies can be detected in these patients; however, the performances and validity of both assays are under question [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. IgM anti-HEV antibodies develop nearly 4 weeks after the infection and can be detected in the sera for nearly 6 months, hence indicating an acute or recent infection from HEV. IgG antibodies usually also develop simultaneously with IgM antibodies early after the infection and last for years, indicating either a recent or past infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The utility of these assays is limited by their non-standardization and discordance between different kits. Sometimes, in a subset of the infected population, both IgM and IgG antibodies may be negative in HEV RNA-positive patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Also, these antibodies may wane with time, thus limiting their role for diagnostic and epidemiological purposes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In a study by Abranavel et al., the specificity of IgM anti-HEV was ≥ 99.5% while the specificity of IgG anti-HEV was 89.5% and 97.8% for two different diagnostic kits [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The testing kits for the detection of IgM antibodies had a higher sensitivity of 80–90% in immunocompetent while it was lower among immunocompromised patients viz. 85–87.5% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The sensitivity of IgG detection kits among immunocompetent patients was 80–90% while it fell dramatically to 15–45% in immunocompromised patients, rendering the test practically useless [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Also, there was no correlation between HEV RNA levels and IgG anti-HEV antibody levels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The limits of detection of various anti-HEV IgG detection kits available commercially worldwide vary from 0.25 to 2.5 World Health Organization (WHO) units per ml. Using assays with a lower detection limit of 0.25 WHO units per ml gives a more elaborate estimation of the prevalence of HEV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. National Institute for Biological Standards and Control established the WHO reference reagent for HEV detection kit. Experts have suggested that waning anti-HEV IgG antibody levels after the natural course of disease or vaccination could pose a risk for reinfection [
