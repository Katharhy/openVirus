<p id="Par9">European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) recommends considering HEV infection as a cause of viral hepatitis and as an important differential diagnosis to drug-induced liver injury in all patients [

Certain population groups like pregnant women, immunocompromised-like malignancy, and people on immunosuppressants are at high risk for devastating liver disease from HEV infection. Hence, it is imperative to test them upon suspicion of viral hepatitis. EASL recommends testing for HEV during flares up of chronic liver disease and immunocompromised patients or blood recipients with abnormal LFTs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>••]. In many countries around the world, either universal screening of blood or targeted screening for the high-risk recipient is being done. EASL recommends screening blood donors for HEV by nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT) [

EASL recommends testing for HEV as a causative agent for neuralgia amyotrophy and Guillain-Barre syndrome and suggested testing for encephalitis/myelitis [
