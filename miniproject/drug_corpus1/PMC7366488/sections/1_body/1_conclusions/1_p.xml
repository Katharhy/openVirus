<p id="Par34">Hepatitis E virus leads to outbreaks in developing countries and causes significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised and pregnant females. Our knowledge of HEV infection has increased dramatically over the past 20 years. A combination of serology and NAT is the recommended testing strategy for suspected patients. Further research into therapeutic options for treating hepatitis E infection is the need of the hour. Oral ribavirin is the initial drug of choice for severe acute hepatitis, acute-on chronic liver failure, and chronic hepatitis E. PEGylated interferon α can be used for ribavirin-resistant liver transplant patients with chronic hepatitis E. However, no further treatment option is available for immunocompromised organ transplant patients who fail initial ribavirin therapy. Sofosbuvir shows promise as antiviral in immunocompromised patients with chronic hepatitis E, but more evidence would be needed before being considered as a reliable therapeutic option in ribavirin-resistant patients. There is no available treatment option for HEV infection during pregnancy, which takes a very stormy course sometimes. Our further focus should be on finding appropriate management options for HEV infection during pregnancy and for ribavirin-resistant infections.</p>
