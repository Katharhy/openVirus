Synthesis</div> <p id="par0005">The specific milestones and benchmarks included in this note for optimal transition out of the epidemic are estimates based on our current knowledge. However, the epidemic is evolving rapidly, and our understanding of the best responses is also likely to evolve. The set of tasks described here will need to be updated and refined as facts, new context and additional information about the epidemic become available.</p> <p id="par0010">The single focus on combating COVID-19 should no longer ignore other health implications of the current situation, such as mental health problems, domestic violence and lack of access to preventive care and/or treatment for chronic diseases, as well as economic or ethical considerations. The aim of this document is to propose to decision-makers the minimum criteria for moving away from our dependence on general confinement and distancing as the main current tool for controlling the spread of the epidemic. For this, we need: </p><ul> <li><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">â€¢</span><p id="par0015">better data to identify the areas of spread and the rate of exposure and immunity in the population;</p> </li> <li><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">â€¢</span><p id="par0020">improved capacity of health care systems for early identification of epidemics, containment of cases and availability of adequate medical supplies;</p> </li> <li><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">â€¢</span><p id="par0025">therapeutic, prophylactic and preventive approaches and better organized medical actions that provide the necessary tools to protect and treat the most vulnerable (elderly, overweight, obesity, diabetes, immune deficiency, etc.) and/or those most affected by the disease.</p> </li> </ul> <p /> <div class="objectiveofphasei:toslowthespreadofthedisease" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Objective of phase I: to slow the spread of the disease</div> <p id="par0030">This is the phase implemented in March of 2020 to respond to an epidemic that has grown in magnitude. To slow the spread during this period, schools are closed, workers are invited to work at home when possible, and gathering places are closed. This was the only strategy applicable once the epidemic had reached a level that was not compatible with stopping it by simply confining the patients detected as being affected (cf. South Korea).</p> <p id="par0035">Four simultaneous criteria were introduced for the transition to the next phase II of partial deconfinement (<a href="#fig0005">Fig. 1</a> ).<a href="#fn0005">1</a></p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 1</span></a></div>   <p>Triggers for the transition from phase I to phase II.</p>   </div> <p /> </div> <div class="objectivesofphaseii:partialdeconfinement" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

However, some distancing and containment measures will still be required to prevent the resumption of transmission. For those at increased risk of infection, it will be important to strictly limit the time spent away from home. As a first step, the public will be asked to limit gatherings and to wear masks outside to reduce the risk of asymptomatic spread. Sick people will be encouraged to isolate themselves and be tested. Testing should become more widespread and common as diagnoses themselves become more common, while recognizing the difficulties of doing so.</p> <p id="par0065">In this phase II, the development of therapeutics will have to be accelerated, the scientific community mobilized in a coordinated way for priority actions in biology and health research and digital tools used on a large scale, in particular from the large existing health databases (CNAMâ€¦).</p> <p id="par0070">A return to the previous phase I of slowing down the epidemic, locally or globally, could be indispensable in the event of uncontrolled difficulties.

To begin to adjust distancing measures while maintaining barrier gestures</div> <p id="par0330">General distancing precautions should always be the norm during phase II, including teleworking (as much as possible), maintaining hand hygiene, wearing a mask when away from home, regular disinfection of frequently contacted surfaces, and initially limiting social gatherings to fewer than 50 people (or 20 or another number to be delimited). These recommendations should be complemented by technological solutions to assess distancing behaviour and adapt risk messages as appropriate. This could be done through partnerships with the private sector, taking care to preserve individual lives and avoiding coercive means to encourage compliance.</p> <p id="par0335">To reopen cautiously the country which is about to create the most freedom through a modest opening of society. For example, it might be a good idea to start by letting the smallest children go to school so that their parents can return to work. It may also be a matter of deciding where the public sectors that are considered the most important can be opened up as a matter of priority. As children return to school or daycare (i.e., in places with high attendance) and people return to densely populated workplaces, those in charge of these institutions must continue to implement physical distancing measures for schools, which for the smallest children will require an organizational effort, and for businesses.</p> <p id="par0340">The French authorities could also follow the example of the Danish Prime Minister, who is considering that his countrymen have to work, educate and go to school at different times of the day, outside of regular business hours.

Through effective development strategies and early investments in commercial scale manufacturing, an effective therapy could quickly receive a Transitional Use Exemption (TUE) or a Marketing Authorization (MA) as early as the summer or fall, if tests show that it meets either of the standards set out in the legislation for these two provisions, and even more quickly if it is a repositioned drug.</p> <p id="par0395">Treatments can have two different purposes, be directed against the virus or against the pathophysiological consequences of its contamination: </p><ul> <li><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">â€¢</span><p id="par0400">against the virus, several attempts are underway to limit its replication by action on its membrane receptor, the capsid proteins reacting with this receptor, its replication enzymes as polymerases and protease, or against virions by specific monoclonal or polyclonal neutralising antibodies or by interferon;</p> </li> <li><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">â€¢</span><p id="par0405">against the physiopathological consequences of the viral infection, the therapeutics are of two orders: some fight the cytokine storm, as antibodies against interleukin-1, other cytokines, or against their receptors (in particular IL6, IL1, TNF, and complement factor inhibitors), others facilitate oxygen transport or limit the risk of thrombosis (anticoagulants);</p> </li> </ul> <p /> <p id="par0410">At a minimum, the optimal treatment profile that will influence the risk of future spread is one that significantly reduces the risk of death or serious illness and possibly prevents the onset or worsening of symptoms in exposed individuals.

Guidelines should be transparent and explain the rationale for priorities, with a phased approach that expands to other priority groups as vaccine availability increases.</p> <p id="par0650">Mass immunization or therapeutic distributionÂ â€"Â when supply is abundant. The government should create a national plan on how mass immunization will be carried out throughout the country. This plan should determine who will administer the vaccines, where the vaccines will be offered, and how data on the number of vaccinations will be collected, as well as any adverse effects of the vaccine. Compensation to vaccine developers and manufacturers should also be considered.</p> <p id="par0655">Global implementation of vaccines and mass vaccination. France must continue to work with WHO and global vaccine organizations such as GloPID-R, CEPI and Gavi, coordinating their efforts and stimulating research on innovative vaccines (phase 1), as well as with national leaders and industry to (a) develop vaccines (b) test them (c) produce them, and (d) plan how higher-income states will help other countries (especially low- and middle-income countries) to procure vaccines and implement mass vaccination. This support will be critical to controlling the virus globally and saving lives around the world, as well as reducing the impact that future waves of the pandemic could have on national populations.</p> <p id="par0660">Serological studies to determine population immunity. One of the key elements in assessing the prevalence of the population at risk is the fraction of the population that has recovered and is protected against re-infection. If a sufficiently large fraction of the population has become immune, either by natural recovery or by vaccination, the remaining constraints can be removed.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="phaseiiib:intheabsenceofavaccine,avoluntaryandselectiveacquisitionstrategyofherdimmunity" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Phase III B: in the absence of a vaccine, a voluntary and selective acquisition strategy of herd immunity</div> <p id="par0665">Faced with an epidemic spreading so rapidly, with an agent so contagious but as little known as COVID-19, the only possible response by countries unprepared for this type of event, such as France, was the almost generalized containment of populations. Other countries in Europe, such as the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Sweden, have tried with varying degrees of success and consistency to initiate herd immunity by advising only physical distancing and voluntary confinement to the most vulnerable individuals. Thus, although Sweden <a href="#bib0085">[7]</a>, <a href="#bib0090">[8]</a> has closed neither its schools nor its businesses, its hospital system seems to respond to the influx of serious cases, and the observed death rate does not appear to be fundamentally different from that of France.

Treating the physical effects</div> <p id="par0730">The end of phase III, the return to normal life, will not be the end of the COVID-19. Indeed, in a significant number of subjects, sequelae will persist, many of which remain to be assessed in terms of severity and duration. We are beginning to know which organs will remain affected.</p> <p id="par0735">The main localization in the acute phase of the disease is the pulmonary alveoli and, more specifically, the pneumocytes within them. The â€œcytokine stormâ€� accompanies the response to pneumocyte aggression. In addition to this, pulmonary embolisms related to coagulation disorders must be added. It is very likely that sequelae will persist in the form of pulmonary fibrosis with its usual complications of superinfection and hypoxia leading to respiratory and cardiac insufficiency.</p> <p id="par0740">The tubular epithelial cells of the kidneys may be, like the pulmonary pneumocytes, the target of the virus. The result is acute renal failure, which is not, as initially thought, functional in relation to hydro electrolytic disorders, but organic with necrosis of the tubular cells, often irreversible, and thus progressing to chronic renal failure. This will result in the need to resort to haemodialysis for an indefinite period of time.</p> <p id="par0745">Brain damage: the simplest forms are anosmia and taste loss, which fortunately mostly regress: damage to the cranial nerves, especially the olfactory with infection of the olfactory lobe; damage to the thalamus and brain stem. These lesions may also be the consequence of thromboembolic syndrome or cerebral anoxia related to acute respiratory failure. There are also cerebral lesions detected by electroencephalography, which sometimes determine a frontal syndrome with cognitive disorders and memory loss. These disorders will require a long rehabilitation. More exceptionally, acute encephalitis leading to rapid death has been described.</p> <p id="par0750">The cutaneous symptomatology is very diverse, ranging from acrosyndromes to drug and urticaria rashes. They are attributed to bleeding disorders and are expected to be transient. It is not yet known whether anticoagulant therapy will need to be continued.</p> </div> <div class="treatingthepsychologicalsequelae" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Anticipating the future</div> <p id="par0760">The current pandemic has revealed serious gaps in the pandemic preparedness of our country, in fact all western countries, in good standing with countries that had not been exposed to previous SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV type epidemics. COVID-19 will not be the last public health emergency to threaten our societies. Significant investments must be made in scientific, medical and public health infrastructures to prevent, detect and respond to the next emerging infectious disease threat. A hospital organisation based on the flexibility of its structures, as opposed to the current organisation based on sometimes compartmentalised specialities, will have to be thought through so that it can be implemented rapidly if necessary in the future. This will require a considerable relaxation of regulatory constraints and a reduction in the administrative burden of hospital management. The human and social sciences will also have to grasp this new context of a post-pandemic world where a return to normality will not be the return to the past norm, particularly in our Western societies, with political, economic and behavioural challenges. From this point of view, the systematic wearing of masks and physical distancing will become reflexes, as in Asian countries, on the eve of, for example, a new epidemic of the same nature.</p> <p id="par0765">Better coordination of biological-health research.

The programmes will address the major issues raised by the pandemic: epidemiology, clinical forms, prevention, pathophysiological mechanisms, phenotype/genotype relationships, risk factors including chronic diseases, treatments, vaccines, diagnosis, digital health, human and social sciences, health economics, ethical principles in times of pandemic, etc.;</p> </li> <li><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">â€¢</span><p id="par0775">to develop a specific programme in artificial intelligence to support digital health: diagnosis, patient monitoring, telemedicine, decision support, modelling: epidemiology and therapeutic strategies;</p> </li> <li><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">â€¢</span><p id="par0780">to pool existing infrastructures: population cohorts, biobanks, health data hubs, analytical platforms;</p> </li> <li><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">â€¢</span><p id="par0785">to foster innovation: supporting healthcare start-ups with long-term R&amp;amp;D, which implies adapting regulations, funding and public-private partnerships in specific areas, including: diagnosis, patient monitoring, telemedicine, decision support, population-based sampling and clustering, modelling: epidemiology and therapeutic strategies;</p> </li> <li><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">â€¢</span><p id="par0790">to establish a strategy and means of communication to inform citizens about research, therapeutic and diagnostic advances, ethical and regulatory aspects; insert educational elements in the curricula of primary and secondary schools to explain what research in biology and health is, particularly on the occurrence and management of epidemics;</p> </li> <li><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">â€¢</span><p id="par0795">To put in place a genuine European strategy to respond to the health challenges, whether infectious or non-infectious, to which our societies may again be exposed in the future.
