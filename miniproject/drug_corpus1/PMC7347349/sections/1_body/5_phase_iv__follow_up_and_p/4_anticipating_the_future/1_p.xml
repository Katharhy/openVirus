<p id="par0760">The current pandemic has revealed serious gaps in the pandemic preparedness of our country, in fact all western countries, in good standing with countries that had not been exposed to previous SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV type epidemics. COVID-19 will not be the last public health emergency to threaten our societies. Significant investments must be made in scientific, medical and public health infrastructures to prevent, detect and respond to the next emerging infectious disease threat. A hospital organisation based on the flexibility of its structures, as opposed to the current organisation based on sometimes compartmentalised specialities, will have to be thought through so that it can be implemented rapidly if necessary in the future. This will require a considerable relaxation of regulatory constraints and a reduction in the administrative burden of hospital management. The human and social sciences will also have to grasp this new context of a post-pandemic world where a return to normality will not be the return to the past norm, particularly in our Western societies, with political, economic and behavioural challenges. From this point of view, the systematic wearing of masks and physical distancing will become reflexes, as in Asian countries, on the eve of, for example, a new epidemic of the same nature.</p>
