<p id="par0765">Better coordination of biological-health research. In parallel with the so-called immediate actions of phase II, research in biology and health must be strengthened, particularly in terms of coordination and strategy:

   <p id="par0770">to establish a single steering structure, led by the Life Sciences and Health Alliance (AVIESAN), which is in charge of coordinating calls for research projects, particularly those of the PHRC, ANR, ANRS, their evaluation, and the allocation of resources, including those for cohort management, based on feedback from the REACTing consortium, which has demonstrated its operational efficiency. The programmes will address the major issues raised by the pandemic: epidemiology, clinical forms, prevention, pathophysiological mechanisms, phenotype/genotype relationships, risk factors including chronic diseases, treatments, vaccines, diagnosis, digital health, human and social sciences, health economics, ethical principles in times of pandemic, etc.;</p>

European coordination of the debate on major health problems, downstream and in connection with research, will have to ensure the relevance of the European research fabric and its coordination with the industrial fabric in order to allow the development of coordinated strategies for epidemiological monitoring and, within deadlines which may be urgent, strategies for the development of biological tests, vaccines and targeted therapeutics, similar to what is being done in other fields, such as aeronautics;</p>

   <p id="par0800">to increase the vigilance of zoonoses, develop large-scale modelling of infectious diseases and vaccines against new viruses within a few months. Zoonoses are transmissible to humans either directly (hunting and consumption of wild animals) or indirectly through previously contaminated livestock or domestic animals. Increased vigilance is necessary with the support of veterinary schools, which implies strict control of the importation of live animals and edible meat, as well as the search for viral or bacterial infection in wild animals found dead;</p>

However, it proved to be deficient at the international level during this pandemic, with forecasts at excessively wide confidence intervals providing little guidance on policy. In order to better manage this crisis and try to prevent the next one, it is essential to develop on a large scale the mathematical modelling of epidemics based on information from public data,

A specific strategy, programmes and funding will be needed. This strategy should include support for flexible manufacturing capacity to increase production worldwide in case of emergency.</p>
