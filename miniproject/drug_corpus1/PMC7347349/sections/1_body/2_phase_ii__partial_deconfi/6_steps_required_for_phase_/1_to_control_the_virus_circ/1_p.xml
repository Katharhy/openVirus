<p id="par0315">In addition to virological tests carried out on medical staff, patients and in EPHADs, virological tests on representative samples of the population should be carried out during phase II. These tests carried out on samples of a thousand volunteers should correspond to the densest possible coverage of the territory, at least one per region and ideally one per department. These tests must also be repeated at least once a week according to the same geographical distribution. Increasing or decreasing the percentage of positive or negative responses will make it possible to adapt the rhythm of the surveys to the constraints of confinement as close as possible to the territory.</p>
