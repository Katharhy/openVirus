<p id="par0425">These tools are essential for understanding the development of the epidemic. However, by making it possible, at least temporarily, to substitute machines for human beings tasks, they have also made it possible to maintain part of the activities through teleworking while helping to maintain physical distance. In addition to telework, which must be maintained if not amplified and secured in this phase II in order to maintain the country's activity in security, the current context offers opportunities to develop new applications or to amplify those already existing in the medical field:
