<p id="par0330">General distancing precautions should always be the norm during phase II, including teleworking (as much as possible), maintaining hand hygiene, wearing a mask when away from home, regular disinfection of frequently contacted surfaces, and initially limiting social gatherings to fewer than 50 people (or 20 or another number to be delimited). These recommendations should be complemented by technological solutions to assess distancing behaviour and adapt risk messages as appropriate. This could be done through partnerships with the private sector, taking care to preserve individual lives and avoiding coercive means to encourage compliance.</p>
