   <p id="par0400">against the virus, several attempts are underway to limit its replication by action on its membrane receptor, the capsid proteins reacting with this receptor, its replication enzymes as polymerases and protease, or against virions by specific monoclonal or polyclonal neutralising antibodies or by interferon;</p>

   <p id="par0405">against the physiopathological consequences of the viral infection, the therapeutics are of two orders: some fight the cytokine storm, as antibodies against interleukin-1, other cytokines, or against their receptors (in particular IL6, IL1, TNF, and complement factor inhibitors), others facilitate oxygen transport or limit the risk of thrombosis (anticoagulants);</p>
