<p id="par0390">Accelerating the research, development, production and distribution of safe and effective therapeutics is a top priority. At a minimum, the expected profile of a treatment that will influence the risk of future spread is to significantly reduce the risk of death or serious illness and possibly prevent the onset of symptoms or progression to serious illness in exposed individuals. Through effective development strategies and early investments in commercial scale manufacturing, an effective therapy could quickly receive a Transitional Use Exemption (TUE) or a Marketing Authorization (MA) as early as the summer or fall, if tests show that it meets either of the standards set out in the legislation for these two provisions, and even more quickly if it is a repositioned drug.</p>
