 <xref rid="fn0100" ref-type="fn">20</xref> As distance is gradually reduced, monitoring will be essential to quickly identify an increase in cases. A district (region or other) should return to phase I and continue to “slow the spread” if a significant number of cases cannot be linked to known cases, if there is a sustained increase in new cases for at least five days, or if hospitals are no longer able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization.
