<p id="par0665">Faced with an epidemic spreading so rapidly, with an agent so contagious but as little known as COVID-19, the only possible response by countries unprepared for this type of event, such as France, was the almost generalized containment of populations. Other countries in Europe, such as the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Sweden, have tried with varying degrees of success and consistency to initiate herd immunity by advising only physical distancing and voluntary confinement to the most vulnerable individuals. Thus, although Sweden

The strategy for France would be to acquire group immunity through selective and controlled contamination with a lower risk.
