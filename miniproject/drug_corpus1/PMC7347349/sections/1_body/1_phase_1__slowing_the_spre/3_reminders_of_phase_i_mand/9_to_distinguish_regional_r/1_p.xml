<p id="par0225">The great regional and local disparity of infectious situations and their evolution calls for policies that can be differentiated according to regions, departments and municipalities. The State should produce guidelines for prefects, regional health agencies (ARS) and those in charge of local authorities (regions, departments and communes) and leave it to the latter to assess situations, manage resources and, ultimately, propose decisions to move on to the next phase. The most important decisions at the local level could be validated at the national level when dependent on the state of the hospital system in other regions. An adapted procedure with neighbouring countries should be put in place for border departments.</p>
