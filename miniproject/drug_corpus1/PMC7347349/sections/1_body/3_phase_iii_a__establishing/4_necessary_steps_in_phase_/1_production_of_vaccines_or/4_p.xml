<p id="par0655">Global implementation of vaccines and mass vaccination. France must continue to work with WHO and global vaccine organizations such as GloPID-R, CEPI and Gavi, coordinating their efforts and stimulating research on innovative vaccines (phase 1), as well as with national leaders and industry to (a) develop vaccines (b) test them (c) produce them, and (d) plan how higher-income states will help other countries (especially low- and middle-income countries) to procure vaccines and implement mass vaccination. This support will be critical to controlling the virus globally and saving lives around the world, as well as reducing the impact that future waves of the pandemic could have on national populations.</p>
