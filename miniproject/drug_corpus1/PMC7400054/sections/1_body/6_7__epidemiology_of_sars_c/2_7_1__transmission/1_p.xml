<p>Information about the mode of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is continuously evolving. Transmission primarily occurs via the person-to-person route through respiratory droplets (&gt;5–10 μm in diameter) and fomites. Droplet infection is associated mainly with coughing, sneezing, and talking to an infected person, and the virus is transmitted to humans through direct contact with mucus membranes. Transmission can also occur by touching an infected surface, followed by contact with eyes, nose, or mouth. The travel range of the droplets is less than six feet (approximately two meters), and these are not retained in the air for long. Satisfactory evidence of the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains unavailable [
