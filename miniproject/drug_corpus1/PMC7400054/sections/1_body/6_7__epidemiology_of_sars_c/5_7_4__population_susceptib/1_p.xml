<p>There is no age limit for vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, cases with higher morbidity and chances of mortality have been reported in older adults. Individuals above 65 years of age or those who have comorbidities (such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory system diseases) are highly susceptible to the infection [

 <xref rid="B63-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. For example, the biallelic expression of TLR7 in women allows higher immune responses, while the immune regulatory genes encoded by X chromosomes cause comparatively less virus load and inflammation. Recently, studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection in children (though less severely affected), may develop the Kawasaki disease-like forms [
 <xref rid="B64-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. However, it is still not clear whether Kawasaki disease-like forms are a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection alone or just SARS-CoV-2 induced aggravations in Kawasaki disease patients.
