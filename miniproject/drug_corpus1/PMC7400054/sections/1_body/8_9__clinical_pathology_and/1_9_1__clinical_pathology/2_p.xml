<p>Radiological images indicate that two to five lobes of the lungs may be affected. The most common and pronounced lesions are marked by patchy ground-glass opacities and patchy consolidation in the mid, external, and sub-pleural areas of the lung [

The cytopathic effects were marked by the presence of interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, with a majority of lymphocytes and multinucleated syncytial cells, along with atypical enlarged pneumocytes containing large nuclei and amphophilic granular cytoplasm, in the intra-alveolar spaces. In some infected patients, microvascular steatosis and mild lobular and portal activity were recorded in hepatic tissues, while interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates were found in the cardiac tissues [
