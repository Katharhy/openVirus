<p>The successful limitation of virus spread in Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, despite their geographical proximity to China, indicates that widespread and intense testing, combined with strict quarantine measures for positive and suspected cases, are crucial for combatting SARS-CoV-2. Large-scale screening is arduous with the currently used molecular tests; therefore, deployment of rapid point-of-care tests (POCTs) can act as a breakthrough in the current scenario [

 <sup>®</sup> Xpress SARS-CoV-2 test (an RT-qPCR test) developed in the USA and reported as a rapid diagnostic test that provides result in 45 min. Moreover, it is an automated POCT with EUA from the FDA and enables the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the nasal wash, nasopharyngeal swab, and aspirated samples [

The Abbott ID NOW™ COVID-19 test, a rapid point-of-care (POC) PCR isothermal test, which can deliver results in five minutes, has recently received the EUA from the FDA. Another FDA-approved POC test, a rapid IgM–IgG-combined antibody test for COVID-19, developed by Biomedomics (Becton Dickinson) can detect antiviral antibodies with 88.7% sensitivity and 90.6% specificity within 10–15 min [

These POC tests, which can be used at the community level, are likely to improve the testing capacities, and hence, would be pivotal in disrupting the SARS-CoV-2 transmission cycle. Recently, a CRISPR-based Specific High Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter Unlocking (SHERLOCK) technique has been used to diagnose COVID-19 in less than an hour without using multiple instruments [
