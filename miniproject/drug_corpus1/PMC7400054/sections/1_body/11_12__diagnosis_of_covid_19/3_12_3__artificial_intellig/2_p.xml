<p>The chest CT-based diagnosis, usually in COVID-19, has certain limitations in terms of differentiation between COVID-19 and community-acquired pneumonia. Therefore, a deep learning model for COVID-19 was developed and employed to distinguish the common community-acquired pneumonia from COVID-19 [

With a lack of point-of-care diagnostics, AI-driven tools can prove useful in determining the risk involved and the transmission dynamics among different population groups. Presently, owing to the involvement of active learning processes in AI tools, the rate of confidence in decision-making processes has increased [
