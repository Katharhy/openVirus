<p>We analyzed the spike gene sequences (
 <italic>n</italic> = 38) of SARS-CoV-2, which were retrieved from the NCBI database. The spike gene sequences of CoVs, representing different subgenera of 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, were also retrieved. Based on the BLASTn analysis, certain strains, similar to bat SARS-like-CoVs and bat-CoVs, were also included in this analysis. The nucleotide and amino acid percentage similarities between these CoVs were calculated using the MegAlign software from DNASTAR. The phylogenetic analyses of spike genes from different CoVs were conducted using the GTR + G substitution model and the Maximum Composite Likelihood method. The tree was visualized using iTOL, an online tree visualization tool [
