<p>The whole-genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 derived from isolates from different countries showed a high similarity of 99 to 100% at both nucleotide and amino acid levels, suggesting the stability of the viral genome. To determine the similarity index between SARS-CoV-2 and other members of 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus,</italic> we analyzed the spike protein sequences of all subgenera. The reference SARS-CoV-2 strain (Wuhan-Hu-1/NC_045512) was closely associated with a bat-CoV (RaTG13) from Yunnan, China, with 93.1 and 97.67% nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarity, respectively, as shown in 
 <xref rid="pathogens-09-00519-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. A pangolin-CoV strain MP789 from China also had a similarity index of 89.7 and 89.78% in nucleotide and amino acid sequences with the reference strain, respectively. Besides, two bat SARS-like-CoVs (bat-SL-CoVZC45/MG772933 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21/MG772934) were also closely related to the novel SARS-CoV-2, as shown in
