 <xref rid="B21-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Of these, four CoVs (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1) cause mild symptoms in humans. Contrarily, two highly pathogenic CoVs caused outbreaks of severe respiratory illness due to zoonotic transmission in humans, namely the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and MERS.
