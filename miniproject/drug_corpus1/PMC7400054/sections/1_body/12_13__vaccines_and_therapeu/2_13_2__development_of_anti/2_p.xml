<p>Favilavir (Favipiravir), the first antiviral drug tested against SARS-CoV-2, approved by the National Medical Products Administration of China in February 2020, is commonly used to treat influenza infection in China and Japan and has shown promising results in shortening the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection [

 <xref rid="B124-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>,
 <xref rid="B125-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. This drug acts by inhibiting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2. Despite its potential effectiveness, the drug is yet to be approved by the U.S. FDA. Remdisivir has also been reported to treat COVID-19 patients to full recovery [

 <xref rid="B127-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. In fact, remdisivir is also a repurposed drug that was initially developed for the treatment of Ebola virus infection. Remdisivir is reported to prevent viral replication by the premature termination of RNA transcription. Currently, remdisivir is under clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir has been reported to significantly improve the conditions of COVID-19 patients in South Korea [

However, the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir failed to serve its initial purpose when used for the treatment of COVID-19 patients in recent clinical trials in China [

 <xref rid="B129-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. However, its associated side-effects could be more severe in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing chronic medical conditions.
