<p>The most common preventive and effective approach to decelerate the COVID-19 pandemic is the use of vaccines in humans. Currently, there are significant research efforts being made globally to develop safe and effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection [
 <xref rid="B120-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Approximately 200 vaccine candidates have already been developed worldwide and are at different stages of clinical evaluation [
 <xref rid="B121-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. Most of these vaccine candidates have been developed using at least seven different approaches, which include mRNA vaccine, viral vector vaccine, DNA vaccine, recombinant protein-based vaccine, peptide-based, virus-like particles, killed vaccine, and live-attenuated vaccine. Currently, the COVID-19 Treatment and Vaccine Tracker, maintained by the Milken Institute School of Public Health, USA, provides comprehensive publicly-available information on all drugs and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 that are currently being studied.
