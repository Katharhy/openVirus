<p>With the global cohesive approach, dozens of vaccine candidates have reached a status needing human trials. The human trials can only provide an idea on the status of vaccine effectiveness. The search for volunteers is a challenge, though in few places a number of people have registered for the clinical trials. The time estimated for the release of any vaccine looks lengthier, with a waiting period of nearly 12 months, involving quality checks, regulatory, and scale-up issues, with the required number of doses covering those who are suffering globally. A few of the candidate vaccines cleared the animal trials with safe outcome and need an assessment of immune responses and disease enhancement. Lately, other concerns posing a challenge are higher mutability seen in circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide and the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of disease. This ADE mechanism enables the entry of the virus into the host cells and is well described in viral infections. “Will the changing virus remain susceptible to the upcoming vaccine?” and “Could it be helping in ADE?” are the questions yet to be resolved.</p>
