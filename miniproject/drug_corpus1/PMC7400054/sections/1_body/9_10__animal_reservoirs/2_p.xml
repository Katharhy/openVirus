<p>The preliminary whole-genome analyses of SARS-CoV-2 denoted a high genetic identity (96.2%) with a bat (BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013) virus, detected in 
 <italic>Rhinolophus affinis</italic> in the Yunnan province of China [
 <xref rid="B99-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>], leading to speculation that bats might act as a possible reservoir host. Notably, the homology modeling studies of RBD of SARS-CoV-2 suggest that it has a structure similar to that of SARS-CoV RBD, with few differences in the key residues at the amino acid level [

The recent detection and whole-genome sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 from Malayan pangolins indicated a sequence identity of 85.5 to 92.4% with pangolin SARS-CoV-2, which is lower compared to that of bat CoV RaTG13 (96.2%). However, the RBD of the S protein from pangolin SARS-CoV-2 exhibited 97.4% amino acid similarity to that of SARS-CoV-2, which is higher compared to that of RaTG13 (89.2%) [
 <xref rid="B101-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD shares five identical key residues with that of pangolin-CoV, while it shares only one residue with that of RaTG13 [
 <xref rid="B101-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. This finding suggests that pangolins may act as a potential intermediate host. However, studies suggesting bats as a reservoir host and pangolins as an intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 need to be investigated further.
