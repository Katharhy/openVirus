<p>CoVs include viruses infecting humans and other animal species, such as birds, camels, cattle, bats, and cats. CoVs primarily affect the upper and lower respiratory tracts, and the enteric, hepatic, and neurological systems, with infections characterized by severe dyspnea and hypoxemia, renal dysfunction with lower urine output, tachycardia, altered mental status, and functional alterations of organs in animals and humans. Individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 may be asymptomatic carriers or active patients with the clinical presentation of symptoms, such as fever, fatigue, dry cough, myalgia, dyspnea, severe respiratory distress syndrome, and acute cardiac injury [

An increase in body temperature up to 39.0 °C (102.2 °F), accompanied by coarse breathing sounds from both lungs at auscultation are common clinical symptoms. Symptoms, such as headache, sputum production, hemoptysis, diarrhea, and pleuritic chest pain were also observed in rare cases. The infection more commonly affects people with cardiopulmonary or renal diseases, and pregnant females, infants, and the elderly (at a two-fold greater risk than the general population). There is no evidence to suggest greater susceptibility among children. Pregnant women are at greater risk for viral infections, as suggested by data from previous outbreaks; therefore, it is advisable to avoid contact with infected individuals [
