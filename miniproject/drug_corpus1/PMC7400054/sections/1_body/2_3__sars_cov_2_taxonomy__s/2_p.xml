<p>SARS-CoV-2 is a 0.12 µm, enveloped, non-segmented virus, and its genome comprises a single-stranded positive-sense RNA (+ssRNA) of ≈29.8 kb [
 <xref rid="B29-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The genome is arranged in a structure typical to coronaviruses in the following order: 5′-ORF1a/ab-Spike (S)-Envelope (E)-Membrane (M)-Nucleocapsid (N)−3′; however, it lacks the hemagglutinin–esterase gene, similar to bat SARS-like-CoVs, human SARS-CoVs, and MERS-CoVs. Fourteen open reading frames (ORFs) have been identified that encode twenty-seven proteins, both structural and non-structural proteins (nsps). At the 5′ terminus, the first ORF1a/ab, which occupies approximately two-thirds of the entire genome length, encodes the pp1a and pp1ab proteins, respectively, and both collectively comprise 15 non-structural proteins (nsp 1 to 10 and nsp 12 to 16). The functions of the nsps of a typical coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 are listed in

 <xref rid="B31-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The ORFs toward the 3′- terminus encode at least four major structural proteins: the spike (S), matrix membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Besides, accessory proteins (3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, and 10) are also encoded by the genome of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan HU1. The 5′- and 3′- UTR sequences of SARS-CoV-2 have ≈83.0% nucleotide identity with other members of the 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> genus. The genomes of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and bat-SARS CoV are considerably similar. The RNA secondary structures in the 5′-UTR were more identical to those of SARS-CoV than to the bat SARS-like CoV; however, the 3′-UTR was more conserved compared to other related
