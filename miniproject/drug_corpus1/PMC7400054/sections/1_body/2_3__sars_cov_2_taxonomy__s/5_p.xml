<p>Similarly, furin might cleave the MERS-CoV EMC spike protein less efficiently at the S2′ cleavage site, owing to the lack of typical basic amino acid residues observed in SARS-CoV-2, bat SARS-like-CoVZC45, and human SARS-CoV Tor2. Although the S1/S2 cleavage site in the bovine CoV ENT (K
 <bold>RR</bold>S
 <bold>RR</bold>SITT) spike protein is rich in basic amino acids, its S2′ cleavage site (N
 <bold>K</bold>VSS
 <bold>R</bold>SA) lacks the typical basic amino acid residues, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00519-f003">Figure 3</xref>. The porcine CoV HKU15 contains a monobasic cleavage site (NSTENN
 <bold>R</bold>FTTT), which could lead to low-efficiency cleavage. Based on the findings from these comparative studies, we speculate that the high-density basic amino acid residues, preferably positioned in close proximity at both cleavage sites (S1/S2 and S2′), might have facilitated the efficient replication and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. However, these propositions need to be validated by further experimental investigations.
