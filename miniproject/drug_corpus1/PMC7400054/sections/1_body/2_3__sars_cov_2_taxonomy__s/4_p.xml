<p>The trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein, the most important determinant of host cell tropism and transmission capability, is functionally composed of two subunits, the S1 (receptor binding) and S2 (cell membrane fusion) [

 <xref rid="B35-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 is comparatively conserved and closely related to that of bat SARS-like-CoVZC45, while the S1 subunit had only 70% identity with that of bat SARS-like-CoVZC45 [

 <xref rid="B34-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. During infection, the S protein is proteolytically processed by host cell proteases at the S1/S2 cleavage site and, following cleavage, the S protein is cleaved into the N-terminal S1 subunit and C-terminal S2 subunit. The S1 subunit comprises a signal peptide, an N-terminal domain, and a receptor-binding domain (RBD). In contrast, the S2 subunit comprises a conserved fusion peptide, a second proteolytic site (S2′), followed by an internal fusion peptide, heptad repeats 1 and 2, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain [

 <xref rid="B38-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. After the virus enters the host cell, a second cleavage (at the S2′ cleavage site) occurs for membrane fusion, mediated by the endolysosomal proteases [
 <xref rid="B33-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Since furin is highly expressed in the lungs, the furin-like cleavage sites (S1/S2 and S2′) appear to be critical for the activation of the S protein and, therefore, for the efficient entry of virus [

 <xref rid="B39-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. On comparing these sites, we observed a typical furin-like cleavage site rich in basic amino acid residues (SP

 <bold>R</bold>STSQ), as shown in
