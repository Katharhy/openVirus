<p>The definitive origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains undetermined. However, initial estimations implicate Wuhan as the epicenter and the live animal seafood market as the source of this outbreak, owing to the involvement of different animals, including wild and domestic animals, in close proximity to each other [
 <xref rid="B10-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The postulation was primarily based on the significant genomic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and bat or pangolin CoVs. The first patient to be reported in Wuhan did not visit the seafood market, and molecular analyses of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences suggest its origin is traced back to late November [

 <xref rid="B12-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These findings raised specific questions pertinent to the COVID-19 epidemic and the Wuhan seafood market. The well-established human transmission of the outbreak emphasizes the likelihood of the better adaptability of the virus in transmission dynamics [
