<p>The events leading to the emergence of a virus capable of infecting a new host have occurred previously in CoV infections [
 <xref rid="B14-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Earlier, reports suggested the emergence of SARS-CoV by a recombination between bat SARS-like CoVs, followed by mutations in civet CoVs prior to its spillover. Similarly, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV also circulated and acquired mutations in camels for approximately 30 years before the incidence of MERS in the Middle East [

 <xref rid="B17-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 is suggested to be a chimera of two different viruses, a bat-CoV (RaTG13) and a pangolin-CoV [
