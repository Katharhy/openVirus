The incidences and CFR are reportedly higher in males (67.67% and 2.8%, respectively) than in females, owing to the higher frequency of engagement in outdoor activities and smoking status in males [

The most common reported comorbidities in COVID-19 cases include cardiovascular diseases (10.5%), diabetes (7.3%), chronic respiratory infections (6.3%), hypertension (6%), and malignancies (5.6%) [

As per the WHO observations, the COVID-19 epidemic peaked and plateaued between 23 January and 2 February 2020, in China, and then followed a declining trend, paving a path for the elimination of the epidemic. However, the WHO has simultaneously stated that other countries are reporting a continuous increase in the number of cases, with the USA reporting the highest increase in daily deaths.
