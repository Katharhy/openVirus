<p>Travelers from COVID-19 affected countries need to be quarantined appropriately, as they have been the root cause of spreading SARS-CoV-2 from China to subsequently more than 200 countries. Measures, such as public awareness programs about COVID-19 associated health risks and how to avoid contact transmission, issuing updated advisories from time to time, visa cancellations to avoid travelers coming in from affected countries, understanding the high socio-economic implications of SARS-CoV-2 with a follow up of suitable ameliorating measures, closing schools, offices, malls, and other public places, staying at home in affected areas during lockdown conditions in countries where this virus has been severely affected, strengthening medical facilities, adopting high biosafety measures for doctors, nurses, and health-care workers, along with following high standards of hygiene and health practices while diagnosing and treating COVID-19 patients, are a few of the critical prevention and control measures to check the high spread of this pandemic virus.</p>
