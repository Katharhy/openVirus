<p>The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 highlights gaps in the current knowledge about human–animal barriers and zoonotic diseases, as well as the necessity for a prerequisite for extensive comprehensive research at the human–animal–environment interface of the One Health concept [
 <xref rid="B155-pathogens-09-00519" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>], to determine the origins and crossroads of interspecies transfer impediment by the identification of the ecological and evolutionary carriers of the infection. Several questions on SARS-CoV-2 remain unanswered, including the factors behind the virus crossing the species barrier, the definitive origin of the virus, the exact roles of distinct ORFs, the critical point mutation differences in virus transmission and pathogenesis, the reason for the death of specific infected individuals while others remain asymptomatic, and the reappearance of infection in specific cured individuals, among others. With the availability of more complete genome sequences from different parts of the world, it is becoming apparent that several virus mutants are circulating and need close monitoring. There is a need to identify the role of the ADE mechanism in SARS-CoV-2, as well to plan for better immunomodulatory therapies for the effective treatment and control of COVID-19 infections.
