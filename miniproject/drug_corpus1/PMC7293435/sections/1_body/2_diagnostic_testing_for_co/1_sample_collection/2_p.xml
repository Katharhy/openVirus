<p id="Par10">Once a person is identified as a person under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19, it is recommended that the clinician should immediately adapt infection control and prevention (PPE) measures. In addition to excluding all other sources of respiratory infection, the decision on who to test should be based on the CDC guidance and local epidemiological data. For sampling, the WHO recommends collecting specimens from both the upper respiratory tracts, nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs, in the spontaneously breathing patients, and the lower respiratory tract in the mechanically ventilated patients. Researchers have proven that NP swab specimen is superior to the OP swab specimen for the examination of SARS-CoV-2 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] as higher viral loads were detected in the nasal area than in the throat [

Upon collection, the swabs should be placed immediately into a sterile transport tube containing 2–3 mL of either viral transport medium (VTM), Amies transport medium, or sterile saline [

Potential risks of NP swabs include (1) the production of aerosol during the sampling, which can impose infection risks to healthcare workers; (2) the inconsistent quality of NP swabs between collections, which may lead to false-negative results; and (3) the patient may experience discomfort during the sampling procedure. Aiming to address these potential risks, further studies demonstrated the efficacy of less invasive routes for sampling such as throat wash and sputum collection [

Saliva collection was shown to yield greater detection sensitivity and consistency throughout the course of the infection when compared with patient-matched NP samples. Furthermore, saliva could enable self-administered sample collection for accurate large-scale SARS-CoV-2 testing [
