<p id="Par21">As mentioned previously, the main culprit of the uncontrolled excessive immune reaction to SARS-CoV-2 is IL-6, which was found to increase, particularly during the symptomatic exacerbation of COVID-19 disease. Other common molecular laboratory findings in the early stage of COVID-19 disease include decreased white blood cells, lymphocytes, and platelets as well as metablic acidosis with elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), elevated liver transaminases, muscle enzymes, and reactive protein C. In addition, laboratory indicators of systemic shock, ARDS, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy have been reported in the severely ill patients. Notably, lymphopenia and elevated LDH appear to be negative prognostic factors, while procalcitonin value has been reported to be normal in several COVID-19 cohorts [

Other than the descriptive data obtained from retrospective analysis of COVID-19 patientsâ€™ clinical records, the current literature is lacking the pathogenic mechanisms. Clinical, preclinical, and pathological research will have to elucidate the pathophysiology underlying the various manifestations of the disease.
