<p id="Par20">Rapid antigen assays are emerging new class of tests to be used in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. These assays are designed to detect particles of the viral proteins in nasal swabs quickly by using simple qualitative or semiquantitative in vitro diagnostic procedure, which can be performed either in the lab or at a local point of care to give results within 1 h [

Rapid antigen assays are currently being validated to enhance clinical laboratories’ capacity to match the urgent need for rapid COVID-19 detecting in response to the pandemic. The first emergency used authorization has been issued by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to the Quidel Corporation for the Sofia 2 SARS Antigen FIA on May11, 2020 [

Few other rapid tests are currently being validated by the WHO or on the FDA list. An important advantage of an antigen test is the speed of the test at lower cost and the high specificity. However, they have high false-negative rate due to lower sensitivity. Therefore, a negative result from a rapid antigen test requires confirmation with a PCR test prior to formalizing isolation and treatment decisions.
