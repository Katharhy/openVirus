<p id="Par17">The lateral flow assays for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies may potentially be useful in assessing the burden of COVID-19 infection. However, important limitations exist, including the low specificity of the IgM responses and the delayed seroconversion of the specific IgG responses. Therefore, these assays cannot be used for acute diagnostics but may represent an indirect indication of COVID-19 infection that is best utilized to confirm late COVID-19 cases, retrospectively, or to assess the immunity of healthcare providers during the pandemic. In addition, they can be useful to predict which patient would benefit from repeat testing, self-isolation, or targeted therapies for COVID-19 [
