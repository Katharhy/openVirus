<p id="Par19">The frequency of detecting antibodies to the N protein in COVID-19 patients indicates that the N protein may be useful as an immunodominant antigen in the early diagnosis of COVID-19 disease [

For testing antibodies to the N protein, investigators relied on the high degree of similarity between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 proteins (estimated 90%) to develop a new ELISA assay, in which the SARS-CoV N protein was used as antigen. Using 3 different validated ELISAs, the investigators demonstrated that higher antibody levels are associated with the severity of infection. Furthermore, they showed that N-specific IgG seroconversion occurs in the second week after the beginning of the symptoms. Remarkably, compared with S1 ELISAs, the N protein ELISAs showed higher sensitivity in detecting antibodies in mildly infected patients and stronger correlations with the plaque reduction neutralization test. However, this observation requires confirmation in a larger cohort of patients with different levels of disease severity to precisely monitor the timing of seroconversion even in mildly symptomatic patients. Further, antibodies against two different antigens should be tested to decrease false-negative results in serial disease monitoring studies [

Well-defined standard references should be developed to standardize the serologic assays developed by different laboratories, to account for inter-assay variability, and to unify data interpretation tools from different studies. Finally, as research efforts are currently focused on developing a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, validation and standardization of serologic testing are crucial for evaluating vaccine immunogenicity and effective induction of antibody responses for prevention.
