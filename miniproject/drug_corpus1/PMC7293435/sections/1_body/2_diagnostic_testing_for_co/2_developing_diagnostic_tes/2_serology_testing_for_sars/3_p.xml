<p id="Par18">The spike and nucleocapsid proteins are the main immunogens of the SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Okba NMA et al. established serologic assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing, spike protein-specific (S), and nucleocapsid-specific (N) antibodies using serum samples from patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The investigators validated the various antigens using ELISA platforms and found that most of the patients with the SARS-CoV-2 infection seroconverted by 2Â weeks after the beginning of their illness. Particularly, the S1 subunit was more specific than S2 in detecting the SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. This finding could be explained by the higher conservation of the S2 subunit in CoVs, relative to S1. Therefore, S1 was identified as a specific antigen for the SARS-CoV-2 serology testing. Remarkably, further validation of S1-specific IgA and IgG ELISA assays by two different groups revealed that while the IgA-based ELISA was more sensitive, the IgG ELISA showed higher specificity than the IgA ELISA. Furthermore, compared with IgA, IgG is longer lasting in patients and thus is preferred for serology studies. To date, no studies have addressed cross-reactivity from other non-specific proteins that can lead to false-positive result. Further studies and optimization of ELISA assays will be necessary.
