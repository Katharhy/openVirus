<p id="Par12">After collection, the clinical samples are subjected to RNA isolation. This is a time-consuming step that is also extremely important to avoid the false-negative results. The optimal protocol for the isolation of RNA would ideally provide pure RNase-free nucleic acid and recover RNA quantitatively across a range of dilutions. Several protocols for RNA isolation have been used by different laboratory. The efficiency of RNA isolation protocols for SARS-CoV-2 from stool samples was discussed in a recent multicenter study [
