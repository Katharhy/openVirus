<p id="Par11">The top priority for controlling the rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2-associated-COVID-19 is developing a diagnostic test of high performance. The use of viral culture is not feasible option for rapid diagnosis as it takes 3–5 days for SARS-CoV-2 to cause obvious cytopathic changes in vitro. In addition, virus isolation requires biosafety level-3 (BCL-3) facilities of limited availability in many medical centers. Serology tests have not yet been validated. Moreover, the issue of cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV remains to be solved. Therefore, at present, a positive result in nucleic acid testing (NAT) using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19 [
