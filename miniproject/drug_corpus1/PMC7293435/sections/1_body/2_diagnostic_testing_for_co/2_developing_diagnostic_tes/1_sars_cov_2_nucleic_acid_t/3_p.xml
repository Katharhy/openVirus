<p id="Par13">After RNA isolation from the clinical sample and amplification through a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the SARS-CoV-2-specific primers serve to search for the viral RNA sequences that are conserved [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, the laboratory evaluation should be repeated to confirm viral clearance prior to releasing from isolation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The conserved or abundantly expressed genes such as the structural genes N and E and the nonstructural RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) as well as the ORF 1a/b genes are the preferred targets for the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Traditionally, two molecular targets should be included in the assay to avoid potential cross-reaction with other CoVs as well as potential genetic drift of SARS-CoV-2. Among these assays, the RdRp assay exhibited the highest sensitivity (3.8 RNA copies/reaction at 95% detection probability) and involves two probes. One of the probes is non-specific, which would detect other CoVs, whereas the second probe is specific for the SARS-CoV-2. These RdRp assays have been used in &gt; 30 laboratories in Europe [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], while the WHO recommends an initial screening with the E gene assay followed by a confirmatory assay using the RdRp gene [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Importantly, the RdRp assays were designed and validated using synthetic nucleic acid technology (in vitro transcription) in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 isolates or patient specimens [
