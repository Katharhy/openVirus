<p id="Par14">Given high false-negative rates, additional studies on COVID-19 samples highlighted the importance of successive sampling and testing of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR [

In addition, other parameters (D-dimer and absolute lymphocyte count, etc.) should be combined with negative RT-PCR test as additional measures to assure that recovered patients can be released from isolation. The protocols of several RT-PCR assays have been implemented and published online (

One of these assays is the reverse transcripton loop-mediated isothermal amplification assays, known as RT-LAMP, which were developed by Park GS et al. These assays were designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 specifically even at low copy numbers, without detecting other human CoVs. Furthermore, a colorimetric detection method was developed for this assay allowing its potential use at higher throughput [
