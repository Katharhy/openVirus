<p id="Par15">More recently, Chan JF et al. developed novel RT-PCR assays for COVID-19 targeting a different sequence of the RdRp/Hel (helicase/hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) [

The new RdRp/Hel assay exhibited higher sensitivity and specificity without cross-reactivity with other common respiratory viruses. The authors speculated that the new RdRp/Hel assay might be employed for detecting COVID-19 cases with low viral loads, particularly when samples from the upper respiratory tract, saliva, or plasma are used for testing. Moreover, they proposed using these assays for serial monitoring of the viral load in plasma of the COVID-19 patients to detect the cases with SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia (circulating viral RNA in blood) and, thereby, to inform prognostic and treatment decisions.
