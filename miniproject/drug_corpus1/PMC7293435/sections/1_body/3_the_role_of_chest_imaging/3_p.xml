<p id="Par24">In light of high false-negative result rate in nucleic acid testing (NAT) using RT-PCR technology, thoracic CT imaging has become a critical diagnostic tool, in combination with close monitoring of clinical features and epidemiological data for COVID-19 confirmation and management. More recently, Fang et al. reported that the sensitivity of CT (98%) exceeded that of RT-PCR (71%) in diagnosing COVID-19 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Rather, the patientâ€™s symptoms, chest CT images, and other laboratory parameters should be taken into account to inform the clinical decision regarding further management, PPE measures, and evaluating the need for repeating the diagnostic test. Although several studies described the imaging features of COVID-19, clinical stratification of pulmonology abnormalities and their correlation with the disease course need to be conducted in the future. Such data may lead to identification of a prognostic matrix for the disease.
