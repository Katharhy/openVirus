<p id="Par23">Current literature evidence indicates that 60–93% of patients have positive chest computed tomographic (CT) findings consistent with COVID-19 infection prior to positive RT-PCR test results [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. The pulmonology findings on chest CT images are more prominent approximately 10 days after the onset of the disease, including bilateral pneumonia noted in 80% of cases. Other lung abnormalities include ground glass opacities and lobular wall thickening. Notably, progressive consolidation can take place up to 2 weeks, while fibrotic bands were recognized upon the resolution of symptoms. In addition, reactive lymphadenopathy that resolved within 1 month was noted in some cases. Remarkably, any of these radiology findings were reported to change dynamically over a short period of time.
