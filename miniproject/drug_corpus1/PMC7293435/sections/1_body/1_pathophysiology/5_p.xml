<p id="Par8">The pathogenic mechanism of COVID-19 disease is complex and poorly understood. Clinical longitudinal studies will have to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the variety of clinical manifestations of this disease. The expression of ACE2 in the lower respiratory tract is believed to have determined the natural history of SARS tropism to infect the lower respiratory tract [

IL-6 can execute different actions on a large number of cells and tissues. It also stimulates the production of acute phase proteins that play important roles in thermoregulation and can result in severe tissue damage and multi-organ dysfunction.
