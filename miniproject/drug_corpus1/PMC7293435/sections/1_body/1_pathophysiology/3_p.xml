 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These resources allowed researchers to trace the phylogenetic tree and to recognize strains that vary according to the mutations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. For instance, a recent report by Angeletti et al. suggested that a spike mutation, which probably occurred in late November 2019, triggered crossing the species barriers to humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Moreover, the availability of the complete genome of SARS-CoV-2 allowed scientists to develop diagnostic laboratory tests [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The synthesis of viral polyprotein 1a/1ab (pp1a/pp1ab) from the viral RNA is achieved in the host cells. In the SARS-CoV-2 genome, at least six ORFs can be generated. Specifically, a frameshift between ORF1a and ORF1b guides the production of both 1a and1ab polypeptides that are processed by virally encoded proteases for producing 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps). Other ORFs encode structural proteins, including spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), nucleocapsid proteins (N), and accessory protein chains [
