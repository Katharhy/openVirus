<p id="Par7">Evolving literature links virulence mechanisms of CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2, to the nsps and structural proteins. For example, the nsps are able to block the host innate immunity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and the envelope (E) promotes viral assembly and release. In particular, more information is now available about the features of the spike glycoproteins positioned on the viral surface of CoVs, which guide the binding to host receptors and determine host tropism and transmission properties [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Each monomer of the trimeric S protein contains two subunits, S1 and S2, mediating attachment and membrane fusion, respectively. The S1 subunit utilizes human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), an important regulator of the cardiovascular system, as the receptor to infect human cells [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Being highly conserved, S2 could be a selective target for antiviral (anti-S2) agents. In contrast, the spike receptor-binding domain presents only 40% amino acid identity with SARS-CoV. Other SARS-CoV-2-specific structural elements are the ORF3b and ORF8 that have no homology with those of SARS-CoV. Finally, the N protein plays an important role in viral replication. Research will be needed to further determine the structural components of SARS-CoV-2 that underlie the pathogenicity.
