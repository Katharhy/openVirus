The antiviral regimens were not significantly different between the two groups. All antivirals were continued for 10 days. Deep-vein thrombosis prophylaxis and stress ulcer prophylaxis were considered for patients where indicated. Based on patients’ clinical conditions, azithromycin, intravenous ascorbic acid, antibiotics, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), or a corticosteroid was added to the antiviral regimens. A corticosteroid (methyl prednisolone, hydrocortisone, or dexamethasone) was administered for 61.9% and 43.6% of patients in the IFN and the control groups, respectively. The corticosteroid dose was equivalent to 250 mg methylprednisolone daily for 3 days. In addition, 35.7% and 25.6% of patients in the IFN and the control group, respectively, received IVIG. The dose of IVIG was 5 g daily for 3 days. Supportive care modalities and administered medications are summarized in
