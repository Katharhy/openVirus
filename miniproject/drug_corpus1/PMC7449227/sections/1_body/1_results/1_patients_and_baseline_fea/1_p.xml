Fifty-two (64.19%) patients had positive nasopharyngeal real-time PCR (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2, and 29 (35.81%) patients were diagnosed according to the clinical signs/symptoms along with the imaging findings. Hypertension (38.3%), cardiovascular diseases (28.4%), diabetes mellitus (27.2%), endocrine disorders (14.8%), and malignancy (11.1%) were common baseline diseases. Endocrine disorders were dyslipidemia and hypothyroidism. There was no significant difference in terms of demographic data and baseline diseases between the groups. The most frequent chief complaints of patients were cough, fever, and dyspnea (
