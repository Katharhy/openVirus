<p>The six-category ordinal scale was assessed at days 0, 7, 14, and 28 (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). On day 0, there was no significant difference between the groups in terms of the components of this scale. On day 7 of therapy, 19% of patients in the IFN group were discharged with no deaths. At this time, 28% of patients in the control group were discharged and 25% died. However, the difference was not statistically significant (odds ratio [OR], 0.60; 95% CI, 0.21 to 1.69). On day 14, the results were statistically significant, and 66.7% versus 43.6% of patients in the IFN group and the control group, respectively, were discharged (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.05 to 6.37). When the administration of IVIG and corticosteroid was considered a probable confounding factor, the adjusted odds ratio was 4.05 (95% CI, 1.42 to 11.55).
