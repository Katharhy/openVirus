<p>Other secondary outcomes, such as duration of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation, were not statistically different. However, more patients were extubated in the IFN group (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.019). Additionally, the 28-day overall mortality was significantly lower in the IFN than the control group (19% versus 43.6%, respectively, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.015). In multivariate analysis, the effect of IFN on the reduction of mortality was shown (OR, 2.95; 95% CI, 1.08 to 8.03). When the model was adjusted for administration of IVIG and corticosteroid as confounding factors, the effect not only remained but also became stronger (OR, 6.65; 95% CI, 1.67 to 26.45). Kaplan-Meier plot for assessment of survival was also determined (HR, 0.375; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.87; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.024) (
