<p>As a primary outcome of the study, time to reach the clinical response was not significantly different between the groups. Considering the dysregulated inflammatory response in the pathogenesis of the late phase of COVID-19, it is not surprising that antivirals do not have immediate effects in relieving the main symptoms at this stage. In the study of Hung et al., as a secondary outcome clinical improvement occurred significantly faster in the IFN combination therapy group (lopinavir-ritonavir plus interferon β-1b plus ribavirin) than in the control group, i.e., 7 versus 12 days (

Remdesivir also shortened time to recovery in mild cases, i.e., 11 days compared to 15 days in the placebo group. The definition of time to recovery was somewhat different from that of our study (
