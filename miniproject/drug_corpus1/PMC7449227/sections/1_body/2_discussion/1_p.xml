<p>The present study was the first randomized, open-label, controlled trial that assessed the efficacy and safety of IFN Î²-1a in the treatment of patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19. Time to reach the clinical response did not change following adding IFN to the national protocol medications. However, IFN significantly improved the discharge rate by day 14. The 28-day mortality also was significantly lower in the IFN group. Patients who received IFN in the early phase of the disease experienced significantly more benefits from the treatment. Some injection-related adverse effects of IFN occurred, and all were tolerable.</p>
