<p>The clinical course of COVID-19 is divided into early viral replication phase and late cytokine release phase (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). It was suggested that early administration of antiviral medications (within 7 to 10 days of the onset of the symptoms) would improve outcomes of patients with COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Additionally, early administration of IFNs was recommended in the treatment of MERS (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). The early administration of antiviral agents in viral infections can accelerate viral clearance and postpone neutrophil infiltration. Early administration of IFN β-1a, even in severely ill, mechanically ventilated patients, led to a higher survival rate. Late administration did not show more benefits.
