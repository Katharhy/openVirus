<p>Regarding the safety of IFN therapy in patients with COVID-19, injection-related reactions, including fever, chills, headache, and fatigue (early after injection), were detected in 19% of the patients. All of these symptoms responded to the supportive therapy (acetaminophen) and change in the time of injection to late night. No erythema or injection site reaction, or any reaction that caused treatment interruption, was reported. Considering the duration of the intervention, the incidence rate of IFN adverse reactions was lower than that reported in patients with multiple sclerosis (

However, it should be accounted that some patients in our study were under mechanical ventilation, and the exact evaluation of these reactions was not feasible. As a component of the supportive care in COVID-19, most patients received analgesic and antipyretic concomitant with antiviral agents and IFN. These medications might mask the adverse reactions of IFN, too.
