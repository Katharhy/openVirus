<p>IFNs may have multifunctional roles in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. IFNs are natural cytokines that are produced in response to viral infections. They can activate interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and increase the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor 2 (ACE2). Although the upregulation of ACE2 might increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, by inactivating angiotensin II, it might protect lung host cells from further injury (
