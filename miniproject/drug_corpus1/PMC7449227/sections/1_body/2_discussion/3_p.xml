<p>Among the coronavirus family, the efficacy of IFNs at first was reported in SARS (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). After the subsidence of the SARS epidemic, IFN was again proposed for treatment of another coronavirus, MERS. However, different subtypes of IFN (alpha and beta) in combination with ribavirin did not show significant efficacy in critically ill patients with MERS (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Due to promising primary effects of IFN β-1 in MERS, a trial for evaluating its efficacy is still running (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Thus, IFNs, especially type I, are still interesting options for recent epidemics. One study evaluated the effects of IFN β-1b in combination with lopinavir-ritonavir and ribavirin on mild to moderate COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In addition, nebulized IFN α-2b in combination with oral arbidol was examined for the treatment of the disease (
