<p>This study had some limitations. In this open-label, randomized clinical trial, patients in general and intermediate wards and intensive care units were recruited. Most of the general wards actually were intermediate wards, but the accurate classification was not possible due to special and emergent conditions. Due to restrictions in each pandemic event and low experience, the diagnosis of COVID-19 was according to either positive RT-PCR or signs/symptoms plus imaging findings highly suggestive for the disease. In addition, in assessing viral load, follow-up PCR and imaging was not possible due to limitations and emergent conditions.</p>
