<p>Baseline vital signs and laboratory data were almost comparable between the groups, with some exceptions. The respiratory rate was significantly higher in the IFN group. The mean blood urea nitrogen level was higher in this group. This may be due to the higher rate of diarrhea as an initial symptom of COVID-19 in this group compared to the control one (19% versus 5.1%). Diarrhea may cause dehydration and lead to higher blood urea nitrogen.</p>
