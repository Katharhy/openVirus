<p>The length of ICU and hospital stays and duration of mechanical ventilation were not statistically different between the groups, like the other interferon trial (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). However, according to the six-category ordinal scale, more patients were discharged following IFN therapy at day 14. This scale was also used in the study of remdesivir, but the same results were not detected (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). One of the remarkable findings in our study was a decrease in 28-day mortality in the IFN group that was not achieved in other studies on COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Neither in early use (within 10 days of the onset of the symptoms) nor in the late phase (10 days after the onset of the symptoms) did remdesivir significantly change mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Although the effect of IFN on decreasing the mortality of patients with severe COVID-19 is surprising, the results should be interpreted with caution and considering the limitations of the study. Four patients in the IFN group died before receiving the fourth dose of IFN. According to the protocol of the study, these patients were excluded from the final analysis for assessing mortality. Further studies are needed to confirm the results.
