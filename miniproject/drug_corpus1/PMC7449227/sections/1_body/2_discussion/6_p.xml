<p>The mean age of patients in the present study was 57 ± 15 years. The mean or median ages were different in published studies, from 46 to 65 years (

However, both hypotheses should be confirmed in future studies. At present, neither gender nor smoking is certainly correlated with severity of COVID-19 (
