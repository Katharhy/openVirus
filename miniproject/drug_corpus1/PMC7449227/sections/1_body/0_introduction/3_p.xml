<p>Interferon (IFN) subtypes were previously examined in the treatment of SARS and MERS. Primary 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experience showed antiviral effects of IFNs, especially IFN-β and IFN-γ, on SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The same results were reported for IFN-β against MERS-CoV (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Later, in an animal model, higher antiviral activity of IFN-β compared to that of lopinavir-ritonavir was shown against MERS-CoV (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The efficacy of IFN-β on MERS is still being investigated (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).
