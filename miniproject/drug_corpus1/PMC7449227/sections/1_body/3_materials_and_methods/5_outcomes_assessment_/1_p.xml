<p>The primary outcome of the study was time to reach clinical response. Clinical response was defined according to the six-category ordinal scale (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). This scale classifies patients into six categories according to the severity of the viral pneumonia: (1) discharge; (2) hospital admission, not requiring oxygen; (3) hospital admission, requiring oxygen; (4) hospital admission, requiring noninvasive positive pressure ventilation; (5) hospital admission, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation; (6) death. Time to clinical response was considered the number of days required to at least two scores of improvement on the scale or patient’s discharge, whichever occurred sooner. Secondary outcomes were duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, 28-day mortality, effect of early or late (before or after 10 days of the onset of symptoms) administration of IFN on mortality, adverse effects, and complications during the hospitalization. The following adverse effects of the antiviral regimen/IFN β-1a and complications during the hospitalization course were assessed: gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and pancreatitis), anaphylaxis and allergic reactions (rash, urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, and dyspnea related to medication administration), IFN injection-related reaction (skin erythema and necrosis, chills, fever, and flu-like symptoms after injection), neuropsychiatric (sleep disorder, psychosis, agitation, depression, and mania), renal impairment (according to KDIGO definition) (

 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), indirect hyperbilirubinemia (direct bilirubin level less than 15% of the total bilirubin) (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), incidence of thromboembolism (deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary thromboembolism), incidence of nosocomial infections, and diagnosis of septic shock (according to the surviving sepsis campaign guidelines) (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). The Naranjo scale was used for evaluation of adverse effects of IFN. In this standard scale, several items, including previous reports, relationship with starting the agent, improvement after discontinuation, challenge result, alternative causes, data of drug assay, dose dependency, and patient’s history of the same reaction were considered. Total scores of &gt;8, 5 to 8, and 1 to 4 were considered definite, probable, and possible correlations between the use of IFN and the adverse drug reaction, respectively (
