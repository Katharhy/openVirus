<p>Randomization was performed for all patients. An allocation ratio of 1:1 was accounted between IFN and the control group in randomization, but the patients had to receive at least four injections of IFN to be included in the final analysis. The randomization was performed by permuted block randomization and block sizes of 2, 4, and 6, used randomly. The statistician prepared a list of numbers for randomization. Sequentially numbered opaque envelopes were prepared according to the list, and envelopes were delivered to the clinical investigators. The statistician that performed randomization and analysis was unaware of the treatment and follow-up of patients.</p>
