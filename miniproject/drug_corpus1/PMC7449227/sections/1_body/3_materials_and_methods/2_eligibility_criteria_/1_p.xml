<p>The diagnosis of COVID-19 was according to either a positive real-time PCR (RT-PCR) of the deep nasopharyngeal secretions or clinical signs/symptoms plus imaging findings highly suspicious for COVID-19. RNA extraction was performed using the viral nucleic acid extraction kit (no. YVN50/YVN100) provided by RBC Bioscience, Taipei, Taiwan. After processing nasopharyngeal samples, rapid RT-PCR was performed by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCOV) nucleic acid diagnostic kit (PCR-fluorescence probing) from Sansure Biotech (S3102E) (Changsha, China) according to the instructions of the manufacturer.</p>
