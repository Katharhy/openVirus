<p>The analysis was performed on a per-protocol basis, and patients who did not receive at least four doses of IFN were not included. The Kaplan-Meier plot and log rank test were used to compare the number of days to reach the clinical response and survival time between the groups. The HR and 95% CI for clinical improvement and death were estimated by Cox proportional hazards model. The odds ratio was also calculated for patients who received IFN early versus late. The multiple logistic regression model was performed for the variables that were significantly different between the groups according to the univariate analysis. In the multiple logistic regression model, corticosteroid and immunoglobulin were adjusted as confounding factors, and the adjusted odds ratio was reported. SPSS software (version 24) was used for statistical analyses.</p>
