<p id="p0030">Based on the clinical and imaging data of this case, the following guidelines are recommended. If children and adolescents have a history of living or traveling in epidemic areas within one to two weeks, or they have had contact with confirmed or suspected cases, or stay in an aggregated disease environment, the possibility of their infection with SARS-CoV-2 cannot be ruled out, even when their clinical symptoms are mild and there is no typical chest imaging manifestation. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid or gene testing is required for these patients. If these tests are positive, the patient should be placed under immediate quarantine. Patients with negative results from viral nucleic acid testing need to be closely observed or to undergo CT examination of lung changes to reduce and avoid missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis of patients with atypical clinical manifestations and occult symptoms, in order to take timely isolation and prevention measures.</p>
