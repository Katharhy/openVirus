<p id="p0025">COVID-19 has a strong transmission and high concealment, and its chest imaging findings are characteristic. Some patients have imaging findings earlier than clinical manifestations. The stages of imaging manifestations include early, advanced, and severe[
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. There are few existing reports of children, and only one case report of adults[
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Children and teenagers infected with SARS-CoV-2 have mild clinical symptoms and radiological manifestations[
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and are rarely severe or critical. Mild-stage patients have mild clinical symptoms and no pneumonia on imaging[
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Thin-slide chest CT can be non-invasive and more sensitive to nucleic acids and clinical manifestations. In order to avoid missed diagnosis of the progress in this child, a chest CT examination was performed on the third and fifth days of admission. No positive signs were found, which can provide high indication for clinical judgment of good prognosis. The child's nucleic acid turned negative eight days after admission and he was then discharged.
