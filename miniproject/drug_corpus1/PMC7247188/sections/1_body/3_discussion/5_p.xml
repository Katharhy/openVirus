This pilot study survey did not include all these regions and was not representative of all individuals living with HIV or AIDS in China. We will expand the PDR study to all provinces in inland China next year. Second, the lack of drug-resistant virus transmission among IDUs in this study could be related to the sampling density. IDUs were not infected in local areas or related individuals were not recruited in this study.</p>
