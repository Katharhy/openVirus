<p id="Par52">We performed a cross-sectional study of HIV PDR in China and obtained an overall PDR prevalence of 6.8% (95% 
 <italic>CI</italic>: 6.5–7.1%). According to the WHO, low, moderate, and high levels of HIV drug resistance are defined as &lt; 5%, 5–15%, and &gt; 15% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. PDR prevalence was moderate in China in 2017. The pooled prevalence of PDR was similar or higher than those for other countries, such as Zimbabwe (6.3%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and Sub-Saharan Africa (5.5%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] but lower than estimates for Kenya (9.4%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], Argentina (14.0%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], and Mexico (15.5%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The prevalence of NNRTI PDR was 4.6% (95% 
 <italic>CI</italic>: 4.4–4.8%) in this study, which is below the 10% threshold to change the recommended first-line ART regimen [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, six countries have reported rates of PDR to NNRTI of &gt; 10% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Studies have suggested that PDR is associated with a shorter time to virological failure or increased risk of ART regimen switch [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Moreover, the most common mutation in this study was K103N, consistent with studies in Argentina, Zimbabwe, and Kenya [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Hence, routine surveillance programs for PDR in China are necessary.
