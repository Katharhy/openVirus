<p id="Par53">In this study, there were no associations between age, sex, or CD4 cell counts before ART and PDR. These results were consistent with previous results in Vietnam and Zimbabwe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. However, IDU was significantly associated with PDR, as observed in a previous study in Vietnam [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Another study has shown that IDUs receiving first-line ART have a higher rate of virological failure in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Although the overall prevalence of PDR in our study was moderate, the prevalence was high in some regions, i.e., Liangshan Prefecture of Sichuan, in Dehong Prefecture, and Lincang of Yunnan. Liangshan prefecture of Sichuan and Dehong prefecture of Yunnan are areas with serious HIV epidemics and IDUs are the main high-risk population for HIV infection. Antiretroviral treatment was initiated early and the highest rates of HIV-infected people receiving ART are in Sichuan and Yunnan.
