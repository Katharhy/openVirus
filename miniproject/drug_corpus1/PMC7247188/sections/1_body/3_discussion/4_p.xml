<p id="Par55">Transmission networks were constructed to explore whether the HIVDR related cluster was existed among PLWHA before the initiation of ART. There were no significant differences between the degrees of PDR and no PDR. However, there were five transmission networks with two or three same DRMs. Two transmission networks contained subjects from Liangshan, and one contained subjects from Dehong. Another contained subjects from Liuzhou. All these cities are in regions with the most severe HIV epidemics. One additional transmission network contained subjects from Shandong, with moderate HIV rates. There was a HIVDR related cluster contained three same DRMs in Liangshan, especially. These results suggest that PDR could be transmitted among high-risk populations for HIV infection in the future.</p>
