 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and the most important to improve the quality of life for PLWHA, the number of people receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) has increased. With the rapid scale-up of treatment, the transmission of drug-resistant viruses can become a challenge among those newly infected with HIV. Individuals infected with drug-resistant HIV strains may experience early virological failure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and the accumulation and transmission of drug-resistant strains can result in an increased mortality rate. Pretreatment drug resistance (PDR) to standard first-line ART is a challenge for HIV treatment. The WHO recommends transmitted drug resistance surveillance among recently infected antiretroviral-naïve populations of younger than 25 years old [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In 2014, the WHO proposed a global strategy for the surveillance and monitoring of HIV drug resistance, including the surveillance of PDR in populations initiating ART [

In particular, if the prevalence of PDR to non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) is ≥10% among individuals initiating first-line ART, excluding those with previous antiretroviral drug exposure, an alternative first-line ART regimen as a supplement should be urgently considered in accordance with the consolidated guidelines on the use of antiretroviral drugs established in 2016 [
