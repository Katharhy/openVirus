 <italic>pol</italic> sequences were obtained to construct genetic transmission networks. We constructed transmission networks with a genetic distance threshold of 0.0125, which identified the maximum number of clusters. In total, 754 (44.1%) sequences were used to generate 164 transmission networks (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Among all transmission networks, 70.1% (115 of 164) included 2 individuals.
