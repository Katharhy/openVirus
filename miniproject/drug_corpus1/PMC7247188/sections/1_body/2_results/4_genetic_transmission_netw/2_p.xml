<p id="Par50">Overall, 43 sequences with PDR were included in the networks and the degrees between PDR and no PDR in the networks were not statistically significant. The 43 sequences with PDR were dispersed among 23 transmission networks; shared mutations yielded five transmission networks (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The most frequent DRMs in the transmission networks was 
 <italic>K103N</italic> (7.9%, 13/164). Three transmission networks contained two PDR sequences with the 
 <italic>K103N</italic> mutation and they were from Liangshan prefecture of Sichuan province, Dehong Prefecture of Yunnan Province, and Liuzhou City of Guangxi Province. In addition, three PDR sequences with 
 <italic>E138Q</italic> and 
 <italic>V179D</italic> mutations comprised a transmission network and they were from Liangshan prefecture of Sichuan province. Another transmission network included two PDR sequences with the 
 <italic>L210W</italic> mutation from Shandong Province.
