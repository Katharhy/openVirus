<p id="Par45">During the study period, we recruited 1943 participants in total and acquired 1731 (89.1%) sequences. Twenty participants were excluded, including fourteen participants who were aged below 18 years and six without any information. Finally, 1711 participants were included in the study (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In total, 87.8% (1502/1711) of participants were ≥ 25 years old and 76.0% (1301/1711) were male. The numbers of unmarried, married, and divorced or widowed participants were 562, 873, and 271, respectively (32.8, 51.0, and 15.8%). Marital status was missing for five patients (0.3%). The majority of participants (65.9%, 1128/1711) were of Han ethnicity and 66.3% received a junior high school-level education or below. More than half (60.0%) of participants were infected via heterosexual intercourse, followed by homosexual intercourse (26.5%) and IDUs (9.4%). In total, 1076 (62.9%) patients had CD4 cell counts &lt; 350 cells/ml and 576 (33.7%) had CD4 cell counts ≥350 cells/ml. In addition, no records of CD4 cell counts were obtained for 59 patients. The proportions of the subtypes CRF01_AE, CRF07_BC, CRF08_BC, CRF55_01B, and others were 32.7% (559/1711), 37.0% (633/1711), 13.3% (228/1711), 3.7(64/1711), and 7.8% (134/1711), respectively. Participants were primarily from Southwest China (52.0%, 889/1711). None of the participants had previous exposure to antiretroviral drugs.
