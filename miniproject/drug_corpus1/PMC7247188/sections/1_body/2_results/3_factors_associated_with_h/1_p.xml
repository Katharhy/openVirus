 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>. In a univariate logistic regression analysis, four factors were significantly associated with HIV PDR. The 
 <italic>OR</italic> for patients infected via IDU versus heterosexual intercourse was 3.61 (95% 
 <italic>CI</italic>: 2.22–5.88) and that for Liangshan, Dehong, and Lincang versus other regions was 2.30 (95% 
 <italic>CI</italic>: 1.57–3.35). A multivariate logistic regression model showed that IDUs and region (Liangshan, Dehong, and Lincang) were important factors, with a
 <italic>OR</italic>s of 2.64 (95% 
 <italic>CI:</italic> 1.57–4.44) and 2.04 (95% 
 <italic>CI</italic>: 1.26–3.30), respectively.
