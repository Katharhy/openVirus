<p id="Par43">To avoid potential biases due to convergent evolution, 43 codons in 
 <italic>PR</italic> and 
 <italic>RT</italic> associated with drug resistance mutations were removed according to the most recent update of major HIV-1 drug resistance mutations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Finally, the sequences were 910 bp in length. To construct genetic transmission networks, the pairwise Tamura–Nei 93 (TN93) genetic distances [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] were calculated among all sequences using HYPHY2.2.4. Transmission networks were visualized and analyzed using Cytoscape3.5.1 with a threshold genetic distance of 0.0125 among subtypes. The genetic distance threshold was defined as the distance that identifies the maximum number of clusters in the transmission networks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The cluster included three or more same drug resistance mutations (DRMs) was defined as the HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) related cluster. The DRMs in the same clusters may be transmitted potentially. To visualize the networks, the igraph and network packages in R 3.5.0 software (the Free Software Foundation’s GNU General Public License, Auckland, New Zealand) were used [
