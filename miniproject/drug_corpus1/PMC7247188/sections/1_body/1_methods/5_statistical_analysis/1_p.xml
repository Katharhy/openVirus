<p id="Par44">In this cross-sectional study, we collected baseline data and obtained subtypes after sequencing analysis of participants. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the potential factors associated with pretreatment drug resistance. We adjusted age, sex, marital status, ethnicity, year of education, route of infection, CD4 cell counts before ART, subtype, and region for each participant. We constructed multivariate logistic regression model in a stepwise manner to select variables independently associated with drug resistance. Odds ratio (
 <italic>OR</italic>) and adjusted odds ratio (a
 <italic>OR</italic>) with 95% confidence interval (95% 
 <italic>CI</italic>) were reported. All tests were two tailed and a 
 <italic>P</italic>-value &lt;â€‰0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS V9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
