<p id="Par5">According to the tradition, based on local chronicles (Wallis 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2006</xref>) and stratified in various nineteenth-century literary narratives, the contagion was caused by a box of clothes imported from London by Alexander Hadfield, the village tailor. A few days after receiving the package, probably infested with infected fleas, George Viccars, Hadfield's assistant, died of the plague. Although some modern epidemiological studies accept this version (Massad et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2004</xref>), the real cause of the epidemic remains unclear: several authors believe, for example, that the outbreak of the epidemic was rather caused by an enzootic reservoir of wild rodents (Coleman
