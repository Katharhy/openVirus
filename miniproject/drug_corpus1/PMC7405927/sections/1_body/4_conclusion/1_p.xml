<p id="Par34">Today's world is certainly more complicated than the rural English society of the 1600 s and the COVID-19 pandemic did not have its main outbreak in a village of 700 souls, but in Wuhan, a city of 11 million inhabitants, and that main outbreak has been followed by several others, scattered all around the world. It would be quite naive to infer that the same 
 <italic>actions</italic> undertaken in Eyam could magically sort things out. Nevertheless, the history of Eyam and its voluntary quarantine, read in the light of Upshur’s 
 <italic>principles,</italic> can be an interesting ethical paradigm, useful in providing guidance on how to understand and deal with some aspects of the current situation.
