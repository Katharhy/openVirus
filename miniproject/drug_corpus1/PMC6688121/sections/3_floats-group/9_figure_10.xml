  <p>Bayesian phylogenetic inference software packages generate a large number of posterior trees, potentially annotated with inferred ancestral traits. This collection of trees is often summarized using a consensus tree, allowing to plot a single tree with posterior support values on the internal nodes. DensiTree enables drawing all posterior trees in the collection; areas where a lot of the trees agree in topology and branch lengths show up as highly colored areas, while areas with little agreement show up as webs (
   <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). We refer to 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> for the color legend of the host species, as the legend drawn by DensiTree was not very readable and could not be edited (in terms of its textual information).
