  <p>Focusing on real-time tracking of several viruses, Nextstrain (
   <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) provides up-to-date visualizations of phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses, the latter with an animation over time similar to SpreaD3 (
   <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Shown here is the current situation for Zika virus evolution, based on analyses of 506 genomes sampled between February 2013 and September 2017 from 32 countries around the world (see the figure legend), corresponding to samples taken in 6 different regions of the world: China, Southeast Asia, Japan and Korea, Oceania, South America, and North America.
