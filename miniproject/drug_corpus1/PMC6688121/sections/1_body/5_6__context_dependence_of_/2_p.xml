<p>Investigations of more established epidemics usually involve much larger sample sizes, are more retrospective-oriented in design and incorporate more heterogeneous information, and therefore benefit from more extended visualization frameworks. For most of these globally prevalent pathogens, clinical and phenotypic information is often available and questions relate to the population- or patient-level dynamics of viral adaptation and the identification of transmission clusters. For example, the selection of the virus strain composition of the seasonal influenza vaccine is informed by analyses and visualizations of circulating strains and their antigenic properties using the nextflu framework (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>). Other diverse examples include investigations of the impact of country-specific public health interventions on transmission dynamics (
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>), the identification of distinctive socio-demographic, clinical and epidemiological features associated with regional and global epidemics (
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>–
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>) and large-scale modeling of epidemiological links among geographical locations (
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>–
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>). In these settings, relevant software packages should consider the scalability of large phylogenies and allow user-friendly exploration of heterogeneous and customized annotations. Overall, it is anticipated that future work on visualization tools, accompanying analysis and visualization software developments as described above, will result in a merging of these two epidemic perspectives, with the development of context-independent visualization software tools that can handle both scenarios equally well.
