<p>The SpreaD3 visualization in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> is an example of an increasing trend toward web-based software tools that can run in any modern browser, making them compatible with all major operation systems, without requiring any additional software packages to be installed by the user. A distinction can be made between browser-based tools that are able to work without internet access [Phylocanvas; (

 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>), IcyTree; (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), SpreaD3; (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>] or that are only accessible online [iTOL; (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), phylo.io; (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>)]. Web-based visualization platforms enhance collaborations and output dissemination in a very efficient and simple manner through their ability to share web links of complex and pre-annotated tree visualizations. Transferring genomic data and associated data to an online service may invoke privacy issues which is not the case for tools that execute data processing purely on the client side. By contrast, online accessible visualization tools such as iTOL (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) offer tree management possibilities to organize and save different projects, annotated datasets and trees for their users. These online packages typically also provide export functionalities to facilitate the production of publication-quality and high-resolution illustrations [see also MrEnt; (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>), Mesquite; (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>)], directed toward end-users with minimal programming experience.
