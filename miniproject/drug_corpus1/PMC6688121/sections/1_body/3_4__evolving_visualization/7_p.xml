<p>Finally, browser-based packages such as SpreaD3 employ JavaScript libraries (e.g., D3) to produce dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers, known specifically for allowing great control over the final visualization. Custom programs are also typically written in R as a long list of popular R libraries are readily available, with ggplot2 quickly rising to popularity and finding use in both R and Python languages. A system for declaratively creating graphics based on

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> shows an example of ggtree, which extends ggplot2 and is designed for visualization and annotation of phylogenetic trees with their covariates and other associated data (

 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>) for visualizing phylogenetic trees (

Given that these types of libraries contain many tried-and-tested functions that save substantial time when creating novel software packages, future visualization efforts are likely to see increased usage of readily available visualization libraries in programming languages such as R, Python and JavaScript.
