<p>In the previous sections, we have already covered a wide range of software packages for visualizing phylogenetic trees as well as their associated metadata, which may or may not be used in a joint estimation of sequence and trait data [for an overview of integrating these data types in various inference frameworks for pathogen phylodynamics, we refer to (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)]. We here organize our visualization examples into different broader categories: different approaches toward visualizing associated trait data with a focus on phylogeography (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>), and finally custom-written code or applications that focus on assessing phylogenetic uncertainty (
