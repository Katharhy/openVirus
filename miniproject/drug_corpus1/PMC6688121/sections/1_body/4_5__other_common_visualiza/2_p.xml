<p>A variety of other summary statistics computed over the course of a phylogeny also benefit from visual representations, such as for the basic reproduction number and its rate of change as a function through time (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). Closely related are lineage-through-time plots (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>) that allow exploring graphically the demographic signal in virus sequence data and revealing temporal changes of epidemic spread. Neher et al. (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>) plotted cumulative antigenic changes over time by integrating viral phenotypic information into phylogenetic trees of influenza viruses, thereby providing additional insights into the rate of antigenic evolution compared to representations of neutralization titers that are traditionally transformed into a lower-dimensional space (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). Another example relates to reconstructions of phylogeographic diffusion in discrete space, where patterns of migration links are typically projected into a cartographic context, but quantitive measures are additionally computed including the expected number of effective location state transitions (known as “Markov jumps”). Information on migrations in and out of a location state can be obtained by visualizations of the number of actual jumps between locations as well as the waiting times for each location, either as a total or proportionally over time (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>–
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>).
