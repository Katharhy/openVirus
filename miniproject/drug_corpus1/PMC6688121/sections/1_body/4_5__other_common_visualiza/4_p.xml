<p>Finally, in order to compare two or more trees that are estimated from the same set of virus samples, but differ in the method used for tree construction or in the genomic region considered, tanglegrams provide insightful visualizations. The most popular use case is the comparison of two trees displayed leaf-by-leaf-wise with differences in clustering highlighted by lines connecting shared tips (
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>). Alternatively, tanglegrams allow mapping tree tip locations to mapped geographical locations using GenGis (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>). The Python toolkit Baltic (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>, which are advanced sequential tanglegrams to compare a series of trees (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>). The use of phylogenetic networks, which are a generalization of phylogenetic trees, can also visualize phylogenetic incongruences, which could be due to reticulate evolutionary phenomena such as recombination (e.g., HIV-1) and hybridization (e.g., influenza virus) events (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>). Tanglegrams and related visualization of sets of trees [e.g., DensiTree (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>); see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>] provide a qualitative and illustrative comparison of trees, buy this may prove to be less suited for the interpretation of extremely large trees or sets of trees. Recent quantitative approaches allow the exploration and visualization of the relationships between trees in a multi-dimensional space of tree similarities, based on different tree-to-tree distance metrics that identify a reduced tree space that maximally describe distinct patterns of observed evolution [Mesquite; (
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>), R package treespace; (
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>)].
