<p>The inference of transmission trees and networks (“who infected whom and when”) using temporal, epidemiological and genetic information is an application of phylodynamics that has made substantial methodological progress in the last decade (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>–
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). Different from phylogenetic trees that represent evolutionary relationships between sampled viruses, transmission trees describe transmission events between hosts and require visualizations that are tailored to the analysis objectives (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>–
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>). Consensus transmission trees, such as maximum parent credibility (MPC) trees (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>) or Edmonds' trees (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>), visually alert the user on putative infectors (indicated with arrows), corresponding infection times and potential super-spreaders. (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>) use the Cytoscape framework (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) for drawing the transmission trees, and a similar adaptation of the original biological network-oriented framework has been done by PastML (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) (see above).
