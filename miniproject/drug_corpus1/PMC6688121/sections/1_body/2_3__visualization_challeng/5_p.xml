<p>A third challenge consists of the visual integration of metadata with phylogenetic trees—often in the form of either a discrete and/or continuous trait associated with each sequence—which is in part related to the previous challenge concerning uncertainty of trait reconstructions. Incorporating virus trait information (e.g., drug resistance mutations, treatment activity scores) or host characteristics (e.g., gender, age, risk group) in phylogenetic inference can substantially facilitate the interpretation for end users and accelerate the identification of potential transmission patterns. Tree reconstruction and visualization software generally share a set of basic operations for coloring taxa, branches or clades according to partial or exact label matches. While these annotations can be performed manually using a graphical user interface, this can be time-consuming and is prone to errors. Hence, several software programs offer functionalities to automate the selection and annotation of clades of interest, for example through the use of JavaScript libraries [e.g., PhyD3; (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), SpreaD3; (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>)]—also see 
 <bold>Figure 3</bold>—or Python toolkits [e.g., ETE; (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), Baltic; (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>)]. Alternatively, drag-and-drop functionality of plain text annotation files generated with user-friendly text editors facilitate this process, as is for example the case in iTOL (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). These scripting visualization frameworks also foster more intense tree editing through their functionalities to annotate inner nodes, clades and individual leaves with charts (pie, line, bar, heatmap, boxplot), popup information, images, colored strips and even multiple sequence alignments. Even more advanced integration efforts entail the superimposition of tree topology with layers of information on geographical maps, such as terrain elevation, type of landcover and human population density [e.g., R package seraphim; (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>)].
