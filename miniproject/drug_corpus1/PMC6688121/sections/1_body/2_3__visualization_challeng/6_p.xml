<p>Finally, visualization and accompanying interpretation are a critical component of infectious disease epidemiological and evolutionary analyses. Indeed, many researchers use visualization software during analyses for data exploration, identifying inconsistencies, and refining their data set to ensure well-supported conclusions regarding an ongoing outbreak. As such, the visualizations themselves are gradually refined and improved over the course of a research project, with the final figures accompanying a publication often being post-processed versions of the default output of a visualization package or customly designed to attract a wide audience, both through the journal's website and especially social media [see e.g., (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>)]. On the other hand, the advent of one-stop platforms [MicroReact; (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>) and Nextstrain; (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), also see

Applications that are exclusively tailored toward tree manipulation and viewing are starting to offer management services and registration of user accounts [iTOL; (
