<p>An excessive inflammatory response to SARS-CoV2 has been thought to be the major cause of disease severity and death among patients with COVID-19 in the ICU setting.

 </sup> In this context, exaggerated neutrophil and macrophage/monocyte proinflammatory activation may trigger development of immune dysfunction, including immune tolerance (defective response to bacterial products, eg, lipopolysaccharide) and reduced host immune capacity against bacterial infections.

 </sup> Such inflammatory mechanisms can be relevant in the development of immunosuppression in sepsis survivors, consistent with reduced HLA-DR expression on monocytes after an initial activation of immune cells during sepsis syndrome.
