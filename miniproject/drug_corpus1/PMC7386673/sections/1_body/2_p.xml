<p>A recent examination of HLA variations among the world population revealed a significant impact of HLAs on the cellular immune response, in particular, on peptides from coronavirus-infected patients. HLA-B*15:03 exhibited the greatest capacity to present highly conserved, shared SARS-CoV2 peptides to immune cells.

 </sup> Subsequent studies have recently confirmed that immune dysregulation in COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure is associated with a significant downregulation of monocyte HLA-DR.
