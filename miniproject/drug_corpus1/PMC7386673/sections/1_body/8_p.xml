<p>Diabetes and obesity are leading causes of the morbidity and mortality associated with viral infection–related cardiovascular complications. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a serious preexisting metabolic syndrome with adverse outcomes in patients with hemagglutinin type 1 and neuraminidase type 1 (influenza strain) (H1N1) influenza and SARS-CoV2 in ICU.

 </sup> Diabetes-related hyperglycemia is closely linked to thedevelopment of acute ketoacidosis and other metabolic alteration, as well as chronic low-gradeinflammation.

 </sup> A possible impact of T2DM on mortality due to viral infections is the abundance of glucose that favors virus replication. Diabetes is also characterized by innate immunity dysfunction, including reduced chemotaxis, phagocytosis, andpathogen killing by monocytes and polymorphonuclear neutrophils.

 </sup> Interestingly, it has been suggested that HLA regulates immunoreactive inflammation or infection associated with type 2 diabetes. However, the role of HLA alleles in pathogenesis of T2DM and T1DM, and subsequent complications are less clear, as both positive and negative associations of DR alleles have been observed.

 </sup> Such discrepancies are likely because diabetes mellitus is a multifactorial disease. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to determine if a decrease of specific HLA-DR alleles contributes to worst outcome in patients withdiabetesand critically illobese patients with COVID-19.
