<p>Several epidemiological studies have shown that aging is disproportionally linked to more cases, increased severity of organ injury, and mortality related to COVID-19.

 </sup> This is a significant issue because aging is characterized by a collective loss of immune responsiveness and paradoxically low-grade chronic inflammation (“inflammaging”).

 </sup> Importantly, although CD14
 <sup>+</sup>CD16
 <sup>+</sup> monocytes significantly increased with age, but they also displayed reduced HLA-DR surface expression in the elderly.

 </sup> It is important to note that a reduced abundance of HLA-DR is likely not a sole biological event becausemany hallmarks of aging are coupled with host–coronavirus interactions in direct and indirect ways, including genomic instability, reduced mitochondrial function, epigenetic alterations, telomere attrition, and impaired autophagy.

 </sup> In particular, mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic profile of immune and alveolar epithelial cells play a crucial role in bioenergetic maladaptation in response to viral infections.

 </sup> Mitochondrial antiviralsignaling (MAVS) proteins can be released/activated upon viral infection, including SARS-CoV2. MAVS-mediated apoptosis can be suppressed by viral proteins and prevent mitochondrial death or apoptosis to limit virus propagation.

 </sup> On the other hand, leukopenia developed in approximately 70% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and the mechanism of this cell line death/exhaustion remains to be determined.
