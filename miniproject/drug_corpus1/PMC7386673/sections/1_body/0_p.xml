<p>Despite remarkable progress in understanding the immune response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), optimal management of immune function during severe viral infections remains a major issue among critically ill patients. In this issue of

 </sup> revealed serious concerns about the development of immunosuppression among coronavirusdisease2019 (COVID-19) patients requiring hospitalization in an intensive care unit (ICU). A significant number of patients appeared to develop immune dysfunction, as evidenced by reduced amounts of monocytic human leukocyte antigen-DR (mHLA-DR). A similar observation has been reported in patients who survive severe sepsis or trauma, but later develop life-threatening immunosuppression.
