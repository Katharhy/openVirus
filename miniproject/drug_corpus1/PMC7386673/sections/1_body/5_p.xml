<p>Notably, the mechanisms underlying the downregulation of HLA-DR in sepsis and trauma are also not well understood. Nevertheless, once HLA-DR is decreased or deficient, this event upregulates surface expression of the negative co-stimulatory molecules programmed death 1 (PD-1), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), and their corresponding ligands, such as PD-1 ligand (PD-L1). These actions can compromise innate and adaptive immune systems, including cluster of differentiation (CD)8- and anergic CD4-positive T cells, and inducing T cell apoptosis. It could be speculated if these are relevant immunosuppressive mechanisms associated with severe SARS-CoV2 infections (Figure). Furthermore, although HLA-DR is diminished in monocytes during sepsis and viral infection, many other events can trigger immunosuppression, including T cell senescence, exhaustion, and skewing toward the TH17 phenotype.
