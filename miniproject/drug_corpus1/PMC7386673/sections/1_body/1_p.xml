<p>HLA-DR is a class IIhuman leukocyte antigen (HLA) expressed on the cell surface of antigen-presenting cells, including monocytes, differentiated macrophages and dendritic cells, as well as B cells. Since the first description of role of HLA-DR in immunosuppression,

 </sup> HLA-DR expression on monocytes has been subsequently proven to be a reliable marker for evaluating immune dysfunction and risk of secondary bacterial infections in sepsis and trauma patients.

 </sup> Thus, reduced amounts of HLA-DR can also place COVID-19 patients at high risk of secondary and severe bacterial nosocomial infections. This observation is consistent with a clinical report of secondary bacterial infections and end-organ injury among COVID-19 patients requiring ICU care.
