<p id="Par16">Finally, several authors reported cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The main etiopathological hypothesis involves “molecular mimicry”, by which specific viral antigens and myelin or axonal epitopes may lead to cross-reactive of immune responses and inflammatory damage of the peripheral nerve fibres. Toscano and colleagues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] described five patients who developed GBS 5–7 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms: Three of them presented an axonal variant, whereas two had a demyelinating form. Interestingly, CSF was negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in all cases, and anti-ganglioside antibodies were not detected in the three patients who were tested. A similar case was reported by Camdessanche et al. who described a 64-year-old man with a demyelinating form of GBS whose CSF is negative for anti-ganglioside antibodies [
