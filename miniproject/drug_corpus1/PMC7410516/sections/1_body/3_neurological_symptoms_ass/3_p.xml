<p id="Par14">One of the first cases of COVID-19 with positive neurological signs was reported by Yin et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], who described a patient with severe cognitive impairment, bilateral ankle clonus, positive Babinski, and meningeal signs. However, head CT scan was unremarkable and viral genome was not detected in the CSF. Nonetheless, similar findings have been reported as well in other patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] whose cerebral spinal fluid tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, suggesting COVID-19-related encephalitis. In one patient, brain MRI showed a signal hyperintensity in the medial temporal lobe on T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences, consistent with the hypothesis of ongoing acute encephalitis. Furthermore, shreds of evidence have shown that SARS-CoV-2 can elicit a cytokine storm, which in turn might be associated with severe organ damage, including the CNS. Poyiadji et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] reported a patient with acute haemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy, a rare complication of specific viral infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] which has been linked to intracranial cytokine storms. In this patient, brain CT and MRI detected inflammatory lesions involving the medial temporal lobes along with the thalami and the insular regions. Moreover, we should consider that cytokine storms have been linked to the onset of multiple organ failure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]; hence, they could also indirectly affect the nervous system.
