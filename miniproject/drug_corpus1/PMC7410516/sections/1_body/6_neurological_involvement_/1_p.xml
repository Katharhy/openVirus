<p id="Par22">COVID-19 seems to have a relatively low prevalence in children, which represent from 1.7 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] to 2.4% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] of patients. In Italy, 1.9% of reported cases were &lt; 19 years old [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Nonetheless, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows different characteristics in children compared with the adult population, such as a longer incubation period (6

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]), a milder course and a reduced fatality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Furthermore, typical symptoms of COVID-19 like fever, cough and shortness of breath have been reported less frequently in children [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Focusing on the neurological features, headache has been reported in up to 28% of the cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>], being the principal neurological symptom, followed by confusion, in this age group [
