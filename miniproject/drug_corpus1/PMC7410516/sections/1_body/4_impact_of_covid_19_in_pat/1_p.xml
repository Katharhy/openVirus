<p id="Par17">SARS-CoV-2 infection has impacted on the health and well-being of patients with chronic neurological diseases. In fact, despite the lack of published evidence, it seems reasonable to presume that patients with chronic neurological disorders may both be at increased risk of contracting the virus (i.e. for primary or acquired immune deficiencies, higher risk of hospitalization and daily living in institutions) and of experiencing a more severe infection. Nonetheless, SARS-CoV-2, like other pathogens, may re-exacerbate or worsen previously diagnosed neurological diseases. For these reasons, many national and international scientific societies and disease foundations dealing with neurological disorders have acted to adequately inform, prevent and treat these patients [

While enlightening the general lack of evidence about the risks of IST in milder forms of COVID-19, they recommended that clinicians should consider interrupting treatment in case of comorbidities or worsening of symptoms. However, there are contradictory opinions on this issue, since other authors suggest that the moderate immunosuppression induced by MS treatments may protect from developing more severe forms of COVID-19 [

In addition to this, authors expressed their doubts about the short-term usage of high-dose corticosteroids in MS relapses during the pandemic, since it does not influence the final degree of recovery and could be associated with a higher risk of viral reactivation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]; therefore, they advised to keep a high threshold on the administration of such treatment. In patients requiring a high-efficiency therapy for MS during this period, natalizumab might be a better choice compared with other treatments that could lead to complications, such as transient lymphopenia, or increase hospital accesses for monitoring drug levels. No special advice so far has concerned children with MS [
