<p id="Par18">Patients affected by neuromuscular diseases (NMD) should also be considered a population at more prone to COVID-19 complications [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Some of them may be at higher risk for infection, such as those with the involvement of swallowing and breathing muscles, with other comorbidities or under IST (such as steroids). Furthermore, infections can be a trigger for disease exacerbation or progression in NMD, like in myasthenia gravis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] or spinal muscular atrophy, and patients with NMD and acute respiratory illnesses present a much higher risk of respiratory failure and need for intensive care. Hence, clinicians should consider that COVID-19 might not represent an exception to this evidence, and therefore worsen clinical conditions of patients with NMD or unmask previously undiagnosed pathologies. There are no current indications for interrupting or changing an ongoing therapy, even with immunosuppressant drugs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]; however, careful surveillance of these patients should be advisable. Finally, a global pandemic is certainly a stressful event that can affect both physical and mental health, quality of sleep and daily routines. In this sense, patients with migraine or other headache disorders may be more prone to be affected by those stressors and experience more severe or more frequent headache episodes.
