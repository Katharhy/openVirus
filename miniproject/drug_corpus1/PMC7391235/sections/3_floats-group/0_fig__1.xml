  <title>Neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19.</title>
  <p>The SARS-COV-2 enters the body through various routes and causes systemic and tissue inflammation. Systemic inflammation compromises the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and floods the brain with pro-inflammatory factors. The virus may also cross the BBB at the level of the circumventricular organs or through retrograde axonal transport via olfactory bulb and infect the brain, thus instigating reactive gliosis, which leads to an increased production and secretion of cytokines and other pro-inflammatory factors. The combination of systemic inflammation, hypoxia resulting from respiratory failure and neuroinflammation may trigger or exacerbate psychiatric diseases.</p>
