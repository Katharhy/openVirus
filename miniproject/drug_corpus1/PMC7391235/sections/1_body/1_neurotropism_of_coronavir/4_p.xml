<p id="Par10">The virus can also enter the brain through infecting endothelial cells lining brain vasculature; an electron-microscopic analysis of the frontal lobe identified SARS-COV-2 viral particles in the endothelium with some indications for virus transit to the neuropil

Post-mortem analysis of nervous tissue from tissue of a 54 years-old man who died from severe respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 identified SARS-COV-2 viral particles in the olfactory nerve, in the gyrus rectus and in the brainstem with signs of profound damage to all elements of the tissue including glial cells, neurones, their axons and myelin
