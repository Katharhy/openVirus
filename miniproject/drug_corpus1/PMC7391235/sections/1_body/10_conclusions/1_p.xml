Investigations of previous viral respiratory epidemics have demonstrated the onset of a wide range of psychiatric disorders over the course and in the aftermath of the infection. The pandemic of Spanish flu in 1918–1920 instigated speculation of the causative role of viral infection in the pathogenetic mechanism of behavioural disorders in bipolar and schizophrenic subjects. Karl Menninger was one of the first to declare that he was persuaded that dementia praecox (as schizophrenia was called in those days) is, in majority of instances, a somatopsychosis, “the psychic manifestations of an encephalitis”
