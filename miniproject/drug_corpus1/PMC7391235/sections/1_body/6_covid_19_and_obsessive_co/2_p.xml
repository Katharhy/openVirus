<p id="Par24">Beyond any doubt immune dysfunction plays a causative role in childhood-onset OCD where the sudden onset of obsessive compulsive signs and tics occurs in the aftermath of a streptococcal infection, with subsequent production of auto-antibodies against neuronal antigens of the basal ganglia

 </sup>, further supporting the notion that an alteration of the immune system may be implicated in the pathobiology of these disorders. Numerous investigations have shown a correlation between circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines levels and OCD

 </sup>. Increase in blood concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in OCD patients was detected when compared to normal controls paired by gender, age, and educational level

 </sup>. These findings are in agreement with results of studies investigating drug-naïve, comorbidity-free OCD subjects

 </sup>. The observation that pro-inflammatory cytokines are increased in a study that eliminated any confounding factors, such as anxious or depressive comorbidity or the effects of psychotropic drugs, represents a more convincing support for the idea that immunological abnormalities contribute to the origin of OCD

 </sup>. Systemic inflammation which is the prominent feature of COVID-19 may therefore trigger OCD in surviving subjects.
