<p id="Par23">A growing body of literature reported the occurrence of obsessions and compulsions in patients who had recently recovered from viral encephalitis

 </sup>. Already in 1930s more than a third of cases of obsessive and compulsive disorders (OCD) were recognised an organic in pathogenesis, and linked with Von Economoâ€™s encephalitis

 </sup>, to the six OCD patients with anamnesis of viral encephalitis

 </sup>. Beside these early examples, more recently, high levels of Borna virus immune complexes and viral components (proteins, RNA) were detected in the blood and in peripheral mononuclear cells of OCD patients, reinforcing the notion of a significant link between viral infection and OCD in predisposed subjects

 </sup>. In this scenario, since functional neuroimaging demonstrated OCD implies alterations in the striato-thalamo-cortical circuits, it was of interest that activity of these circuits may be affected in viral infection, possibly through interferences with glutamate transmission
