<p id="Par17">Systemic and tissue immune response contribute to the pathophysiology of numerous neuropsychiatric diseases through modifying neurochemical environment, synaptic transmission and plasticity, synthesis and secretion of neurotrophic factors, neurogenesis, and brain connectome. In this context, the major depression disorder (MDD) is one of the most frequent neuropsychiatric disorders linked to inflammatory injury to the brain. A large body of evidence has associated depression symptoms to pro-inflammatory factors

 </sup>. This link specifically applies to subtypes of depression occurring in the elderly. Ageing substantially affects the levels and the activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the CNS. Systemic infection can itself trigger major depression in elderly patients, because of age-dependent decrease of immune homoeostasis
