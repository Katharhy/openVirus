<p id="Par18">Severe cases of COVID-19 are almost invariably accompanied with excessive host immune response, mainly characterised by a massive increase in plasma levels of IL-6, which directly correlates with an unfavourable outcome of the disease

 </sup>. At the same time abnormally high concentrations of IL-6 were detected in the cerebral spinal fluid of suicide attempters

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>

 </sup> and of mothers with post-partum depression
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>
 </sup>. A large body of evidence demonstrated that changes in IL-6 levels, both in plasma and in the brain, are implicated in the emergence of depression, although other factors, environmental or genetic in nature, provide an important contribution
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>
 </sup>. In the CNS IL-6 acts as a pro-inflammatory mediator, which promotes synthesis and secretion of additional inflammatory factors and acute phase proteins by astrocytes and microglia
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>
 </sup>. Thus IL-6, together with TNF-α and IL-1β, can be considered as one of the primary regulators of the immune response in the brain, while astrocytes and microglia are the major responders to IL-6, as well as prominent producers of IL-6 stimulated by damage and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (including viruses and their components), neurotransmitters and pro-inflammatory messengers

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>
 </sup>. Physiological plasma levels of IL-6 in adults range between 1–10 pg/ml whereas in a systemic inflammation is raises to several ng/ml;
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>
 </sup> and even higher concentrations were reported for COVID 19
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>
 </sup>. Incidentally, high levels of IL-6 have been detected in the plasma, in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in the post-mortem prefrontal cortex of subjects with suicidal ideation, with non-fatal suicide attempts or committed suicides
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>
 </sup>. At the same time no direct correlation was found between plasma and CSF concentrations of IL-6 in subjects with suicide attempts, nor such correlation was detected for scores of depression severity
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>
 </sup>. The IL-6 levels in circulation also correlated with suicide endophenotypic behaviours, such as personality trait disorders, aggressivity and impulsivity
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>
 </sup>. This is in agreement with numerous findings proving the role of cytokines in regulating emotions and behaviours through interacting with specific brain areas and different neuronal pathways
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>
 </sup>. COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant changes in lifestyle and interpersonal relationships condemning many to prolonged loneliness. These conditions of psychosocial stress can also have a detrimental effect on the most fragile subjects affecting their ability to modulate emotions
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>
 </sup>. Decreased control over impulsivity and feelings of fear in combination with inflammatory challenges to the brain might increase the risk of suicide.
