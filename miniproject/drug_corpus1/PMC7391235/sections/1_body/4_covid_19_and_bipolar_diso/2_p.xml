<p id="Par20">Analysis of the presence of pro-inflammatory molecules in the CSF in BD patients revealed contradictory results. Somewhat high CSF levels of IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1(MCP-1 / CCL-2), and neurofilament light chain were detected in BD subjects, although these biomarkers did not correlate with the outcome of the disease

 </sup>. A meta-analysis of CSF cytokines content in BD subjects revealed increased levels of IL-1Î², the IL-8 showed statistically insignificant rise and no changes for IL-6 were detected

 </sup>. The disparity between the levels of interleukins and chemokines in blood serum and in the CSF is another controversial issue. It is of course tempting to assume that this discrepancy is lost in COVID-19 since the overload of interleukins and chemokines, compromised BBB and activation of CNS resident and invading immune cells exacerbates the neuroinflammation and promotes a bidirectional flow of inflammatory messengers through a permeable barrier. Such a scenario, however, remains highly hypothetic and much more investigations and analysis are needed to reveal possible association of viral infection in general and COVID-19 in particular with BD.
