<p id="Par27">Generally, albeit incorrectly, it is assumed that once the trauma is over and the subject is no longer under the pressure of stress, the path for steady recovery begins, since the time heals all wounds. Unfortunately, this is not always the case because in susceptible subjects the active stress instigates brain processes whereby traumatic memories suddenly re-emerge and disturb the mental health. The persistence of these conditions generates the PTSD

 </sup>. The PTSD is no longer classified among anxiety disorders; it is considered a trauma or stress-related disorder
 <sup>

 </sup>. The pathogenetic link between inflammation and PTSD is well documented
 <sup>

 </sup>. Because of marked impact of stressors on the immune system, it is not surprising that PTSD is associated with the immune state

 </sup>. Increased concentrations of pro-inflammatory factors were observed both within systemic circulation and in the brain in the context of PTSD
 <sup>

 </sup>. Activation of neuroglia induced by heavy or persistent stressors can stimulate aberrant secretion of pro-inflammatory signals which could potentially facilitate the appearance of PTSD. Data from meta-analyses confirm a remarkable increase in pro-inflammatory molecules in subjects with PTSD, including IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">164</xref>
 </sup>. The levels of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory interleukin, have been also increased, probably in an attempt to offset the inflammatory processes triggered by stress, further highlighting a close link between inflammation, stress and PTSD
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">165</xref>
 </sup>. The occurrence of PTSD was usually associated with occurrence of low-grade inflammation
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">166</xref>
 </sup>. Beside changes in cytokines, PTSD is also connected with enhanced NF-κB expression, this transcription factor being implicated in the inflammation process and its elevated expression correlated directly with PTSD severity
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">167</xref>
 </sup>. Moreover, PTDS is usually comorbid with depression as well as with anxiety, with drug addiction and with high frequency of suicide, since all these conditions share common inflammatory mechanisms into their pathogenetic processes

 </sup>. However, it remains to be elucidated whether in all cases the relationship is mutual and what factors, along with the inflammatory ones, play a causative role in determining the comorbidities observed. The PTSD can be a likely outcome for COVID-19 sufferers. This stems not only from severity of systemic inflammation and viral invasion into the brain, but also from the gravity of stress caused by an unexpected pandemic which, for the high mortality, has a shocking value.
