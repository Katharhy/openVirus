<p id="p0025">Prolonged enforced isolation and quarantine is known to have a range of adverse effects on psychological well-being: anxiety, irritability, poor concentration, fatigue and lowered mood are common. Healthcare workers may be particularly affected, perhaps because of concerns about being away from the workplace at a time of heightened demand (see Further reading). These untoward effects can be minimized by keeping isolation as brief as possible, ensuring individuals understand fully when quarantine is essential, ensuring adequate supplies to meet basic needs, and by reducing boredom and improving communication. Psychiatrists should work with other mental health professionals in helping populations to understand that many of the experiences are shared by others and are likely to resolve as entry back into wider society becomes possible.</p>
