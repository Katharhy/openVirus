<p id="p0030">The pandemic places many healthcare professionals in previously unanticipated situations, needing to make swift difficult decisions on limited evidence under duress, having to choose between similarly affected patients when allocating limited resources, and trying to balance their commitment to providing clinical care with their own, and their family's, physical and mental needs. These pressing challenges can cause some to experience ‘moral injury’ (psychological distress resulting from actions that violate individual moral or ethical codes) and can contribute to subsequent mental health problems (see Further reading). Consultation-liaison psychiatric services and occupational mental health services could therefore be important in attending to distressed colleagues and supporting systems designed to support a psychologically robust workforce.</p>
