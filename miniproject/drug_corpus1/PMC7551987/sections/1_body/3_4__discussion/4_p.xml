<p>Notably, for scenarios where survival and virulence are both positively and negatively correlated, the time that it takes for an epidemic to reach its maximum number of infected individuals changes little across extreme values of survival (12% in the positive correlation scenario; 0.15% in the negative correlation scenario; see 
 <xref rid="viruses-12-01055-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="viruses-12-01055-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). That is, the time that it takes for an epidemic to reach its peak (however high) is not especially sensitive to evolution in virulence or survival.
