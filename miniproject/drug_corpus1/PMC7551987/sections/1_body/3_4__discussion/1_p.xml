<p>The virulence–survival relationship drives the consequences of virus evolution on the trajectory of an outbreak. In this study, we examined how different virulence–survival relationships may dictate different features of outbreaks at the endpoints of evolution (according to the positive or negative correlation scenarios). When the parameter space for virulence and survival is mapped, we find that certain outbreak metrics are more sensitive to change in free-living survival and virulence than others and that the nature of this sensitivity differs depending on whether survival and virulence are positively or negatively correlated.</p>
