 <sub>0</sub> at higher and lower survival values also does not translate to a difference in the total number of infected individuals in the first 30 days of an infection (the early outbreak window). In a scenario where survival and virulence are negatively correlated, a highly virulent and less virulent virus population can have similar signatures on a population with respect to the number of infected individuals in the first month. Thus, simply measuring the number of infected individuals in the first month of an outbreak is unlikely to reveal whether a pathogen population has undergone adaptive evolution or has evolved in a manner that meaningfully influences the natural history of disease.
