<p>More generally, our findings suggest that the ability to detect the consequences of virus evolution would depend on which feature of an outbreak an epidemiologist measures: from our analysis,

 <sub>0</sub> is most impacted by changes in virulence and survival. In addition, the total number of infected individuals in the early window and the size of the infected “peak” would each be impacted most readily by changes in virulence–survival traits. The rate at which the epidemic peak was reached, on the other hand, showed relatively little change as survival increased or between the two correlation scenarios. Consequently, it would not serve as a useful proxy for virus evolution.
