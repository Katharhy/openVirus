<p>That different features of an outbreak are differentially influenced by the endpoints of viral life-history evolution highlights how epidemiology should continue to consider principles in the evolution and ecology of infectious disease in its analyses and predictions. As not all features of an epidemic are going to be equally reliable signatures of virus evolution, we should carefully consider the data on how the dynamics of an epidemic change when making inferences about whether a pathogen population is essentially different from prior iterations (e.g., prior outbreaks of the same virus type). The results of this study suggest that carefully constructed, mechanistically sound models of epidemics are important, both for capturing the dynamics of an outbreak and for abetting our efforts to understand how evolution of survival and virulence influences disease dynamics.</p>
