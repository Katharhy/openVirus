<p>While the stochastic, sometimes entropic nature of epidemics renders them very challenging to predict [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-01055" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], we suggest that canons such as life-history theory and the evolution of virulence provide useful lenses that can aid in our ability to interpret how life-history changes in virus populations will manifest at the epidemiological scale. We propose that, in an age of accumulating genomic and phenotypic data in many pathogen–host systems, we continue to responsibly apply or modify existing theory in order to collate said data into an organized picture for how different components of the host–parasite interaction influence the shape of viral outbreaks of various kinds.
