<p>The practical process of interpreting the evolutionary consequences of signals of virus evolution should encompass several discrete steps. Firstly, we should determine whether molecular signatures exist for adaptive evolution. Adaptive evolution would manifest in observable differences in genotype and phenotype and, perhaps, in the natural history of disease. Secondly, we should aim to attain knowledge of the underlying mechanistic relationship between survival and virulence. This knowledge is not necessarily easy to attain (it requires extensive laboratory studies) but would allow added biological insight: we may be able to extrapolate how changes in some traits (e.g., those that compose survival) influence others (e.g., those that influence virulence).</p>
