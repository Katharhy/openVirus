<p>In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01055-f007">Figure 7</xref>, we observe the disease dynamics at extreme values for survival and the dynamics corresponding to the fraction of the environment that is contaminated with infectious virus. Consistent with the data represented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01055-f006">Figure 6</xref>, we observe that minimum and maximum simulations differ more substantially for extreme survival scenarios in the positive correlation scenario than for the negative correlation scenario.
