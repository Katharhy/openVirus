<p>The feature of different outbreaks that varies most ostensibly between the correlation scenarios is the time needed to reach the peak number of infected individuals. In positive correlation simulations, one can observe that the low virulence, low survival scenario (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01055-f007">Figure 7</xref>A,B) takes longer to reach the peak number of infected individuals. Most notably, however, the low virulence, low survival setting has a far smaller peak of environmental contamination and shorter tail relative to its high virulence, high survival counterpart (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01055-f007">Figure 7</xref>D). Similarly, intriguing findings exist in the comparison between the simulation sets corresponding to extremes in the negative correlation setting (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01055-f007">Figure 7</xref>E‚ÄìH). Especially notable is the difference in the length of the tail of the environmental contamination for the high virulence, low survival combination (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01055-f007">Figure 7</xref>F) vs. the low virulence, low survival combination variant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01055-f007">Figure 7</xref>H). The explanation is that, in this model, higher virulence influences (among many other things) the rate at which the virus is shed into the environment from either the asymptomatic (

  <sub>A</sub>
 </italic>) or symptomatic (
 <italic>ùúé
  <sub>I</sub>
 </italic>) host. We observe how the high virulence, low survival simulation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01055-f007">Figure 7</xref>E) features a symptomatic peak that is larger in size and is prolonged relative to the lower virulence counterpart (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01055-f007">Figure 7</xref>G). This relatively large symptomatic population sheds infectious virus into the environment for a longer period of time, contributing to the long tail of contaminated environments observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01055-f005">Figure 5</xref>F.
