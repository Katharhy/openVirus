 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01055-f002">Figure 2</xref> depicts a tornado plot that communicates the sensitivity of the model to permutations in parameters. Across features, the model is most sensitive to parameters that are considered virulence-associated (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-01055-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) and is relatively less sensitive to survival-associated parameters (
