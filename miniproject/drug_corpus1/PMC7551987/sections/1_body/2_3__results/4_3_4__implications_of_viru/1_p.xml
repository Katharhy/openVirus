<p>Having observed how outbreak dynamics are influenced by variation in traits that alter virulence–survival phenotypes, we then examined how each outbreak metric is influenced by the extreme (±5%) values of the trait combinations considered. Specifically, we assess how a change in pathogen survival affects outbreak dynamics, based on two expected relationships between survival and virulence traits.</p>
