<p>In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01055-f004">Figure 4</xref>, we observe how dynamics of the outbreak are influenced across a space of combinations of traits altering virulence (see 
 <xref rid="viruses-12-01055-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> for a list of virulence-associated parameters) and survival (see 
 <xref rid="viruses-12-01055-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> for a list of survival-associated parameters), changed by ±5% (10% overall). In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01055-f004">Figure 4</xref>D, we demonstrate how changes in virulence and free-living survival traits influence 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, with variation in virulence-related traits having the largest effect on
