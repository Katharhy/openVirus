<p>In the next analysis, we examine the epidemic consequences of varying traits associated with survival and virulence. One can consider this as a scenario where we compare the endpoints of evolution of different virus populations (corresponding to combinations of values of survival and virulence) and calculating how these evolved populations manifest in epidemic terms.</p>
