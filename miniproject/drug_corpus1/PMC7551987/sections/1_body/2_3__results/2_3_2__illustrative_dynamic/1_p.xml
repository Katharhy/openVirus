 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01055-f003">Figure 3</xref>B shows the dynamics within the environment over the course of 250 days. In these dynamics, the population begins to be fixed for susceptible hosts. The disease dynamics manifest in the shapes of the curves corresponding to exposed, asymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals. Note the long tail of the curve corresponding to contamination by the environment. The environment remains infectious even after the infected populations have declined in number. The length and shape of this tail are influenced by the free-living survival of the virus.
