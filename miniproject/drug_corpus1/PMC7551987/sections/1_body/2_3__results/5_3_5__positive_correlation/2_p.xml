<p>If hostâ€“pathogen evolution proceeds according to a positive correlation scenario, all outbreak metrics would show an increase in severity as both survival and virulence increase. Across the range of variation in virulence and survival traits considered (5% above and below the nominal value), the peak number of infected individuals increases by approximately 35%, the rate at which the peak is reached increases by approximately 16%, the total number of infected individuals after 30 days increases by approximately 98%, and
