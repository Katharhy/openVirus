<p>In a positive correlation scenario, high values for survival would be associated with high values for virulence [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-12-01055" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-01055" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Because the correlations we observe are often not exactly linear, we utilize quadrants to express a trend, allowing for some variance around the expected “line”. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01055-f005">Figure 5</xref>, the positive correlation scenario can be represented by combinations of virulence and survival residing in quadrants I and III.
