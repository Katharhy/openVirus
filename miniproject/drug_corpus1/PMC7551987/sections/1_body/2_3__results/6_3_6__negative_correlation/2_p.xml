<p>Under negative correlation, outbreak severity decreases as survival increases. Across the measured range of variation in virulenceâ€“survival traits, the peak number of infected individuals decreases by approximately 23%, the rate at which the epidemic peak is reached decreases by 0.15%, the total number of infected individuals decreases by 3%, and
