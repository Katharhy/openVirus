 <xref rid="viruses-12-01055-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> outlines the direction in which each of the virulence-associated parameters are modulated as virulence decreases or increases. An up arrow (↑) indicates the parameter increases (by an equivalent percent) when the percent virulence is changed. A down arrow (↓) indicates the parameter decreases (by an equivalent percent) when the percent change in virulence is applied. Changes in virulence are then defined, in this study, as an equivalent uniform (percent) change in each of the parameters listed above. For the purposes of our study, we modify virulence by changing all parameters associated with virulence by 5%. One could also disambiguate virulence into changes in individual subcomponents; however, that is not the focus of this current study.
