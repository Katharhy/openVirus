<p>In this study, we define virulence as the capacity to cause a disease. In order to measure it, we utilize a set of parameters that uniformly increase the rate or probability of causing symptomatic disease or the severity of those symptoms (including death). Our definition is more comprehensive than many other models of parasite virulence (e.g., [

 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-01055" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]), which tend to focus on a single aspect of the natural history of disease associated with harm to a host (e.g., the fitness consequences of an infection on the host population or the case fatality rate). Instead of having to justify a definition built around a single term (e.g., the term associated with fatality), we took a collective approach to defining virulence through all terms that foment the viral-induced onset of symptomatic disease and death. This definition allows for the reality of pleiotropic effects in viral pathogens, where adaptations can have multiple effects on the natural history of disease [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-01055" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-01055" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Our definition of virulence emphasizes terms that influence host wellness and/or are symptoms of disease. The iteration of virulence used in this study also undermines the potential for overly weighting only one or a small number of parameters under a large umbrella of virulence. Because so many varying definitions exist for virulence, we have also performed calculations according to a different definition of virulence, one that exclusively considers terms that have a detrimental direct effect on the host and neither of the terms that reflect symptoms of severe disease (
