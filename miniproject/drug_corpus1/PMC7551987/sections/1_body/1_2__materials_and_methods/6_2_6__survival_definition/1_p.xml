<p>Survival is defined as the set of parameters that, when uniformly modulated, increases the pathogen’s probability of surviving the outside environment and successfully infecting a new host [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-01055" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In our model, this includes both the waning virus rate in the environment (
 <italic>k</italic>) and the contact rate of an individual with the environment × the transmission probability of the environment to people (

  <sub>w</sub>
 </italic>). 
 <xref rid="viruses-12-01055-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> outlines the direction (increasing or decreasing) in which these parameters are modulated when survival is decreased or increased. Within both models, a (percent) change in survival is defined as an equivalent uniform (percent) change in the survival parameters.
