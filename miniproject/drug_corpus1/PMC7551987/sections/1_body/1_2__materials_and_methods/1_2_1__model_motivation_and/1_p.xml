<p>The mathematical model explored in this study is adapted from a recent one developed to investigate environmental transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during the early-stage outbreak dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with parameter values based on fits to actual country outbreak data [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-12-01055" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In this study, we utilize this model to examine questions about the evolution of free-living survival. While the phenomenon we examine is a very relevant one that manifests in the real world, we want to emphasize that none of the methods or results in this study are intended to be applied to the current COVID-19 pandemic (as of September, 2020). This study is an attempt at responsible theoretical biology, with data-informed models and inferences that are germane to the natural world. However, neither do we support the extrapolation of these findings to any particular aspect of COVID-19 nor should they inform a policy or intervention. The model applies to a number of scenarios that include outbreaks in a na√Øve host population. This describes situations such as the evolution of novel viral lineages, viral spillover events, or host shifts, where a virus with a preexisting relationship between virulence and survival emerges in a population of new hosts. Another such scenario where this model applies is one where a virus has already emerged but evolves in a subpopulation in the novel hosts before a migration event of some kind introduces the evolved virus population to a fully susceptible population of hosts.
