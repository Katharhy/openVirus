 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01055-f001">Figure 1</xref> depicts the compartmental diagram for the model. The direction of the arrows corresponds to the flow of the individuals and the pathogen through the system. Note that individuals can move directly from the asymptomatically infected compartment to the recovered compartment (bypassing the symptomatic compartment) via what we call a “mild track”. The dashed arrows represent WAIT coupling to the environment. The model is inspired by one developed to interrogate environmental transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [
