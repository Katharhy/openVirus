<p>Alternatively, the “tradeoff” hypothesis suggests that there is some intermediate level of parasite virulence [

In this scenario, too high a virulence kills the host and parasite and too low a virulence leads to failure to transmit. Applying this hypothesis specifically to free-living survival would suggest that selection for increased free-living survival should come at the expense of virulence (producing a pathogen that is less harmful to the host). Mechanistically, as a consequence of increased adaptation to a nonhost environment, a virus may be less fit to replicate inside a host [
