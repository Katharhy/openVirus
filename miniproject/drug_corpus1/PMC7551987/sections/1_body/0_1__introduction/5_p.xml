<p>In this study, we examine the epidemic consequences of different virulence–survival relationships—Positive and negative correlation—In a viral disease with an environmental transmission component. In order to measure how pathogen survival influences disease dynamics, we included an environmental compartment in our model, which represents contaminated environments that act as a reservoir for persisting pathogens, causing disease spread when they come in contact with susceptible individuals (infection via “fomites”) [
