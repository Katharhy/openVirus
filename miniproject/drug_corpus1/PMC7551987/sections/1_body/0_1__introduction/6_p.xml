<p>We find that the identity of the virulence–free-living survival relationship (e.g., positive vs. negative) has distinct implications for how an epidemic will unfold. Some, but not all, features of an outbreak are dramatically influenced by the nature of the underlying virulence–survival relationship. This indicates that signatures for evolution (adaptive or other) in a pathogen population will manifest more conspicuously in certain features of an outbreak. We reflect on these findings in light of their theoretical implications on the evolution and ecology of infectious disease and for their potential utility in public health interventions.</p>
