 <caption>
  <p>Heatmap describing the impact of varying virus virulence and survival trait values assessed across four key epidemic metrics: these heatmaps express the change in (
   <bold>A</bold>) the number of infected individuals (asymptomatic and symptomatic) at the epidemic peak; (
   <bold>B</bold>) the rate at which the epidemic peak is reached, t
   <sub>max</sub>
   <sup>−1</sup>; (
   <bold>C</bold>) the total infected population after 30 days; and (
   <bold>D</bold>) the basic reproductive ratio (
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sub>0</sub>) when virulence and survival are modulated by ±5% within the model. Contour lines are available for clarity.
