  <p>The percent change in SEAIR-W outbreak metrics as survival increases from −5% to +5% for different virulence–survival relationships (positive correlation and negative correlation). For each metric analyzed, we present the percent difference between the minimum and maximum survival values given the two hypotheses tested: (i) positive correlation between survival and virulence (comparing low virulence/low survival to high virulence/high survival) and (ii) negative correlation (high virulence/low survival to high survival/low virulence). The bars here correspond to the values (percent) in the third columns of 
   <xref rid="viruses-12-01055-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> and 
   <xref rid="viruses-12-01055-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>, which denote the differences between the minimum and maximum values.
