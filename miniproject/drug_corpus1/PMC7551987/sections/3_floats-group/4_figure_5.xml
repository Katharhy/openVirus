  <p>The expected effect of increasing survival on virulence for the two correlation models considered: here, we present a schematic of how the different hypotheses for the relationship between virulence and survival manifest on a map with a structure similar to the heat maps shown in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-01055-f004">Figure 4</xref>. The directions of the arrows depict how increasing survival would affect virulence under the two hypotheses: the blue arrow indicates the flow of an increasing positive correlation dynamic, while the direction of the orange arrow indicates an increasing negative correlation dynamic.
