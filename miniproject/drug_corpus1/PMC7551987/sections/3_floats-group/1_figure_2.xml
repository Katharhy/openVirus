 <caption>
  <p>Tornado plot showing the sensitivity of epidemic properties to individual parameter changes: (
   <bold>A</bold>) the number of infected individuals (asymptomatic and symptomatic) at the epidemic peak; (
   <bold>B</bold>) the rate at which the epidemic peak is reached, t
   <sub>max</sub>
   <sup>âˆ’1</sup>; (
   <bold>C</bold>) the total infected population after 30 days; and (
   <bold>D</bold>) the basic reproductive ratio (
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sub>0</sub>). Filled bars indicate the value of the epidemic feature when the associated parameter is increased by 5.0% from its nominal value. White bars indicate the value of a feature when the associated parameter is decreased by 5.0%. Blue coloring with checkered patterning indicates a parameter associated with survival, and orange coloring with lined patterning indicates a parameter associated with virulence.
