  <p>Schematic representation of the TMPRSS2 structure. (A): Schematic representation of the domains of TMPRSS2. Each domain is represented by different shape and color and is defined by arabic numbers listed above them. His296 (H), Asp345 (D) and Ser441 (S) are the amino acid residues that form the catalytic triad of TMPRSS2. (B): The three-dimensional model of TMPRSS2 was built according to 
   <xref rid="b0450" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref>. The catalytic domain of TMPRSS2 is shown with its surface in gold, the SRCR domain in cyan and the LDL domain in pink. The amino acid residues of the catalytic triad and of the predicted active site are displayed. (C): Three-dimensional model of TMPRSS2 in complex with the standard inhibitor camostat mesylate 
   <xref rid="b0450" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref>. The catalytic triad (
   <italic>i.e.</italic>, His296, Asp345, Ser441) and the predicted interactions of camostat with the active site residues (
   <italic>i.e.</italic>, Asp187, Asn346, Cys348, and Asn450) of the human serine protease are shown. TMPRSS2 is shown in tan. The inhibitor is displayed in black sticks with nitrogen in blue, and oxygen in red. The figures of panels B and C were drawn using the UCSF Chimera software
