  <p>SARS-CoV-2 polyproteins encoded by 
   <italic>ORF1a</italic> and 
   <italic>ORF1ab</italic>. Schematic representation of the open reading frames 1a and 1ab, which encode for polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab. Proteins composing each polyprotein are shown: (ns) indicates non-structural proteins; RNA dependent RNA polymerase and Helicase are indicated by (RdRp) and (Hel), respectively. Proteolytic sites cleaved by PLpro and Mpro are reported in yellow and green arrows, respectively. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
