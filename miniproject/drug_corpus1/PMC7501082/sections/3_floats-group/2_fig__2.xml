  <p>Diagram of the involvement of host and viral proteases in SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Activation of coronavirus spike proteins by host cell proteases occurs at different stages in the viral life cycle and in different cell localizations. The ACE2-dependent infectious entry at the cell membrane is triggered through the S protein cleavage by host proteases: furin (1) and/or TMPRSS2 (2). Intracellular activation of S protein is mediated by cathepsin in lysosomes (3) and/or by Furin in 
   <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN) (4). After the receptor recognition, the viral genome is released into the cytoplasm of the host cell (5), RNA attaches directly to the host ribosome for translation of two polyproteins (not shown). Polyprotein (pp) maturation into mature fragments is catalysed by viral Cys proteases (Mpro and PL pro) (6). RNA is translated into DNA and inside the nucleus (N) replication amplifies the number of virus genome copies (7). The viral genome produces pps, which help to take command over host ribosomes for their own translation process; protein biosynthesis starts at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and follows the constitutive secretory pathway along Golgi compartments (8). The virion assembly occurs (9) and the newly packed viral particles can egress (10).
