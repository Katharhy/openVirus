  <p>Schematic representation of the furin structure. (A): Schematic representation of the domains of furin. Each domain is represented by different shape and color and is defined by arabic numbers listed above them. Asp153 (D), His194 (H), Ser368 (S), are the amino acid residues that form the catalytic triad of furin; Asn295 contributes to the oxyanion hole. (B): Crystal structure of human furin (PDB ID: 5JXG) 
   <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. The catalytic domain of furin is shown with its surface in gold and the P-domain in green. The amino acid residues of the catalytic triad and of the binding sites of furin to the viral S protein are displayed. (C): Crystal structure of mouse furin in complex with the inhibitor Dec-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-CMK (PDB ID: 1P8J) 
   <xref rid="b0265" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Furin is shown in light blue. The inhibitor is displayed in black sticks with nitrogen in blue and oxygen in red. The figures of panels B and C were drawn using the UCSF Chimera software 
   <xref rid="b0890" ref-type="bibr">[178]</xref>. For details, see the text. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
