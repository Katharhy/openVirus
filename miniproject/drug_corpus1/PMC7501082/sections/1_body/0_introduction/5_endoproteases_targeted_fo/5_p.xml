<p id="p0040">It has been suggested that the surface route is preferred under natural conditions, while repeated passages in cultured cells

Thus, to activate the fusion machinery of the viral S protein the cooperation in space and in time of multiple membrane proteases is demanded; the actually involved pool depends on both the virus strain and the specific host cell type expression profile of proteases (thus changing for each cell type).
