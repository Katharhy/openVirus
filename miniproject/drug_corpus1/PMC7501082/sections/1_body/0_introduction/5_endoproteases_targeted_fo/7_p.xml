<p id="p0050">Unlike close relatives, SARS-CoV-2 can promptly infect a broad spectrum of human cell types, spanning from lung cells to endothelial, conjunctival and gut cells, with the respiratory district being the main target, displaying the peculiar ability to infect even the upper respiratory tract. The efficient spreading of virus relies on the protease arsenal of host cells which mediate the propagation of viral infection. The expression profile of furin and ACE2 in human cells could explain why SARS-CoV-2 is so efficient in spreading virus particles, since they are present throughout the body in endothelial cells with particularly increased levels in cells lying in alveoli and small intestine
