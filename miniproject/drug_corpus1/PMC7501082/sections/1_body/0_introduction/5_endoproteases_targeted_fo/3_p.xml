<p id="p0030">The spike glycoproteins are responsible for the crown-like appearance of Coronavirus particles (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A), playing a crucial role for the entry of the viral genome inside the host cell (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The first critical step is the binding of the homotrimeric S protein with its specific cellular receptor, which triggers a cascade of proteolytic events leading to the fusion of cell and viral membranes. Similarity in structure and sequence with SARS-CoV and

 <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The S protein is synthesized as an uncleaved precursor which includes two functionally distinct domains (
