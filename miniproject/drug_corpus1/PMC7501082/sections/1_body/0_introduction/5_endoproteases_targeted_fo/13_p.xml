<p id="p0080">Overall, two very attractive processes (which indeed represent important targets for designing anti-viral drugs), will be discussed here: (
 <italic>a</italic>) the proteolytic activation of the S protein (by furin and TMPRRS2), impairing the entry of viral genetic material inside the host cell, and (
 <italic>b</italic>) the activity of viral proteases (in particular Mpro), impairing the formation of mature viral proteins, which are required for the progression of the viral infection and replication of viruses.
