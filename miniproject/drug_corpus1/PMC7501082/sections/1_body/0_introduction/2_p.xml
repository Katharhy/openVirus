<p id="p0005">Over the past twenty years, Î²-Coronaviruses (CoV)s have caused three epidemics/pandemics, namely SARS-CoV in 2002, MERS-CoV in 2013 and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, which have been associated with acute severe respiratory illnesses. As of September 8, SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for the global COVID-19 pandemic, has been causing more than 27 millions of contagions and around 900.000 deaths worldwide (

The scientific community has come together to understand the mechanisms underlying the infection and the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as all symptoms and risk factors for subsequent mortality. Currently, there is neither antiviral nor vaccine for the severe acute respiratory syndrome induced by SARS-CoV-2. Its alarming spread and its severity across most countries elicited an effort for the elucidation of the pathogenetic features of this novel viral infection in search for effective therapeutic approaches
