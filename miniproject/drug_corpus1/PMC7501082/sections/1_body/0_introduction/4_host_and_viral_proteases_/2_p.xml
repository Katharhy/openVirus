<p id="p0015">As for common viral infections, the crucial event for the viral life cycle is the entry of genetic material inside the host cell for replication and release of new virions. During its life-cycle, SARS-CoV-2 is internalized in the host cell where the viral RNA is translated, exploiting the host cell machinery and giving rise to virus-encoded proteins of different open reading frames (
 <italic>ORF</italic>)s. The 
 <italic>ORF1</italic>, which encompasses about 75% of the viral genome, is translated into two viral replicase polyproteins (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, pp1a and pp1ab) (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> ). Sixteen mature non-structural proteins (nsp) arise from further processing of these two pps, which are autocatalytically processed by two proteases (also auto-processed), namely (
 <italic>a</italic>) the papain-like protease (PLpro), which cleaves the first two non-structural proteins (nsp1 and nsp2) at the 
 <italic>N</italic>-terminal region of the polyprotein, and (
 <italic>b</italic>) the main protease (Mpro, also known as a chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease, 3CLpro), which recognizes cleavage sites at the 
 <italic>C</italic>-terminus and brings to the production of about 11 individual mature non-structural proteins

 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The remaining 
 <italic>ORF</italic>s encode accessory and structural proteins, like spike surface glycoprotein (S), small envelope protein (E), matrix protein (M), nucleocapsid protein (N) (see 
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).
