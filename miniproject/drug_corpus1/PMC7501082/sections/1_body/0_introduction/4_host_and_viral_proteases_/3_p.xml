<p id="p0020">Since proteolytic enzymes are the major actors of the various events described in this review and although knowledge about their role is continuously expanding, it may be worth recalling that they can be roughly classified into seven broad groups (from the type of aminoacid involved as proton donor for the activation of the peptide bond to be cleaved), namely (
 <italic>a</italic>) serine protease, (
 <italic>b</italic>) cysteine protease, (
 <italic>c</italic>) threonine protease, (
 <italic>d</italic>) aspartic protease, (
 <italic>e</italic>) glutamic protease, (
 <italic>f</italic>) metalloproteases (usually employing Zn
 <sup>++</sup>), and (
 <italic>g</italic>) asparagine peptide lyases 
 <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Within each group, a further differentiation can be applied according to whether the peptide bond cleaved by the specific enzyme corresponds to a terminal residue (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, exoprotease) or else to one of aminoacids within the sequence (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, endoprotease).
