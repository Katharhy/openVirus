<p id="p0010">Little is known about the pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2, even though the availability of the virus genome sequence (GenBank ID: MN908947.3) has demonstrated crucial similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and other members of the same viral order (

 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Hence, to rapidly gain insights on molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 it is worth exploiting what we have learned from several medicinal chemistry studies on viral spreading to help us in finding promising targets for the development of anti-viral strategies for SARS-CoV-2.
