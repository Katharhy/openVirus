<p id="p0600">In the last months, some of the drugs and compounds reported previously were employed in the treatment of COVID-19. Most of the drugs, identified by molecular docking or 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cell-based assay as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, are actually potential therapeutic options, targeting different stages of SARS-CoV-2 “life cycle”. Therefore, only clinically oriented drugs are reported, such as chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, Umifenovir, Favipiravir and Lopinavir/ritonavir combination. The reason to use such drugs is that currently there are no drugs approved by FDA to specifically treat COVID-19.
