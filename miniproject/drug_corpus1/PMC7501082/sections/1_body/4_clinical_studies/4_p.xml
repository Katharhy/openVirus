<p id="p0610">The chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, originally employed for malaria treatment, deserve a further clarification, since they should block the SARS-CoV-2 viral entry into cells by elevation of endosomal pH and by inhibition of the ACE2 terminal glycosylation 
 <xref rid="b0845" ref-type="bibr">[169]</xref>, thus ultimately interfering with virus receptor binding. Unfortunately, the clinical data and the effect of hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin are mostly controversial about their efficacy in COVID-19 treatment. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have certain limitations and toxicity, especially on the heart and eyes. Considering their ocular, cardiac and neuro toxicities, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine should not be recommended as preventive drugs for the COVID-19 pandemia
