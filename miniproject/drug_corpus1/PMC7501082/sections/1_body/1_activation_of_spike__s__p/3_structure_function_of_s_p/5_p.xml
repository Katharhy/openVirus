<p id="p0105">The cleavage at the S1/S2 sites, also termed priming, can be mediated by ACE2 and furin (and/or other bio-membrane anchored proprotein convertases, namely PoCo5B and PoCo7) 
 <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Thus, in SARS-CoV-2 S the cleavage S1/S2 site 1 for furin (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, Pro Arg Arg Ala Arg689 ↓Ser Val) is conserved with respect to other CoVs (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>D). On the other hand, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein displays an additional putative cleavage recognition motif at the S1/S2 site 2 (Ile Ala Tyr ↓ Thr Met Ser) resulting from the four aminoacidic insertion (Ser Pro Arg Arg) (see 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C and D); this suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 might operate a peculiar mechanism to promote its entry into host cells 
 <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Moreover, both SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV display Pro685 at the S1/S2 junction. The turn created by Pro685 is important for the glycations of flanking residues; notably, the O-linked glycans Ser673, Thr678 and Ser686 are unique to SARS-Cov-2 
 <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. This feature might envisage an O-glycation somehow modulating the cleavability of the spike protein (
