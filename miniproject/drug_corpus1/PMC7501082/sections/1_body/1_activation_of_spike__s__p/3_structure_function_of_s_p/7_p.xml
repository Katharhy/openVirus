<p id="p0115">In addition to the canonical furin S2′ cleavage site the SARS-CoV-2 S protein shows an additional potential furin-like cleavage site (referred as polybasic insert), absent in CoV of the same clade, which in turn broadens the spectrum of proteases that can be exploited by the virus

 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>D). As a matter of fact, trypsin-like proteases (TMPRSS2) and cathepsin L have also been shown to be involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection
