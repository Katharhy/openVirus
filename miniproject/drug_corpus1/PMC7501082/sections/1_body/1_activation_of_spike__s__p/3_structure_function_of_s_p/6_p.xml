<p id="p0110">The C-terminal of the S2 domain, known as the biomembrane-anchored stalk domain, anchors the S protein to the lipid transmembrane and it is involved in the viral entry 
 <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. It contains the fusion peptide (FP), followed by an internal fusion peptide (IFP) and two heptan domains (HR)s preceding the transmembrane domain (TM) (see 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B). Noteworthy, like SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 S2 domain contains a proteolytic site S2′, found immediately upstream of the fusion peptide 
 <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, which displays the canonical furin-like cleavage site (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, Lys-Arg815↓Ser-Phe) and whose cleavage is critical for the fusion process (see
