<p id="p0140">Like other serine proteases, furin is characterized by a catalytic triad, made up of Ser368, His194, and Asp153 whereas Asn295 contributes to the oxyanion hole

 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B). Interestingly, the substrate-free enzyme is essentially inactive since the catalytic Ser368 residue is flipped over with respect to the active conformation. Substrate binding triggers the conformational change of Ser253, which brings about a flipping of Ser368 from the inactive to active conformation
