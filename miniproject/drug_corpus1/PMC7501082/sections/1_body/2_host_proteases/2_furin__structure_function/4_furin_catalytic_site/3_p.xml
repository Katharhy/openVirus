<p id="p0145">The high specificity of furin proteolysis occurs at the 
 <italic>C</italic>-terminal of a multibasic recognition motif, showing Arg-Xxx-Arg↓Xxx and Lys-Arg↓Xxx as preferred consensus sequences, often containing an additional Arg residue in the P4 position 
 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Unlike trypsin and chymotrypsin, the substrate-binding pocket is rigid and rich of negative charges, 
 <italic>e.g.</italic> Glu 257 and Asp153 at the S1 and S2 substrate recognition sites, respectively. The rigidity of the substrate-binding pocket envisages a high selectivity for substrates, which indeed must properly fit inside the recognition site interacting with (at least) 6 residues forming the minimum binding surface 
 <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The substrate Arg residue is bound to the Glu 257 side chain of the S1 site, while the positively 
 <italic>N</italic>-terminal charged residue (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, Lys) is bound to the Asp153 residue of the S2 site (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B). In particular, Asn133 is a key component of the S5 substrate binding pocket together with Glu236 
 <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, while the S4 site involves two additional negatively charged residues (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, Asp236 and Asp 264) also present at the buried interface
