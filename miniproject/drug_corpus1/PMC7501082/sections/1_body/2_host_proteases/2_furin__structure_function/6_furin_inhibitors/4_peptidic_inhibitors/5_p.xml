<p id="p0190">Nevertheless, as a result of the cytotoxicity of CMK-based inhibitors and of the instability of the CMK moiety, the potential therapeutic applications of these molecules remain limited to topical applications, such as the treatment of papillomavirus (HPV) skin infections 
 <xref rid="b0265" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. However, the incorporation of amino acid analogues, such as D‐amino acids, decarboxylated P1 arginine mimetics, and 4-amidinobenzylamide (Amba), increased the stability of peptide-derived furin inhibitors. The most powerful compound, Phac-Arg-Val-Arg-Amba (Phac being a phenylacetyl group), inhibits recombinant furin with

 <bold>,</bold> in a cellular assay
 <bold>,</bold> as an inhibitor of the cleavage of the fowl plague hemagglutinin of the H7 subtypes of the avian influenza viruses, possessing a multi-basic furin cleavage site; this limited efficacy might be related to a reduced ability of this inhibitor to target intracellular furin. The same authors also showed that this inhibitor was able to reduce feline panleukopenia virus propagation in a long-term infection test (25 μM of inhibitor over a period of 72 h, see
