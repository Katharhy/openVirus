 <xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>), which displays a 300-fold increase of the affinity (=5.5 pM, see 
 <xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>) for the substrate pocket, essentially blocking the furin activity (see 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Inhibitor MI-1148 was shown to have a significant protective effect against anthrax and diphtheria toxin and to be active against H5N1 and H7N1 avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) and canine distemper viruses (CDV) propagation in cell culture

 <xref rid="b0310" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>) and several cyclic hexapeptide derivatives were recently tested as inhibitors of the proteolytic activation and replication of respiratory syncytial virus in cells 
 <xref rid="b0315" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref> (see 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Significant antiviral activity was found for both MI-1148 and MI-1554 linear inhibitors, whereas a negligible efficacy was determined for the cyclic derivatives. The authors have speculated that the specific chemical structure of MI-1148 and other close linear analogues might enable enhanced cellular uptake, providing improved intracellular inhibitory potency.
