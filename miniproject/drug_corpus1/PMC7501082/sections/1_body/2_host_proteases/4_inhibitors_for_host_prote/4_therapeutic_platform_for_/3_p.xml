<p id="p0310">It must be stressed that, differently from viral targets, furin (like any protein hijacked by the virus system) is an attractive target as it is not expected to develop drug resistance. On the other hand, as for Ebola virus, although a furin cleavage site has been clearly demonstrated, blocking the furin-mediated cleavage of glycoprotein does not result in a reduction of viral replication under cell culture conditions, suggesting that the inhibition of furin activity may not always produce beneficial effects 
 <xref rid="b0500" ref-type="bibr">[100]</xref>. Therefore, to encourage further developments of furin inhibitors additional proofs-of-concept are required at each step of the different infectious processes.
