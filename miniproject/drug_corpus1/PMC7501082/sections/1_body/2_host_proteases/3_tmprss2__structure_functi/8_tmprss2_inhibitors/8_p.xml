<p id="p0285">Nafamostat and Camostat mesylate bind in the same pocket of TMPRSS2 and in the same way. On the other hand, due to its small structure, BHH binds the active site of TMPRSS2 with fewer hydrogen bonds and more hydrophobic interactions, as compared to Camostat mesylate and Nafamostat, establishing hydrophobic interactions with the TMPRSS2 His279, Val280, Cys281, and His296
