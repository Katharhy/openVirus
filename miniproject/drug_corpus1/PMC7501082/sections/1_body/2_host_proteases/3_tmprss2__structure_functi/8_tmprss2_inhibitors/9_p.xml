<p id="p0290">A recent analysis, based on the combination of a ligand-based pharmacophore approach and a molecular docking-based screening, allowed to identify 12 potential natural inhibitors of TMPRSS2. Among these drug-like compounds, the geniposide, that is the major iridoid glycoside of gardenia fruit (IUPAC name: methyl (1S,4aS,7aS)-7-(hydroxymethyl)-1-[3,4,5-trihydroxy-6-(hydroxymethyl)oxan-2-yl]oxy-1,4a,5,7a-tetrahydrocyclopenta[c]pyran-4-carboxylate), showed the highest docking score of −14.69 kcal/mol 
 <xref rid="b0380" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. Geniposide forms 10 hydrogen bonds with the active site residues of the receptor protein. Among these H-bonds, five TMPRSS2 amino acid residues (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, Asn146, Arg147, Arg150, Lys449, and Asn450) are side chain acceptor, and two residues (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, Asn146 and Arg147) are concurrently backbone acceptor and donor. It is known that the geniposide is an inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase 
 <xref rid="b0480" ref-type="bibr">[96]</xref> and it has anti-angiogenic activity
