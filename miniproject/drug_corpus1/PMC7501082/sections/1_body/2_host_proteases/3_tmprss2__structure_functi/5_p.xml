 <italic>TMPRSS2</italic> gene encodes for a predicted protein of 492 amino acids that belongs to the type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) family 
 <xref rid="b0370" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0375" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>. The TTSP family is characterized by: (
 <italic>i</italic>) the 
 <italic>N</italic>-terminal transmembrane domain, (
 <italic>ii</italic>) the 
 <italic>C</italic>-terminal extracellular serine protease domain of the chymotrypsin (S1) fold that contains the catalytic His, Asp, and Ser residues, and (
 <italic>iii</italic>) the “stem region” that contains a mixture of one to eleven protein domains of six different types (
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A). TTSPs are synthesized as single-chain precursor and their activation produces a two-chains form which is stabilized by a disulfide bridge, anchoring the active form to the cell membrane. Nineteen human TTSPs have been identified and may be divided into four subfamilies, namely Hepsin/TMPRSS, Matriptase, HAT/DESC, and Corin
