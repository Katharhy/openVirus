<p id="p0355">The polyproteins encoded by 
 <italic>ORF1a</italic> and 
 <italic>ORF1b</italic> are auto-catalytically cleaved into 16 different non-structural proteins (nsp) by the two viral proteases (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, Mpro and PLpro). The 
 <italic>N</italic>-terminal part, which is cleaved by PLpro, contains three proteins, namely nsp1 and nsp2, which help modulating the host response, and nsp3. PLpro activity also plays a key role in other functions, such as the deubiquitination of host polyubiquitin chains and the formation of the viral double-vesicles membranes (see 
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The rest of pp1a and pp1ab are self-cleaved by Mpro, giving rise to 13 proteins which, except for Mpro itself, play different roles in RNA replication (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, helicase, proofreading exoribonuclease, endoribonuclease and methyltransferase activities). It is worth citing here that the polyprotein pp1ab, which is encoded when ribosomal frameshift occurs, also contains the RNA-dependent RNA replicase, a common target for anti-viral inhibitors.
