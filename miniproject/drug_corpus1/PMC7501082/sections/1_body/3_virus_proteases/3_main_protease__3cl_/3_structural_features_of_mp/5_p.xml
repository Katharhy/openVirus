<p id="p0385">The quaternary structure of Mpro may also contribute to the modulation of enzyme activity; thus, the dimer interface area, which is constituted by the two domains III, seems to play a pivotal role by allowing the ion-pair interaction between residue Glu290 of one protomer and Arg4 of the other one. Moreover, in the mature protein, the “N-finger” (the 
 <italic>N</italic>-terminal residues) of each monomer forms stable hydrogen bonds with Phe140 and Glu166 of the other protomer, squeezing the outer-wall of S1 and shaping the S1 pocket to become catalytically competent

An additional contribution to the dimer stabilization may originate from the direct interaction between the residues 285 of each protomer (Thr and Ala in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 MPro, respectively); in SARS-CoV MPro this interaction occurs through a H-bond between the two Thr285 hydroxyl groups. However, this interaction, though tightening the dimer assembly in SARS-CoV Mpro, does not seem to affect the catalytic activity, since it is closely similar for the two Mpros
