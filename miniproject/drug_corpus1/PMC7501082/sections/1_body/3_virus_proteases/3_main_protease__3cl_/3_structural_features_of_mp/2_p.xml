<p id="p0370">In the mature active form, Mpro (EC 3.4.22.69) is found as a homodimer. Each protomer is formed by three structural pseudo-domains, namely two antiparallel-β-barrel domains (domains I and II, residues Phe8-Tyr101 and Lys102-Pro184, respectively), and a five-fold antiparallel-α-helix domain (domain III, residues Thr201-Thr303)

The Mpro enzyme resembles the structure of cysteine proteases, although in the active site the third catalytic residue is missing; thus, the active site is formed by the catalytic dyad His41-Cys145, which forms the “oxyanion hole” together with the main-chain amides of Gly143 and Ser144

 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B). The His-Cys dyad is highly conserved among the coronavirus proteases and shows significant structural homologies with the 3chymotrypsin protease (3Cpro) of rhinoviruses, which, however, contain a catalytic triad composed of His, Cys, and Glu or Asp

In this context, it is also worth noting that, while the autocatalytic process of viral polyproteins is performed by both Mpro and PLpro, the two proteinases have instead significantly different features. As a matter of fact, mature PLpro is a multifunctional protein composed by an
