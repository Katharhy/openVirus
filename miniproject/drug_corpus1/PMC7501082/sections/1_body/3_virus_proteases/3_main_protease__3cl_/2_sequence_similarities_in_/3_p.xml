<p id="p0365">The multiple-sequence alignment of the main proteases from the seven human coronaviruses (
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> A) shows that the active site (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, residues Thr24-Leu27, His41-Tyr54, Phe140-Cys145, His163-Pro168) is highly conserved in all the coronavirus Mpros, clearly indicating its specificity. Interestingly, from a pairwise alignment, SARSâ€“CoV-2 Mpro shows more similarities to its SARS-CoV homologue (96% identity and 99% similarity) than with any of the other six Mpros from human coronaviruses (average identity 50%, average similarity 64%). Indeed, only very few residues in SARS-CoV-2 are substituted with respect to the SARS-CoV counterpart, that is Thr35Val, Ala46Ser, Ser94Ala, Lys180Asn, Ala267Ser, and Thr285Ala. All these mutations are located in poorly conserved regions on the surface of Mpro with the exception of Ser46, which is located in the proximity of the active site entrance; the Ala267Ser mutation is also observed in the HCoV-NL63 strain. Although such a small structural change would be not expected to substantially affect the binding of small molecules to the binding sites, structural and molecular modelling studies show that Ala46Ser may have a relevant effect on the shape and flexibility of the Cys44-Pro52 loop at the active site entrance (see below), where substitutions occur quite often during the evolution of viral Mpro proteins
