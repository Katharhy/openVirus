<p id="p0490">Metabolites and molecules from Indian spices, present in PubChem and Zinc databases, were also analyzed by bioinformatics approach, virtual screening tools and molecular dynamics. The best three molecules were a) carnosol from 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic>, that exhibited hydrogen bonds interactions with residues present on the active site of SARS-CoV-2 MPro and also the highest binding affinity (−8.2 kcal/mol), b) rosmanol from 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic>, (−7.99 Kcal/mol), and c) the triterpene glucoside arjunglucoside-I from
