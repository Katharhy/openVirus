<p id="p0555">A second study displayed a variety of different drugs all tested against purified SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The groups considered were proteasome inhibitors, HIV protease inhibitors, γ-secretase inhibitors, HCV NS3-4A protease inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors, miscellaneous serine protease inhibitors, cathepsin and calpain protease inhibitors, miscellaneous cysteine protease inhibitors, matrix metalloprotease inhibitors, and miscellaneous protease inhibitors 
 <xref rid="b0780" ref-type="bibr">[156]</xref>. Boceprevir, an anti-HCV drug, inhibited the enzymatic activity of Mpro with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 4.13 μM, and an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.31 μM against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the primary viral cytopathic effect (CPE) assay. An interesting result was obtained with the protease inhibitor Gly-Cys-376 (a broad-spectrum inhibitor targeting Mpro in the picornavirus-like cluster), that showed promising antiviral activity with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 3.37 μM as well as an enzymatic inhibition with a value of IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.03 μM 
 <xref rid="b0780" ref-type="bibr">[156]</xref>. Interestingly, in another recent work, Gly-Cys-376 showed a promising high affinity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 26.4 nM and EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.91 μM) to SARS-Cov2 Mpro 
 <xref rid="b0785" ref-type="bibr">[157]</xref>. While ebselen and N3 displayed inhibition against SARS-CoV-2 with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 4.67 μM and 16.77 μM, respectively
