<p id="p0430">While in the last decades a relatively small number of docking and inhibition studies have been performed on the Mpro of the closest taxonomic SARS-CoV (the etiological agent of epidemic in 2002), the extensive production of computational research works on SARS-CoV-2 Mpro is absolutely contingent to the actual historical context that combines a common feeling in fighting the pandemic with a planetary spread of software and hardware technologies suitable for the purpose of molecular docking. In the following, for each Mpro inhibitor all the best poses of potential inhibitors often showed hydrophobic interactions and formation of hydrogen bonds network will be addressed, this finding being in line with the features of the Mpro active site as described in the first part of the section. It is important to underly that unfortunately a straightforward comparison among inhibitors cannot be accurate, since the affinity scoring functions (expressed in kcal/mol), obtained by different molecular docking processes, cannot be directly converted in terms of binding free-energy values, as they are significantly dependent on the force-fields and protocols employed.</p>
