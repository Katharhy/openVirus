 <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>B) showed high binding affinity (−9.28 kcal/mol) because its interaction is stabilized by four hydrogen bonds with Glu166 and Thr190 together with hydrophobic interactions established with eight residues. Moreover, Bonducellpin D exhibited a broad-spectrum inhibitory potential against SARS-CoV Mpro and MERS-CoV Mpro
