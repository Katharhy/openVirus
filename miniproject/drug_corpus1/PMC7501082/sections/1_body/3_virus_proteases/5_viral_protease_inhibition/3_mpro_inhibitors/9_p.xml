<p id="p0450">An interesting investigation identified a series of novel peptidomimetic aldehydes. These new compounds were designed so as to maintain the aldehyde as warhead in P1′ and holding the S1′ pocket of the Mpro active site. The most promising inhibitors, defined as 11a and 11b, exhibited anti-SARS-CoV-2 Mpro activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.053 μM and IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.040 μM, respectively), being also effective on the anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection activity in cell culture (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.53 μM and EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.72 μM, respectively). Both compounds showed also good results for a preliminary pharmacokinetic evaluation
