<p id="p0575">A pool of compounds, considered inhibitors of coronavirus replication in a clinical trial study, were validated for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assay against SARS-CoV-2 virus in Vero E6 cells; they gave the following EC
 <sub>50</sub>: 23.15 μM (remdesivir), 26.63 μM (lopinavir), 2.55 μM (homorringtonine), and 0.46 μM (emetine hydrochloride), while ribavirin and favipiravir showed no inhibition at 100 μM. Only the synergistic effect of remdesivir at 6.25 μM with emetine at 0.195 μM achieved more than 60% inhibition in viral yield. The conclusion is that a “cocktail” of antiviral drugs may reduce compound concentrations and increase inhibition of viral replication
