<p id="p0460">A first interesting approach was carried out by screening an impressive number (more than 606 million) of compounds. Shape screening, molecular descriptors relevant for pharmacokinetics and complex stability (estimated by molecular dynamics simulations) were used to significantly reduce the number of molecules to be studied. A final list of 9 compounds was selected and the natural compounds (-)-taxifolin from plant of 
 <italic>Pinaceae</italic> family and rhamnetin from plant of 
 <italic>Myrtaceae</italic> family were identified as best binders and thus potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 MPro
