<p id="p0415">In the following, we will present a discussion on inhibitors for human coronavirus Mpro. First, results for known Mpro inhibitors will be presented and recent findings on natural compounds or repurposed drugs as SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors will be also thoroughly discussed. It is worth noting that the urgency for an effective treatment against COVID-19 has deeply stimulated the scientific community to focus on the development of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors. For this reason, some of the results reported here from literature are based on computational assessments and still lack experimental validation.</p>
