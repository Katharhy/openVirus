<p id="p0435">Over one decade ago, in an interesting anti-SARS drug screening research, 59,363 compounds were docked, 93 were selected for inhibition assays, and finally 21 showed inhibition against SARS-CoV Mpro with IC
 <sub>50</sub> ≤ 30 µM. Similar substructures were found in three databases identifying another 25 compounds that exhibited inhibition with IC
 <sub>50</sub> from 3 µM to 1 mM against SARS-CoV Mpro. The promising compounds were also thouroughly investigated by 3D-QSAR and pharmacophore approaches
