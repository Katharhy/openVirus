<p id="p0645">An approach more realistic for laboratories and “a simple to undertake” method is to focus on host proteases involved in the entry of the viral genome. Thus, exploring the cellular factors, employed by SARS-CoV-2 for entry, might result in providing useful information about viral outbreak and a number of therapeutic approaches. Further, while targeting the intracellular virus cycle does not avoid the infection of cells (only impairing the further diffusion of virions), targeting instead host proteases, involved in the entry of the viral genome, means to block the onset itself of the viral attack. In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, which relies on ACE-2, furin and TMPRSS2 can be limited by protease inhibitors 
 <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Therefore, furin and TMPRSS2 inhibitors can be developed in clinical application to halt the cellular internalization and it might result in the advancement of a therapeutic approach.
