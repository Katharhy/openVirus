<p id="p0635">Considerable progress has been made in the field of the peptide-based drug design using peptidomimetics, including the development of novel chemical strategies to improve the biological activity, specificity and stability of peptides. These advances turn into new realistic options whenever peptides can be transformed from lead compounds to ‘druggable’ molecules with improved power and stability profiles. Combined with novel delivery technologies, peptide-based drugs can be addressed to specific cellular targets, thus avoiding other cells expressing the same targets. These two major elements can now be added to the already known favourable properties of peptide-based drugs, such as their high biological activity, specificity, low toxicity, biodegradability and minimal potential for drug interactions.</p>
