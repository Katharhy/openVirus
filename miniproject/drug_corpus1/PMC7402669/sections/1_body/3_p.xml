<p id="para40">2019 saw 1·7 million new infections, 23% down on the number a decade earlier in 2010, a decline largely driven by reductions in infections in girls and young women in eastern and southern Africa. Boys and men now account for most new infections (52% of infections worldwide). Outside of western Europe and North America, men and boys are much less likely to be on virally suppressive antiretroviral therapy than are women and girls; this disparity is greatest in west Africa where just 49% of men with HIV have viral suppression compared with 67% of women. Worldwide, 62% of new infections were among key populations, which include sex workers, people who inject drugs, prisoners, transgender people, and men who have sex with men. Failure to achieve targets of treatment and prevention mean that since 2015 there have been an excess of 3·5 million new infections and 820 000 deaths.</p>
