<p id="para60">Given advances in prevention, testing, and treatment, every HIV infection and death in 2020 is preventable. Nonetheless, we find ourselves falling far short of global targets for treatment and prevention, and in very real jeopardy of backsliding years because of the effects of COVID-19. If countries as disparate as Switzerland and eSwatini can succeed, then targets can be met elsewhere. Local and national governments worldwide must not lose sight of the ultimate goal of ending HIV transmission and AIDS-related deaths. Seizing the moment is an optimistic take as we risk watching successes slip through our fingers.</p>
