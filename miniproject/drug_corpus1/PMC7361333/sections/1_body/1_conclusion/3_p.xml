<p>The emergence of subsequent specific patterns of mutations, concomitant with the decline in case fatality rate, likely follows the principle of homoplasy and suggests a converged evolution due to the accumulation of mutations over time. This would, in turn, lead to the rapidly progressive and convergent adaptation of the virus to the human host. Additional confirmation and the biological significance of such mutations need to be determined. Nonetheless, it is tempting to speculate that they may contribute to the loss of virulence of SARS‐CoV‐2. These mutations may also be relevant for the design of new antiviral agents and vaccines.</p>
