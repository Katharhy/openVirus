<p id="Par17">Retrospective clinical analysis has indicated the role of Lianhua Qingwen in treating new coronavirus pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. One study enrolled 102 COVID-19 patients (1:1 ratio), 51 were taking Lianhua Qingwen combined with conventional treatment in the treatment group, and 51 in the conventional treatment as the control group [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This trial compared the disappearance rate, duration, and effectiveness at relieving the main symptoms (fever, fatigue, and cough) between the two groups. The disappearance rate of other symptoms and signs and the improvement rate of lung computed-tomography (CT) were also analyzed. It was found that the combined application of Lianhua Qingwen, compared to conventional treatment, significantly improved the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients. The strength of the study was multicenter. However, it was a retrospective analysis. Another 14-day study randomized 284 COVID-19 patients into the control group (usual treatment only) or the treatment group (Lianhua Qingwen plus usual treatment) [

 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and clinical cure (78.9% vs. 66.2%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.017) were also higher in the treatment group. The study was a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial. However, it was an open-label study. Lianhua Qingwen is currently recommended for treating patients during the clinical observation period and in the early stage of the disease (mild case) in the NHC guidelines [
