<p id="Par24">Tanreqing consists of scutellaria baicalensis, bear bile powder, goat horn, honeysuckle, and forsythia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. It has effects of clearing heat and detoxification, as well as reducing cough and phlegm. It is mainly used in the clinical treatment of early pneumonia, acute bronchitis, acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and lower respiratory tract infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Quercetin and luteolin in Tanreqing have anti-influenza A virus activity in vitro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Studies show that quercetin can reduce the expression of TGF-β1, α-SMA, and TNF-α, inhibit the apoptosis of rat alveolar cells, and lessen the inflammation and fibrosis destruction of rat lung tissue [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. However, there are no reported clinical studies in the COVID-19 treatment. Currently, Tanreqing is recommended for treating patients in the progressive stage of COVID-19 (critical case) in the NHC guidelines [
