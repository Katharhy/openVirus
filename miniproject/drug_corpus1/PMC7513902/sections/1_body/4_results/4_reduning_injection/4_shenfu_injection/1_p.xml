<p id="Par27">Shenfu is made from red ginseng and black monkshood, commonly used in the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. It can also be used alone or assist in the treatment of severe pneumonia, sepsis, multiple organ dysfunction, and tumors. Shenfu can effectively reduce the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, procalcitonin, and hypersensitive CRP in the serum of patients with sepsis, as well as improve the therapeutic effects [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. When observing the treatment of Shenfu on elderly chronic lung infections, it was found that Shenfu can reduce the level of immunoglobulin (IgA, IgG, IgM) in patients' serum and reduce the value of serum procalcitonin. It can also improve the body's immunity through immune regulation while playing an active role in treating lung infections [
