<p id="Par23">Reduning is composed of honeysuckle, gardenia, and artemisia annua. The injection has been shown to have antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-viral pharmacological effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. It has proven efficacy in the treatment of acute bronchitis and upper respiratory tract infections. Therefore, it has become a recommended anti-epidemic drug in the prevention and treatment of epidemics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Reduning combined with biapenem was reported to have a better clinical effect in treating severe pneumonia, improving patients' clinical symptoms, improving blood gas indexes and lung function, and reducing serum inflammatory factor levels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Research has found that quercetin, luteolin, rutin, and isorhamnetin in the Reduning injection have anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and immunomodulatory effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The mechanism of action may be through the IL-17, C-type lectin receptor, HIF-1, and other pathways acting on IL-6, CASP3, MAPK1, CCL2, and other targets. Reduning has a good therapeutic effect on lung injury and cardiovascular disease. However, there are no reported clinical studies in the COVID-19 treatment. Currently, Reduning is recommended for treating patients in the progressive stage of COVID-19 (critical case) in the NHC guidelines [
