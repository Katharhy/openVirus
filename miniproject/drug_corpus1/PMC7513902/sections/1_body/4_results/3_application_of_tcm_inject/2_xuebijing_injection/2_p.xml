<p id="Par22">Using a retrospective method, researchers investigated 44 patients with light new coronavirus pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Patients were divided into an observation group (n = 22) and a control group (n = 22). The observation group received 50 mL Xuebijing intravenously and 100 mL 0.9% normal saline for 7 days. After treatment, the lung CT showed that the effective rate of lesion absorption and the overall effective rate in the observation group were higher than those in the control group (

It is worth noting that this was only a retrospective small size analysis. Currently, Xuebijing is recommended for treating patients in the progressive stage of COVID-19 (critical case) in the NHC guidelines [
