<p id="para0025">Since the outbreak of the novel SARS-CoV-2, scientists and medical industries around the globe ubiquitously urged to fight against the pandemic, searching alternative method of rapid screening and prediction process, contact tracing, forecasting, and development of vaccine or drugs with the more accurate and reliable operation. Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are such promising methods employed by various healthcare providers. This paper addresses on recent studies that apply such advance technology in augmenting the researchers in multiple angles, addressing the troubles and challenges while using such algorithm in assisting medical expert in real-world problems. This paper also discusses suggestions conveying researchers on AI/ML-based model design, medical experts, and policymakers on few errors encountered in the current situation while tackling the current pandemic. This review shows that the use of modern technology with AI and ML dramatically improves the screening, prediction, contact tracing, forecasting, and drug/vaccine development with extreme reliability. Majority of the paper employed deep learning algorithms and is found to have more potential, robust, and advance among the other learning algorithms. However, the current urgency requires an improved model with high-end performance accuracy in screening and predicting the SARS-CoV-2 with a different kind of related disease by analyzing the clinical, mammographic, and demographic information of the suspects and infected patients. Finally, it is evident that AI and ML can significantly improve treatment, medication, screening &amp; prediction, forecasting, contact tracing, and drug/vaccine development for the Covid-19 pandemic and reduce the human intervention in medical practice. However, most of the models are not deployed enough to show their real-world operation, but they are still up to the mark to tackle the pandemic.</p>
