The new model is effective and robust in predicting patients in critical/severe conditions, and the empirical results show that a combination of the four-feature results an AUROC of 0.9996 and 0.9757 in training and testing datasets respectively. The survival and the cox-multivariant regression analysis revealed the model's significance towards and auxiliary tools for the healthcare expert.
