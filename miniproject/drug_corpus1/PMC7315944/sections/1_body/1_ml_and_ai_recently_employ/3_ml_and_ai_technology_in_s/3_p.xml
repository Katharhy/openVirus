 <xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The developed model uses raw chest X-ray images of 127 infected patients with 500 no-findings and pneumonia cases of 500 records. With remarkable performance accuracy, binary class of 98.08%, and multi-class with 87.02%. Multi-classes proved the applicability of the expert system to assist radiology in validating in screening process rapidly and accurately.
