<p id="para0015">The above studies give the evidence of an application of the expert system; designing rapid diagnosis was the main objective along with augmentation of accuracy. Prompt and early detection reduce the spread of the disease and reserve more time to the healthcare expert to correspond to the next diagnosis to save more lives, resulting in low-cost medical expenditure. However, majority of the studied paper employed a single classification algorithm on individual data or more. Therefore it is suggested to come up with a hybrid classification method applying more potential algorithm on multi-database or hybrid-database consisting of clinical, mammographic, and demographic data, as each type of data has a significant factor that could represent the true identity of the infected patients and deployment of the application in the real world.</p>
