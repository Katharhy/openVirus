<p id="para0018">Concerning contact tracing, studies have proven the use of ML and AI in augmentation of contact tracing process against infectious Chronic Wasting disease 
 <xref rid="bib0036" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. After applying Graph theory on infectious animal disease epidemics data, mainly shipment data between each farm, the resultant graph properties generated by the proposed model can be used to exploit to augment contact tracing more efficiently. Moreover, the generated graphs have a potential prediction impact on the number of infections that can take place. However, there are still limitations in addressing the scenario, privacy, control over the data, and even data security breach. Countries are working to overcome the challenges; some countries like Israel “passed an emergency law to use mobile phone data” to tackle the current pandemic

 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> so far they do the job acceptably by supplement the manual tracing process. However, virtually every country has their contact tracing application individually, as the outbreak continues to spread across the world, it becomes a global health emergency. To fight against the Covid-19 as one, one should provide a standard de-facto centralized contact tracing application to trace every human being all around the world. Also, it is reported that some specific query needs to address: “Is it mandatory or voluntary?” “Is the attempt clear or translucent?” “Is information gathering lessened?” “Will collected information be demolished as declared?”, “Is the data safe with the host” and “Are there any restrictions or control on utilizing the information?”.
