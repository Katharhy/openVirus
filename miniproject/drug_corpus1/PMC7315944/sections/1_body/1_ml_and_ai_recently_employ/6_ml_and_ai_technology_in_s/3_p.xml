<p id="para0021">Researchers from Taiwan are building a new model to augment the development of a novel drug 
 <xref rid="bib0042" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. After applying the ML and AI technology-based model on two datasets (one using the 3C-like protease constraint and other data-holding records of infected SARS-CoV, SARS-Cov-2, influenza, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)) using Deep Neural Network on the eighty old drugs with potential for Covid-19 treatment, the study suggested eight drugs, i.e., vismodegib, gemcitabine, clofazimine, celecoxib, brequinar, conivaptan, bedaquiline and tolcapone are found virtually effective against feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus. Furthermore, other five drugs like homoharringtonine, salinomycin, boceprevir, tilorone and chloroquine are also found operational during AI experimental environment.
