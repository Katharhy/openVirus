 <xref rid="tbl0003" ref-type="table">TableÂ 3</xref> indicates the applications of ML and AI in forecasting and predicting the novel pandemic. A new novel model, that forecast and predicting 1-3 to 6 days ahead of total Covid-19 patient of 10 Brazilian states, using stacking-ensemble with support vector regression algorithm on the cumulative positive Covid-19 cases of Brazilian data was proposed, thus augmenting the short-term forecasting process to alert the healthcare expert and the government to tackle the pandemic 
 <xref rid="bib0038" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Recent studies suggested a novel model using a supervised multi-layered recursive classifier called XGBoost on clinical and mammographic factor datasets. After applying the model, researchers found out those three significant key features (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, lymphocyte and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH)) of the 75 features clinical and blood test samples result to be the highest rank of 90% accuracy in predicting and assessing Covid-19 patient into general, severe and mortality rate 
 <xref rid="bib0039" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Furthermore, comparatively higher value in single lactic dehydrogenase appears to be a significant factor in classifying most patients in need of intensive medical care, as LDH degree related to various respiratory disorder diseases, namely asthma and bronchitis, and pneumonia. The forecast model employed decision rule to forecast rapidly and predict infected individuals at the highest risk, authorized patients to be manageable for intensive care, and possibly lessen the transience rate. A Canadian based forecasting model using time-series was developed employing Deep learning algorithm for the long-short-term-memory network, the studies found out a key factor intended for predicting the course with an ending point estimation of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Canada and all over the globe 
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. The suggested model forecast ending point of this SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Canada will be around June 2020. Based on the data collected from John Hopkins University 
 <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, the prediction was likely to be accurate as newly infected cases have dropped rapidly and proven the applicability of the expert system in predicting and forecasting for the current pandemic outbreak by revealing key significant features. The real-time forecasting model was proposed combining the goodness of the wavelet-based forecasting model and autoregressive integrated moving average based time-series model 
 <xref rid="bib0041" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The model solves the problem by generating short-term forecasts of the SARS-CoV-2 for various countries (India, United Kingdom, Canada, South Korea, and France) to assist healthcare experts and policymakers as a preliminary cautioning module for each target country.
