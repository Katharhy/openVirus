  <p>Chemical structures of favipiravir and its related compounds. A. Favipiravir (6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide). T-705 is the code number of favipiravir. B. Guanosine, inosine, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-Î²-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR), ribavirin, and ribosyl favipiravir. Guanosine, inosine, and AICAR are biosynthesized in the body, and ribavirin and ribosyl favipiravir are synthesized nucleoside analogues. They have similar chemical structures, but favipiravir and the other two compounds differ because they contain pyrazine, triazole, and imidazole that are marked by red circles.</p>
