  <p>Chain termination and lethal mutagenesis. A. Chain termination Favipiravir is converted to favipiravir-RTP and incorporated into the elongating RNA strand. Then, chain elongation stops at the site of favipiravir incorporation, and elongation does not proceed because favipiravir functions as a chain terminator. This RNA-favipiravir(âˆ’RdRp) complex will not be repaired by the proofreading enzyme and would be disposed of as unnecessary RNA, resulting in the extinction of the viral genome (

Lethal mutagenesis Ribavirin is incorporated into the elongating RNA strand, and viral RdRp continues to elongate until completion. Next, the RNA strand with multiple ribavirin incorporation sites further incorporates ribavirin or serves as mRNA for viral protein synthesis. The incorporation of ribavirin in the viral RNA causes the mismatch of base pairs (transition mutation), and translation of this RNA causes mutations in the amino acid sequence of the protein, resulting in impaired function. Viral proteins with impaired function fail to replicate or produce infectious viral particles, and viral infection ceases. Thus, lethal mutagenesis terminates viral infection through a different mechanism than chain termination.
