<p id="p0110">Baloxavir marboxil (baloxavir, XofluzaÂ®) is a selective inhibitor of influenza Cap-dependent endonuclease of the viral RdRp complex. Baloxavir inhibits mRNA synthesis and subsequent viral protein synthesis, but genomic RNA without the Cap structure is synthesized by the incorporated RdRp-viral RNA complex in the presence of baloxavir.</p>
