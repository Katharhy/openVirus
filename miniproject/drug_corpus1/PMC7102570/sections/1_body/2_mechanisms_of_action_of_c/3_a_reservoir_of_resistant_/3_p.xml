<p id="p0120">The spontaneous mutation rate of the influenza virus RdRp complex is approximately 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>. Titers of influenza virus in culture reach approximately 10
 <sup>8</sup> plaque forming units/mL in 5 mL in a 25 cm
 <sup>2</sup> flask, and their genomes contain approximately 13,600 bases, indicating a probability of 10
 <sup>4</sup> alterations per nucleotide in the genome. Therefore, all types of mutated genomes should be synthesized and present as genomic RNA, even in cells treated with anti-influenza drugs.
