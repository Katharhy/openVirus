<p id="p0160">Single-dose baloxavir is superior to the placebo in alleviating influenza symptoms and to both oseltamivir and placebo in reducing the viral load 1 day after initiation in patients with uncomplicated influenza (
 <xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Hayden et al., 2018</xref>). The emergence of baloxavir-resistant mutants with PA/I38X substitutions occurred in 2.2% and 9.7% of baloxavir recipients in the phase 2 and phase 3 trials, respectively. Patients with a substitution at position I38 in the viral polymerase acidic protein (PA/I38X) of the baloxavir-resistant virus exhibited sustained alleviation and virus clearance, and baloxavir-resistant viruses were not cross-resistant to favipiravir and oseltamivir (
 <xref rid="bb0445" ref-type="bibr">Omoto et al., 2018</xref>). Baloxavir-resistant viruses were identified after 3–9 days in 9.7% (36/370) of baloxavir-treated immunocompetent adults and adolescents (
 <xref rid="bb0595" ref-type="bibr">Uehara et al., 2020</xref>). Baloxavir-resistant viruses emerged in 18 of 77 (23.4%) patients. Emergence was associated with a prolonged detection of the infectious virus (median time, 180.0 h) and time to illness (median, 79.6 vs 42.8 h in patients without PA/I38T/M-substituted viruses) (
