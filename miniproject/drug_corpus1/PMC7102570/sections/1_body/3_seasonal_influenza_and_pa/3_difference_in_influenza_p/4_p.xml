<p id="p0145">Since the novel influenza strain is transmitted in the original host bird, the avian receptor is sialic acid linked to galactose by an alpha-2,3 linkage, and this receptor is distributed in respiratory bronchioles and alveolar epithelial cells in humans (
 <xref rid="bb0510" ref-type="bibr">Shinya et al., 2006</xref>). Although the name of the influenza virus is common to both seasonal influenza and novel influenza, a new subtype of influenza causes severe influenza in humans because it is a completely new subtype of virus, and humans have neither a history of infection nor immunity. Seasonal influenza mainly infects the upper respiratory tract, while novel influenza causes pneumonia, mainly due to an infection of the pulmonary epithelium. Furthermore, unlike the presence of a certain level of immunity to seasonal influenza, immunity does not exist for novel influenza. Therefore, the severity of the infection appears to be caused by a prolonged virus growth period and the affinity for the pulmonary epithelium (
