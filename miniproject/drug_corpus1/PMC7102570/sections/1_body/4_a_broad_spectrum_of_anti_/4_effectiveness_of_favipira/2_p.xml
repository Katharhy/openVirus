<p id="p0210">The number of patients is limited, and favipiravir has been used as an emergency or compassionate treatment for Lassa fever, norovirus, and rabies cases. This review focuses on human administration in terms of the broad spectrum of RNA virus activity. Therefore, favipiravir has been positioned as a valuable anti-influenza drug and a broad spectrum anti-RNA drug, as listed in

In addition, combination therapy of favipiravir with the other existing therapies is also an option and favipiravir and oseltamivir combination therapy showed accelerated clinical recovery compared to oseltamivir monotherapy in severe influenza in China (
