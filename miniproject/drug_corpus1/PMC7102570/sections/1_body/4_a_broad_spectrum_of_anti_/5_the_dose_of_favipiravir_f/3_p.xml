<p id="p0220">The approved favipiravir dose for influenza in Japan is 1600 mg twice a day on day 1 followed by 600 mg twice a day for 4 days, and the dose for Ebloa virus infection is 6000 mg on the first day and 2400 mg/day on days 1–9. The antiviral concentration of favipiravir in influenza is achieved in the lung epithelium by diffusion from the blood, and in the case of Ebola virus infection, direct perfusion of blood reaches target tissues, vascular endothelial cells, hematopoietic cells, and hepatocytes. Differences in the two factors between antiviral concentrations and target cells do not appear to be significantly reflected in dosage. Intravenous preparations are being prepared to improve oral administration of favipiravir.</p>
