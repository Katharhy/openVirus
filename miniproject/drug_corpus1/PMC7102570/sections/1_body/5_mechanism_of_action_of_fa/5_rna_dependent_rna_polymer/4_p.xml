<p id="p0270">Jurkat cells exposed to 500 μM guanosine for 24 h show an increase in GTP pools to 600% of the control and a decrease in ATP to 40% of the control (
 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Batiuk, Schnizlein-Bick, Plotkin, &amp; Dagher, 2001</xref>). Thus, the intracellular condition of biased nucleotide pools alone is sufficient to increase the ratios of mismatched transition mutations without treatment with mutagens such as ribavirin. Ribavirin reduces GTP levels by inhibiting inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, but favipiravir has little effect on GTP levels (
