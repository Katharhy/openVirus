<p id="p0275">As a guanosine analogue, extracellular favipiravir may bias the nucleotide pools, and favipiravir-RTP competes with GTP or ATP, resulting in an increase in the transition mutations, although data are not available to support this speculation. An observed increase in the transition frequency is presumed to be due to the low fidelity of RdRp of influenza virus and misincorporation of nucleotides by the biased nucleotide pools in favipiravir-treated cells. Favipiravir is a chain terminator without direct mutagenic activity but increases the number of mismatches in the genome due to the induction of biased nucleotide pools in the favipiravir-treated cultures.</p>
