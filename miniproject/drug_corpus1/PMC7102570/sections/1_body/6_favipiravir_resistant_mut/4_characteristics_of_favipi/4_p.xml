<p id="p0305">The K291R mutation in the F1 motif of the RdRp (nsP4) in chikungunya virus is less susceptible to favipiravir, displays a reduced growth property and acquired an additional Y543C mutation in the helicase-protease (nsP2) during passages in the absence of favipiravir (
 <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Delang et al., 2014</xref>). The corresponding K-to-R substitution (K159R) of the chikungunya virus K291R mutation was introduced in the coxsackievirus B3 RdRp, but the engineered virus with the K159R mutation in RdRp was a nonviable virus (
 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Abdelnabi et al., 2017</xref>). The replication competence of the K159R variant is restored by the additional acquisition of an A239G substitution in the RdRp. The variant virus with the K159R and K291R mutations is more susceptible to favipiravir and exhibited lower fidelity than the wild-type virus.
