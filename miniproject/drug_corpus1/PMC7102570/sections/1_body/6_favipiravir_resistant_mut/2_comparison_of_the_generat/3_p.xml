<p id="p0285">An oseltamivir- or baloxavir marboxil (baloxavir)-resistant virus has emerged in patients with seasonal influenza during treatment, and the isolated virus has been replaced by a resistant virus. A subsequent new infection by the resistant virus has been confirmed. Therefore, we investigated the possibility that a favipiravir-resistant virus appeared in cultured cells while influenza virus was growing in the presence of favipiravir and that the proliferating virus was replaced by a resistant virus.</p>
