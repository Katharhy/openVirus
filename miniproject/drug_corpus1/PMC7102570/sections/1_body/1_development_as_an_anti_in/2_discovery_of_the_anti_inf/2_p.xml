<p id="p0030">In a joint development project with Toyama Chemical Co., Ltd., we initially developed anti-herpes drugs and screened and identified several promising compounds with efficacy, but they did not exceed the efficacy of acyclovir in animals. Approximately 30,000 compounds synthesized in the company were screened for the activity required in each category of drugs, such as antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and nervous system agents. Regarding favipiravir (T-705), one compound showed anti-influenza virus activity and was optimized for activity and efficacy in animal experiments to yield favipiravir. Our laboratory conducted drug efficacy and validation tests in infected mice and ferrets and conducted experiments to compare the efficacy of favipiravir with oseltamivir (Tamiflu). Based on its chemical structure, favipiravir should inhibit RNA synthesis, and our laboratory tried to isolate a resistant virus. Then, the lack of generation of resistant viruses was investigated.</p>
