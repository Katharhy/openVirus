<p id="p0350">Since children died of avian influenza A(H5N1) in Hong Kong in 1997 (
 <xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">Ku &amp; Chan, 1999</xref>), concern has been expressed about novel influenza pandemics, such as A(H5N1) and A(H7N9). An influenza pandemic consisting of a global outbreak of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus occurred in 2009, and although the pathogenicity of this virus was milder than A(H5N1) and A(H7N9), it caused a pandemic and health problems. Although there was immunity against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 among the elderly, it caused health problems for young people and a substantial social impact. As a next candidate for a pandemic influenza, avian influenza, such as A(H5N1) or A(H7N9), causes a severe infection and pneumonia due to the prolonged viral replication caused by the lack of immunity and its tropism to the pulmonary epithelium with a high mortality rate (
