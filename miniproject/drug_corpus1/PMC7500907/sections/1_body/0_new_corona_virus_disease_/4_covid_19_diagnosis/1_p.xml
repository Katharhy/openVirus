<p id="para0011">Based on the published reports, in most of the patients with COVID-19, the absolute value of lymphocytes was reduced, which indicated that this novel coronavirus (COVID-19) acts more on lymphocytes especially T lymphocytes, just similar to SARS coronavirus.

 </xref> It seems that COVID-19 could induce a cytokine storm and activate immune responses which could be appeared as changes in the number of white blood cells and immune cells especially lymphocytes, the clinical outcome of such events would be respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock and finally end-organ damage.

 </xref> COVID-19 could also affect the liver which could be presented as hypoproteinemia, elevated aminotransferases, and prolonged prothrombin time. Hepatotoxicity could be attributed to the higher expression of angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) in cholangiocytes, ACE2 could act as an entry receptor for COVID-19. So it seems that this new virus can directly damage the intrahepatic bile ducts.

 </xref> Pathological findings of a liver biopsy from a patient with COVID-19 showed moderate micro-vesicular steatosis and also a mild portal and lobular activity which could be a result of direct SARS-CoV-2 liver damage or antiviral drug-induced hepatotoxicity.

 </xref> Almost all COVID-19 patients had abnormal lung CT when diagnosed. According to the recently published article, an average of 10.5Â±6.4 segments were involved in patients and the number of involved lung segments was significantly higher in symptomatic patients group in comparison to asymptomatic ones. CT findings revealed that affected COVID-19 patients could present as bilateral lung involvement, peripheral distribution, or diffuse distribution. The most common presentation in chest CT was ground-glass opacity pattern, consolidation, and ill-defined margins.
