<p id="para0094">According to the recent studies, liver abnormalities (such as elevated AST and ALT serum levels) have been occurred after and during infection with COVID-19. These abnormalities would be related to viral infection pathogenesis and direct liver injury or it may be drug-induced.

 </xref> Almost all of the potential drugs in COVID-19 treatment containing chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, ribavirin, and lopinavir/ritonavir have hepatic metabolism. So injury to the liver because of pre-existing liver disease or acute hepatic failure would impair drug metabolism and therefore drug accumulation and enhancement in plasma level, which can lead to drug toxicity. In these patients, frequent liver function monitoring is essential to achieve an optimal serum drug level.

 </xref> Also, dosage adjustment for each drug should be done individually according to the patientsâ€™ liver function as mentioned above. The impact of chronic liver diseases such as chronic viral hepatitis, alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver diseases on occurrence of liver injury related to COVID-19 infection, still is not clear. It seems that in patients with underlying liver disease, with the immunocompromised condition, who infected with COVID-19, more intensive and individualized pharmacotherapy is required. Further studies would be also helpful to explain the exact role of pre-existing liver diseases in COVID-19 prognosis.
