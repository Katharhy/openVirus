<p id="para0090">COVID-19 could be categorized as a severe disease if one or more of the following conditions have occurred: Tachypnea (respiratory rate of over than 30 breaths/min in adults), oxygen saturation of less than 93%, PaO
 <sub>2</sub>/FiO
 <sub>2</sub> ratio of less than 300, and over than 50% lung infiltration during 24 to 48 hours. In this group, a combination of remdesivir plus chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine or monotherapy of remdesivir are considered as the first choice. If remdesivir is not available, lopinavir/ritonavir plus chloroquine has been suggested as a second choice of therapy. Duration of therapy in this group could vary between 5 to 20 days which is dependent on the monitoring of viral excretion.
