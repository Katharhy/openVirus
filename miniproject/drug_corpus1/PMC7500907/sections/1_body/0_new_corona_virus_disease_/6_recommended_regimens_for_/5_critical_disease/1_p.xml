<p id="para0091">COVID-19 could be categorized as a critical disease if one or more of the following conditions have occurred: ARDS, sepsis, altered mental status, and multi-organ failure. In this group, a combination of remdesivir plus chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine or monotherapy of remdesivir are considered as the first choice. If remdesivir is not available, lopinavir/ritonavir plus chloroquine has been suggested as a second choice of therapy. Duration of therapy in this group could vary between 5 to 20 days which is dependent on the monitoring of viral excretion. In some countries such as Switzerland, tocilizumab has been considered in patients with multi-organ failure and inotropic support.
