 </xref> Ribavirin has hepatic metabolism. Its oral bioavailability (F) is about 64%. Ribavirin elimination half-life (t Â½) in the normal population is 24 hours but in patients with pre-existing chronic hepatitis C infection, half-life could be increased to 44 hours. So because of its prolonged half-life and potential overdose toxicity, ribavirin is contraindicated in patients with hepatic failure (Child-Pugh class B and C). Time to peak level (T
 <sub>max</sub>) after oral administration is between 2 to 3 hours. Ribavirin excretion could take place through both urine and feces routes. Because of its renal elimination, dose adjustment in patients with underlying kidney disease is highly essential. According to the previous pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study, Bayesian therapeutic drug monitoring would be a suitable approach to control ribavirin-induced anemia [41].
