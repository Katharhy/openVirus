<p id="para0058">Ribavirin has teratogenic and mutagenic effects. So it is a high-risk drug in pregnancy according to animal data. Also because of its half-life of 12 hours in multiple-dose drug therapy and the possibility of drug accumulation in tissue compartments for up to 6 months, ribavirin administration is contraindicated in pregnant women and also in men who are pregnant women's partner. It was suggested that pregnancy should be avoided during ribavirin therapy and at least 6 months after completion of therapy in women or men.
