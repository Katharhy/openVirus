<p id="para0025">Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are immunomodulant antimalarial agents with broad-spectrum antiviral effects which have been considered for potential benefits in COVID-19 treatment. Hydroxychloroquine is a common drug in many autoimmune disorders such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, also it has a strong immunomodulatory effect that can prevent inflammation flare-ups and avoid further organ damage related to COVID-19.

 </xref> Previous 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies confirmed the antiviral activity of chloroquine against COVID-19. Also, a recent publication from a Chinese clinical trial reported that the use of chloroquine phosphate in patients with COVID-19 is superior and have the potential of reversing exacerbation of 2019-nCoV-induced pneumonia, normalizing patientsâ€™ lung CT scans, shortening the disease duration and length of hospitalization, and induction of virus-negative conversion. But still, more information and larger prospective clinical trials are required to confirm its beneficial effect in COVID-19 treatment.

 </xref> The recommended dose of chloroquine in patients with mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 pneumonia is 500 mg twice daily. Chloroquine is a safe, available, and clinically applicable drug for COVID-19 patients. Since hydroxychloroquine has the same mechanism of action to chloroquine, so it also could be an alternative agent with identical effects in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia.

 </xref> An open-label non-randomized clinical trial on hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin co-administration in COVID-19 patients was performed in France. Results revealed that hydroxychloroquine could significantly reduce the viral load and azithromycin could reinforce its clinical effect, but the main limitation of this clinical trial was its small sample size.

 </xref> Although many previous studies emphasized the potential therapeutic effects of these drugs in COVID-19 management, unfortunately some recent publications reported that the efficacy of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 management is not consistent. Also, their safety is still remaining a major concern for physicians and pharmacists, since chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine could cause QT prolongation and arrhythmia. Since the possible risks of these drugs could overweigh their potential benefits and efficacy, United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) no longer recommended these two drugs as potential options for COVID-19 management.
 <xref rid="bib0043" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>43</sup>
 </xref> Results of a systematic review on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine on the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 revealed that the available evidences on their benefits and risks are weak and controversial.
 <xref rid="bib0044" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>44</sup>
 </xref> Results of another systematic review and meta-analysis on 53 randomized clinical trials on administration of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 management revealed that hydroxychloroquine administration (case group) was significantly associated with higher incidence of total adverse effects in comparison to placebo or no treatment (control group) in overall population of patients with COVID-19.

  <sup>45</sup>
 </xref> So, the recruitment of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 management is still controversial and further larger multi-center randomized clinical trials are required to evaluate their efficacy, safety, risk-benefit ratio, dose and duration of individualized pharmacotherapy. Also, close patient monitoring, especially cardiac, ocular, and neurotoxicity assessments, are required and strongly recommended during drug administration.
