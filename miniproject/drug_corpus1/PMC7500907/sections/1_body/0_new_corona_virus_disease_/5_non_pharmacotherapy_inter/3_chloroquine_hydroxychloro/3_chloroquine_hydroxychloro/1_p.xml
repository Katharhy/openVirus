<p id="para0027">Chloroquine has different adverse reactions such as cardiovascular adverse reactions (atrioventricular block, cardiac arrhythmia, QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, etc.), ophthalmic adverse drug reactions (blurred vision, corneal opacity, macular degeneration, maculopathy and retinopathy [which are depends on cumulative doses of chloroquine], nocturnal amblyopia, accommodation disturbances, etc), otic adverse drug reactions (deafness, hearing loss and tinnitus), central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions (agitation, anxiety, confusion, etc.), endocrine and metabolic adverse reactions such as hypoglycemia, hematologic and oncologic (agranulocytosis, aplastic or hemolytic anemia, neutropenia, pancytopenia, etc.), gastrointestinal adverse reactions, hepatic adverse reactions (hepatitis and increased liver enzymes), etc. Results of a recent case report emphasized that chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine administration could induce severe dermatologic side effects such as Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS) in a patient with COVID-19.

 </xref> Also the results of a systematic review on dermatologic adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine emphasized that the most common dermatologic reactions due to hydroxychloroquine administration were rash, SJS,toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), pruritus, hyperpigmentation, and hair loss. These dermatologic reactions were mostly occurred after cumulative dosages of hydroxychloroquine.

 </xref> In overall, since hydroxychloroquine has lower tissue accumulation potential in comparison with chloroquine, it has fewer adverse drug reactions and would be better choice.
