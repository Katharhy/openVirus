<p id="para0066">Lopinavir has high plasma protein binding (about 98 to 99 %), it has hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4 through its drug interaction with all inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A4. Lopinavir has an elimination half-life of 5 to 6 hours which indicates that a suitable dosage interval would be 12 hours. Time to peak (T
 <sub>max</sub>) is about 4 hours. The main route of drug excretion is feces (about 83%) and the remaining amounts could be excreted through urine. Because of its low renal elimination, no dosage adjustment is required in patients with underlying kidney disease and it could be administered safely.
