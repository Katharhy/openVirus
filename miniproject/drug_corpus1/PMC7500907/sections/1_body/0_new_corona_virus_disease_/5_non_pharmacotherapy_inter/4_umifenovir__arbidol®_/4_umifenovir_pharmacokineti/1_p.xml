<p id="para0046">Umifenoviris an indole derivative with poor water solubility which could affect its bioavailability and pharmacokinetics. After oral administration of umifenovir, it could rapidly distribute to organs and tissues, maximum plasma concentration (C
 <sub>max</sub>) was achieved after 1 to 1.5 hours. In the Russian population, it had elimination half-life (t ½) of 17 to 21 hours, but t ½ was shorter in the Chinese population. After multiple-dose administration of umifenovir, little drug accumulation could be predictable. The main site of drug metabolization is the liver. Umifenovircould undergo several metabolism pathways such as oxidation at the S site, N-demethylation, glucuronidation, and conjugation at 5-hydroxy moiety. The potential antiviral effects of umifenovirmetabolites are unknown until now.
