<p id="para0044">Umifenovirhas a dual pharmacologic action: First is its beneficial effect on respiratory viruses such as the COVID-19 virus and the second is its immune-stimulating function which can activate serum interferon and phagocytes. Since 2004, umifenovir was patented for its beneficial effect in the treatment of severe acute respiratory distress (SARS) coronavirus-induced atypical pneumonia.

 </xref> Results revealed that umifenovircan induce direct viricidal effect so it would be a promising direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agent. Umifenovircould affect critical stages of viral life cycles such as cell attachment, cell internalization, viral replication, assembly, and budding so it also would be a promising host targeting agent (HTA). Its dual pharmacologic function is related to its potential interaction with both cell membranes and with cellular and viral lipids and proteins.
