<p id="para0086">Iron toxicity has a multi-stage clinical course. First patients have gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, etc. After an apparent recovery phase, clinical presentations of shock and end-organ damage (renal failure, liver damage, and cardiomyopathy) would be occur. After that enhancement of liver aminotransferases would be appear. The adhesion of SARS-CoV-2 protein to heme could results in the removal of iron from hemoglobin and convert it to porphyrin, so the excess free iron could induce iron toxicity. This iron toxicity leads to alveolar macrophage inflammation and chest infiltrations. In moderate to severe cases of COVID-19 pneumonia, symptoms of iron overload such as shock, end-organ damage (renal failure, hepatic failure, and cardiac events), and elevation of liver aminotransferases would be appeared. It seems that the recruitment of deferoxamine, as an iron-chelating agent, could relieve iron toxicity presentations in COVID-19 patients.
