<p id="para0084">Ascorbic acid (vitamin C), is an antioxidant agent and might act as a co-factor of many physiological reactions such as immune augmentation. The results of a previous meta-analysis revealed that high dose intravenous (IV) vitamin C would be a promising agent in sepsis and septic shock management. ARDS could be a life-threatening consequence of sepsis or septic shock. High dose vitamin C has dual effects; it can act as a pro-oxidant agent for immune cells and as an antioxidant agent for lung epithelial cells. Another possible mechanism of vitamin C is inhibition of lactate secretion from immune cells and therefore preserve the innate immunity of alveolar epithelial cells type II.

 </xref> So high dose IV vitamin C would be a promising option in COVID-19-induced ARDS management. The recommended dose of vitamin C in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia is 50 mg/kg IV every 6 hours for 4 days. In this protocol, hydrocortisone (50 mg IV every 6 hours for 7 days) should be added to avoid vitamin C-induced local inflammation in the alveolar medium.

 </xref> The results of this study were based on a mechanistic approach, so further studies and clinical trials are required to confirm its efficacy and safety in COVID-19 patients. Some recent studies revealed that vitamin C could have a preventive role in COVID-19 lower respiratory tract infection. So supplementation with a moderate amount of vitamin C has been suggested as a promising preventive option.
