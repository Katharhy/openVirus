 </xref> A small retrospective observational study on COVID-19 pneumonia patients receiving tocilizumab revealed that this drug would have potential benefits in these patients such as improvement in CT scan abnormalities, normalizing C-reactive protein (CRP), and lymphocyte levels, and enhancing O
 <sub>2</sub> saturation. Tocilizumab mechanisms of action in COVID-19 pneumonia is attributed to the critical role of IL-6 in the hyper-inflammatory state after infection with COVID-19, so the blockers of IL-6 would be a promising option in the management of COVID-19 pneumonia, especially ARDS condition.

 </xref> Since the number of pro-inflammatory cytokines in COVID-19-induced cytokine release syndrome (CRS), is inversely related to absolute lymphocyte count, so tocilizumab, as an IL-6 antagonist, would be a promising agent to enhance viral clearance and relieve COVID-19 pneumonia complications,

 </xref> Further clinical trial results are required to confirm its clinical efficacy and safety. In COVID-19 patients, T cell counts have been reduced significantly and also the remaining T cells are highly exhausted. Since an active immune response against respiratory viruses such as COVID-19 is highly dependent on cytotoxic T cells’ action, so in patients with total T cell count of fewer than 800 cells/µL, aggressive intervention is essential. One of the possible approaches in enhancing T cell count in these patients is the administration of tocilizomab, because there is a reverse relationship between T cell count and the number of cytokines such as IL-6.
