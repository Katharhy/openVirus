<p id="para0076">Teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic. It is commonly used in Gram-positive bacterial infections. Recent 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies showed that teicoplanin could be effective in COVID-19 treatment. A possible antiviral (anti-COVID-19) mechanism of teicoplanin is the enhancement of the endosomal pH and thereby inhibition of low-pH viral spike protein cleavage in endosome by Cathepsin L, this process results in avoidance of genomic RNA release and replication of viral life cycle which would be stopped at early stages. The recommended daily dose of teicoplanin is 400 mg daily which could obtain a serum level of 8.78 µM/L, this level is significantly higher than its IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.66 µM/L. According to these results, teicoplanin would be a promising alternative in COVID-19 pneumonia treatment but further randomized clinical trials are required to confirm its efficacy.
