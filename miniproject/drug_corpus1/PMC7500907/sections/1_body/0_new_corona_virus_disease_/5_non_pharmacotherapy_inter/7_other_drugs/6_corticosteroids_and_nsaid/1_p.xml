<p id="para0079">Corticosteroids are a double-edged sword, they can inhibit our immune response and so the clearance of COVID-19 could be delayed, but on the other hand, they can suppress our inflammatory response which is highly responsive to the lung damage and ARDS during viral infection. Although corticosteroids were used in the management of SARS/MERS-CoV outbreaks, corticosteroids have the disadvantage of increased incidence of secondary bacterial and fungal infections and also increase the length of patient's staying in the intensive care unit. In overall, there are no sufficient data available to recommend the use of corticosteroids in the management of COVID-19 complications and WHO in the recent guideline in the treatment of COVID-19 advice against the use of corticosteroids.
