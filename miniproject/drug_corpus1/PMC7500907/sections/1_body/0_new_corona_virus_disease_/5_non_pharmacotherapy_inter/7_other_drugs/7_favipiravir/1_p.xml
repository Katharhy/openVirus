<p id="para0081">Favipiravir, a guanine analog, is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor. It has antiviral effects against variant RNA viruses such as Coronaviruses and Influenza viruses. Favipiravir in the body could be metabolized to an active form called favipiravir-RTP (a phosphorylated form of favipiravir), which is a substrate for viral RNA polymerases. By adhesion of favipiravir to viral RNA polymerase, RNA polymerase activity would be inhibited. With this theory, favipiravir would be a promising antiviral agent against COVID-19 which is an RNA virus. Results of a small clinical trial revealed that favipiravir in comparison with lopinavir/ritonavir was more potent and had fewer adverse drug reactions. But further clinical trial results are required for deciding its efficacy and safety in COVID-19 pneumonia.
