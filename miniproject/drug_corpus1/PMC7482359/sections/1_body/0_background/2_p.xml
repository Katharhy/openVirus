<p>Of late, the mainstay of treatment for most novel viral epidemics such as COVID-19 has been primarily supportive, as evidence to justify the use of any specific drug with proven efficacy is limited. However, remdesivir has emerged as a promising molecule based on the results of recent clinical and observational studies. It has received conditional marketing approval for COVID-19 treatment under “emergency use authorization” in countries such as USA. Apart from remdesivir, several other agents are being evaluated for COVID-19 therapy including antivirals such as lopinavir-ritonavir, favipiravir, arbidol, and repurposed agents such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, ivermectin, and nitazoxanide.</p>
