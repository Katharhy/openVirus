<p>Interestingly, the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) has conducted an Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial. The objective of this study was to find out the optimal duration of remdesivir therapy in SARS-CoV-2 infection. It was a double blind, placebo-controlled, multicentric study with 1,063 randomized patients. Results showed that remdesivir use was associated with survival benefit and faster recovery rates with a median time to recovery of 11 days compared to 15 days with placebo. All hospitalized patients requiring oxygen therapy showed significant clinical improvement. However, the mortality rate was high (7.1% in the remdesivir group versus 11.9% in the placebo group by day 14), indicating that antiviral monotherapy may not be sufficient for COVID-19.
