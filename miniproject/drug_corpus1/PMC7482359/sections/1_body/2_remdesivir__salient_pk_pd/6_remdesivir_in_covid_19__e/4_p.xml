<p>Grein et al. also demonstrated favorable outcome with remdesivir in hospitalized patients having severe COVID-19. remdesivir was primarily used on a compassionate basis in this cohort. Study eligibility criteria included patients requiring oxygen support or having oxygen saturation &lt;94% in room air. Dosing schedule was a single loading dose of 200 mg on first day followed by a daily dose of 100 mg once from day 2 to 10 intravenously by infusion. Preliminary results indicated that 57% patients could be extubated from mechanical ventilation; improvement in oxygen status was recorded in 68% patients. Overall mortality rate was 13% over 18 days follow up-period. Data regarding viral load, a useful surrogate for antiviral efficacy, were not recorded in this study, although clinical improvement was noted in patients across different geographies.
