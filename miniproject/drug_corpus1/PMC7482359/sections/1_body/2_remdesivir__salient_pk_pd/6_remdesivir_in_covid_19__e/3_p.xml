<p>Data from preliminary studies conducted in US demonstrate significant clinical improvement in COVID-19 patients when treated with remdesivir. On 29 April, 2020, results of the SIMPLE (trial), a phase III open label study was declared by Gilead Sciences Inc. wherein remdesivir was tested in severe cases of COVID-19 hospitalized patients, with two dosing schedules of 5 days and 10 days. Results showed similar clinical improvement in 10-day treatment group in comparison to 5-day group with an odds ratio of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.51â€“1.12). Clinical recovery was achieved in 53.8% patients of 10-day group and 64.5% in 5-day group. A total of &gt;50% patients were discharged from both groups by day 14. Exploratory analysis revealed that outcome was better when the therapy was initiated within 10 days of onset of symptoms. Additionally, 62% patients with early-onset treatment could be discharged in comparison to 49% discharge rates for subject with late-onset treatment by day 14. Safety and tolerability data were similar for both groups without any new safety signal.
