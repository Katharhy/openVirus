<p>In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a double blind, placebo-controlled trial was carried out in China across ten hospitals, using remdesivir in microbiologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected adult patients. Subjects were assigned to test and control groups randomly in 2:1 ratio. In the test group, remdesivir was initiated at a loading dose of 200 mg on first day followed by a daily dose of 100 mg once from day 2 to day 10 by intravenous infusion. Concomitant therapy with lopinavir-ritonavir, corticosteroids, and interferons was given in both groups. However, there was no statistically significant clinical improvement in the test drug group. It is important to know that, therapy was started late and power of the study was insufficient to identify clinical improvement in both the groups.
