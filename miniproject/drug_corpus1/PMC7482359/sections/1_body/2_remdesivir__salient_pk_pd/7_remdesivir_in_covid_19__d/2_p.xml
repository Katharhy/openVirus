<p>The first study has already recruited 397 patients (1:1) in both groups (i.e., 5-day vs 10-day) in its initial recruitment phase. A loading dose of remdesivir being 200 mg on first day, followed by 100 mg once daily intravenous infusion up to 5 days or 10 days, along with standard care. Preliminary results indicate that efficacy was not significantly different between groups for severe cases not requiring mechanical ventilation. Incidence of adverse reactions and tolerability profile were also comparable. However, cases requiring mechanical ventilation in due course may benefit with 10-day therapy. This study is slated to expand through recruitment of 5,600 severely ill patients from 180 study sites worldwide. Study sites already listed include United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Italy, China, France, Singapore, Spain, Germany etc.
