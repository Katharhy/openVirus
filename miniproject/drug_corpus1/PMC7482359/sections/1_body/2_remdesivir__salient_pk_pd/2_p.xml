<p>In clinical pharmacokinetic studies, remdesivir expressed low bioavailability in cynomolgus monkeys. In vivo studies in rhesus monkeys have shown that remdesivir administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg by intravenous route undergoes rapid conversion to nucleoside phosphate derivative. It gets distributed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells within 2 hours of administration, followed by activation to NTP analogue to achieve a peak with 100% survival rate.
