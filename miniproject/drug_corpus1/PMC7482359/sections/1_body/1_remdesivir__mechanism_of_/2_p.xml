<p>Remdesivir is first metabolized within the host cells into an alanine metabolite (GS-704277), which is further processed into monophosphate derivative and then ultimately into the active nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) analogue. The NTP derivative now competes with alanine metabolite to get attached to nascent RNA strand.

 </sup> This abnormal incorporation stops the elongation of RNA strand, terminating RNA synthesis prematurely. However, addition of remdesivir in the i-position of growing chain will not immediately stop the replication process. Instead, the strand replication stops at i+3 positions after incorporation of three more nucleotides.

 </sup> This unique mechanism of delayed chain transmission has been found to inhibit viral RNA synthesis of all three types of corona viruses including SARS CoV 2. Mechanism of action is shown schematically in
