<p>Women who used drugs in our study suffered various forms of sexual, physical and psychological violence. We note that these results provide particularly strong evidence for the implementation of programs focused in violence support and prevention in women who use drugs in a harm reduction setting. These issues should generate policies of detection early signs of abuse or violence promoting derivation to specialized public services and strengthening womenâ€™s empowerment activities. Drug policy makers should also create specific resources including housing and phycological support for women who suffer gender-based violence and cannot or do not want to stop using drugs.</p>
