  <p>(
   <italic>a</italic> and 
   <italic>b</italic>) Result from 20 equilibrium MD simulations over 50 ns of the hexapeptide in the vicinity of ACE2. (
   <italic>a</italic>) Color-assigned structure of ACE2 with the affinity of the hexapeptide for regions at ACE2 was indexed with a color gradient ranging from 0 (
   <italic>blue</italic>) to 100% (
   <italic>red</italic>), corresponding to the highest affinity. (
   <italic>c</italic>) Shown is the log plot of the relative affinity ɛ averaged over the set of 20 MD simulations. The affinity expresses the propensity of finding the hexapeptide as a function of the residue number and the distance. (
   <italic>b</italic> and 
   <italic>d</italic>) Shown is the result from the enhanced CORE-MD simulation over 200 ns of the hexapeptide in the vicinity of ACE2. (
   <italic>b</italic>) B-factor assigned structure of ACE2 with the affinity of the hexapeptide for regions at ACE2 was indexed with a color gradient ranging from 0 (
   <italic>blue</italic>) to 100% (
   <italic>red</italic>). (
   <italic>d</italic>) Shown is a log plot of the relative affinity ɛ of finding the hexapeptide as a function of the residue number and the distance averaged over the CORE-MD simulation. (
   <italic>e</italic>) Shown is the average root mean-square deviation of all measured distances (nm) of the hexapeptide and ACE2 as a function of time taken from the set of 20 independent NPT simulations. (
   <italic>f</italic>) Shown is the average root mean-square deviation of all pairwise distances (nm) in the CORE-MD simulation as a function of time. To see this figure in color, go online.
