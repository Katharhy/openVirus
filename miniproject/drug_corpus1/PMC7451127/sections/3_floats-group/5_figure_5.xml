  <p>Structural overlays of the PDB structure (PDB: 
   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:6M0J" id="intref0040" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">6M0J</ext-link>) of CoV-2 RBD in complex with ACE2 (
   <italic>green</italic>) and the two final structures from the enhanced MD simulations without (
   <italic>a</italic>) and in the presence of the hexapeptide (
   <italic>b</italic>) (
   <italic>cyan</italic>). (
   <italic>c</italic>) Shown is a list of SARS CoV viruses as a result from a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool search over the protein sequence space of all organisms. Surprisingly, the hexapeptide fragment preferentially occurs in SARS CoV viruses, which makes it suitable as a potential drug because of its dissimilarity with human proteins. (
   <italic>d</italic>) Shown is a hexapeptide fragment YNYLYR in SARS CoV-2 RBD (PDB: 
   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:6M0J" id="intref0045" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">6M0J</ext-link>, chain E), indicating that the tyrosine repeat at the positions 1, 3, and 5 might be important for the design strategy of a potential peptide mimetic for the treatment of SARS CoV-2 infections.
