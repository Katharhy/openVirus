   <italic>a</italic>) Main conformation of the hexapeptide in complex with the N-terminal helical interface of ACE2 as revealed from equilibrium MD and enhanced sampling MD simulations. (

   <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) on the hexapeptide YKYRYL and five further variant models in the binding site at ACE2. The relative error to the experiment lies at 1.89 kcal/mol (
