<p id="p0010">A novel coronavirus, CoV-19, and a later phenotype, CoV-2, were identified as the primary cause for a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS CoV-2). The spike (S) protein of CoV-2 is one target for the development of a vaccine to prevent the viral entry into human cells. The inhibition of the direct interaction between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and the S-protein could provide a suitable strategy to prevent the membrane fusion of CoV-2 and the viral entry into target cells. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the assembly process of a coronavirus spike protein fragment, the hexapeptide YKYRYL on the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, and its inhibitory effect on the aggregation and activation of the CoV-2 spike receptor protein at the same receptor protein.</p>
