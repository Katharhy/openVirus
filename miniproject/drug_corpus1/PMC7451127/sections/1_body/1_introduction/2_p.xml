<p id="p0020">In this article, we present MD simulations to investigate the effect of the hexapeptide on the binding of the spike protein RBD of SARS CoV-2 (CoV-2 RBD) with ACE2 and quantify its affinity to the binding site shown by Struck et al. (

Second, we applied enhanced correlation guided MD (CORE-MD) simulations to measure the free energy of binding of the hexapeptide to its preferential binding site at ACE2. In the third stage of the study, we investigated the effect of the hexapeptide on the interaction of CoV-2 RBD with ACE2. In our simulations, we observe that the hexapeptide binds to the N-terminal region of ACE2 with a high affinity to three clusters that are located at the interface at which CoV-2 RBD binds to the receptor as revealed in x-ray structures (

 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In the enhanced MD simulations, we observe that CoV-2 RBD relaxes into an energy minimum that differs fundamentally from the x-ray structure; we find that CoV-2 RBD rotates and binds to ACE2 at the N-terminal region by a hydrophobic patch, which is between residues Thr351 and Leu535. Our simulations reveal that the energetic minimum does not favor a hydrophilic interaction as shown in x-ray crystallography. In the simulations of binding of CoV-2 RBD to ACE2 in the presence of the hexapeptide, the hexapeptide binds preferentially to CoV-2 RBD in the vicinity to the ACE2 binding segment. Surprisingly, we find that the binding of the hexapeptide changes the assembly process of CoV-2 RBD such that the activation of ACE2 is inhibited by the hexapeptide. Our simulations are in agreement with the experimental study and demonstrate the potential of the hexapeptide YKYRYL as a possible “new modality” treatment option (
