<p id="p0085">In the simulation of CoV-2 RBD binding to ACE2 in the presence of the hexapeptide, we observe a fast binding process of the hexapeptide to CoV-2 RBD at Glu465 (CoV-2 RBD) and Lys2 (hexapeptide). We find a secondary contact between the hexapeptide and CoV-2 RBD between Ser349 (CoV-2 RBD) and Arg4 (hexapeptide) in the initial stage of the simulation. The hexapeptide then diffuses along the surface of CoV-2 RBD until it binds strongly to Glu465 (see 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, 
 <italic>d</italic> and 
 <italic>f</italic>). An initial rotatory process of CoV-2 RBD is highly analogous to the simulation without the hexapeptide, in which the binding motif of CoV-2 RBD rotates away from the surface of ACE2 because of an electrostatic driving force. In the implicit solvent environment, the formation of the contact interface is driven by the surface charge of CoV-2 RBD and ACE2. Therefore, the formation of a contact interface between polar residues as shown in the PDB structure is less probable. This behavior can potentially change at high salt concentrations. In contrast to the simulation without the hexapeptide, we find that CoV-2 RBD attaches only weakly at the peripheral region of the N-terminal helix 4 nm away from the conformation without the hexapeptide (see 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref>, 
 <italic>b</italic> and 
 <italic>d</italic> and 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>
 <italic>b</italic>). In this case, we again emphasize that the hexapeptide changes the electrostatic patterns, leading to a change in the structure of the assembly. The hexapeptide binds to CoV-2 RBD, leading to the weak attachment of CoV-2 RBD to ACE2. We anticipate that this conformation corresponds to an inhibited state, in which CoV-2 RBD does not become activated, and the process of membrane fusion might get inhibited because of the low affinity of CoV-2 RBD for ACE2. Because of thermal fluctuations and longer timescales, CoV-2 RBD might dissociate away from ACE2, which would inhibit CoV-2 activation.
