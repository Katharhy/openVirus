<p id="p0080">We tested the effect of the hexapeptide on the binding process of CoV-2 RBD on ACE2 (see 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> ). Therefore, we used a starting structure in which CoV-2 RBD is separated by a distance of 2.2 nm away from the surface of ACE2 (see 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, 
 <italic>c</italic> and 
 <italic>d</italic>). We simulated the system in and without the presence of the hexapeptide using CORE-MD enhanced sampling. In the simulation of binding of CoV-2 RBD to ACE2, the hydrophilic interface formed by the loop region between the 
 <italic>β</italic>-sheets of CoV-2 RBD rotates away from the surface of ACE2, mainly because of an electrostatic repulsion. In a comparatively fast translatory process, CoV-2 RBD binds to the N-terminal helix (
 <italic>blue</italic>) of ACE2 (see 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, 
 <italic>a</italic> and 
 <italic>c</italic>). The interface between CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 is mainly stabilized by hydrophobic interactions between residues in the range between Leu535 and Thr351 (CoV-2 RBD) and Gln60 to Glu75. A hydrophobic interaction between Leu63 and His537 plays a major role in the stabilization of CoV-2 RBD at ACE2 (see 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>
 <italic>e</italic>). The relaxed final conformation of CoV-2 RBD at ACE2 is rotated by ∼90° in its attached orientation when we compare the structure in an overlay with the experimental x-ray structure (PDB: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:6M0J" id="intref0020" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">6M0J</ext-link> (
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>)) (see 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>
 <italic>a</italic>). Additionally, the global contact pattern changed from a hydrophilic interface to a hydrophobic interaction at a different region of CoV-2 RBD, which is initialized by a rotatory motion in the beginning of the simulation that is induced by an electrostatic driving force.
