<p id="p0090">We were surprised by the high specificity with which the hexapeptide bound to ACE2 and CoV-2 RBD. Because we observed that the hexapeptide inhibits the binding process of CoV-2 RBD, we performed a BLAST search over all organisms that contain the specific fragment in their protein sequences (
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Surprisingly, we found that 47 out of 50 hits in the sequence search returned SARS CoV organisms, whereas only three hits were contained in bacteria, which shows that the hexapeptide pattern preferentially occurs for SARS CoV but not in human proteins (see

 <italic>c</italic>). That result shows that an a priori affinity for another function in the human organism can be excluded, which makes the hexapeptide a suitable candidate as a potential drug. When we analyzed the sequence of CoV-2 RBD, we find a hexapeptide sequence YNYLYR, which contains the same Tyr repeat at the positions 1, 3, and 5 but different residues at the positions 2, 4, and 6, which might be an indicator that Tyr at the positions 1, 3, and 5 is imminent for the specificity of CoV-2 RBD (see 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>
 <italic>d</italic>). However, we found that this hexapeptide sequence leads to the lowest interaction energy 
 <italic>ΔG</italic> = −6.8 kcal/mol as we found in a modeling approach using the preferential hexapeptide ACE2 binding site as a structural model (see 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, 
 <italic>c</italic> and 
 <italic>d</italic>). We only can speculate that the amino acids at the positions 2, 4, and 6 are affecting the relative affinity of the fragment for the ACE2 receptor, whereas we find that Tyr at the positions 1, 3, and 5 is essential for the binding. We assume that Tyr at the positions 1, 3, and 5 has to be conserved for the design of a peptide mimetic used as a potential drug against SARS CoV-2, whereas the hexapeptide sequence YKYRYL inhibits the viral interaction with ACE2, as we have shown in this work. Finally, we conclude that binding of CoV-2 RBD to ACE2 is unexpectedly highly heterogeneous, which is also the case for the interaction of the hexapeptide with ACE2. We anticipate that the CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 interaction (as well as the hexapeptide-ACE2 complex) depends on the ionic strength. At high ionic strengths, a polar CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 binding interface as given in the experimental structure might be stabilized in a strong field of surrounding ions and water (
