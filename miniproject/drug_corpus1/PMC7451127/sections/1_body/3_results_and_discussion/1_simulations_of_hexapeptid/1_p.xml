<p id="p0065">We tested the affinity of the hexapeptide to the ACE2 protein in 20 independent equilibrium MD simulations over a total simulation time of 50 ns. For this first set of simulations, we modeled 20 different starting conformations of the hexapeptide at an approximate distance of 1 nm away from the potential binding site between ACE2 and CoV-2 RBD. To examine the specific affinity of the hexapeptide for binding sites at ACE2, we determined the complete 
 <italic>Cα</italic>-
 <italic>Cα</italic> distance matrix and averaged over all 20 trajectories. We find that the hexapeptide binds with 55% of the total affinity to the interface between the N-terminal helix and a 
 <italic>β</italic>-sheet located at Glu329 and a lowered contact propensity of 43–50% to the residues Asn330 and Trp328 (see region (4) in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> , 
 <italic>a</italic> and 
 <italic>c</italic>). We observe another contact cluster at Asp382 and Met383, in which the affinity reaches values of 13 and 15%. A third contact cluster is located at Thr55, in which the affinity of the hexapeptide to ACE2 reaches a value of 21% (see 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, 
 <italic>a</italic> and 
 <italic>c</italic>).
