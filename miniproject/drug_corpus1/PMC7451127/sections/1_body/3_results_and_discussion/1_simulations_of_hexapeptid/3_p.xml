<p id="p0075">Our set of 20 equilibrium MD simulations agrees with the enhanced MD simulation on the general contact patterns of the hexapeptide at ACE2. In both sets of simulations, we find a major binding pattern in the vicinity of the N-terminal region of ACE2, where specifically Arg4 binds to Asn322, which is in agreement with the experimental study (
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The residues Tyr3 and Tyr5 are interacting with Ala387 in a hydrophobic binding mode (see 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> , 
 <italic>a</italic> and 
 <italic>b</italic>). We conclude that the hexapeptide binds preferentially to the N-terminal helix and the helical interface close to the N-terminus, which indeed blocks the binding interface between CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 (
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Based on our findings, the hexapeptide shows a high affinity for the ACE2 binding region, which has the potential to inhibit CoV-2 RBD activation, membrane fusion, and the viral entry into the human cell (
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Subsequently, we used the conformation of the hexapeptide at ACE2 to model five further peptide variants and used a protein binding energy predictor (
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) to determine the interaction strength of the models with ACE2 (see 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, 
 <italic>c</italic> and 
 <italic>d</italic>). We find that the hexapeptide YKYRYL binds with −7.4 kcal/mol and

 <sup>−6</sup> M. A modification of the C-terminal residue to arginine and a hydrophobic modification at the position 4 to Leu leads to a lower interaction energy as we find for the models YNYLYL and YNYLYR (
 <italic>ΔG</italic> = −6.8 and −7.1 kcal/mol). A mutation at the position two to Leu has only a moderate effect and leads to an interaction energy equal to −7.3 kcal/mol. In contrast to the other variants, we found that Lys at position two should remain conserved, whereas a replacement of Arg at the position 4 with Asn increases the affinity of the hexapeptide to energies equal to −7.6 kcal/mol. The conformation with the lowest dissociation constant

 </sub> is the variant YKYNYI, in which the C-terminal Ile stabilizes the interaction, leading to a value of

 </sub> = 2.8 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup> M. Finally, we state that the hexapeptide variants YKYNYI and YKYNYL contain potential alternative sequences for the binding to ACE2 and the inhibition of CoV-2 RBD activation.
