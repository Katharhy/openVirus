<p id="p0070">In an enhanced MD simulation, we simulated the binding of the hexapeptide to ACE2 in implicit solvent. We used this simulation to cross-validate our equilibrium MD simulations. In the enhanced MD simulation over 200 ns, we observe approximately identical binding patterns of the hexapeptide to the surface of ACE2. We observe a first cluster of contacts at Gly354 with an affinity of 27%. We find that a second contact cluster with a propensity ranging from 80 to 100% is located at Trp328 and Glu329 (see region (4) in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, 
 <italic>b</italic> and 
 <italic>d</italic>). We observe another contact pattern at Gln325 with a propensity of 96%. A fourth contact cluster is located at Leu132 with a relative propensity equal to 56%. Finally, we observe a last cluster of contacts at the N-terminus of ACE2 between the residues Ser124 and Gly130 with affinities ranging from 1 to 71% (see regions (2) and (3) in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, 
 <italic>b</italic> and 
 <italic>d</italic>). An additional minor contact formation with a propensity of 2% resides at Glu57 (see region (1) in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, 
 <italic>b</italic> and 
 <italic>d</italic>). To assess the convergence of the simulations, we measured the average root mean-square deviation of the distances from their final value (see 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, 
 <italic>e</italic> and 
 <italic>f</italic>). In the set of 20 NPT-MD simulations, we observe that the average root mean-square deviation decreases to a value below 0.5 nm at ∼30 ns, which shows that the simulation length of 50 ns is sufficient for a convergent sampling (see 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>
 <italic>e</italic>). The CORE-MD simulation over 200 ns in implicit solvent shows that the hexapeptide accesses five different states (see
