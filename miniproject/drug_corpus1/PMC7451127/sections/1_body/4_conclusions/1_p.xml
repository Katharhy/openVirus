<p id="p0095">In this article, we investigated the binding process of a fragment of the SARS CoV spike protein receptor domain (CoV RBD), the hexapeptide YKYRYL on the ACE2 receptor, and its effect on the assembly formation and activation of CoV-2 RBD at ACE2. In agreement with an experimental study, we find a high affinity of the hexapeptide to the binding interface between CoV-2 RBD and ACE2, which we investigated using 20 independent equilibrium MD simulations over a total of 1 
 <italic>Î¼</italic>s and a 200-ns enhanced MD simulation. We then evaluated the effect of the hexapeptide on the binding process of CoV-2 RBD to ACE2 in long-time enhanced MD simulations. In that set of simulations, we found that CoV-2 RBD does not bind to ACE2 with the binding motif shown in experiments, but it rotates because of an electrostatic repulsion and forms a hydrophobic interface with ACE2. Surprisingly, we observed that the hexapeptide binds to CoV-2 RBD, which has the effect that this protein only weakly attaches to ACE2 so that the activation of CoV-2 RBD might be inhibited in this case. Our results indicate that the hexapeptide might be a possible treatment option that prevents the viral activation through the inhibition of the interaction between ACE2 and CoV-2 RBD.
