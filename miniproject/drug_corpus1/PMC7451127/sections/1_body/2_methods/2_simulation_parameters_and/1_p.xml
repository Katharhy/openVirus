<p id="p0050">For all simulations, we used the structures of the CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 complex from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) structure PDB: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:6M0J" id="intref0010" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">6M0J</ext-link> (chain A: ACE2, chain E: CoV-2 RBD) (
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). For the first set of 20 independent NPT-MD simulations over 50 ns in explicit solvent, we centered the PDB structure of ACE2 (PDB: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:6M0J" id="intref0015" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">6M0J</ext-link>, chain A) in a triclinic box with dimensions 7.419 × 8.361 × 8.614 nm
 <sup>3</sup> and filled the box with 17.026 SPC/E waters. For the preparation of 20 starting structures, we placed the hexapeptide YKYRYL at 20 different initial positions in the vicinity to the potential binding site of ACE2 (see

 <italic>b</italic>). In parts, we reduced the accessible conformation space by the placement of the 20 peptide conformations in the vicinity of the CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 interface in the PDB structure. For the selection of random orientations, larger simulation times and a larger number of starting structures would have to be applied. For the enhanced sampling simulation of the hexapeptide-ACE2 system in implicit solvent using CORE-MD enhanced sampling, we modeled one hexapeptide-ACE2 conformation to and simulated the system over 200 ns using the parameters 
 <italic>α</italic> = 5.0 and 
 <italic>β</italic> = 0.5 (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ). For a third and a fourth CORE-MD enhanced sampling simulation with and without the presence of the hexapeptide, we modeled a separated CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 system with an increased contact distance of ∼2.2 nm by which the two domains are separated from each other. For the separated ACE2-CoV2 RBD complex with the hexapeptide, we inserted the hexapeptide 1 nm away from ACE2. Both systems were centered in a triclinic box with dimensions 7.41900 × 9.13930 × 16.23050 nm
