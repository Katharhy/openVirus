In children, allergy and asthma are among the most prevalent non&#x02010;communicable chronic diseases, and healthcare providers taking care of these patients need guidance. At the current stage of knowledge, children have less severe symptoms of COVID&#x02010;19, and severe asthma and immunodeficiency are classified as risk factors. In addition, there is no evidence that currently available asthma and allergy treatments, including antihistamines, corticosteroids, and bronchodilators, increase the risk of severe disease from COVID&#x02010;19. Most countries affected by COVID&#x02010;19 have opted for nationwide confinement, which means that communication with the primary clinician is often performed by telemedicine. Optimal disease control of allergic, asthmatic, and immunodeficient children should be sought according to usual treatment guidelines. This statement of the EAACI Section on Pediatrics puts forward six recommendations for the management of childhood allergies and immunodeficiencies based on six underlying facts and existing evidence.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd id="pai13262-kwd-0001">allergy</kwd><kwd id="pai13262-kwd-0002">asthma</kwd><kwd id="pai13262-kwd-0003">biologics</kwd><kwd id="pai13262-kwd-0004">children</kwd><kwd id="pai13262-kwd-0005">coronavirus</kwd><kwd id="pai13262-kwd-0006">corticosteroids</kwd><kwd id="pai13262-kwd-0007">COVID&#x02010;19</kwd><kwd id="pai13262-kwd-0008">immunodeficiency</kwd><kwd id="pai13262-kwd-0009">SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2</kwd><kwd id="pai13262-kwd-0010">treatment</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="0"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="7"/><word-count count="12143"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>source-schema-version-number</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>edited-state</meta-name><meta-value>corrected-proof</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>details-of-publishers-convertor</meta-name><meta-value>Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:5.8.3 mode:remove_FC converted:02.06.2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><p content-type="self-citation">

Nevertheless, this equilibrium can be disturbed in many occasions and lead to outbreaks of disease. In the case of the delicate interaction between viruses and human beings, many significant epidemic outbreaks of viral disease are linked to respiratory symptoms. Humans have been faced in the last 100&#x000a0;years with major pandemics involving viruses. In 1918, the so&#x02010;called Spanish flu led to more deaths than the civil deaths of the First World War and Second World War combined. More recently, the H1N1 flu, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) led to epidemics to different extents. Currently, the world is faced again with a major pandemic due to a novel coronavirus, the SARS&#x02010;COV&#x02010;2 leading to COVID&#x02010;19 (CoronaVIrus Disease 2019) disease. Epidemiologic data suggest emergence of the virus from an animal market in the city of Wuhan, China, most probably during the last months of 2019.<xref rid="pai13262-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref> Thereafter, the virus has spread throughout the Asia/Pacific area, to the Middle East, the West and throughout the world.<xref rid="pai13262-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref> At the time of this writing (April 10, 2020), the major centers of dissemination are in Europe and North America, although data from other countries may be underrepresented due to lack of testing. Disruptions of social and economic life are significant and by no means comparable to previous respiratory virus pandemics.</p><sec id="pai13262-sec-0002"><label>1.1</label><title>What is different in children?</title><p>While all humans are at risk of being infected regardless of age, gender, or health, vulnerable populations at higher risk of developing a severe form of COVID&#x02010;19 disease have been identified. Among them, older age is a major risk factor. Since the beginning of the pandemic, it has become rapidly apparent that children less often present symptoms and that these are less often severe. The only systematic review bringing together data on children has been published recently and concluded that children account for 1%&#x02010;6% of the diagnosed COVID&#x02010;19 cases often have milder disease than adults, and mortality rates are extremely low.<xref rid="pai13262-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref> However, with hundreds of papers published on COVID&#x02010;19 in the past few months, the problem of reporting the same patients in different manuscripts was raised<xref rid="pai13262-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>; duplicate reporting may lead to inaccurate scientific record and thus potentially misleading results in any systematic review and meta&#x02010;analysis. The first reliable data came from more than 72.000 case reports reviewed by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention showing that less than 1% of cases were younger than 10&#x000a0;years of age.<xref rid="pai13262-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref> Another recent report described in detail the clinical characteristics of 171 children treated for COVID&#x02010;19 at the reference children's hospital in Wuhan.<xref rid="pai13262-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref> The most common clinical signs included cough and pharyngeal erythema. Fever was only observed in 41.5% of the children. Interestingly, although 111/171 (64.9%) were diagnosed with pneumonia, 12 patients had radiologic signs of pneumonia without any symptoms of infection. In the whole cohort, only 3 patients required hospitalization in an intensive care unit for invasive mechanical ventilation. All 3 patients had a pre&#x02010;existing medical condition (hydronephrosis, leukemia, or intussusception), and one of them, a 10&#x02010;month&#x02010;old infant, with intussusception had multi&#x02010;organ failure and died four weeks after admission to the hospital. Asthma and allergies were not mentioned in this case series. In another report, among children aged 1&#x02010;7&#x000a0;years who were admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, all children including four with radiological evidence of pneumonia and one admitted to the intensive care unit have recovered.<xref rid="pai13262-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">

</p><p>A recent study that covered nationwide case series of 2143 pediatric patients with COVID&#x02010;19 reported to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention from January 16 to February 8, 2020, provided important information regarding the epidemiology and transmission patterns of the disease in children.<xref rid="pai13262-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref> In this study, there were 731 laboratory&#x02010;confirmed cases (34.1%) and 1412 suspected cases (65.9%). Ninety&#x02010;four (4.4%) patients were asymptomatic; 1091 (50.9%) had mild disease; and 831 (38.8%) had moderate disease which, as a group of non&#x02010;severe cases (ie, with no hypoxemia or organ failure), accounted for 94.1% of all cases. The proportion of severe and critical cases (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;125, 5.8%) in each age groups was as follows: Within the&#x000a0;&#x0003c;1&#x000a0;year age group, 40 of the 379 patients (10.6%) had severe or critical disease; in the 1&#x02010;5&#x000a0;year group, 36 of the 493 patients (7.3%); 6&#x02010;10&#x000a0;year age group, 22 of 521 patients (4.2%); 11&#x02010;15&#x000a0;year age group, 17 of 413 patients (4.1%); and in the&#x000a0;&#x02265;16&#x000a0;year age group, 10 of 335 patients (3%) had severe disease. There was one fatality of a 14&#x02010;year&#x02010;old boy. The data suggested that younger age, especially infants, was represented at a higher proportion among children with severe disease. However, as discussed in the paper and outlined in an accompanying editorial one should bear in mind that in this study testing for other viruses was not standardized, and two&#x02010;thirds of cases were clinically diagnosed, but not virologically confirmed.<xref rid="pai13262-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref> In addition, more of the severe and critical cases were in the suspected than the confirmed group which suggests that some suspected cases might be caused by other respiratory infections.</p><p>The CDC in the United States recently published a review of laboratory&#x02010;confirmed COVID&#x02010;19 in children between February 12 and April 2, 2020.<xref rid="pai13262-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref> Among 149&#x000a0;082 (99.6%) reported cases for which age was known, 2572 (1.7%) were among children aged&#x000a0;&#x0003c;18&#x000a0;years.&#x000a0;The majority of pediatric cases (57%) were male, and male predominance persisted even in infants. Among 345 pediatric cases with information on underlying conditions, 23% (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;80) had at least one underlying condition, most commonly chronic lung disease (including asthma) (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;40), followed by cardiovascular disease (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;25), and immunosuppression (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10).&#x000a0;Information on hospitalization status for children was available for only 745 (29%) cases. Infants accounted for the highest percentage of hospitalizations; of the 95 infants with known hospitalization status, 62% (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;59) were hospitalized, including five who were admitted to intensive care. There was little variation in the percentage hospitalized among children&#x000a0;&#x0003e;1&#x000a0;year of age. Limitations of this study included substantial missing data; thus, statistical comparisons were not possible and need to be interpreted with caution. However, similarly to the Wuhan review of pediatric cases, children were less severely affected than adults, and infants were more likely to be hospitalized. Of note, given the higher percentage of asymptomatic children in the population, the real percentage of pediatric subjects with severe or critical disease may be even lower.</p><p>The reason for the relatively milder clinical presentation in children is mostly unknown. As outlined in the Chinese study, several factors in relation to the exposure and host factors may account for this observation; in addition, since the children's immune system is still developing, it may react to pathogens differently than do adults.<xref rid="pai13262-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">

Unfortunately, direct evidence is lacking. However, various observations provide some indirect evidence. An analysis of previously published studies shows no benefit from adding systemic corticosteroids during the acute phase of COVID&#x02010;19 infection; in fact, this was associated with increased harm due to complications (psychosis, diabetes, avascular necrosis) and delayed clearance of the virus.<xref rid="pai13262-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">

Previous studies have shown that ICS especially when used at high doses may be associated with an increased risk of pneumonia in adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In this regard, one should keep in mind that children have different phenotypes of asthma than adults.

<italic>Fact 1</italic>: Children are at lower risk for COVID&#x02010;19 infection and have a less severe course of the disease.</p><p>
<italic>Recommendation 1:</italic> Fortunately, pediatric allergists are dealing with a patient population that is at low risk for COVID&#x02010;19. Nevertheless, due to the extent of the disease, severe cases of COVID&#x02010;19 will also be seen in allergic children, independent of their atopic predisposition and their young age. Pediatric allergists should seek to gain the best control of current allergic symptoms and instruct patients on current recommendations for hygiene and social distancing to reduce the risk of COVID&#x02010;19 infection. Given the increased stress levels during the COVID&#x02010;19 pandemic, guidance and support are important for patients and their parents.<xref rid="pai13262-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">
<sup>42</sup>
</xref>
</p><p>
<italic>Fact 2</italic>: Whenever possible, diminish or remove risk factors.</p><p>
<italic>Recommendation 2:</italic> Uncontrolled asthma is classified as a risk factor; thus, asthma control with appropriate medications should be a major goal in such patients. Although asthma is most often multi&#x02010;factorial, allergies may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of their disease. In particular, during months when seasonal allergies become common, asthma control according to current guidelines should be undertaken. Pediatric allergists should aim for optimal asthma control.<xref rid="pai13262-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">
<sup>43</sup>
</xref> In some countries, shielding (home isolation for up to 12&#x000a0;weeks) is recommended for patients with severe asthma<xref rid="pai13262-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">
<sup>44</sup>
</xref> but this method cannot be universally applied and each case should be approached on individual basis.</p><p>
<italic>Fact 3</italic>: Initial symptoms of seasonal allergy might be misleading as they might resemble those seen in a mild flu&#x02010;like infection.</p><p>
<italic>Recommendation 3:</italic> Seasonal allergy symptoms, especially at the beginning of the season, may resemble flu or common cold and thus may also be suggestive of COVID&#x02010;19. Pediatric allergists must be aware of this and not be over&#x02010;suspicious of and yet should not miss COVID&#x02010;19 in allergic patients.</p><p>
<italic><bold>Fact 4</bold></italic>: Treat your allergic patients according to usual guidelines.</p><p>
<italic>Recommendation 4:</italic> There has been no scientific evidence that allergy treatments either increase susceptibility to SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 or the severity of COVID&#x02010;19 disease. Pediatric allergists should treat patients with allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, or other allergy conditions according to usual guidelines,<xref rid="pai13262-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">
<sup>24</sup>
</xref> without restricting the use of any specific medication. One exception to this is the advice to withhold biologics during acute COVID19 disease. In addition, there is also reason to believe that proper treatment of these diseases might prevent unnecessary visits to physicians and hospitals and thus reduce the risk of being exposed to the SARS&#x02010;COV&#x02010;2 virus. Of note, the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) recommends avoiding the use of nebulizers for asthma attacks due to the increased risk of disseminating COVID&#x02010;19 (to other patients and to physicians, nurses, and other personnel); thus, pressurized metered&#x02010;dose inhaler (pMDI) via a spacer is the preferred treatment during severe attacks.<xref rid="pai13262-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">
<sup>28</sup>
</xref>
</p><p>
<italic>Fact 5</italic>: Current knowledge might evolve, and guidelines might change.</p><p>
<italic>Recommendation 5:</italic> As the COVID&#x02010;19 pandemic spreads over the world, increasing number of patients are affected, also including children with allergic diseases. Our knowledge will increase over time, although we do not expect any increasing risk in children with allergic conditions, and current recommendations might change according to new findings. Allergists should be flexible and open to the progress of science, as current recommendations might be revised accordingly.</p><p>
<italic>Fact 6</italic>: Patients with immunodeficiency have an increased risk for infections with respiratory viruses.</p><p>
<italic>Recommendation 6:</italic> Representing a potential at&#x02010;risk&#x02010;group, patients with immunodeficiency are recommended to strictly follow national precaution recommendations to reduce the risk of infection. To avoid disease exacerbations, patients should stay on their regular medication for their underlying disease as well as its complications, including autoimmune, allergic, and other symptoms. Patients with suspected COVID&#x02010;19 infections should be in close contact with their attending physician and resolve any clinical symptoms immediately. Given the risk of face&#x02010;to&#x02010;face consultation, reduced staffing (due to sickness or redeployment), this contact is now often being performed via telemedicine.<xref rid="pai13262-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">
