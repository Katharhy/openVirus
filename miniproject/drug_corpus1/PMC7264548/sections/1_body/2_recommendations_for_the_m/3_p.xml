 <italic>Recommendation 1:</italic> Fortunately, pediatric allergists are dealing with a patient population that is at low risk for COVID‐19. Nevertheless, due to the extent of the disease, severe cases of COVID‐19 will also be seen in allergic children, independent of their atopic predisposition and their young age. Pediatric allergists should seek to gain the best control of current allergic symptoms and instruct patients on current recommendations for hygiene and social distancing to reduce the risk of COVID‐19 infection. Given the increased stress levels during the COVID‐19 pandemic, guidance and support are important for patients and their parents.
