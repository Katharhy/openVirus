 <italic>Recommendation 6:</italic> Representing a potential at‐risk‐group, patients with immunodeficiency are recommended to strictly follow national precaution recommendations to reduce the risk of infection. To avoid disease exacerbations, patients should stay on their regular medication for their underlying disease as well as its complications, including autoimmune, allergic, and other symptoms. Patients with suspected COVID‐19 infections should be in close contact with their attending physician and resolve any clinical symptoms immediately. Given the risk of face‐to‐face consultation, reduced staffing (due to sickness or redeployment), this contact is now often being performed via telemedicine.
