 <italic>Recommendation 3:</italic> Seasonal allergy symptoms, especially at the beginning of the season, may resemble flu or common cold and thus may also be suggestive of COVID‐19. Pediatric allergists must be aware of this and not be over‐suspicious of and yet should not miss COVID‐19 in allergic patients.
