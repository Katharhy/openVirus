 <italic>Recommendation 5:</italic> As the COVID‚Äê19 pandemic spreads over the world, increasing number of patients are affected, also including children with allergic diseases. Our knowledge will increase over time, although we do not expect any increasing risk in children with allergic conditions, and current recommendations might change according to new findings. Allergists should be flexible and open to the progress of science, as current recommendations might be revised accordingly.
