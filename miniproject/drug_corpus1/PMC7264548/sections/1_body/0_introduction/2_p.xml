<p>Viruses interact with most living organisms, mostly in a symbiotic way. Nevertheless, this equilibrium can be disturbed in many occasions and lead to outbreaks of disease. In the case of the delicate interaction between viruses and human beings, many significant epidemic outbreaks of viral disease are linked to respiratory symptoms. Humans have been faced in the last 100 years with major pandemics involving viruses. In 1918, the so‐called Spanish flu led to more deaths than the civil deaths of the First World War and Second World War combined. More recently, the H1N1 flu, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) led to epidemics to different extents. Currently, the world is faced again with a major pandemic due to a novel coronavirus, the SARS‐COV‐2 leading to COVID‐19 (CoronaVIrus Disease 2019) disease. Epidemiologic data suggest emergence of the virus from an animal market in the city of Wuhan, China, most probably during the last months of 2019.

Disruptions of social and economic life are significant and by no means comparable to previous respiratory virus pandemics.
