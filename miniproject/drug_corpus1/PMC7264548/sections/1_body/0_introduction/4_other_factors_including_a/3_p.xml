<p>While public policy is majorly focusing on “flattening the curve,” that is, preventing a too rapid spread of COVID‐19 and on providing adequate health care for patients with severe respiratory symptoms in this very aggressive disease, many health providers are faced with questions about safe management of their patients with chronic health conditions. Many elective face‐to‐face hospital services have been discontinued, in favor of remote consultations that have also been substantially scaled back, which provides its own challenges. The care of children with allergies or immune conditions is being adapted to the current situation, with more remote working and providing guidance to children to reduce likelihood of infection in children who would be deemed at higher risk of severe COVID‐19 disease.</p>
