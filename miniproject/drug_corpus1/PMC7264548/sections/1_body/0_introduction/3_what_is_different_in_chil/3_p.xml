<p>A recent study that covered nationwide case series of 2143 pediatric patients with COVID‐19 reported to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention from January 16 to February 8, 2020, provided important information regarding the epidemiology and transmission patterns of the disease in children.

 </xref> In this study, there were 731 laboratory‐confirmed cases (34.1%) and 1412 suspected cases (65.9%). Ninety‐four (4.4%) patients were asymptomatic; 1091 (50.9%) had mild disease; and 831 (38.8%) had moderate disease which, as a group of non‐severe cases (ie, with no hypoxemia or organ failure), accounted for 94.1% of all cases. The proportion of severe and critical cases (n = 125, 5.8%) in each age groups was as follows: Within the &lt;1 year age group, 40 of the 379 patients (10.6%) had severe or critical disease; in the 1‐5 year group, 36 of the 493 patients (7.3%); 6‐10 year age group, 22 of 521 patients (4.2%); 11‐15 year age group, 17 of 413 patients (4.1%); and in the ≥16 year age group, 10 of 335 patients (3%) had severe disease. There was one fatality of a 14‐year‐old boy. The data suggested that younger age, especially infants, was represented at a higher proportion among children with severe disease. However, as discussed in the paper and outlined in an accompanying editorial one should bear in mind that in this study testing for other viruses was not standardized, and two‐thirds of cases were clinically diagnosed, but not virologically confirmed.

 </xref> In addition, more of the severe and critical cases were in the suspected than the confirmed group which suggests that some suspected cases might be caused by other respiratory infections.
