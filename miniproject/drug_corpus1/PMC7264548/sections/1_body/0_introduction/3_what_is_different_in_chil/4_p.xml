<p>The CDC in the United States recently published a review of laboratory‐confirmed COVID‐19 in children between February 12 and April 2, 2020.

 </xref> Among 149 082 (99.6%) reported cases for which age was known, 2572 (1.7%) were among children aged &lt;18 years. The majority of pediatric cases (57%) were male, and male predominance persisted even in infants. Among 345 pediatric cases with information on underlying conditions, 23% (n = 80) had at least one underlying condition, most commonly chronic lung disease (including asthma) (n = 40), followed by cardiovascular disease (n = 25), and immunosuppression (n = 10). Information on hospitalization status for children was available for only 745 (29%) cases. Infants accounted for the highest percentage of hospitalizations; of the 95 infants with known hospitalization status, 62% (n = 59) were hospitalized, including five who were admitted to intensive care. There was little variation in the percentage hospitalized among children &gt;1 year of age. Limitations of this study included substantial missing data; thus, statistical comparisons were not possible and need to be interpreted with caution. However, similarly to the Wuhan review of pediatric cases, children were less severely affected than adults, and infants were more likely to be hospitalized. Of note, given the higher percentage of asymptomatic children in the population, the real percentage of pediatric subjects with severe or critical disease may be even lower.
