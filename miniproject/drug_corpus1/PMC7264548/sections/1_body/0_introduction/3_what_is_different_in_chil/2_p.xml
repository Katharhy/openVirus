<p>While all humans are at risk of being infected regardless of age, gender, or health, vulnerable populations at higher risk of developing a severe form of COVID‐19 disease have been identified. Among them, older age is a major risk factor. Since the beginning of the pandemic, it has become rapidly apparent that children less often present symptoms and that these are less often severe. The only systematic review bringing together data on children has been published recently and concluded that children account for 1%‐6% of the diagnosed COVID‐19 cases often have milder disease than adults, and mortality rates are extremely low.

 </xref>; duplicate reporting may lead to inaccurate scientific record and thus potentially misleading results in any systematic review and meta‐analysis. The first reliable data came from more than 72.000 case reports reviewed by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention showing that less than 1% of cases were younger than 10 years of age.

 </xref> The most common clinical signs included cough and pharyngeal erythema. Fever was only observed in 41.5% of the children. Interestingly, although 111/171 (64.9%) were diagnosed with pneumonia, 12 patients had radiologic signs of pneumonia without any symptoms of infection. In the whole cohort, only 3 patients required hospitalization in an intensive care unit for invasive mechanical ventilation. All 3 patients had a pre‐existing medical condition (hydronephrosis, leukemia, or intussusception), and one of them, a 10‐month‐old infant, with intussusception had multi‐organ failure and died four weeks after admission to the hospital. Asthma and allergies were not mentioned in this case series. In another report, among children aged 1‐7 years who were admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, all children including four with radiological evidence of pneumonia and one admitted to the intensive care unit have recovered.
