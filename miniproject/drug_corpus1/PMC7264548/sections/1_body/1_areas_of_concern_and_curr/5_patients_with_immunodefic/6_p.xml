<p>To increase our knowledge in disease mechanisms, we need to learn from clinical and immunologic characteristics of patients with severe in contrast to moderate disease.

 </xref> In children and young adults, COVID‐19 mainly occurs mildly and without life‐threatening complications. If COVID‐19 causes severe to lethal disease as observed in sporadic cases in these age groups without other comorbidities, it is tempting to speculate that severity is due to a defect in defense against the infection. Therefore, a targeted search for possible monogenic immunodeficiencies by next generation sequencing and further advanced methods was launched in these patients,
