<p>Since primary immunodeficiencies (PID) are congenital disorders, patients with PID might represent a potential group‐at‐risk in the current pandemic of COVID‐19. From the very onset of the pandemic, a special focus was given to this patient group predisposed to infections with respiratory viruses. An international consensus recently summarized how to best manage patients with PID during the pandemic.

 </xref> According to current knowledge in April 2020, it is not yet known whether any specific form of immunodeficiency poses a particular threat to patients. As a joint project, questionnaires were launched by the Joint Forces of International Societies for Immunodeficiencies to map and follow‐up the situation among patients with immunodeficiencies.

 </xref> So far, only individual patients (15 patients in total as of April 6, 2020) with immunodeficiency and COVID‐19 are listed in the survey. Most of them present a milder course of the disease. Those with a more severe disease course additionally have comorbidities or complications of their immunodeficiency. As COVID‐19 might also trigger complications of an underlying disease, patients with immunodeficiencies should be very carefully followed up during COVID‐19.
