<p>Concerns have also been raised regarding a more severe course of COVID‐19 in patients already treated with systemic steroids, as patients on oral corticosteroids could have modified immune response predisposing to an increased susceptibility or a higher rate of infection. Unfortunately, direct evidence is lacking. However, various observations provide some indirect evidence. An analysis of previously published studies shows no benefit from adding systemic corticosteroids during the acute phase of COVID‐19 infection; in fact, this was associated with increased harm due to complications (psychosis, diabetes, avascular necrosis) and delayed clearance of the virus.
