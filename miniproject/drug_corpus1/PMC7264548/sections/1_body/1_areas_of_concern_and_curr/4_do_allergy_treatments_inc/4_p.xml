<p>There are no data regarding whether the treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) modifies the susceptibility to or severity of COVID‐19. Previous studies have shown that ICS especially when used at high doses may be associated with an increased risk of pneumonia in adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In this regard, one should keep in mind that children have different phenotypes of asthma than adults. In children, however, a recent meta‐analysis has shown that regular use of ICS may not increase the risk of pneumonia or other respiratory infections in children with asthma.

 </xref> Early childhood is a time associated with frequent infections due to common respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or rhinovirus. In children with increased bronchial hyperactivity, recurrent viral infections predispose to episodes of bronchoconstriction. In order to prevent this, these patients are frequently treated with ICS. During such treatments, increased severity or frequency of viral infection has not been observed.
