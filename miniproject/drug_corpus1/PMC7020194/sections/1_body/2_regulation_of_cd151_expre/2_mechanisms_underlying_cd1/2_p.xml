<p>Interestingly, the mechanism underlying hypoxia-mediated downregulation of CD151 was determined to be at the transcriptional level (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Chien et al., 2008</xref>). In addition to the decrease in CD151 protein expression under hypoxic conditions, CD151 mRNA levels were also reduced significantly in hypoxic compared to normoxic conditions. This reduction in mRNA levels was confirmed with desferrioxamine treatment. The group went on to identify a putative hypoxia-response element (HRE) in the human CD151 promoter region and intron II, suggesting a direct action on CD151 regulation by hypoxia exposure.
