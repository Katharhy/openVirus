<p>In addition to transcriptional regulation of CD151 expression, another area that may be explored is post-translational modifications. Several reports have previously identified six intracellular C- terminal cysteine sites on CD151 that are palmitoylated, that is, C11, C15, C79, C80, C242, and C243 (

 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2002</xref>). Besides palmitoylation, CD151 may also undergo glycosylation at the asparagine residue, N159 (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Baldwin et al., 2008</xref>). However, palmitoylation and glycosylation modifications have not exhibited differences in expression levels or staining pattern (

 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">Zevian et al., 2011</xref>). Also, the effect of drug treatment on these post-translational modifications has not been elucidated. Besides palmitoylation and glycosylation of CD151, the post-translational modification of ubiquitination should also be explored as it may be informative with regards to CD151 protein stability.
