<p>Lung cancer has a high degree of molecular heterogeneity thus giving rise to diverse pathological features. Cases are classified according to respective histological characteristics leading to the distinction between small and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (

The authors found that the monoclonal antibody raised against CD151 was capable of inhibiting both spontaneous and experimental metastasis in the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane model. Since then, CD151 overexpression has been implicated as a negative prognostic indicator in numerous solid malignancies (
