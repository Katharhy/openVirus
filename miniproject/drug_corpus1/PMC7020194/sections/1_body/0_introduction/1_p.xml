<p>Respiratory diseases account for significant illness and premature mortality around the world. The global impact of respiratory diseases is difficult to quantify due to discrepancies or insufficient data across regions, however, the socioeconomic burden of these conditions cannot be ignored. More than 9.5 million deaths globally were attributed to respiratory diseases – the most common of which were asthma, lower respiratory infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer – and the total cost of respiratory diseases in the European Union alone was estimated to total over €380 billion annually (

Hence, the development of novel therapies is required to alter the progression of disease severity and/or prevent disease onset.
