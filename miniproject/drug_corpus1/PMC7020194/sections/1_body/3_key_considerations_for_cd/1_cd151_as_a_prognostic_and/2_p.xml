<p>Besides immunohistochemical analysis, an emerging technology in determining protein expression is exosome protein profiling. Tetraspanins, including CD151, are shown to be highly enriched in exosomes (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Merino et al., 2014</xref>) which may be derived from plasma or urine samples (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Jakobsen et al., 2015</xref>) making this method far less invasive than traditional biopsy techniques. The potential of CD151 expression detection in exosomes as a screening tool has been explored where a high level of accuracy (72%) in detecting cancer in adenocarcinoma patients was observed (

 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Reck et al., 2013</xref>). Whilst this method requires further validation, it may be a promising avenue to complement or improve current diagnostic processes.
