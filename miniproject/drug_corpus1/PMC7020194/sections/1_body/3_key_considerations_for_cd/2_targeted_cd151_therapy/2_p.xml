<p>Besides the use of monoclonal antibodies, CD151 gene deletion has been instrumental in improving markers of disease outcomes in asthma, influenza, and tumor progression. As described above, CD151 knockdown, through siRNA technology, markedly reduced airway smooth muscle contraction whilst airway hyperresponsive processes decreased significantly in allergen-induced CD151-null mice. Following influenza A virus infection, CD151-null mice exhibited better survival and reduced viral titer, which was attributed to the role of CD151 in nuclear export of viral proteins confirmed using CD151 knockdown experiments. In the context of cancer, both experimental lung metastasis and tumor cell residence were reduced in CD151-null mice. Furthermore, pathologic angiogenesis was impaired in these CD151-null mice despite showing no vascular defects under normal developmental conditions. The impact of CD151 was also reported in breast cancer in which mammary tumor initiation, tumor growth, survival, and metastasis were impaired in CD151-null mice (
