<p>Despite the promising results with monoclonal antibodies and gene deletion, there are several obstacles that restrict the development of these therapeutic strategies. The ubiquitous expression of CD151 in normal human tissue (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Sincock et al., 1997</xref>) and its role under physiological conditions (as described above) warrant further studies to determine whether diminishing CD151 expression for therapeutic benefit in the lungs may lead to unwanted, adverse effects to other healthy cells/organs. In this regard, advancements in targeted drug delivery would be extremely beneficial to avoid off-target effects. Developments in the field of nanotechnology and the advent of nanoparticles or nanocarriers in biomedical research provide another avenue for exploiting the importance of CD151 in lung diseases. Several reviews have summarized the clinical significance of nanomedicine in which binding molecules (such as peptides, aptamers, and antibodies) are utilized in cell-specific or tissue-localized delivery of drugs, compounds or genetic material (

 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Rosenblum et al., 2018</xref>). For instance, using the nanoparticle-based system, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Deshmukh et al. (2018)</xref> were able to deliver the small molecule EGFR-specific inhibitor, erlotinib, specifically to myofibroblasts by means of targeting a transmembrane receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta, which is uniquely expressed on myofibroblasts in the liver. This specific delivery to hepatic myofibroblasts was more effective and well-tolerated compared to systemic administration of the drug alone (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Deshmukh et al., 2018</xref>). No studies to date have reported the use of CD151-specific binding molecules as a targeting mechanism for drug delivery, but its potential could be explored given the importance of CD151 overexpression in various lung diseases and other human malignancies. Delivery of genetic material to inhibit the expression of CD151, such as in the case of short hairpin RNA or guide RNA for CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing, is another approach that may be investigated. Also, advancements could be made to improve not only uptake but enhanced retention of drugs (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Matsumura and Maeda, 1986</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Klibanov et al., 1990</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Blume et al., 1993</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Blanco et al., 2015</xref>), as well as route of drug administration (local delivery via inhalation versus systemic delivery) (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Yan et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Cryer and Thorley, 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Mukherjee et al., 2019</xref>). In addition to that, the magnitude of CD151 reduction required in cases of overexpression will also need to be assessed, specifically whether CD151 expression levels can be ablated completely or must be brought back to a baseline expression to ensure physiological functions are not disrupted. Finally, drug-induced upregulation of CD151 must be taken into account given the importance of expression changes in disease progression and severity.
