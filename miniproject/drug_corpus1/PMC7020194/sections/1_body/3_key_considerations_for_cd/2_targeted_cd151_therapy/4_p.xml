<p>Cluster of Differentiation 151 may also play an important role as an adjuvant therapy alongside currently available therapeutics. Given the close association of CD151 with oncogenic drivers including growth factors, such as EGFR (

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Ha et al., 2014</xref>), CD151 was shown to impair growth factor receptor-dependent processes such as tumor onset, cell growth, spreading and motility. CD151 ablation in these studies was sufficient to arrest or impair oncogenic responses. Furthermore, in the case of EGFR and HER2-specific inhibitors, drug sensitivity was restored when CD151 expression was abrogated (
