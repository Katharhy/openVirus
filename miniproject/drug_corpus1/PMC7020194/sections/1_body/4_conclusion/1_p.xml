<p>Cluster of Differentiation 151 is involved in numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes. Therefore, it has been implicated in several diseases, including respiratory diseases such as lung cancer, asthma, influenza and IPF (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The majority of studies link CD151 to disease onset, severity or progression. The mechanisms underlying CD151 upregulation or downregulation remain to be fully understood. Nonetheless, the clinical significance of CD151 expression shows that CD151 has great potential to be developed as a diagnostic biomarker which may be helpful for early detection or screening, or as a prognostic biomarker given its relevance in predicting lung cancer or asthma severity. Furthermore, CD151 monoclonal antibodies, gene deletion, and nanotechnology studies support the notion for its development as a novel targeted or adjuvant therapy in the treatment of respiratory diseases.
