<p>There is a significant opportunity for research that characterizes and integrates cardiovascular, pulmonary, and other clinical aspects of both CD and NCDs using the lens of syndemics to better comprehend the synergistic effects of these diseases in PWH while also incorporating social, behavioral, political, and ecological factors which underlie diseases. The goal should be to gain a deeper understanding of the interplay between these factors and their role in promoting disease clustering at the population level, and the impact they have on disease pathologies at the individual and community level with the intent to encourage more holistic approaches in the clinical management of PWH. Moreover, the economic impact of HIV/AIDS in LMICs suggests that a comprehensive model of care which includes syndemic characterization of various factors that underpin the epidemic in distinct regions of the world is needed. This multifaceted approach which incorporates both clinical and non-clinical elements in the management of chronic disease can provide the evidence-based need for sustaining interventions to reduce the burden of diseases among PWH.</p>
