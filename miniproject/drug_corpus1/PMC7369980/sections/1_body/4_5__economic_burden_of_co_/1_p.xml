<p>The shift in prognosis from life-threatening to a chronic but manageable disease has been a major public health achievement in the HIV/AIDS community. PWH initiating ART can now expect to have similar life expectancies as their HIV-negative counterparts, barring significant HIV-related comorbidities. However, coupled with the fact that these additional years of life require treatment for survival and that PWH are more susceptible to opportunistic infections as well as a multitude of other chronic diseases, a diagnosis of HIV now presents as a critical economic burden. Currently, the average annual cost of treating HIV/AIDS alone is approximately USD 20,000 among all levels of CD4 count [

It is important to consider that this value ignores the indirect costs associated with treating HIV/AIDS, such as transportation, the time and effort required of family members to assist in managing the infection, as well as the larger, contextual burden of productivity loss which has great potential to negatively affect economic stability. In Africa, economic growth can be reduced by up to 4% each year as a result of HIV/AIDS-related productivity loss [
