<p>Of the estimated 37.9 million people living with HIV/AIDS globally in 2018, approximately 23.3 million are receiving antiretroviral therapy, and this number is expected to increase [

While ART improves life expectancy significantly and decreases susceptibility to HIV-related infections, it also leads to an increase in the incidence of age-related NCD such as chronic cardiovascular, pulmonary, and hematological conditions [

As people live longer, the prevalence of HIV infection in LMICs and its co-occurrence with other CD and NCD are increasing compared to high-income countries (HICs). Current models predict that while HIV/AIDS will not be among the top 10 leading causes of death for high-income countries, it will remain in the top five for LMICs, and will cluster with other NCDs [

Countries within Central and South America and the Caribbean, Central and sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia regions have the potential to be the most negatively affected by the co-occurrence of syndromes, revealing a major health disparity and the need to address the challenges in these regions, as well as the urgency to gain a deeper understanding of the root causes of disease clustering in PWH and ways to mitigate them effectively.
