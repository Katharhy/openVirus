<p>In the context of CD coinfections, it is well described that tuberculosis (TB) and HIV act synergistically to cause excess morbidity and mortality among PWH who are more likely to develop TB because of their immunodeficiency. Of the approximately 37.9 million people living with HIV, more than one-third are also infected with TB. In fact, TB is the leading killer of people with HIV, accounting for 1 in 3 AIDS-related deaths [

In HIV-infected individuals, TB often occurs outside the lungs, evading traditional diagnostic tests and making people unaware that they have TB. Poorly ventilated facilities such as hospitals, homeless shelters, prisons, and clinics can promote the spread of TB to vulnerable HIV-positive individuals, further fueling the syndemic [

On top of the HIV/TB health challenge, the use of tobacco, while not a communicable disease, is yet another global epidemic that collectively with HIV/TB amplifies the health impacts of the individual factors. The three epidemics (HIV, TB and tobacco use) are often approached individually in low-income countries. These syndemics share common social determinants of health (poverty, low-education, high population density, cultural patterns), and health systems could benefit from holistic frameworks to integrate all factors to improve disease outcome and clinical practice.
