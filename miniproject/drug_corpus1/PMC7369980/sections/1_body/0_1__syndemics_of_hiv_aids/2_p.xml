<p>The Framework of Syndemics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-04704-f001">Figure 1</xref>) provides powerful strategies for recognizing how social, behavioral, political, and ecological factors create and perpetuate structural vulnerabilities that contribute to syndemic emergence (synergistic epidemic) and exacerbation of the progression of diseases in PWH. Moreover, it enables the understanding of how certain individuals, families, and communities are consigned to harmful environments that make them vulnerable to syndemics with concrete effects on social and biological wellbeing [

Additionally, syndemic knowledge makes it possible to intervene effectively at both the policy and clinical levels by addressing both the root causes of sickness and the disparity/inequality in the treatment of symptoms (clinical care). It has been eloquently stated by Mendenhall and colleagues that “how we think about disease pathologies affects how we design policies and deliver care to those most affected by social and economic inequities. Conventional frameworks in medicine and public health, such as comorbidity and multi-morbidity, often overlook the effects of social, political, and ecological factors” [
 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-17-04704" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In the context of PWH having a full lifespan, chronic diseases within this population around the globe are starting to emerge. Utilizing the comorbidities framework has advanced our understanding of the underpinnings of disease from a molecular and mechanistic perspective; however, this framework lacks the fundamental elements to incorporate economic, psychological, and large-scale social forces that precipitate disease clustering in marginalized populations for PWH around the globe. Based on the work of Singer, the term 
 <italic>synergistic epidemics</italic> or 
 <italic>syndemics</italic> was coined to capture the largely non-biological aspects of disease clustering that is lacking in the comorbidities/multi-morbidities framework [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-17-04704" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Syndemics involve population-level clustering of social and health problems. The criteria of a syndemic are as follows: (1) two (or more) diseases or health conditions cluster within a specific population; (2) contextual and social factors create the conditions in which two (or more) diseases or health conditions cluster; and (3) the clustering of diseases results in adverse disease interaction, either biological or social or behavioral, increasing the health burden of affected populations [

Within this context, Singer cites some powerful examples of how syndemic interaction of food insecurity increases the risk of HIV transmission by promoting involvement in risky behaviors (such as commercial sex activities) and worsens HIV clinical outcomes [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-17-04704" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]; moreover, mental health and the psychosocial elements of discrimination are emerging areas of research [
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-17-04704" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Furthermore, for implementation research, syndemic intervention can strengthen prevention and care strategies by considering the full scope of syndemic vulnerabilities, rather than treating disorders individually and ignoring the complex contexts in which they occur [
