<p id="p0055">A group of new techniques, called isothermal amplification of nucleic acids, has been introduced with loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) [
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) [
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] as its main representative, with an important aim of bypassing PCR-related patents. Papers that have described these techniques start with the claim that LAMP is far superior to PCR because complicated temperature cycling is not required for isothermal amplification. However, temperature cycling is a very simple engineering method that helps to improve the PCR specificity. Proportional-integral-derivative controllers that include temperature sensors and solid-state relays are cheap and readily available. In addition to that, LAMP still needs a closed-feedback loop system heater to maintain the system's temperature in a range of 50°C–60°C. Both real-time PCR and real-time LAMP require a fluorescence detection system, and due to the rather weak fluorescent output signal the fluorescent signal related electronic processing circuits is far more demanding than those for temperature control. Although there is no requirement for temperature cycling, LAMP is a complicated process. Given that nothing comes for free, a simple LAMP requires six primers, but a PCR needs only two; thus, it does not seem to be correct to assume the simplicity of LAMP. Nevertheless, the LAMP system has its merits, which include the fact that thermal cycling is not required, resulting in better thermal isolation and, therefore, less power consumption compared with PCR. Also, LAMP can be designed to simplify the readout by colorimetry or nephelometry, instead of conventional fluorescence detection. [
