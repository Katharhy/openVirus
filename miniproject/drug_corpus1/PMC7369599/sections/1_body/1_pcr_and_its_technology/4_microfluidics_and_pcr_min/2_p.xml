<p id="p0060">Following in the footsteps of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), the field of microfluidics—or lab-on-a-chip—emerged in the early 1990s, with the grand vision of producing a micro-total-analysis system (μTAS) [
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Two analytical techniques pioneered the field: capillary electrophoresis (CE) [
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and PCR [
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The first demonstrations of both techniques independently on the microchip format led to the PCR-CE integration [
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] later on by implementation of a real-time PCR to a portable unit for a POC-PCR [
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Since then, important innovations have taken place in terms of materials [
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], as well as the method of implementation [
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], extending the boundaries of this field. However, nearly three decades on, these efforts have yet to bear fruit in daily life outside the laboratory. One cannot help but wonder: why has the development and deployment of practical POC-PCR testing taken so much time? This is a pressing question, especially at a dire time like the present, when the world is battling another once-in-a-century pandemic, COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This is the 
 <italic>raison d’être</italic> of μTAS. This background should not be taken as a criticism of the slow development because the task of making portable systems for viral diagnostics with minimal false-positive and -negative results is complex, and great progress has indeed been made in recent years.
