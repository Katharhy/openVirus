<p id="p0065">PCR runs on a platform which cycles the temperature of the reaction between two or three set points for over 30 to 40 cycles. The reaction time is often limited by heating and cooling rate within each cycle determined by power dissipation (
 <italic>P</italic>) and system thermal time constant (τ). It is reduced with a reduced thermal mass (inclusive of the sample and the chamber) and with decreased isolation of this thermal mass from surrounding. Both features can be fulfilled by miniaturization, through MEMS technology and microfluidics, which has lowered the reaction time from &gt;30 min to several min in the past decade [

 <italic>C</italic> is its thermal capacitance. The total reaction time depends on a series of parameters, such as the chip size, the PCR master mix volume determining the value of 
 <italic>C</italic>, the thermal conductivity of the substrate (
 <italic>G</italic>), and the temperature cycling rate. Here, the miniaturization of the PCR results in a smaller value of 
 <italic>C</italic>, which proportionally lowers the Δ
 <italic>t</italic>. Recently, an extremely fast PCR with a 0.4 s·cycle
 <sup>−1</sup> has been demonstrated and resulted in an incredible total reaction time of less than 15 s [
