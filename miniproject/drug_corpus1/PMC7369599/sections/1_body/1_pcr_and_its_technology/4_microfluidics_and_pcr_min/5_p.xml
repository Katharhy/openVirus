 </disp-formula>and power demanding systems are not suitable for battery-operated POC devices. Nevertheless, the system heating/cooling rate can still be increased without compromising the power increase by minimizing the sample volume. Isothermal amplification systems benefit from the absence of a cooling requirement, making the τ value irrelevant. Then, there is an option to thermally isolate the heated part with a G value as low as possible to consume very little energy—a valuable feature of portable, battery-operated systems.
