<p id="p0050">PCR-based systems are, in principle, capable of detecting a single copy of RNA or DNA, with the assumption that the single DNA/RNA copy is presented in the sample and not lost during the sample preparation. The PCR/RT-PCR is a far superior technique in comparison with antibody-based assays due to the much smaller diagnostic window, i.e., it stops providing false-negative results earlier than the antibody-based assays. An alternative to PCR is a ligase chain reaction with short templates, whereby the products are only one base pair longer than the combined length of both the primers [
