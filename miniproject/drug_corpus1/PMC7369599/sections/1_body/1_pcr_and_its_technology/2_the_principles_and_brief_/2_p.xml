<p id="p0045">Single-step RT-PCR is a technique derived from the original PCR [
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] to perform a reverse transcription followed by the PCR temperature cycling. It requires a mixture of reverse transcriptase, DNA polymerase, short oligonucleotides complementary to the target cDNA, called primers, free nucleotides, and bivalent salts, such as MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>. The RT-PCR starts with reverse transcription, typically conducted at ≈60°C, followed by a hot start performed at ≈93°C, destroying the reverse transcriptase and activating the polymerase. Typically, there are 35–45 cycles consisting of a double stranded DNA (dsDNA) denaturation at 93°C, primer annealing at a temperature ranging between 55°C and 65°C, and extension at 72°C to finish the dsDNA. The three temperature protocols can be simplified by a two-step temperature protocol, whereby the annealing and elongation are conducted at the same temperature [
