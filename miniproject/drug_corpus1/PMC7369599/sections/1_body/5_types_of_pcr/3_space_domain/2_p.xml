<p id="p0140">The PCR master mix is pumped into a channel or chamber in the chip, typically with two/three zones maintained at constant temperatures [
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The reaction is performed when the solution is passing through these temperature areas by denaturation, annealing, and extension. This is an old technique that was used in the early days of PCR systems, with three baths with different temperatures and a laboratory technician or robot to move a basket with samples from bath to bath. Currently, this technique is still utilized in miniaturized systems, such as flow-through and rotational types. The flow-through method is a typical space-domain PCR method. The solution is pumped into a microfluidic channel made of polymers with different temperature regions, and a number of microheaters are applied to provide different temperature zones for denaturation, annealing, and elongation when performing the PCR. These zones maintain constant temperatures, and only the temperature of the samples is changed while it is moved through the zones with different temperatures [
