<p id="p0165">Standard PCR (end-point) typically utilizes electrophoresis of either a gel or capillary type to detect PCR products after thermal cycling. A PCR master mix is pumped into a microchannel fabricated in a microfluidic chip, and PCR is performed using microheaters. After the reaction, the solution is taken out, and gel electrophoresis (GE) is conducted to check the presence and specificity of the amplicons [
