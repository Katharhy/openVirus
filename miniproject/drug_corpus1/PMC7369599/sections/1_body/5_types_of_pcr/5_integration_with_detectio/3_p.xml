<p id="p0170">Detection by GE/CE made the chip or system design complicated, hindering the system miniaturization for POC diagnostics. Inspired by commercial real-time PCR instruments, optical detection modules, such as optical fibers [
 <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] and lock-in amplifiers [
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], were then integrated into miniaturized qPCR systems while intercalating dyes such as SYBR Green or probe were added into the PCR master mix, and the reaction was monitored in real time. Furthermore, additional types of qPCR systems combined with other technologies have been developed to improve performance. A pico-liter droplet array generated by double-inkjet printing was demonstrated to be capable of performing parallel qPCR with an enhanced throughput [
