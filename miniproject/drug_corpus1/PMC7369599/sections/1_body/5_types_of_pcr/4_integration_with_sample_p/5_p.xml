<p id="p0160">A large sample volume to be processed needed to be stored in a plastic cartridge next to the Si chip, and the Si chip experienced processing problems due to its small channel cross section. The first step is to filter out red blood cells, while effectively capturing white blood cells for subsequent lysis. The DNA-capturing system was based on a SiO
 <sub>2</sub> surface inside the chip, was orders of magnitude smaller than the one based on microfiber membranes or silica beads. Finally, the use of Si nanowires as DNA sensors offers somewhat questionable repeatability. The replacement of a conventional PCR with a qPCR would make life easier because there would be no sample manipulation after PCR, and qPCR is well established technique. Nevertheless, the system had limited portability.
