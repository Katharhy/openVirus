<p id="p0150">A number of fully integrated systems have so far been developed, starting with the non-portable GeneXpert from Cepheid, which was first utilized for anthrax detection by the United States Postal Service [

 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Despite being non-portable, it is a true sample-to-answer system that uses injection-molded plastic preloaded cartridges with lyophilized compounds, including a PCR master mix, as well as infectious agent-specific primers. Their prohibitive capital cost has unfortunately restricted the spread of these systems, given that those employed in South Africa were heavily subsidized.
