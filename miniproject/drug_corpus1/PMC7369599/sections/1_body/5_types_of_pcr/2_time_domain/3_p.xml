<p id="p0125">The PCR master mix is dispensed into a stationary location, such as droplets or microwells, and microheaters are then used to conduct the thermal cycling beneath the droplets or wells. There are several techniques that can be employed to split samples to form droplets. A few Î¼L of PCR master mix is pipetted onto a hydrophobic/oleophobic glass coverslip and covered by mineral oil, forming a virtual reaction chamber (VRC) [
