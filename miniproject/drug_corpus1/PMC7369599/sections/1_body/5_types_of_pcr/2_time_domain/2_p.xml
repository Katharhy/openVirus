<p id="p0120">The first conventional thermal cycler, called Mr. Cycle, was a time-domain system, as are most current PCR devices. Samples are placed at fixed locations on a heater whose temperature is modulated according to the required PCR protocol. The heaters can be based on dissipating Joule heat with active heating and passive cooling, or by utilizing thermoelectric coolers with active heating, as well as cooling.</p>
