<p id="p0040">The raw sample and the reagents used in the sample preparation often contain a significant level of PCR-inhibiting factors; thus, proper sample preparation—whether manual or automated—is an essential step for successful detection [
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The success of virus detection in real-world biological samples is highly dependent on the volume of the analyzed sample. During the initial phases of infection, the viral loads in patients may be near or below the test LOD [
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The analysis of larger volumes of biological fluids with a low viral load is likely to reduce the risk of false-negative results, but microfluidic point-of-care (POC) devices are typically unable to handle mL-scale volumes in a short time due to the requirement of slow flow rates. Multiple approaches have been developed to address this problem. Flow-through capture membranes [
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] have been used to capture nucleic acids in a short period of time, allowing the direct amplification of the captured material without any elution step, detecting as few as ≈10 copies of DNA with flow rates as high as ≈1 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>. Magnetic beads [

 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] were used to isolate the RNA of avian influenza H5N1 and SARS from a ≈40 μL sample of blood; this is an insufficient volume on which to perform reliable coronavirus diagnostics. Carbon nanotubes [
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] or aptamers [
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] have been used to capture RNA from influenza A and H5N1 from avian flu viruses, respectively, and to promote their enrichment in samples. Here, we look back and identify those technologies that appeared since the emergence of SARS in late 2002. It is our aim to put landmark developments under the spotlight, critically evaluate them, and raise questions to identify the gaps that are currently hindering a commercial POC-PCR test. There have also been other recent outbreaks of infectious diseases that have threatened global human health, such as Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2018, measles in Burundi, and yellow fever. Additionally, the lower respiratory infections, tuberculosis, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease were listed among the top ten global causes of death in 2016 [
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The PCR test on samples prepared from blood and urine specimens is capable of detecting the virus in the early stages of the disease, resulting in early diagnosis and subsequent isolation of infected patients to block transmission. For a comprehensive snapshot of the field, we refer the reader to in-depth reviews on the topic that have appeared in recent years [
