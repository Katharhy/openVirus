<p id="p0035">Technically, once a disease emerges, researchers identify the infectious agent by sequencing its genome, after which the newly obtained sequence is compared against sequences in the databases to evaluate its similarity to other known viruses. Determination of a sequence that is truly unique to the newly characterized virus represents a crucial step in the development of an effective diagnostic procedure. Furthermore, such a sequence should be selected from a region of the viral genome that is not variable between its different isolates and is not expected to evolve and mutate quickly. When a suitable sequence is determined, the design and synthesis of the relevant PCR primers can be performed routinely. In the case of RNA viruses, the reverse transcription that converts viral RNA to cDNA represents a crucial step, allowing the subsequent application of all methodologies based on PCR (
