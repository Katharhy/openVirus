<p id="p0025">The 21st century has witnessed exponential growth in science and technology; however, sadly and ironically, it has succumbed to devastating coronavirus infections: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and now coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As of July 7, 2020, a total of 11,500,302 COVID-19 cases had been reported across the world, together with 535,759 deaths [
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The SARS and MERS coronaviruses were transmitted indirectly from bats to humans through civets and camels, respectively, as intermediate hosts [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], but the one responsible for COVID-19, has yet to be identified [
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. One of the main reasons that outbreaks such as these occur is the ability of viruses to evolve rapidly and change their animal hosts; this was seen with 
 <italic>Spanish influenza</italic>, the single-largest pandemic of the last century, which was probably caused by a virus that was transmitted from ducks to domestic pigs and then to humans, in the densely populated region of southern China [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The virus was eventually transmitted to the USA and Europe after World War I. Recombination among viruses as they change their hosts is a natural process. There is, therefore, always a strong probability of new epidemics emerging from novel types of viruses, especially in densely inhabited regions (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.Â 1</xref> ). The emergence of a coronavirus epidemic in the southern provinces of China has been predicted for some time, given the presence of multiple bat species that are infected with many different coronaviruses, in these highly populated areas [
