<p id="p0030">Coronaviruses and influenza viruses tend to be diagnosed through the detection of their specific genomes, in particular their ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequences. Rapid and precise screening of the public is essential to identify and quarantine infected people, thereby limiting or potentially eliminating the spread of the virus. The viral load of coronaviruses is high, making it easily detectable in symptomatic patients. Unfortunately, there is also a high percentage of asymptomatic individuals, making an accurate disease diagnosis of the population a challenging job unless the entire population is tested [

A low level of limit-of-detection (LOD) is crucial to shift the diagnostic window of opportunity toward the start of the infection process, to detect newly infected individuals. The test can be based on immunoassays, using antibodies to detect a specific antigen produced by the body's immune system or polymerase chain reactions (PCR) to detect a viral genome sequence. The PCR method is capable of multiplying the DNA with specific sequences in a short time, greatly enhancing the capability of infectious disease diagnostics. Since its invention in 1986, variants of PCR, such as the standard PCR (end-point PCR), the quantitative PCR (qPCR), and the digital PCR have been developed and subsequently applied in the field of molecular diagnostics. For coronaviruses, as with other RNA viruses, a reverse transcription step precedes the PCR (RT-PCR) and transcribes the viral RNA into complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA). The PCR test becomes the method of choice due to its sensitivity, as well as its specificity, and it is, in principle, capable of detecting a single copy of the virus, resulting in a shortening of the diagnostic window in comparison with immunoassays.
