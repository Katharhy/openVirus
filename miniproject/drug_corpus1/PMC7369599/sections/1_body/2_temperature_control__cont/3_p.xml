<p id="p0085">Heating methods determine the temperature ramping rate and are currently divided into contact and non-contact heating. The contact heating method utilizes embedded/external heat sources, such as deposited thin films or external Peltier elements [
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]; this method increases thermal mass, inevitably hindering fast thermal transitions during reactions. The non-contact heating method was developed using hot air [
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] or infrared radiation as a heat source and directly heats the sample in small volumes [
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. These contact and non-contact heating methods employed for microchips depend on the material of the substrate, the reaction volume, and the structure of the chip.
