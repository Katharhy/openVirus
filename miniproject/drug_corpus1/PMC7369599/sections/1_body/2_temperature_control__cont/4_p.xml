<p id="p0090">Thermal isolation must also be considered in a miniaturized PCR system because thermal cross-talk deteriorates the chip's performance, especially in multifunctional reaction chambers on a single chip [
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Furthermore, poor thermal isolation results in heat loss from the temperature zones to the surroundings, while the suspended PCR chamber enables good thermal isolation. A hollow reaction chamber has been made out of micromachined silicon (Si) that is integrated with both the heater and the sensor and is connected by a narrow beam to the substrate to achieve thermal isolation [
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In addition, isolated layers with high thermal resistance have been applied to provide excellent thermal isolation [
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]; however, they result in more complex fabrication and additional stress in different layers. Materials with low thermal conductivity, such as glass or plastics, could provide excellent thermal isolation for PCR chips, thereby avoiding the temperature cycling of the entire device [
