<p id="p0190">A portable and affordable real-time PCR system has been developed. The core of the system is a micro-machined Si chip integrated with a thin-film metal heater and a resistive temperature detector type of sensor [
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The basic philosophy the researchers had in mind was to develop a cheap system with disposable parts in contact with the sample to avoid sample-to-sample cross-contamination, and, therefore, the MEMS chip was separated from the sample by a disposable microscope coverslip. The sample was placed together with a volume of a few μL, covered with mineral oil to prevent evaporation, forming a VRC. The first device was rather slow with sample and mineral oil volumes of 5 μL and 10 μL, respectively. The temperature was controlled externally via a personal computer, and the fluorescence was captured by an external microscope. Separate to the PCR system, the same group also developed a miniaturized fluorescent system with the vision of integrating it later on with the PCR system [

 <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. The system was evolved into a world-smallest real-time PCR capable of detecting four samples at a time and demonstrated the ability to perform real-time PCR of cDNA from the H7N9 avian influenza virus [
 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], RT-PCR from the Ebola virus RNA [
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], and finally, it was integrated with a Bluetooth communication system that detected cDNA from the dengue fever virus [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The system was even combined with the sample preparation step to detect RNA from the H5N1 avian flu [
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] or SARS [
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], although they were far from perfect and required further improvement. Furthermore, the VRC looked like an open system, but the system should be converted into a closed system to increase user comfort and avoid the possibility of accidental contamination.
