 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> lists the prototypes discussed above and compares their important features. The LabDisk stands out as the sole cartridge that is fully enclosed with reagents and a waste storage. It can be stored at room temperature owing to the lyophilized PCR master mix. Reagent evaporation and cross-mixing are addressed by the individually sealed stick packs that keep the reagents isolated. This isolation, along with the plastic housing, renders the cartridge robust against handling and transportation. The use of centrifugal microfluidics and silica-coated magnetic beads facilitates on-chip pumping, valving, and fluidic mixing that are realized in a simple design that can be produced through thermoforming. Moreover, the cartridge runs on an instrument very similar to the CD or DVD players of the past. However, several challenges remain. The cartridge must be further developed to handle clinical specimens. The overall test duration should be reduced to below 1 h. Finally, all these prototypes, albeit underdeveloped and very limited in number, are encouraging. However, it is imperative that many more studies are geared towards a POC-PCR test, instead of stand-alone PCR microchips, so that the next outbreak can be contained promptly. The time is running out for the vision before it fades away into a dream and a legacy for future generations.
