<p id="p0205">The detection of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) in serum was demonstrated using a system based on a thermoformed plastic cartridge [
 <xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] where the reagents were confined into discrete wells isolated from each other by a layer of oil. The first well contained an acidic binding buffer that induced a positive surface charge on the pH-responsive magnetic particles mixed into a serum sample before being introduced. Accordingly, the nucleic acids were captured by the charged particles and transported from well to well as the cartridge went through a series of translations and rotations between a pair of opposing stationary magnets (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>D). The surface charge was neutralized by an alkaline PCR solution, and the nucleic acid release was triggered. Following the removal of the particles from the well, rapid thermal cycling took place, administered by the surrounding heat block through the thermoformed thin layer of plastic. A fluorescent signal was captured via a confocal detector placed above the well. More than a dozen clinical serum samples were tested, each analyzed within an hour and generating LODs as low as 45 IU per 10 μL. While these results are encouraging, the unit gave rise to some of the same concerns as the others. First, the RT-PCR enzymes required refrigeration; this issue might be difficult to address by keeping the enzymes lyophilized because the PCR solution itself served as the RNA eluate necessary for rehydration. Second, the unit analyzed blood serum, which must be extracted beforehand, while the unit must be evaluated for other bodily samples relevant to respiratory infections such as sputum or a nasopharyngeal swab. Third, the dynamic range should match the entire range of viral loads encountered clinically. Fourth, the unit faced the issue of equally allocating particles among the wells, each of which has a distinct set of primers specific to the target serotype. Fifth, the greater spread of the data was an issue relevant to the retrieval of viral RNA but could be addressed by increasing the eluate volume by an order of magnitude, at the expense of test sensitivity.
