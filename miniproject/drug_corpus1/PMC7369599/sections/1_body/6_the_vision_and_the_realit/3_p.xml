<p id="p0180">The first of these was arguably a unit reported ≈15 years ago based on the eSensor microarray chip (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A) [
 <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. The eSensor was a printed circuit board featuring a thin-film metal electrode array (4 × 4 array), with DNA capture probes to hybridize the PCR products for multiplexed electrochemical detection. The overall unit was a fully integrated system made up of pumps, valves, and fluidic micromixers, all made free from any fabricated moving parts and based on thermopneumatic expansion and electrolysis for pumping, cavitation microstreaming for mixing, and phase transition for fluidic valving. Eliminating such parts simplified not only the design but also the fabrication, thus lowering the overall cost. The cost was further reduced by patterning the electrodes through the standard printed circuit board (PCB) process and forming the polycarbonate channels and chambers through computerized numerical control-machining. Cavitation mixing was induced by a pair of piezoelectric disks mounted on the sample chamber and the microarray detection chamber, while electrolytic pumping was activated by platinum wires inserted into the pumping chambers. A magnet was mounted on the PCR chamber to trap and enrich the immunomagnetic capture beads that carried target pathogens or cells from the sample chamber for subsequent thermal lysis and asymmetric PCR. The unit was shown to work for pathogenic bacteria detection from whole rabbit blood by spiking it with

Despite the device's simple fabrication process, it entailed post-fabrication steps, such as introducing phase-changing material wax into the valves and conditioning the channel's surface. Despite the claim that it is completely self-contained in terms of reagents and waste storage, the reagents were loaded at the time of sample introduction, which added to the in-use handling. Other technical issues included the low efficiency of the PCR due to the immunomagnetic beads (≈50%) and their low cell-capture efficiency of ≈40%, as well as the low sensitivity of electrochemical detection. Furthermore, the overall assay time was relatively long as sample preparation, amplification, and detection took ≈1 h each.
