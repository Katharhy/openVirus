<p id="p0175">The miniaturized PCR was first envisioned in the early 1990s, and since then numerous PCR microchips have emerged. Most of these PCR microchips have required off-chip sample preparation and even off-chip detection. These undesired features hinder complete freedom from laboratory settings and give rise to the tongue-in-cheek expression for these devices: chip-in-a-lab [

The sample preparation, which involves the extraction and purification of nucleic acids from bodily fluids, plays a determining role in the accuracy of the test, which heavily depends on the effective removal of PCR inhibitors such as hemoglobin. However, the diversity and complexity of bodily fluid samples, together with the sample volume requirement, make it difficult to combine sample preparation with PCR on a microchip or in a cartridge. Few studies have undertaken the challenge of demonstrating a fully integrated PCR system, where sample preparation, amplification, and detection occur in one platform. In this section, we describe these integrated solutions and the issues preventing their POC use.
