<p id="p0185">A biochip featuring an integrated PCR with solid-phase extraction (SPE) and CE detection has been proposed and tested [
 <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. 
 <italic>Bacillus anthraces</italic> (anthrax) and 
 <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic> have been detected within ≈30 min. While this is impressive, the biochip was not a self-contained unit with reagents and waste storage. Reagents had to be externally supplied during each test and the sample had to be lysed off-chip. Both these steps have to be integrated when providing a biochip or a cartridge for a portable diagnostic system. The possible inhibition of PCR by reagent traces of SPE was avoided through the integration of membrane valves that decoupled the two process sites. The valves, however, involved multiple structural layers, adding further complexity to the fabrication. Moreover, the valve activation required compressed air from an external line, which increased the hardware requirement, in addition to the infrared mediated thermal cycling, high-voltage product separation, and laser-induced fluorescence detection. The SPE site had to be packed with silica beads, which added to the post-fabrication handling. Despite all these technical issues, however, the study demonstrates the feasibility of a highly rapid sample-in answer-out capability.
