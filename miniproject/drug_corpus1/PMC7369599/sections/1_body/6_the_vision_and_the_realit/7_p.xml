<p id="p0200">The fully automated sample-to-answer detection of influenza type H3N2 was based on a centrifugal microfluidic disk [
 <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] named the LabDisk (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C). The disk was fully enclosed with preloaded reagents comprising liquid stick packs for nucleic acid extraction, air-dried specific PCR primers with fluorescence probes, and a lyophilized RT-PCR master mix. After loading the sample, the disk started to rotate creating a centrifugal force, triggering a series of events. First, the content of each stick pack was released into a designated chamber at a well-defined number of revolutions per min, breaking the fragile seals of the stick packs. Then, the silica-coated magnetic beads captured and transported the nucleic acids from the lysis chamber into subsequent chambers for washing and release, with the aid of an external stationary magnet. The subsequent eluent was aliquoted into eight reaction cavities, dissolving the lyophilized RT-PCR master mix before thermal cycling through convective heating. The entire test took less than ≈3.5 h, with an LOD of ≈2.4 × 10

 <sup>-1</sup> . All the hardware was packed into a lightweight shoebox-sized unit suitable for POC use, with the only manual step being the sample loading. The centrifugal pumping, together with the surface tension valving, simplified the overall design, allowing the disk to be fabricated by microthermoforming a polymer foil via hot embossing. The thermoformed foil was then sealed by a pressure-sensitive adhesive tape. Although the LOD shown is fourfold lower than the clinically relevant level, the disk needs to be further developed to process viscous clinical specimens, such as sputum, through sample liquefaction and homogenization. A further reduction in analysis time and a demonstration of the ability to conduct multiplexing for sub-typing viral strains would be likely to bring the disk closer to practical POC use.
