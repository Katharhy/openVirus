<p id="p0210">The processes of DNA purification, PCR, post-PCR clean up, and inline injection, as well as CE separation, were all combined into a single microchip for forensic human identification (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>E) [
 <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. The microchip included a miniaturized PDMS pump and valves, a fluidized bed of immunomagnetic beads in bifurcating channels, a 250 nL PCR chamber, and a capillary electrophoresis channel with a double-T junction. The DNA purification was realized through a sequence-specific capture of DNA by a fluidized bed of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. This, however, required off-chip handling, fragmenting the genomic DNA, and then modifying the fragments with biotin-labeled capture probes. Moreover, the DNA capture efficiency was rather low (5.4%). An external magnet was applied to arrest the beads in the bifurcating channels and then manually displaced to transport the beads into the PCR chamber. The PCR master mix, including biotin-labeled primers, was introduced, and the PCR products were then concentrated into a narrow band within a streptavidin-modified gel plug inside the double-T junction. The thermal release of the band led the CE separation and detection. The microchip was accompanied by a small-footprint, battery-powered instrument capable of a full nineplex short tandem repeat (STR) typing from 2.5 ng input DNA, as well as forensic STR analysis from oral swabs within 3 h. Nevertheless, the high level of integration creates complex fabrication and post-fabrication handling, including the alignment and bonding of multiple layers of glass and a PDMS membrane. All reagents had to be externally supplied and the sample lysed outside the microchip.
