<p id="p0280">Given the development of communication technology, more and more devices are envisioned to be connected to form a network called the Internet of things (IoT), a burgeoning industry that is projected to change human society tremendously by bringing about convenience, ubiquitous information, and intelligence to improve our lives in a fundamental way; the health care industry can greatly benefit from this technological advancement. There have also been developments in personal healthcare monitoring devices linked with wearable healthcare monitoring, such as electrocardiogram and blood O
 <sub>2</sub> measurement devices. The data collected can be used for remote and/or real-time disease monitoring and predictive model building. Furthermore, it is easy to predict that a diagnostic device such as PCR, with high connectivity and data transmission capabilities, can become highly impactful in pandemic management. We have demonstrated such a PCR in a pseudo dengue fever test [
