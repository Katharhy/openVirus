<p id="p0230">PCR systems that offer multiplexing capability are preferred because they can reduce the test time for multiple diseases. This can be particularly beneficial during the flu season because different virus strains often present during one season. The differential diagnostics of community-acquired pneumonias can also benefit from this methodological approach, allowing not only the detection of multiple viruses and bacteria in one PCR reaction but also their relative quantification in the examined sample. Such a quantification may lead to the correct determination of the disease-causing agent by selecting the most suitable therapy [
