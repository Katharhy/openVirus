<p id="p0240">Developments in the past have led to the commercialization of sample-to-answer systems that are more or less portable. One of the early birds in this regard was GeneXpert [
 <xref rid="bib97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>], a cartridge-based system that performed a fully automated nucleic acid amplification technique. It was designed for the detection of healthcare-associated infections, critical infectious diseases, sexual health, viruses, and cancers. Its development was accelerated by concerns over anthrax in the USA [

 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The system simplifies the testing procedure as it integrates sample preparation with qPCR/RT-PCR. The system is designed to be employed in areas lacking sophisticated facilities to conduct conventional testing. It is not easily portable but it does offer the option of multicolor multiplexing.
