<p id="p0245">There was another push to release PCR systems for POC applications and this has contributed to disease diagnosis during pandemics such as the 2014 Ebola outbreak. Starting in early 2014, an unprecedented Ebola outbreak occurred in West Africa. On August 8, 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a public health emergency of international concern [

 <xref rid="bib99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Cepheid received a $3.3 million grant, co-financed by the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, to develop the GeneXpert Ebola Assay based on the GeneXpert system. It took only ≈5 months from development for it to get listed in EUAL by WHO. The GeneXpert Ebola Assay is fully automated and only requires the placing of the patient sample into the cartridge and inserting the cartridge into a compact desktop-level instrument. It takes ≈2 h for an entire assay, from sample to answer, and features high detection accuracy [
