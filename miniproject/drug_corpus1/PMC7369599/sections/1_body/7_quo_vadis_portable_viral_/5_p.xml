<p id="p0235">The PCR for POC and other applications should fulfill the essential requirements of portability, operability by untrained personnel, fast and adequate accuracy for screening reliability, and giving the minimum information for the publication of quantitative real-time PCR experimental guidelines [
 <xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Miniaturization enjoys a big advantage in POC applications due to its portability and excellent accuracy and specificity; however, the complications arising from system operation outside the specialized laboratory environment as well as by untrained people pose the biggest challenge for the development of such devices.
