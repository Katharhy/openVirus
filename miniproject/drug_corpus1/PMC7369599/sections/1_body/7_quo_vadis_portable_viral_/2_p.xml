<p id="p0220">One of the most important practical challenges to be resolved for any POC molecular diagnostic device is sample preparation. Ideally, it should be a sample-to-answer system with no human interaction; this is especially important for POC diagnostics, such as for SARS in the past and currently for COVID-19. During the SARS outbreak in Singapore, which was one of the worst-hit countries, the Tan Tock Seng Hospital was almost the only clinic capable of carrying out routine SARS diagnostics. Prospective patients' only option for testing was to get there, leading to a high chance of cross-infection. It was seen to be greatly beneficial to have a system for POC to ensure that prospective patients did not have to go anywhere, but rather stay at home and call health care providers to come to their location to conduct infectious disease diagnostics, and not simply collect a sample. This would demand a small system that is easily portable, with samples sealed to avoid sample-to-sample cross-contamination, thus suppressing the number of false-negative results.</p>
