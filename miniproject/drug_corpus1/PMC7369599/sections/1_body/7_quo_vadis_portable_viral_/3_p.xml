<p id="p0225">Sample preparation is definitely a problem, and many attempts have been made to simplify these crucial steps. There are too many PCR inhibitors in human body fluid samples, such as blood and saliva. Over the years, there has been continuous research into the development of PCR reagents, and especially into methods aimed at simplifying the sample preparation steps and fully integrating the sample preparation with PCR. Single-step direct PCR has also been developed, greatly simplifying the sample preparation process; only hemoglobin has to be removed before performing PCR to diagnose malaria infection [
