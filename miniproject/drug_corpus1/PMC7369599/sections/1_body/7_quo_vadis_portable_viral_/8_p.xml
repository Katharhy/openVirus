<p id="p0250">The COVID-19 global pandemic has greatly boosted the determination and motivation of researchers worldwide to speed up the development of POCT systems, as well as the number of companies prepared to fund such work. Some have adapted existing devices, while others have made new ones. The systems that were available in March 2020 mostly contained immunoassays [

Other companies that have developed systems to diagnose seasonal flu have made use of different primers to convert these systems into POCT for COVID-19.
