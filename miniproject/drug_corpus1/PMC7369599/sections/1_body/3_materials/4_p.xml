<p id="p0105">PDMS is currently one of the most widely used polymers for microfluidic devices due to its biocompatibility, low cost, and simple processing [
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. A disposable PDMSâ€“glass bonding chamber has been utilized to perform PCR with an intercalating reusable electrode part for thermal cycling [
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. However, the evaporation of the PCR solution, located in the PDMS chamber, at a denaturation step may lead to cross-talk because PDMS is porous. PMMA is another popular candidate [
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Inexpensive and versatile PMMA PCR chips can be fabricated by laser ablation technology, followed by bonding methods such as low-temperature bonding that uses optically clear adhesive film and liquid optically clear adhesive [
