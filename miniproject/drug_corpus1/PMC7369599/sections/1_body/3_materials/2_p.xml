<p id="p0095">The implementation of microfluidics has led to the development of miniaturized PCR systems that offer portability and save time, thereby facilitating applications in the realm of POC diagnostics. Researchers have developed a family of miniaturized devices based on different types of PCR. Materials such as Si [
