<p id="p0100">Glass is used to make PCR chips due to its transparency and low auto-fluorescence. A multifunctional platform suitable for the on-chip detection of biomolecules consists of different thin films integrated on a single glass substrate that can also be optically and thermally coupled with another glass [
