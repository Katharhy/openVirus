<p id="p0115">Chips made of Si and glass can be cleaned using solutions such as piranha (H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>/H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>), since the solution performs the mineralization of organic materials, and no RNA/DNA can be left behind. Nevertheless, general practitioners prefer disposable systems because they are safer in terms of cross-contamination. In the future, PCR chips could well be able to be cleaned and reused, once the cleaning process has shown its consistency.
