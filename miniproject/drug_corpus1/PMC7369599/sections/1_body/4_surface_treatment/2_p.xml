<p id="p0110">The surface properties of microfluidic channels/chambers must be considered because the interaction between biomolecules in the PCR solution and the channels/chambers affects PCR efficiency. A high surface-to-volume ratio of microchannels/chambers leads to the non-specific adsorption of the enzymes, limiting or even prohibiting the reaction [
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Two methods have been employed to solve this problem. One involves the use of silanization to modify the surface permanently. Silanization is accomplished by filling the channel with a silanizing agent and heating the filled chip for a period of time, then removing the agent and washing the chip. Alternatively, solutions such as bovine serum albumin (BSA) [
