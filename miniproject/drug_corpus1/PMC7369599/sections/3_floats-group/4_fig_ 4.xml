  <p>The systems currently available for COVID-19 POC testing (POCT). (A) A system performing 25 reactions at a time using magnetic beads for sample preparation, followed by a LAMP [
   <xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. (B) Cobas® Liat® System by Roche originally designed as a universal molecular biology platform for diagnoses based on a real-time PCR [
   <xref rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. (C) ID NOW, made by Abbott Laboratories, originally sought to diagnose seasonal flu; it has currently been converted into a COVID-19 system, based on an isothermal DNA amplification originally developed for the seasonal flu test [
   <xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. (D) Bosch's new microfluidic system is capable of virus diagnostics; the sample preparation is integrated with a multiplexed end-point PCR [
   <xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>].
