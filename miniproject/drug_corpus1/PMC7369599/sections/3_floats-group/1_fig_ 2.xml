  <p>A conceptual demonstration of the detection of viruses in the field, based on real-time RT-PCR at POC. The process starts with a nasal swab to obtain a sample that might contain the virus. The sample is purified using paramagnetic beads and viruses are captured, followed by virus lysis to release the RNA, and purification Then, the RNA is reverse transcribed to cDNA; the number of cDNA molecules is multiplied by the PCR, and the results are displayed and possibly transferred to a centralized laboratory via a mobile device [
