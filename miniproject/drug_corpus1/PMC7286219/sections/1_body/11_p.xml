<p id="Par12">So far, there at least 14 SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine projects had been announced globally (WHO, 27 May 2020). Regularly, the general stages of the development cycle of a vaccine include the exploratory stage, the preclinical stage, clinical development, regulatory review and approval, manufacturing, and quality control. The process of the creation, testing and production of a vaccine in mass quantities can take many years because the industry is highly regulated. For mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection, developers should speed up the process to make them available as soon as possible. However, until a safe, effective vaccine is commercial available, the best protection from infection with SARS-CoV-2 is to follow the suggestions of public health experts.</p>
