<p id="Par5">In the last two decades, mRNA vaccines have been investigated extensively for infectious disease prevention and cancer immunotherapy. Several mRNA vaccines against infectious disease have showed a promising future, such as mRNA vaccines against influenza viruses, rabies virus, HIV, Ebola virus, and Zika virus (Demoulins

Although clinical trials of mRNA vaccines for infectious disease are still in their early stage, a plethora of publications have shown that mRNA-based vaccines are a promising novel platform that is highly flexible, scalable, inexpensive and cold-chain-free. The growing body of preclinical and clinical results demonstrates that prophylaxis and therapy with mRNA promises to be useful for the prevention of infectious disease and that mRNA vaccines are safe and tolerated in animal models and humans. Despite the great challenges in the creation of new processes to generate mRNA vaccines, such as delivery and translation efficiency, these processes hopefully will be streamlined to establish large-scale production. It is just a matter of time for mRNA vaccines to be used in humans and animals.
