<p id="Par4">Two forms of mRNA vaccines have been developed, including conventional mRNA vaccines and self-amplifying mRNA (SAM) vaccines. Conventional mRNA encoding target antigen can be synthetically produced, including an open reading frame (ORF) for the target antigen and 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs), through a cell-free enzymatic transcription reaction. The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription reaction includes linearized plasmid DNA encoding the pathogen antigen as a template, recombinant RNA polymerase, and nucleoside triphosphates. A cap analog and a poly(A) tail are added sequentially to the transcriptional product following the reaction to form a functional mRNA. After injection, transient and low levels of antigen expression are driven (Zhang
 <italic> et al</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2019</xref>). SAM vaccines are derivatives of alphavirus RNA replication, with the structural protein sequences replaced with the antigen gene, generating multiple copies of the antigen-encoding mRNA and expressing high levels of the heterologous gene. Then, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed (IVT) mRNA is encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles and delivered into cells. Consequently, humoral and T cell immune responses are stimulated. The immune response mechanism instigated by mRNA remains to be elucidated. The dimension of the immune response is dependent on the quality of the IVT mRNA, delivery vehicle, and administration route.
