<p id="Par6">Several biopharmaceutical companies have announced promptly the establishment of mRNA vaccine projects for SARS-CoV-2 since its outbreak. On January 23, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced the initiation of three programs to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Moderna, an mRNA-based biotechnology company, announced that it has received funding from CEPI and would manufacture an mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 using their mRNA vaccine platform technology, and it has partnered with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) to develop a vaccine for the Wuhan strain of coronavirus. The NIAID will conduct investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies and a phase I clinical study in the U.S. In projects conducted by Moderna, approximately 1000 people have received different versions of mRNA vaccines so far in seven clinical trials designed to prevent illness from other respiratory viruses, including a strain of the flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). mRNA vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 developed by Moderna is the first one entering phase I clinical trialÂ (Moderna
