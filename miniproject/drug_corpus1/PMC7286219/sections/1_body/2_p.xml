<p id="Par3">Among these SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates, mRNA vaccines are quite remarkable. What is mRNA vaccine? Unlike traditional vaccines, an mRNA vaccine consists of an mRNA sequence encoding a disease-specific antigen. Once delivered into target cells, the antigen is expressed, processed, presented and recognized by the immune system, and a strong humoral and T cell immune response will be instigated. Compared to vaccine production of whole microbes, live attenuated and subunit vaccines, mRNA vaccines are believed to be faster and less expensive to produce, and they do not involve in any living stage of the pathogenic virus or bacteria. This manufacturing process makes mRNA vaccines a promising bioproduct and potentially fills the gap between the desperate demand for vaccines to control disease outbreaks and epidemics, with the potential to scale and standardize the vaccine manufacturing process. The process of mRNA vaccine development is illustrated in Fig.Â
