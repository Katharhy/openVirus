<p id="Par46">One study among male PWID in Southern Thailand has evaluated the uptake of HCV testing at 39.5% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], another among PWID in Bangkok at 33% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], and yet another among HIV-positive PWID in Bangkok at 52.2% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Compared to our results, these higher rates may be due to more contacts with harm reduction organizations where HCV testing is promoted. In our study, the only factor associated with HCV screening was membership of a harm reduction organization. The local network of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and health volunteers supporting the PWID population in Chiang Mai Province is active and respected. Their positive impact on the level of HCV knowledge and screening could be strengthened to fight the epidemic.
