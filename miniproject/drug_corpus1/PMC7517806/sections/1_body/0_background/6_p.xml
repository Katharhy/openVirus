<p id="Par16">In Thailand, the use of recreational drugs is illegal, and repression is the dominant societal response [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. As a result, PWID are frequently arrested and incarcerated for drug-related offences [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Public health interventions such as needle exchange programmes, MOUD prescriptions, and health education have proven effective in reducing HIV and viral hepatitis transmission by more than 50% among PWID, provided these measures are made widely available [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Several studies have reported high prevalence of risky injection practices among Thai PWID, such as syringe borrowing, that could be prevented with appropriate harm reduction programmes [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Some harm reduction interventions, such as access to MOUD with methadone and naloxone, have been successfully implemented [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. However, these medications are unavailable in prisons, and frequent incarceration of PWID has been documented as the main barrier to retention in methadone maintenance therapy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], along with police interference [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and lack of accessibility in rural areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Needle exchange programmes remain confined to pilot projects reliant on international donors [
