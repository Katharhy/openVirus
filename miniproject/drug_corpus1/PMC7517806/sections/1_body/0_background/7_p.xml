<p id="Par17">Most studies among PWID in Thailand have used convenience-based sampling methods, recruiting participants from harm reduction organizations or enrolled in clinical trial, and were conducted in Bangkok [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Few epidemiological studies have used methods such as respondent-driven sampling to obtain data from a representative sample of PWID [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. However, these studies did not collect information on HCV, which is a major infectious risk in this population.
