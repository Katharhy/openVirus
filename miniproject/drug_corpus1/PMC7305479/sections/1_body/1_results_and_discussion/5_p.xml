<p>It can be seen, from the data presented in 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, that the cytotoxicities of the preparations in both cell cultures were generally similar. At the same time, three of the four studied compounds feature low toxicity in cell cultures (CC
 <sub>50</sub> in the range 492–998 µM), while the non-nucleoside compound 
 <bold>cm1pUY11</bold> (
 <bold>III</bold>) showed significantly more pronounced cytotoxic properties; this is probably due to the presence of the pivaloyloxymethyl group, which may hydrolyze to free pivalate, thus inhibiting L-carnitine metabolism in cells [
