<p>Compound (
 <bold>IV</bold>) was prepared in four steps from uridine (
 <bold>V</bold>) (Scheme 1). Perylenylethynyl nucleoside derivatives have low solubility in most solvents, which makes it difficult to purify them using column chromatography. Therefore, acylic protection of hydroxyl groups of the carbohydrate fragment is usually applied, which allows to increase the solubility of the

 </sup> coupling product and to carry out its chromatographic purification after this step [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The isobutyryl group was chosen as such a protective group. Acylation of uridine with isobutyric anhydride resulted in 2′,3′,5′-
 <italic>O</italic>-acyl nucleoside (
 <bold>VI</bold>), which was further halogenated into a 5-iodo derivative (
 <bold>VII</bold>). The latter was alkynylated with 3-ethynylperylene under Sonogashira reaction conditions to afford a product (
 <bold>VIII</bold>), which had sufficient solubility for facile purification by means of silica gel column chromatography. To remove the protective groups, compound (
 <bold>VIII</bold>) was subjected to alkaline hydrolysis under mild conditions to yield the desired ribonucleoside 
 <bold>rUY11</bold> (
 <bold>IV</bold>). As with other perylenethynyl derivatives of nucleosides, compound (
 <bold>IV</bold>) is only slightly soluble in water but fairly soluble in DMSO. Solutions of compound (
 <bold>IV</bold>) feature the bright yellow-green fluorescence characteristic of perylenylethynyluracil derivatives.
