<p>Although the pharmaceutical market is filled with a variety of cold and flu products, most are directed at symptoms, and few feature any direct inhibitory effect on the pathogen. Three groups of antiviral drugs are etiotropic: M2-channel blockers (amantadine, remantadine); neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir); and protease inhibitors (baloxavir marboxil and faviperavir). Drugs in the first group have now lost their potential as influenza agents due to high resistance to them among circulating strains [
