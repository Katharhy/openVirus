<p>For each compound, 2-fold serial dilutions were prepared (in culture media), starting from the original drug stocks in DMSO (2000 µg/mL). Cell cultures were washed with media, and drug (100 µL per well) was applied at the appropriate concentrations, followed by incubation for 24 h (37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>). Cells were washed with PBS, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) solution was applied (0.5 µg/mL in culture medium), followed by incubation for 1.5 hours (37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>). MTT solution was removed, slurry was dissolved in 96% ethyl alcohol, and optical densities of solutions were determined at 535 nm on a Wallas Perkin Elmer plate reader. Based on data analysis using GraphPad Prizm 5.0 software, CC
 <sub>50</sub> values were determined.
