 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra were recorded with the Bruker Avance III 500Â MHz NMR spectrometer with signal attribution by residual proton peaks in solvents: CDCl
 <sub>3</sub> (7.26 ppm for 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 77.16 ppm for 
 <sup>13</sup>C); and DMSO-

 </sub> (2.50 ppm for 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 39.52 ppm for 
 <sup>13</sup>C). 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR coupling constants are reported in Hertz (Hz) for the respective multiplets. UV spectra were recorded using a Varian Cary 100 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence spectra were recorded using a Perkin Elmer LS 55 spectrometer. Thin layer chromatography was performed on TLC Silica gel 60 F
 <sub>254</sub> (Merck) aluminum plates.
