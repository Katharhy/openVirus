<p>Viral titers were determined using cellular immunoassay (cell-ELISA). For the analysis, cell cultures were fixed with cold 80% acetone for 15 min and washed with PBS-T buffer. Next, a solution of mouse primary antibodies (anti-parainfluenza virus HN protein) was applied and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with continuous stirring, followed by washing with buffer. Secondary antibodies were then applied and incubated again for 2 h with continuous stirring. The antibodies were washed out, and substrate-chromogenic mixture with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) was applied. After 5 min, reactions were stopped with 0.1 M sulfuric acid, and optical densities of the solutions were measured at 450 nm. Presence of infection was defined as sample optical densities exceeding those of the controls. Viral titers were calculated by the Reed and Muench method [
