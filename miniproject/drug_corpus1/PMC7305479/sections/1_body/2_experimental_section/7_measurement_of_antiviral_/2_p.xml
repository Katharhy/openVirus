<p>Cell cultures were washed with medium, and drug preparations (in volumes of 200 µL per well) were applied at the appropriate concentrations, followed by incubation for 1 h (37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>). All culture media were then removed, and drug solutions were added to wells again (100 µL per well at twice the original concentration). Viral suspensions (100 µL) were immediately added, and plates were incubated for 1 h (37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>). Plates were then washed free of virus, drug solutions were re-applied (at their original concentrations), and plates incubated for 6 days (at 37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>).
