 <bold>-Triisobutyryl-5-(perylen-3-ylethynyl)uridine (VIII).</bold> To a solution of protected iodide (
 <bold>VII</bold>) (280 mg, 0.48 mmol) and 3-ethynylperylene (177 mg, 0.64 mmol) in dry DMF (13 mL), 
 <italic>tetrakis</italic>(triphenylphosphine)palladium (67 mg, 0.058 mmol), copper(I) iodide (22 mg, 0.12 mmol), and triethylamine (268 µL, 1.93 mmol) were added. The flask was then evacuated and purged with argon three times successively. The reaction mixture was stirred at 35°C for 12 h and evaporated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate (30 mL), washed with water (20 mL), NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub> saturated water (20 mL), and brine (20 mL). The organic phase was dried over Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>, filtered, and evaporated in a vacuum. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (toluene ethyl acetate), and compound (
 <bold>VIII</bold>) (273 mg, 78%) was obtained in the form of brown foam.
