<p id="Par4">Nasopharyngeal swabs were taken by inserting the swab into each nasal orifice directly posteriorly, parallel to the floor of the base of the skull, to the posterior wall of the nasopharynx in turn. Tracheal swabs were obtained by directly swabbing the trachea once it had been removed with the thoracic pluck. Lung samples were obtained after the pleural surface had been sterilized using alcohol swabs (to enable the samples to also be suitable for bacterial culture). The pleura was incised and a sample (around 0.2–0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5–1.0 cm) was taken from the underlying lung tissue from the lower lobe of each lung. A swab was inserted into the incised defect and pressed into the lung parenchyma to obtain the lung swab. All swabs (QSwab, Delta Laboratories, Australia) came with viral transport medium into which the swabs were immersed and sealed for transport. Lung samples were transported dry in a sealed sterile container.</p>
