<p id="Par3">Cases were sourced from deceased who had undergone full internal post-mortem examination in South Australia at the direction of the Coroner from the period of June 2012 to June 2019 wherein respiratory samples were taken to assess for the presence of infective agents. Such cases were identified by searching Coronial autopsy reports held at Forensic Science SA for results of respiratory viral investigation. This yielded 304 cases; however, all four respiratory samples (nasopharyngeal swab, tracheal swab, lung swab, and lung tissue) were only taken at autopsy in 97 cases. Of these, 24 cases were reported positive for a respiratory virus although some detected more than one virus. Cases that detected non-viral pathogens were not included in this study. Ethics approval for the project was provided by the University of Adelaide HREC (ref H-2018-146).</p>
