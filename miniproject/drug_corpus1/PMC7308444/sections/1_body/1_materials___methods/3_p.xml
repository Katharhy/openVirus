<p id="Par5">All respiratory tract swabs were analyzed at SA Pathology using a laboratory developed respiratory viral and bacterial multiplex PCR panel. The panel was able to detect 9 viruses (Adenovirus, Human metapneumovirus, Influenza A and B, Parainfluenza 1, 2 &amp; 3, Rhinovirus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus) and 2 bacteria (
 <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic> and 
 <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic>). Total nucleic acid was extracted from 200 μl of the swab virus transport medium using the Roche MagNA Pure 96 DNA and the Viral NA Small Volume Kit on the Roche MagNA Pure platform and eluted into 100 μl. Real time PCR reactions were performed on the Roche LC480 thermocyclers in 12.5 μl reactions using the Invitrogen SuperScript III Platinum One-Step qRT-PCR Kit 2× mastermix (for all reactions) and 2.5 μl of extracted nucleic acid. Lung biopsies were first processed by beating with glass beads in 2 ml of Roche External Lysis buffer for 20 min and then 200 μl was used for nucleic acid extraction.
