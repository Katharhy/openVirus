<p id="Par2">Lower respiratory tract infections are the third largest cause of death globally, so it is unsurprising that deaths following suspected respiratory infections are often referred to the Coroner [

Furthermore, in the setting of epidemics and pandemics, it is pivotal from a public health perspective to ensure that there is accurate detection of notifiable conditions to inform monitoring, as well as the continued observation for emerging conditions [

As there is a lack of standardization relating to sample collection post-mortem, there is variation pertaining to the number and nature of samples collected for microbiological investigation at autopsy [

Without guidelines to inform best practice for detection of respiratory tract infection, multiple swabs may be taken alongside lung tissue to minimize the risk of missing infection. This can equate to both a high cost for the investigating institution, and increased workload for pathology centers. There is potential to mitigate this issue by determining which sample yields the greatest number of positive results for respiratory viral infection. The notion of the “optimal sampling regime” for respiratory illnesses was explored by Moore and Jones in 2014, wherein they arrived at the conclusion that swabbing is more accurate than tissue sampling, as influenza and other respiratory viruses were more readily detected [
