<p id="Par6">We found 94 cases that had been autopsied between June 2012 and June 2019 from which four respiratory samples (nasopharyngeal swab, tracheal swab, lung swab, and lung tissue) had been obtained for testing by multiplex PCR panel. From these, there were 24 cases that reported at least one positive virology result. Not included in this study were two cases in which Mycoplasma pneumoniae was reported in all four samples. Of the cases with viral infection, the mean age was 48.4 years (median 56 years; interquartile range 29–72.8 years). Just over half the cases were female (13/24; 54%) (Table
