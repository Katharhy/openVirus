<p id="Par8">The presence of virus was reported in all four samples (nasopharyngeal swab, tracheal swab, lung swab and lung samples) in 17 of the 27 reported viruses (63%). Of the cases where the virus was not detected in all four samples, it appeared only in the swabs. There was never a case where a virus was detected in the lung tissue alone. A lung tissue result was only ever positive when all other samples taken were also positive (TablesÂ
