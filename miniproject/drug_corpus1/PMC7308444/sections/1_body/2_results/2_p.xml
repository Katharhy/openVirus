<p id="Par7">A total of 27 respiratory pathogens were detected from the 26 cases. After rhinovirus (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10, 37%), the next highest detection rates were for influenza A (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5, 19%) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6, 22%). It was noted that RSV was more common in those over the age of 60, but this was not statistically significant (83% of cases; chi square 
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). However, the reverse trend was observed for influenza A, where 80% of cases were detected in those under the age of 60 (not statistically significant: chi square p &gt; 0.05). Parainfluenza 3 was reported twice (7.4%). Adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza B and parainfluenza 1 were only observed on one occasion each (3.7%). Neither bordetella pertussis nor parainfluenza 2 were detected. Twenty-two of the 24 cases were positive for one virus only (92%); one (case 7, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) was positive for two viruses and in one case (case 20, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) three viruses were detected.
