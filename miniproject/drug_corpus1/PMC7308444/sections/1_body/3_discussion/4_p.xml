<p id="Par14">It was considered that it might be possible to minimize the number of samples taken and consequently reduce costs, by obtaining a sample of lung tissue for the purpose of both multiplex PCR viral and bacteriological culture study. However, the results indicate this would not be ideal, as lung samples yielded the poorest results overall, only detecting 63% of viruses. Nonetheless, even with a lower detection rate, all respiratory tract viral infections regarded as notifiable by the Stateâ€™s Communicable Disease branch [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] would have been identified by analysis of a sample of lung. One of the main issues with microbiological investigations on lung tissue is that in cases of focal infection, there is a possibility of generating false negative results if the sampling is undertaken outside of the affected region, which could explain the low viral yield [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It was also considered the higher yield from lung swabs might reflect that these were bathed in viral transport medium compared with the lung samples that were not. Further investigation would be required, but studies, including for a possible effect of viral transport medium, were outside the scope of this study.
