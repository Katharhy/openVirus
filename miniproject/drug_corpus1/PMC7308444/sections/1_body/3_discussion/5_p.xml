<p id="Par15">In this study that retrospectively reviewed 94 cases, from which four respiratory tract samples (nasopharyngeal swab, tracheal swab, lung swab, and lung tissue) had been obtained for multiplex PCR viral detection, it was found that a multiple sample strategy detected only one case of viral infection that would not have been reported from a nasopharyngeal swab alone. Although this was a small, retrospective study with only 27 viruses identified from 24 cases, it is concluded a nasopharyngeal swab is an optimal sample for detection of respiratory tract viral infection.</p>
