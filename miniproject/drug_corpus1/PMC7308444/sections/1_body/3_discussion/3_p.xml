<p id="Par13">For the optimal sampling regime at autopsy, it has been previously suggested that a minimum of four samples should be taken in cases of sudden-unexpected death with respiratory symptoms at any age, namely: lung, nasopharyngeal swab, bronchial swab, and at least one other swab from the affected tissue [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In addition, throat swabs are recommended when tonsillitis is apparent, and when empyema is suspected, it is recommended to sample pleural fluid [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Whilst this certainly offers the greatest opportunity for maximal detection of an infectious agent, it could be argued that there is a redundancy when it is possible to detect the overwhelming majority of respiratory tract viral infection using only a nasopharyngeal swab. Nasopharyngeal swabs have been shown to have a high yield of detecting viral respiratory tract infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Due to the mechanics of the mucocillary escalator system, the airways are more likely to contain downstream pathogens contributing to disease, hence making the nasopharyngeal area a prime location for collection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The nasopharyngeal swab has previously been advocated in proposed guidelines relating to sampling in the setting of suspected flu or viral respiratory infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Certainly, the results of this study serve as confirmation of this strategy. This study was performed before the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic due to corona virus (COVID-19) infection. Nonetheless, the findings support the current United States of America Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation for post-mortem investigation, which is to submit a nasopharyngeal swab for virological testing with a lung swab if an autopsy is performed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Nasopharyngeal swabs have been advocated for post-mortem sampling for COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] with positivity from nasopharyngeal swabs and failure to identify COVID-19 from lung swabs being reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Incorporating bronchial swabs has also been suggested [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Others, including the Royal College of Pathologists [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] suggest using a strategy based on testing in living subjects, including use of sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage samples [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A further consideration could be use of rectal swabs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It is not possible to comment on the potential utility of samples others than those used in this reported study.
