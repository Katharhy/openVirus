<p id="Par12">The prevalence of viruses detected was not unexpected. Rhinovirus, which is most commonly associated with the “common cold” was the most common. Whilst it is considered to cause a relatively benign illness, it is implicated in the exacerbation of respiratory diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and cystic fibrosis [

However, it is difficult to comment on the role of rhinovirus in this study, as in half of the cases when rhinovirus was detected, the cause of death was either unascertained, or considered to be due to a non-infective cause. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and influenza were the next most common viruses that were identified [

The observation may be attributed to the high influenza vaccination rates of the elderly in Australia and the fact that RSV increasingly affects the elderly, both in care facilities and the community [
