<p>In the beginning of every epidemic of a new virus, the virus has to “jump” over from animals to humans, and then from humans to humans. That can be quite difficult. Therefore, the virus will be more likely to successfully infect those with a weakened immune system, who will find it more difficult to reject it. Because of this, the first patients are often people who are either older or already have some underlying illnesses that make them more vulnerable. They end up in a hospital, where at that point no one suspects that pneumonia that they are experiencing may have an epidemic potential.</p>
