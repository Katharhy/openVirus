<p>In order to answer this rather complicated question, it must first be said that nowadays, the registered number of infected persons and the number of deaths can be monitored online [
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. When the number of deaths was divided by the confirmed and registered number of infected people at the beginning of the pandemic, a figure of about 2% would be obtained [
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. From this alone, one could apparently conclude that – given that this is an entirely new coronavirus and nobody is immune to it – it will necessarily spread throughout the world and infect us all. If it kills 2 percent of all people, then it follows that out of a total of 7.5 billion people about 150 million will necessarily die. It is difficult for anyone who is not a specialist in this field to understand how such an outcome can now be prevented, because a vaccine against this virus does not yet exist, nor do medicines.
