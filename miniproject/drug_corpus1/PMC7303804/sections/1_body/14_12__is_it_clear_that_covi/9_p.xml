Flu will cause fewer deaths because the most vulnerable will be vaccinated and health statistics will not properly attribute many indirect deaths to flu which really caused them. COVID-19, in turn, will cause fewer deaths due to epidemiological surveillance, the prevention of its spread and possible strict quarantine. It may also have seasonal characteristics and simply disappear with the arrival of late spring.</p>
