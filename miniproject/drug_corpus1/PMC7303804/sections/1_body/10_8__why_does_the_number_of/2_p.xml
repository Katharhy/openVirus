<p>Some of the people who are presently in intensive care are expected to die in several days, weeks, maybe even months. This is why the number of deaths that corresponds to the number presently infected will inevitably increase over time. Therefore, some future number of deaths, as the numerator, will increasingly correspond to the current number of registered infected persons, as the denominator. As a result, the case-fatality rate of “deaths among those with confirmed infection” will then no longer be 2 or 3 percent, but it may increase quite considerably over time – perhaps to 6-7 percent, or even more.</p>
