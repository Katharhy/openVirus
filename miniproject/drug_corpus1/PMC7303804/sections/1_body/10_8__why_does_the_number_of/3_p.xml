<p>Therefore, to simply say that “about 3.4% of those confirmed to have been infected so far have died” is not really wrong in itself, which is what the World Health Organisation did. But it missed explaining that this case-fatality rate among confirmed infected people is quite unrepresentative of the mortality rate among all those who were infected [
