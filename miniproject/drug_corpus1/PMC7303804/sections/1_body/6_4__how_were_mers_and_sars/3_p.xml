<p>Such an epidemic is the easiest to control and contain. That is because the sick person is soon confined to bed and no longer leaves home. Therefore, the virus can mainly spread to their household members. This also makes it relatively easy to identify everyone who was in contact with the person after the onset of symptoms. Those people can then be placed in isolation quite easily. We were fortunate that both SARS and MERS spread to other people only after the onset of the symptoms of the disease. This is why we were able to suppress the epidemics by isolating those infected and all their contacts after the onset of the symptoms. This is quite likely the most important reason why SARS and MERS did not manage to kill remarkably large number of people [
