<p>Obviously, we need to prepare for a very serious flu-like illness against which no-one will be able to be vaccinated against for quite a while. Therefore, elderly people and those with underlying illnesses should be extremely careful because the infection is the most dangerous for them.

From everything written here, it should be understood that all measures of active searching and the isolation of affected patients and their contacts are justified.</p>
