<p>It is possible that it was a pangolin, because in one of them, a coronavirus that matched to the human form by as much as 99% of the sequence was found, although this is not completely definite either [
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Sequence matching is not the only important factor when it comes to viral “jump” from animals to humans. What is also important is how many individuals in the species that serve as a transitional reservoir are infected and how often the species comes into contact with humans. Sometimes these factors are more important, so they can bridge the gap of 2%-3% of the difference in genome sequence, because pangolins are a protected species and cannot be eaten.
