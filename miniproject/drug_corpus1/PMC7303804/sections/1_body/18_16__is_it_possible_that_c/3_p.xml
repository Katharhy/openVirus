<p>The new coronavirus causing COVID-19 is somewhat similar to that caused by SARS. The SARS pathogen, however, had a much higher case-fatality rate. If the total population infected by the novel coronavirus is found to be higher than the registered infected population by only two or three times, and not by eg, ten times or more, then the case-fatality rate of those infected with COVID-19 could be significantly higher than the flu.</p>
