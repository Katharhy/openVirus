First, most epidemiologists, based on their experience with previous epidemics and pandemics, expect the COVID-19 case-fatality rate to fall below 1% when the total death toll is divided by a better estimate of the total number of infected people. However, the virus is new, so it is possible in principle for this specific virus that the number of infected individuals who are not confirmed through testing may not be as large as epidemiologists would expect. This would come as a surprise to science and would indicate a different nature of this virus.</p>
