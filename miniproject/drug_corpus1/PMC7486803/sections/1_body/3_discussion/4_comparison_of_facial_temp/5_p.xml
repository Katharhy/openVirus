<p>As noted above, approaches involving the inner canthi or maximum-temperature locations provided higher levels of performance. Therefore, it is not surprising that

 </inline-formula> is a more unexpected result, because it was not advocated in ISO/TR 13154 as a “robust measurement site,” as the inner canthi were. However, this approach has been used in a number of prior studies

 </xref> likely due to its combination of simplicity and effectiveness. These prior studies achieved relatively high-Se/Sp values (0.7 to 0.9) using this approach. In part, this effectiveness stems from the fact that the inner canthi are a key thermal feature in full-face images, as discussed Sec.
