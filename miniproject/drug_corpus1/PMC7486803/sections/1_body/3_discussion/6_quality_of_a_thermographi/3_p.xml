<p>The use of a BB for temperature compensation had a moderate impact on IRT screening ability. In our prior study,

 </xref> such compensation vastly improved the stability of IRT-2 and enabled the system to meet IEC 80601-2-59 performance specifications. Except to measure and compensate for long-term drift, the use of three-frame averaging in the current study may have improved stability to the point where the BB was no longer critical. If no frame averaging is used, the use of a BB would likely be more critical for fever detection. Additionally, the current study was executed in an environment with relatively stable ambient temperature; it is likely that in a less controlled screening location with larger, more rapid thermal fluctuations, BB compensation would be more important.
