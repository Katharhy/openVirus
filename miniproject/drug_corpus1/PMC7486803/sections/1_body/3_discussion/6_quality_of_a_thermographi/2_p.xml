<p>The IEC 80601-2-59 standard
 <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref> defines an ST as a system composed of an IRT and an external temperature reference source (usually a BB with known temperature and emissivity), and in some cases, a computer and software for data acquisition, processing, and storage. Therefore, most results in this paper, except for the data in Sec.Â 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3.4">3.4</xref>, are technically not results of two thermal cameras, IRT-1, and IRT-2, rather, two fever-screening systems, (IRT-1 + BB) and (IRT-2 + BB). We have evaluated these two systems in our previous work

 </xref> and found that their uniformity, stability, drift, minimum resolvable temperature difference, and laboratory accuracy all satisfied the standard requirements.
