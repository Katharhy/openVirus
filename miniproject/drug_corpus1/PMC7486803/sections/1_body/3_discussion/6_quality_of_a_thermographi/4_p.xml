<p>While inherent IRT instrumentation quality is critical, the performance also depends on effective implementation. The use of control methods, such as an absorbing background, multiple frame imaging, and thermally stable, forward-facing subjects also likely helps to optimize screening performance. Given that many of these confounding factors have been addressed in our study, the results presented here likely indicate a best-case performance level. As control, if methods we have implemented are removed—which may be necessary in certain real-world screening situations—it is likely that performance will degrade. The degree to which removal of any specific control will impact results is beyond the scope of the current study but may be important for predicting real-world performance.</p>
