 </inline-formula>, we evaluated the distribution of locations where maximum temperatures occurred over 3252 thermal images collected by the two IRTs from the first round of measurements. The locations of thermal maxima in full-face images are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref> and 
 <xref rid="t010" ref-type="table">Table 10</xref>. According to 
 <xref rid="t010" ref-type="table">Table 10</xref>, thermal maxima appeared most commonly (59.5%) in the inner canthi region, followed by oral (21.7%), forehead (8.8%), nasal (4.1%), and temporal (3.6%) regions. The predominance of inner canthi maxima is expected given what is known regarding perfusion in this region. A relatively large fraction of maxima occurred in the oral region, likely due to perfusion from the facial artery which is closer to the external carotid artery than the vessels that perfuse most facial regions. The forehead maximum was typically along the hairline, likely due to the thermal insulation effect of hair. Some thermal maxima appeared in the temporal region, likely due to the superficial temporal arteries. It was unexpected to find maxima in the nasal/nostril region (bottom); whether these are due to some pathologies, such as sinusitis,
