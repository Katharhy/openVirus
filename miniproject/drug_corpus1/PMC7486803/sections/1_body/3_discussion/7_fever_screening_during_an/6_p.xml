<p>Even if a suitable diagnostic threshold for fever based on body temperature can be defined, determining the IRT cutoff temperature for fever screening requires a variety of considerations. While we calculated optimal cutoff temperature to optimize both Se and Sp, this may not represent an optimal value for real-world use. For a severe disease, lower cutoff values may be needed to minimize false negatives in primary screening. Given the typically low prevalence of diseased individuals in a screening population, the false positive rate in primary screening will be high (and thus the positive predictive value low). On the other hand, it may also be important to balance the burden on the population being screened (e.g., travel delays) and screening personnel (e.g., workload, fatigue, and cost to health agencies).
