<p>The primary purpose of this study was to facilitate the implementation of IRT systems and practices that enable optimal measurement accuracy and highly effective fever screening during epidemics. However, achieving effective screening can be a complex process, as many factors need to be addressed beyond the physics, instrumentation, and acquisition procedures. While our results showed that some facial temperatures had good discrimination abilities with high AUC values, some previous literature claimed that thermography was not highly effective for fever screening during disease outbreaks.

 </xref> In a future study, we will address the impact of environmental conditions outside those that the standard recommends—such as higher or lower ambient temperatures that might be encountered near the entry of a building—on IRT accuracy and linearity.
