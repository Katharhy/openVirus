 </inline-formula> data produced an AUC value of 0.95 to 0.97 and Se/Sp values in the 0.85 to 0.95 range. For a diagnostic threshold of 37.8°C, Se/Sp values increased to the 0.93 to 0.95 range. These results for relatively low-grade fever detection, as well as findings at higher diagnostic thresholds shown in
