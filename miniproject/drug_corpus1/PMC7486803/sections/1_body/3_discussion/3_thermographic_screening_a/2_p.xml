 </xref> The guidance provided by these publications helped ensure that the devices used in this research had a high level of image quality and that the acquisition methods—including instructions to subjects—were optimized to enable accurate measurements. The optimal approaches identified in our study produced results that were equal to or better than most prior relevant works in terms of absolute agreement with, and correlation to, reference measurements, as well as discrimination of febrile subjects.
