<p>Overall, our clinical study results support the conclusion that adherence to international consensus guidelines regarding IRT system specifications and implementation contributes to optimization of measurement accuracy and detection of febrile individuals. These guidelines include environmental controls as well as subject preparations and acclimation prior to measurements. Two additional findings were made: first, targeted measurement of a small inner canthi area may be unnecessary, with full-face maximum temperatures providing the best performance followed closely by the maximum of a wider inner canthi region. Second, while temperature compensation with a high-quality BB can improve IRT system performance, the impact was modest on our high-quality IRTs and highly controlled setup, which incorporated multiframe averaging. Our findings also indicated that forehead temperatures provide generally inferior estimation of reference (oral) temperature relative to the inner canthi and full-face maximum temperature. The optimal approaches identified here achieved correlation coefficients of

Future work will involve further analysis of our clinical study results to address the impact of confounding factors relating to intersubject and environmental variability.
