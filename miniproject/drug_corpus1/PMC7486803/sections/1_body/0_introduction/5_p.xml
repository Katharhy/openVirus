<p>Improvements in IRT-based temperature measurement accuracy could enable detection of lower-grade fevers (e.g., 37°C to 38°C). Such temperatures may be associated with early disease stages, such as when symptoms are starting to become evident in COVID-19

 </xref> This capability may be particularly relevant to transportation and containment, since individuals with fully developed symptoms may remain home or seek medical care, whereas those with less severe symptoms are more likely to travel. Furthermore, in diseases with significant person-to-person variations in symptom intensity, fully developed illness with low-grade fever would be more common. Alternately, enhanced IRT system accuracy could enable improved Se or Sp for high-grade fever, thus reducing the large number of false positives that are likely due to the high prevalence of afebrile individuals and wide variations in normal temperatures
