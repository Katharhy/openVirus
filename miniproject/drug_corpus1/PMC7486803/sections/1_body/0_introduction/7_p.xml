<p>IRTs measure body surface temperatures that can be calibrated to or matched with corresponding oral or tympanic temperatures, which provide optimal discrimination based on ROC curve analysis. While some prior studies have equated oral and tympanic temperatures with core temperature, it is more accurate to say that these internal, yet accessible, sites act as well-correlated surrogates for core temperature.

 </xref> In thermal images, a variety of facial measurement locations and processing methods have been investigated to optimize IRT fever-screening performance. The inner canthi are thought to be an ideal location for noncontact temperature measurements. Perfused by the internal carotid artery, they have high temperature stability, are typically the warmest regions on the face, and have the highest correlation with internal body temperature.
