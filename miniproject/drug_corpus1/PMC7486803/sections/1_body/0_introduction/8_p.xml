<p>The purpose of this study was to generate independent data to assess the potential of IRTs for fever screening when implemented according to international consensus documents, while also elucidating the impact of facial measurement location and other key issues on IRT-based fever-screening performance. Specifically, our goals included: (a) acquisition of clinical IRT and reference temperature (oral temperature) data in a large population of febrile and afebrile subjects using standardized methods, (b) evaluation of facial measurement locations for their impact on correlation to—and absolute agreement with—reference temperature, and (c) comparative statistical analysis of febrile subject detection performance using these methods.</p>
