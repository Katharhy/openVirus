<p>Optimizing IRT-based screening requires consideration of fundamental device performance, implementation practices, and confounding factors such as environmental conditions. With the steady increase in the use of IRTs for medical applications, consensus documents for IRT evaluation and application have recently been published. International standard IEC 80601-2-59:2017
 <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref> provides recommendations for performance characterization of fever-screening IRTs. In a prior study, we implemented and evaluated these recommendations using two commercial IRTs,

 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>24</sup>
 </xref> describes best practices for IRT deployment, implementation, and operation. These include approaches that have not been commonly employed during disease epidemics, such as including a high-quality blackbody (BB) in the thermal image to minimize the impact of environmental factors, IRT instability, and drift. This report also recommends measurements be performed on individuals rather than a crowd, and that the inner canthus (tear duct) regions be measured to reduce measurement variability.
