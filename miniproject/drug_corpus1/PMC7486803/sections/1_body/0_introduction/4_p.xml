<p>Human subject studies have demonstrated that IRTs can estimate body temperature and detect febrile individuals with moderately high accuracy. Several studies on IRT-based fever detection screening in hospital settings found “optimal” sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) values—the point on the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve where both Se and Sp are high—in the 0.70 to 0.80 range.

 </xref> studied patients arriving at a hospital during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and found Se/Sp of 0.70/0.92 (AUC = 0.86) for IRT-identified subjects with fever above 100°F (37.8°C), although no data were provided on detection of subjects infected with H1N1 influenza. One study performed in an airport also indicated similar Se/Sp levels, yet identified a minimal number of infected travelers;

This lack of Se may has been due in part to using a wide-field screening approach rather than the single-subject approach implemented in most of the aforementioned studies.

However, this review did not address variations in IRT device quality and implementation, which are likely significant factors in determining real-world effectiveness.
