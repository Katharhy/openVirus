<p>Fever is a key symptom of many infectious diseases that have caused epidemics, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, influenza A (H1N1) in 2009, Ebola virus disease (EVD) in 2014, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

 </xref> Fever screening is a medical countermeasure used at international borders, public transportation hubs, and hospitals to mitigate the propagation of these diseases. Often, a diagnostic based on radiative heat transfer from the human body [i.e., infrared (IR) thermometry] is used for primary screening in combination with other approaches, such as symptom questionnaires.

 </xref> If the subject is determined to be positive in primary screening, a secondary screening may be implemented including contact measurements (e.g., oral thermometry) and/or sampling for a laboratory test.
