 </xref> A thermometer (SureTemp Plus 690, Welch Allyn, San Diego, CA) was placed under the subject’s tongue in a sublingual pocket (heat pocket). Then the temperature was read in two different modes, a “fast” mode in several seconds and a “monitor” mode after 3 min. We used the monitor mode data in this study since the monitor mode provides a superior accuracy compared to the fast mode. The monitor mode has accuracy of
