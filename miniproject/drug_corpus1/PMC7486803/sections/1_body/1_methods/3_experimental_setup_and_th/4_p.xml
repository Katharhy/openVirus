<p>To minimize the influence of outside temperature, each subject was instructed to wait for 15 min before measurements started. Once seated, the subject was asked to remove all obstructions from the face (e.g., eyeglasses and hair on forehead) and look at the IRTs. Then, the tripod was adjusted to include the subject’s full face in the WTP. For each subject, four rounds of measurements were performed within
