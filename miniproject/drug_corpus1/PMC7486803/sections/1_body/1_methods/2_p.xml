<p>Over the course of 18 months—from November 2016 to May 2018—we conducted a clinical study of 596 subjects at the University Health Center of the University of Maryland (UMD) at College Park. Both Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and UMD Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) approved this study under FDA IRB study #16-011R and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. All experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Informed concern has been obtained for publishing recognizable images in this paper. The screening area was prepared according to consensus document specifications.

 </xref> Measurements of study subjects were performed with an oral thermometer, multiple NCITs, and two IRTs. The NCIT data and analysis will be the subject of a future paper. As detailed below, the current work focuses on analysis of a subset of the measurements acquired for each subject.
