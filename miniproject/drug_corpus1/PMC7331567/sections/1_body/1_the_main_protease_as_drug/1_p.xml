 <xref rid="b0275" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> Amongst the coronaviral targets that have been studied in the past, the main protease (M
 <sup>pro</sup>, 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, nsp5) received major attention,
 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0280" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> particularly following the first SARS-CoV outbreak in the early 2000s.
 <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0285" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> Alternative coronaviral targets include the spike protein (S), RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp, nsp12), NTPase/helicase (nsp13) and papain-like protease (PL
 <sup>pro</sup>, part of nsp3).
 <xref rid="b0250" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0290" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> The papain-like protease also recognises the C-terminal sequence of ubiquitin. Therefore, substrate-derived inhibitors of PL
 <sup>pro</sup> would be expected to also inhibit host-cell deubiquitinases, making drug-discovery campaigns against PL
 <sup>pro</sup> challenging. In stark contrast, the main protease M
 <sup>pro</sup> exclusively cleaves polypeptide sequences after a glutamine residue, positioning the main protease as an ideal drug target because, to the best of our knowledge, no human host-cell proteases are known with this substrate specificity.
