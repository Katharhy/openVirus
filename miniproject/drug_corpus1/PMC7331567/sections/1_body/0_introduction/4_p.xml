<p id="p0020">SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to other viruses of the 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> genus such as the bat coronavirus BatCoV RaTG13 (~96% sequence identity) and the SARS-CoV (~80% sequence identity).
 <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are both of zoonotic origin, with bats being their natural reservoir. Transmission to humans can occur via their intermediate hosts palm civets (SARS) and dromedary camels (MERS).

 </xref> SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have followed a similar evolutionary transmission cascade.
 <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> The spike glycoprotein (S) plays an important role in host range (tropism) and ‘host jumps’.
 <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> In the case of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, it recognises the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2), which both viruses employ for cell entry.
 <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Comparisons of structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2, such as the spike protein (S), with those from animal coronaviruses indicate the involvement of bats as natural reservoir with a possibility for pangolins as intermediate hosts.

 <xref rid="b0240" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> As the introduction of coronaviruses into human population has been observed on multiple occasions, a better understanding of the naturally circulating viruses is of high interest for pandemic prevention as is antiviral research to prepare for future outbreaks.
