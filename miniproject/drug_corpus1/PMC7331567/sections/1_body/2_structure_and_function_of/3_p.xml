<p id="p0045">M
 <sup>pro</sup> is a cysteine protease with a catalytic dyad (cysteine and histidine) in its active centre (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). While other cysteine and serine proteases contain a third catalytic residue, a buried water molecule occupies this place in the active site of M
 <sup>pro</sup>.

 <xref rid="b0355" ref-type="bibr">71</xref> The proteolytic process is believed to follow a multi-step mechanism. After the cysteine side chain proton is abstracted by the histidineâ€™s imidazole, the resulting thiolate nucleophile attacks the amide bond of the substrate. The 
 <italic>N</italic>-terminal peptide product is released by proton abstraction from histidine before the thioester is hydrolysed to release the C-terminal product and restore the catalytic dyad.
