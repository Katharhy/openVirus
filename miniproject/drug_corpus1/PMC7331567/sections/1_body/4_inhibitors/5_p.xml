<p id="p0095">Compounds 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>6</bold> are the strongest known SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors with inhibition constants in the two-digit nanomolar range. These small peptidomimetics feature an indole moiety at the 
 <italic>N</italic>-terminus (
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>3</sub>) and a C-terminal aldehyde warhead which binds covalently to Cys145, as proven by X-ray crystallography (

 <xref rid="b0465" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0470" ref-type="bibr">94</xref> Compound 
 <bold>5</bold> and the previously investigated α-ketoamides 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> are structurally identical in 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> and 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>; however, 
 <bold>5</bold> inhibits one order of magnitude stronger, which is likely caused by the increased electrophilicity of the aldehyde warhead compared to the more drug-like α-ketoamide. Despite, the high reactivity of the aldehyde function, compounds 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>6</bold> displayed sub-micromolar antiviral activity in Vero cells (
 <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). In agreement with compound 
 <bold>3</bold>, the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> activity of 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>6</bold> was one order of magnitude weaker than the direct M
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibition in the enzymatic assay. Notably, 
 <bold>5</bold> exhibited only low toxicity in animal models despite its aldehyde warhead.
