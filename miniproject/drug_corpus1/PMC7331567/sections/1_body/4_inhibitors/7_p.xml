 <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) have been deposited in the protein data bank under the accession codes 6W63 and 6M2N, respectively. Notably, both compounds bind non-covalently to the active site. X77 and derivatives have previously been investigated as low-micromolar inhibitors of SARS-CoV M
 <sup>pro</sup>, where a strong stereochemical bias for the (
 <italic>R</italic>) enantiomer of the pyridyl side chain has been observed.
