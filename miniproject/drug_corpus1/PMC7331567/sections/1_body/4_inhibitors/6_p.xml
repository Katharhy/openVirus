<p id="p0100">A high-throughput screening campaign of a library of approved drugs and clinical candidates revealed six small molecules, ebselen, disulfiram, carmofur, tideglusib, shikonin and PX-12, as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> (

 </xref> Mass spectrometry experiments showed that ebselen, carmofur and PX-12 covalently modify Cys145. Small covalent modifiers like these may bind unspecifically, a characteristic associated with pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS).

 </xref> Ebselen showed antiviral activity in Vero cells in the low micromolar range. In case of carmofur, a crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> revealed transfer of the hexylurea side chain to Cys145, forming a hexylcarbamothioate interacting with the S
 <sub>2</sub> subsite (PDB: 7BUY).
