<p id="p0400">Among the different phases, as an example, phase 1 (receptor binding and viral entry) is the most critical for the overall infective process (

Among the different events that occur in this phase, we could find compounds that inhibit the Spike protein on the virus coat from interacting with the host receptor on the human cell membrane. Most representative classes acting against this phase are: Terpenes (3), Quinones (2) and Flavonoids (1) (
