<p id="p0420">While expanding the collection to consider the host side perspective, the current resource aimed to collect all known compounds effective for natural treatments and proper food selection and design because of their action against viral absorption and replication. We annotated those that were in vitro tested and those predicted by computational analysis. We highlighted the action in the different viral life cycle phases also to identify compounds that could inhibit the absorption, since this is one of the major target that could help to fight the current and prevent the possible future coronaviral infections.</p>
