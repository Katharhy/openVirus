<p id="p0045">NPs are divided in two main groups: the primary and the secondary metabolites. Primary metabolites are ubiquitous organic compounds considered essential for the organism life, including nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. Secondary metabolites are instead organic compounds, with a much more limited distribution in nature, that sustain the structure and the functional status of cells and overall organisms (

 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Korkina et al., 2011</xref>) and terpenes (
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Saito et al., 2016</xref>) are being extensively used as leading compounds because of their versatile functions and effects in health and wellbeing, for drugs and food design. Their chemical structures are chemically modified to reduce side effects and/or increase their bioavailability.
