<p id="p0100">We reviewed all public scientific papers that describe natural compounds effective against coronaviruses infections, annotating their action, their chemical class and the source organism. Some of these compounds have been already proven for their action against SARS-CoV2, causing the current pandemic disease, other showed relevant effects against previously human infecting coronaviruses. Their functionality, revealed by in vitro experiments or predicted by in silico analyses, offers a relevant piece of information for further experimental validations and for in vivo trials that could drive towards proper food, ingredients and additives. Therefore, we considered useful to organize a web accessible collection, available at

To be ready to face current and next challenges.
