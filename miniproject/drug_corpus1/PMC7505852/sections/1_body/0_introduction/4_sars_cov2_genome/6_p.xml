<p id="p0145">Spike proteins have two subunits, the amino-terminal receptor binding (S1) and the carboxy-terminal membrane fusion (S2) domains. The S1 domain includes the receptor binding domain (RBD), which is the region binding the host receptor, that determines tissue tropism and host range variability for different CoVs (
