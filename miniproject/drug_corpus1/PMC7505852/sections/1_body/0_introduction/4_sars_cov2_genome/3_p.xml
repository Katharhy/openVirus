<p id="p0130">Looking at the genomic features of SARS-CoV2 it includes 6 open-reading frames (ORFs) and other accessory genes (

 <xref rid="bib100" ref-type="bibr">Zumla et al., 2016</xref>). The main ORFs of the genomic RNA at the 5’ end of the genome, ORF1a and ORF1ab, are used as templates to directly translate polyproteins 1a/1 ab (pp1a/pp1ab), respectively, which encode non-structural proteins (nsps) that form the replication-transcription complex (RTC) (

 <xref rid="bib100" ref-type="bibr">Zumla et al., 2016</xref>). The two replicases are cleaved by two different proteases, the 3CLPro, that is also called the main protease (MPro), and the papain-like protease (PLPro) (
 <xref rid="bib97" ref-type="bibr">Zhang, Lin et al., 2020</xref>). The 3CLPro operates as a dimer, each formed by 3 domains (I, II, III), sharing 96% sequence identity with the corresponding protein encoded by the SARS-CoV genome. 3CLPro can cleave at least 11 sites on the replicase 1 ab (
 <xref rid="bib97" ref-type="bibr">Zhang, Lin et al., 2020</xref>). PLPro also takes part in this process, acting on secondary cleavage sites on PP1a and PP1ab. These events produce the two replicases and other enzymes involved in viral transcription and replication, including an RNA dependant RNA polymerase (RdRp) and an helicase (Hel) (
