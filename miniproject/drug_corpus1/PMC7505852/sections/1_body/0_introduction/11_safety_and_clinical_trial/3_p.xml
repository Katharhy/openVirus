<p id="p0300">A drug's disposition depends upon the absorption process from a dosing site, the distribution to target and other systemic and peripheral tissues, and the elimination of unchanged drug by metabolism or excretion. These processes interact to characterize a drug by its pharmacokinetic profile and any alteration will have an impact on the drug safety and efficacy. Therefore, methods were developed by pharmaceutical chemists to predict drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, interaction and also the excretion of unchanged drug and the effect with potential adverse outcomes, thus compromising a drug's safety profile (
