<p id="p0205">In 2003, Cinatl et al. (
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Cinatl et al., 2003</xref>) tested glycyrrhizin against two clinical isolates of SARS-coronaviruses (FFM-1 and FFM-2). The glycyrrhizic acid is a triterpene glycoside extracted from the root of the licorice plant (
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic>), with many properties such as anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, hepatoprotective and anticancer activities. The authors also showed that the maximum effect of glycyrrhizin (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 300 mg/L) was obtained when administered during and after the viral adsorption in Vero E6 cells, the African green monkey kidney cell line. Despite the glycyrrhizin had never been tested against SARS-COVs infected patients, the administration of the compound effectively decreased the concentrations of P24 antigen and prevented the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in those infected by HIV-1 and chronic hepatitis C virus, respectively (

Since side-effects were reported after several months of glycyrrhizin treatment, the authors suggested that the treatments should last for a short period. Despite the mechanism of the antiviral activity against SARS-CoV remains unclear, the authors suggested that it could be related to the upregulation of the inducible nitrous oxide synthase and, as a consequence, to the increased production of nitrous oxide that is proposed to be an inhibitor of SARS-CoV replication.
