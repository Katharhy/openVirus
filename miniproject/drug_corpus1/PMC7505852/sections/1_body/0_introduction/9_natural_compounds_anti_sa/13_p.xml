 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Chen, Lin et al., 2005</xref>) showed that the tannic acid, 3-isotheaflavin-3-gallate (TF2B) and Theaflavin-3,3′-digallate (TF3) (polyphenols in black tea), selected from the pure Natural Products Library (

 <italic>E. coli</italic>), at concentrations &lt;10 μM (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 3, 3.7 and 9.5 μM respectively). Despite the mechanism of action of these extracts was still unknown, the authors suggested that TF2B and TF3 are inhibitors of SARS-CoV 3CLpro more effective than other compounds (i.e TF1) probably for the presence of a gallate group that could have an important role in directing their inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV 3CLpro.
