<p id="p0200">Among the compound tested, the authors suggested the baicalin for both prophylaxis or treatment SARS-CoV infectious disease. The intravenous administration of a 360 mg dose of that compound in human can achieve an active serum concentration of 74 μg/ml. Despite its mechanism of action against SARS-CoV is not known, regarding HIV-1 infections, baicalin was shown to inhibit the infection process both at cellular entry and through the inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. In particular, its binding with the chemokines MIP-1β and SDF-1α prevented the activation of both CCR5 and CXCR4 cellular receptors, which are essential for HIV-1 cellular entry.</p>
