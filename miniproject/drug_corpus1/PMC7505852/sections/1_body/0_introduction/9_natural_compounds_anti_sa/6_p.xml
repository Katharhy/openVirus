<p id="p0215">Furthermore, in 2012, Keum et al. (
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Keum &amp; Jeong, 2012</xref>) analyzed the activity of viral helicase. Firstly, they focused on the DNA unwinding activity of the helicase protein. In particular, they used the fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) to find out the natural compounds that inhibit the DNA unwinding activity. They mixed the viral helicase protein with fluorescent-labeled double stranded DNA, each strand of which was labeled with different fluorescent dyes, (fluorescein (FAM) and carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA)) at the same terminus. Therefore, a constant FRET reaction between FAM and TAMRA occurred when the two DNA strands were base-paired; however, this interaction is lost as soon as the duplex is unwound by the viral helicase. Using this experimental approach, they excluded that the 64 natural compounds (that they screened) interfered with the DNA unwinding activity of the viral helicase protein. Subsequently, they examined the possible effects of the 64 natural compounds on the suppression of ATP hydrolysis by viral helicase. The ATP hydrolysis activity of viral helicase was measured using a long circular ssDNA as a template. The viral helicase protein is expected to continuously translocate along the ssDNA, unless the helicase separates from the DNA. The degree of ATP hydrolysis was examined by measuring the release of inorganic phosphate by colorimetric analysis. Usign this last approach, the authors found that two flavonoids, myricetin and scutellarein, inhibited the ATPase activity of the viral helicase (IC
