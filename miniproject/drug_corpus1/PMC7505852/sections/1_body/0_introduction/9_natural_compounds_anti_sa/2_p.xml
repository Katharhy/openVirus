They also confirmed the antiviral action of glycyrrhizin, together with baicalin, both belonging to the class of flavonoids and extracted from traditional Chinese herbs. These two molecules had been already reported to have also antimicrobial effects. The two molecules showed detectable antiviral activities on foetal rhesus kidney-4 (fRhK-4) infected with the 10 strains (EC
 <sub>50</sub> for baicalin at 48 h was from 12.5 to 25 μg/ml). However, their activities showed a decrease after 48 h treatments (
