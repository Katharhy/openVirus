 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. (2006)</xref> The authors, though a virtual screening based firstly on molecular docking, found quercetin-3-β-galactoside to be a potent binder to the catalytic pocket of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Then the results were also confirmed and supported by docking other techniques such as surface plasmon resonance and FRET bioassays but also and mutagenesis studies. Overall, the results showed that Gln189 plays a key role in allowing the binding of quercetin-3-b-galactoside to SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Quercetin is a water-soluble flavonoid that is known to have salutary effects on humans (
