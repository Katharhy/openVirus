<p id="p0265">In 2013, Cho et al. (
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al., 2013</xref>) showed that the 12 flavonoids extracted from 
 <italic>Paulownia tomentosa</italic> have inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV PLpro. To investigate the inhibitory role of the 12 extracted flavonoids against SARS-CoV PLpro, they measured SARS-CoV PLpro activity in the presence or absence of test compounds using a fluorogenic assay. The SARS-CoV PLpro was expressed in 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and purified by nickel affinity, ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography. In SARS-CoV PLpro inhibition assays, all of the 12 compounds tested displayed dose dependent inhibition (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 5.0–14.4 μM). Of these, tometins had strong inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV PLpro. Tometins are characterized by a rare 3, 4-dihydro-2H-pyran motif. This structural arrangement was found to be more effective at inhibiting SARS-CoV PLpro enzyme than the parent compounds that were cyclization precursors (
