 <xref rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2020</xref>) analyzed all the proteins encoded by SARS-CoV2 genes, and predicted their structures by homology modeling. They identified a total of 21 targets (19 viral and 2 human targets) that were screened against an in house built database of 1066 natural products from traditional chinese herbs. In particular, they focused on 3CLpro, Spike, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and PLpro, and identified 89 natural compounds potentially useful against SARS-CoV2 (
