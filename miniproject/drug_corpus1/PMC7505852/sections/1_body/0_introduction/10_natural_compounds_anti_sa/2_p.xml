<p id="p0275">In 2020, Li et al. (
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2020</xref>) performed a bioinformatics analysis to identify existing drugs that could be useful also against SARS-CoV2. In particular, their analysis of the genome sequence of SARS-CoV2 confirmed the higher sequence similarity with SARS-CoV (

 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Using text mining and database searches, the authors identified 34 COVID19 related genes, identifying 24 disease-related human pathways and 78 potential drugs, that could be repurposed. They manually filtered the list of drugs based on their “mechanisms of action”, “adverse effects”, and “clinical approvals”, yielding to a total of 30 drugs (

 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>). Molecules were selected when they met the criteria of being natural, not chemically modified substances, with antiviral effect. For example, based on our criteria, compounds that were excluded are: monoclonal antibodies (like Adalimumab, Infliximab, Ruplizumab, Siltuximab, Ruplizumab, Ibalizumab, Golimumab, Afelimomab), synthetized or semi-synthetized chemical products (like Abacavir, Cefazolin, Epinephrine, Atiprimod, Thalidomide, Chloroquine, Clenbuterol), fusion proteins (like Etanercept), or those acting on the host immune system (like Olsalazine, N-Formylmethionine, Ketoprofen).
