  <p id="p0460">Coronavirus invasion starts with the interaction of the spike glycoprotein (S) on the viral coat with the receptor on the host cell membrane. The virus entry occurs through fusion with the host cell plasma membrane or by endocytosis (Phase 1: receptor binding and viral entry).</p>
  <p id="p0465">The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm (Phase 2: release of viral RNA genome).</p>
  <p id="p0470">Translation of the viral genomic RNA produces two large polyproteins (Phase 3: translation of polyproteins) that undergo autoproteolytic processing performed by papain-like protease (PLPro) and 3C-like protease (3CLPro) to generate the constituents of the replication/transcription complex (RTC) (Phase 4: autoprotoeolytic activation). The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the key enzyme in the RTC, transcribes a newly synthesized full-length RNA genome (Phase 5a: genomic RNA replication) and subgenome RNAs (Phase 5b: subgenomic RNAs transcription). Translation of subgenomic RNAs gives rise to structural viral proteins (N, S, M and E) (Phase 6: translation of N, S, M, E proteins). The newly produced genomic RNA is encapsidated with the N proteins to form the nucleocapsid (N). The S, membrane (M) and envelope (E) proteins are inserted into the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), transported to the ER–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) from where they combine with the RNA-encapsidated N proteins for the production of mature virions (Phase 7: formation of mature virion). Virus assembly occurs within Golgi vesicles, followed by virus release by fusion of virion-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane (Phase 8: exocytosis).</p>
