<p>In this outbreak there were 7 sapovirus-positive samples from students in multiple grade levels. Epidemiologic studies have shown that volunteers had no connection through family relationships or contact through social activities such as academies and clubs. Considering that the epidemic curve has been reported in most cases to occur within 24 hours, it is estimated that a single exposure by water or food was more likely to have occurred than person-to-person transmission. However, we were not able to determine the infectious agent because the virus was not detected in cooks or environmental samples. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis showed that the strain that shows the most resemblance is the GI.3 strain (strain sapovirus Hu/OH08021/JP: Genbank accession number AB0623037), which was isolated in Japan in 2008. The epidemic strain in Korea was GI.1 type which was confirmed by a domestic acute diarrheal laboratory surveillance system. Analysis of genotypes is important for identifying currently circulating sapoviruses. The most common sapovirus genogroups are GI and GII.
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Genotype I.1 is the most common genotype around the globe, and GI.2 has been increasingly detected in many European countries,
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and also in northern Africa.
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In Korea, as previously reported, the most common genotype is GI.1, but the genotype of the outbreak was GI.3, which is not a domestic genotype.
