<p>In order to identify causative pathogens, human and environmental specimens were collected and examined. Microbiological tests were performed at the Gyeonggi-do Institute of Health and Environment, following the laboratory diagnosis guidelines of the Korea Center for Laboratory Control of Infectious Diseases (KCDC) and the Ministry of Food and Drug Service (MFDS). The molecular epidemiological investigation was performed at the Division of Viral diseases, KCDC. A total of 20 fecal samples were collected by rectal smear method, including 11 of 17 patients who fulfilled the definition, 8 persons who worked as cooks, and 1 patient who had other symptoms. The pathogens to be tested included 10 species of bacteria (
 <italic>Shigella</italic> spp, 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp, pathogenic 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (EHEC, ETEC, EPEC, EIEC etc.), 
 <italic>Vibrio</italic> spp, 
 <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic>, 
 <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>) and 5 species of viruses (Group A rotavirus, norovirus, enteric adenovirus, astrovirus, sapovirus). The environmental samples were basically sampled from preservated foods, drinking water, cooking utensils, and cooking water. Specimens were also sampled from door knobs, handrails, corridors in front of the office, and vomiting areas in places where guests spent much time. In environmental samples, only 10 species of bacteria were tested.
