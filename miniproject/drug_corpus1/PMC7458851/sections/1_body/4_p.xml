<p>One of the human caliciviruses, sapovirus has emerged as an important cause of viral gastroenteritis in people of all age groups and is the cause of outbreaks. Sapovirus associated outbreak has been increasing globally. We described an outbreak of gastroenteritis associated with sapovirus in one elementary school in Gyeonggi Province, Korea. In this study, symptoms due to sapovirus infection were observed in 1.7% (17/999) of the subjects (

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and Johansson et al.
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> reported that diarrhea is more common than vomiting in adults. In the case of norovirus, more than 50% of the cases have vomiting symptoms in children, which may be a characteristic of viral infection belonging to Calicivirus.
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In this case, all of the respondents (17 patients, 100%) showed vomiting symptoms and only 7 patients (41.2%) showed diarrhea, so the main symptom of sapovirus infection in children is vomiting, similar to norovirus (
