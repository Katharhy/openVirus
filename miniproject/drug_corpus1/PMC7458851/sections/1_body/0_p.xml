<p>Sapovirus belongs to the 
 <italic>Caliciviridae</italic> family, such as norovirus and is genetically classified into five groups (GI-GV). GI, GII, GIV and GV are known to cause human infection, except for GIII which causes infection in pigs.

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Transmission of sapovirus occurs via fecal oral route from contaminated water and food, and person-to-person spread. Also, the most common symptoms of sapovirus infection are similar to norovirus infection, such as vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, chills, and fever. The incidence of gastroenteritis associated with sapovirus has been reported throughout the year in all age groups in a variety of settings, such as in childcare centers, colleges, nursing homes, hospitals, restaurants, cruises and schools.

In this study, we report that sapovirus can be a causative agent of gastroenteritis outbreak in elementary school students and characterize molecular epidemics of sapovirus associated with this outbreak.
