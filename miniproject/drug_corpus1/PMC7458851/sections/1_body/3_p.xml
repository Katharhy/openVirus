<p>Bacterial tests were confirmed by biochemical tests on the specific colonies formed after cultivation in the selective medium. For virus detection, the supernatant was used in the experiment after centrifugation of the feces dilution. Group A rotavirus and intestinal adenovirus were confirmed by EIA, and norovirus, astrovirus and sapovirus were confirmed by genetic testing. To briefly describe the sapovirus assay, the pre-treated supernatant was extracted with a commercially available nucleic acid extraction kit (NucleoMag 96® Virus kit, Macherey-Nagel, Dueren, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sapovirus was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using a commercial one-step premix kit (iMOD-001TD, SnC, Seoul, Korea) with the following conditions: 48°C, 40 minutes; 94°C, 15 minutes; 94°C, 30 seconds; 58°C, 30 seconds; 72°C, 60 seconds for 35 cycles; and 72°C 7 minutes. The oligo nucleotide sequence was performed using forward primer SV-F21 (5′-ANT AGT GTT TGA RAT GGA GGG-3′) and reverse primer SV-R1 (5′-CWG GTG AMA CMC CAT TKT CCA T-3′) to amplify the ORF1 capsid region. In the genetic test, only seven samples of human specimens were found to have sapovirus, with 1 in grade 1, 3 in grade 4, and 3 in grade 6 (

The nucleotide sequence was analyzed using a 3730xl automated sequencer (Applied Bio Systems, Foster City, CA, USA). The genotype was then determined by sequencing followed by BLAST searching of the GenBank database and alignment using the Bioedit 7.0 program. We used the neighbor-joining method (Kimura 2-parameter model with 1,000 bootstrap replicates) of the MEGA 6 analysis program, and all 7 cases formed the same cluster as sapovirus GI.3 (
