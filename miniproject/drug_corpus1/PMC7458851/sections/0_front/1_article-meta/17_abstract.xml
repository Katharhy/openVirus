 <p>On October 4, 2018, an outbreak of gastroenteritis associated with sapovirus occurred among elementary school students in Gyeonggi-do, Korea. Epidemiologic studies were conducted in a retrospective cohort approach. Using self-administered questionnaires, we collected information on symptoms and food items consumed. Of the 999 subjects, 17 developed patients that met the case definition. The main symptom was vomiting (100%), and the symptomatic age was 6-12 years. Positive samples were identified by conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for sequencing. They were classified into genotype GI.3 by phylogenetic analysis. This is the first report of an outbreak associated with sapovirus GI.3 in Korea.</p>
