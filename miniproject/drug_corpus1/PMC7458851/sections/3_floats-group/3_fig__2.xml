  <p>Phylogenetic analysis of sapovirus detected in the outbreak, based on 720 bp of the capsid region (ORF1) sequences. The phylogenetic tree was generated using the neighbor-joining method with distance calculation by Kimura-2-parameter correction implemented in the MEGA6 software. The numbers in the branches indicate the bootstrap of 1,000 replicated values. Reference strains of sapovirus genotype were registered in GenBank under the accession number indicated in the text. Outbreak samples are marked with black circles (‚óè).</p>
