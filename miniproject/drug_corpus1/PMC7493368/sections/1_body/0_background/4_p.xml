<p id="Par24">The only guidance on the use of rapid tests for Ebola from WHO is a brief “Interim Guidance” from March 2015, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and the only RDT identified specifically by WHO as appropriate for use, the Corgenix ReEBOV, is no longer on the market [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. There is a dire need for sustained availability of Ebola RDTs to contain active and future outbreaks. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the Ebola Virus (EBV) components of three Ebola rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) developed by Chembio Diagnostics (Medford, USA) in response to the urgent need recognized in 2014/2015 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]: [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] an Ebola-only test [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]; a combination Ebola-Malaria test, and [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] a fever panel test which identifies 7 diseases, including Ebola.
