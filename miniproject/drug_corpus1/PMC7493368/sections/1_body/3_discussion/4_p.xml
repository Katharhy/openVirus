<p id="Par42">Nonetheless, as of September 2019, no RDT meeting the specifications suggested by the WHO are commercially available. Two Ebola RDTs have had emergency use assessment and listing (EUAL) from the WHO: the OraQuick Ebola Rapid Antigen Test Kit (Orasure Technologies, USA), and the ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test Kit (Corgenix, USA) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The OraQuick has a reported sensitivity of 94.1%, (95% CI 83.8–98.8%) and specificity of 100% (98.11–100%) in patients from Sierra Leone [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test had a reported sensitivity of 91.8% (95% CI 84.5–96.8%) in one study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and sensitivity and specificity of 100 and 92.2% among 28 high viral load samples from Sierra Leone [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, an initial Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the ReEBOV test was revoked by the FDA in 2018 when sufficient performance data could not be replicated by a new manufacturer that had acquired the ReEBOV test. Thus, only the OraQuick test has data supporting an emergency authorization for use in Ebola control.
