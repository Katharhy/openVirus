  <p>Replication cycle of SARS-CoV-2 and potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug targets. Following bindings of SARS-CoV-2 particles with the cell receptors including dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), aminopeptidase N (APN), and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), RNA of the virus then enters into the host cell and viral RNA transcription takes place via RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). After that viral protein synthesis takes place that is encapsulated and then released from the host cell. Dotted arrows have been used to indicate the drug targets of investigational therapies for nCOVID-19.</p>
