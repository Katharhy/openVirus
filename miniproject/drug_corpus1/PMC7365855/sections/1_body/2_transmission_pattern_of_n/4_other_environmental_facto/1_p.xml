<p>Several other environmental factors can affect the link between mortality and temperature including air pollution (Cai et al., 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), humidity (Jaakkola et al., 
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Kudo et al., 
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), latitude (Bao et al., 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In this regard, socio-demographic factors including income, age, and gender (Bao et al., 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) have also been reported to play roles. In a study, Chan et al. (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) revealed that individuals who live at lower latitudes showed a strong adaptive capacity toward heat, and a relatively weak adaptive capacity was observed toward cold. These researchers also observed that the viability of SARS-CoV was much lower at higher relative humidity and higher temperatures (for example, relative humidity: over 95%, and temperature: 38Â°C). In a different study, it was revealed that humidity and temperature are linked with an increased risk of nCOVID-19 (Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B187" ref-type="bibr">2020c</xref>). Interestingly, coronaviruses can persist on inanimate surfaces including plastic, glass, or metal for up to 9 days (Kampf et al., 
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).
