<p>As per the recent guidelines from health authorities of China (Adhikari et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; WHO, 
 <xref rid="B197" ref-type="bibr">2020e</xref>), there are 3 major routes of nCOVID-19 transmission including droplets transmission, aerosol transmission, and contact transmission. Transmissions via droplets were found to take place when respiratory droplets of infected individuals are inhaled or ingested by people who are in close contact. Whereas, contact transmission might take place when a person touches a virus-contaminated-object or surface and then that person touches his/her nose, mouth, or eyes. On the other hand, aerosol transmission might take place when respiratory droplets mix into the air, thus forms aerosols and might result in infection when a high dose of aerosols are inhaled into the lungs in a comparatively closed environment (Adhikari et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; WHO, 
 <xref rid="B197" ref-type="bibr">2020e</xref>). In a study, it was revealed that the digestive system is also a possible route for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Symptoms like diarrhea and abdominal discomfort have been observed in individuals with confirmed nCOVID-19, this observation led to studies which revealed that ACE2 (to which SARS-CoV-2 binds) is highly expressed in enterocytes of colon and ileum (Zhang et al.,
