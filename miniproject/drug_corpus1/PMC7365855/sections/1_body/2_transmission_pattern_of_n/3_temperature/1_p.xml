<p>The effect of temperature on the health of humans can be varied depending on the countries or even areas (Hajat and Kosatky, 
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In line with this aforesaid finding, it was also reported that temperature can affect the transmission of respiratory syndromes-causing viruses including SARS-CoV-2 (Ma et al., 
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) and influenza virus (Park et al., 
 <xref rid="B140" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Studies have also revealed that novel coronavirus and influenza virus can survive only in some specific environmental conditions and their transmissions also depend on temperatures (Chan et al., 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Jaakkola et al., 
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), which is also applicable for SARS-CoV-2 transmission (Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B187" ref-type="bibr">2020c</xref>). It was observed in case of influenza virus that it can transmit more readily at lower temperatures (Lowen and Steel, 
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), since host immunity is likely to remain weakened in cold weather, this can further increase the vulnerability toward infection (Kudo et al., 
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). As the transmission process of coronaviruses is comparable with the influenza virus transmission (Lin et al., 
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), thus it can be expected that these processes are also applicable for the SARS-CoV-2 transmission (Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B187" ref-type="bibr">2020c</xref>).
