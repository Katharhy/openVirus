<p>In order to form a physical barrier, the WHO has recommended the use of a face mask by those individuals who are showing respiratory symptoms (WHO, 
 <xref rid="B194" ref-type="bibr">2020b</xref>). However, healthy people are not required to use face masks. A typical surgical mask only provides one-way protection and can avert the spreading of droplets during coughing and sneezing to the surrounding areas. Healthcare professionals who are treating or in contact with a suspected or confirmed nCOVID-19 patient must need to wear a specialized respirator (for example N95 or its equivalent) to effectively prevent the droplets entry and thus can reduce the chance of acquiring the infection (Bae et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; WHO, 
 <xref rid="B194" ref-type="bibr">2020b</xref>). Strict precautionary measures must need to be taken by the individuals during handling affected individual's body secretions including sputum, urine, or stools (Yeo et al., 
 <xref rid="B210" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).
