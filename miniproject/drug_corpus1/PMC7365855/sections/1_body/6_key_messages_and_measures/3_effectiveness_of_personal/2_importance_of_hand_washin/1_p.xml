<p>Indeed, the significance of maintaining frequent and proper hand hygiene is paramount. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has a lipid envelope, thus proper hand-washing with soap can break apart that lipid envelope and therefore can make it difficult or even impossible for the virus to infect humans.

This finding indicates that there is a poor understanding of the significance of proper hand-washing among the general people. Therefore, awareness among people should be increased about the importance of frequent and proper hand-washing.
