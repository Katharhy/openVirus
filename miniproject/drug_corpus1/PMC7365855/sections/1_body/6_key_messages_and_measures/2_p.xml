<p>As like SARS and MERS, nCOVID-19 is also found to spread through the airborne route. Therefore, surgical face masks might be beneficial to prevent sneeze and cough-related larger fluid droplets, however they are less likely to prevent small airborne contaminants (Yee et al., 
 <xref rid="B209" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). In this regard, respirators containing air filters and adequate seal should be more beneficial (Tran et al., 
 <xref rid="B179" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Smith et al., 
 <xref rid="B171" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In healthcare settings, right use of respirators and personal protective equipment and proper hand hygiene are likely to prevent transmission (Cowling et al., 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Radonovich et al., 
 <xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Yee et al., 
 <xref rid="B209" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). If a patient requires hospital admission and there is no private or separate room for that patient, then that patient needs to be taken to an adequate facility containing institution. Isolated rooms and care provide would need to be customized in a way that reduces the exposure of healthcare providers to the patient. Indeed, along with an eye shield, all the healthcare providers must take measures to prevent contact with droplets and to maintain airborne precautions. Since the risk of transmission is much higher during the aerosol-generating procedures (such as intubation), in these cases the importance of PPE is enormous (Raboud et al., 
 <xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; CDC, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2020a</xref>). Still, it remains not known, regarding how long nCOVID-19 can stay airborne following a patient leaves the room. Respiratory protection is essential to enter into the vacated room.
