<p>This severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can be transmitted largely via droplets and due to the close contact. It has been found that elderly people and individuals with chronic diseases or comorbidities are particularly high-risk populations (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">2020a</xref>). There are various symptoms of nCOVID-19 including cough (68%), fever (88%), diarrhea (3.7%), and vomiting (5%) (Mungroo et al., 
 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The mode of transmission of SARSCoV-2 is supposed to take place from human to human through respiratory secretions released by the infected people when sneezing and coughing (Mungroo et al., 
 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). nCOVID-19 patients can be asymptomatic, which is making the control of the transmission more difficult (Gao et al., 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Li et al., 
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">2020a</xref>). Since February of 2020, strict infection control approaches were executed by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in order to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2. In a recent study, To et al. (
 <xref rid="B178" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) mentioned that nCOVID-19 patients had the highest viral load (measured in saliva samples) near presentation. They also summarized that as viral load is quite high during the time of hospital admissions, use of potent antiviral agents at an early stage might prove beneficial in managing the severity of nCOVID-19 infection (To et al., 
 <xref rid="B178" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).
