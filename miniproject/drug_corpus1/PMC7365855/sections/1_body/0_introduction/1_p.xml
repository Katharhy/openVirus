<p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the large family of positive-sense, enveloped, highly diverse, and single-stranded RNA viruses (Fehr and Perlman,

 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Zumla et al., 
 <xref rid="B221" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Former epidemics of CoVs include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, these outbreaks caused severe health problems in humans (Raoult et al.,

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Lu et al., 
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). It was assumed by the earlier reports that the onset of a potential CoV epidemic provided the estimation of a reproduction number for the 2019 novel coronavirus (nCOVID-19, named by World Health Organization (WHO) on Feb 11, 2020) which was thought to be considerably &gt;1 (ranges from 2.24â€“3.58) (Zhao et al.,
