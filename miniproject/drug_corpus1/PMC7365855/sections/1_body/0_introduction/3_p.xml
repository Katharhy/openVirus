<p>Previously, SARS was found to be partially linked with environmental factors (Lin et al., 
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). In a study, it was revealed that air pollution was linked with mortality in SARS patients in China (Cui et al., 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). In this regard, it was mentioned that lung functions can be compromised owing to long- or short-term exposure to certain environmental pollutants (Cui et al., 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Air temperature is another factor that is also needed to be considered. It has been revealed by Lin et al. (
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) that the occurrence of SARS was much higher (18 times) at lower air temperatures as compared to higher temperatures. Researchers also showed that respiratory disorders are more likely to take place in colder environments since virulence of agents are likely to deteriorate at higher air temperatures because they might not endure the alterations in the environment (D'Amato et al., 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). In addition to this, they also summarized that SARS-CoV's transmissibility is comparable with the transmissibility of influenza virus. Moreover, the occurrence of influenza markedly elevates with high relative humidity and low temperatures (Park et al., 
 <xref rid="B140" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), which is further suggesting that viral transmission can be significantly affected by environmental factors.
