<p>Various strategies are used by viruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to evade immune responses for their better survival in host cells. The pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) can identify the evolutionarily conserved microbial structures called pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Nonetheless, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV can stimulate the generation of double-membrane vesicles lacking PRRs and subsequently can replicate in these vesicles, thus evading the host detection of their double-strand RNA (dsRNA) (Snijder et al., 
 <xref rid="B172" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). IFN-I (IFN-β and IFN-α) plays a protective function on MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection, however the IFN-I mechanism is suppressed in infected mouse models (Channappanavar et al.,

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Interestingly, by directly interacting with the dsRNA, MERS-CoV's accessory protein 4a might block the stimulation of IFN at the level of melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 activation (Niemeyer et al., 
 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). IFN β promoter activation and transportation of IFN regulatory factor 3 to the nucleus can be inhibited by the ORF5, ORF4b, ORF4a, and membrane proteins of MERS-CoV (Yang et al., 
 <xref rid="B207" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 can also affect the AP. In this regard, for instance, gene expression associated with AP is downregulated following MERS-CoV infection (Menachery et al., 
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Therefore, it is vital to terminate the immune evasion of coronavirus to develop specific and effective therapies.
