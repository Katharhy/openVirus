<p>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is considered as the major cause of nCOVID-19-related death. In the early stages of the epidemic, 6 out of the 41 admitted patients with confirmed nCOVID-19 died owing to ARDS (Huang et al., 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). This ARDS is found to be the main immunopathological characteristic of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 infections (Xu et al., 
 <xref rid="B203" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Cytokine storm is the major characteristic of ARDS. This storm is a fatal uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response that takes place because of the high secretions of chemokines (i.e., C-X-C motif chemokine 10 [CXCL10], CXCL9, CXCL8, C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 [CCL5], CCL3, CCL2, etc.) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., transforming growth factor-β [TGFβ], tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNFα], interleukin 33 [IL-33], IL-18, IL-12, interferon gamma [IFNγ], IL-6, IL-1β, IFN-α, etc.) via immune effector cells in case of SARS-CoV infection (Cameron et al.,

 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Huang et al., 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. Like SARS-CoV, MERS patients showed increased levels of CXCL-10, CXCL8, CCL5, IFN-α, and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in serum as compared to individuals with the mild to moderate disease (Min et al., 
 <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In the human body, a powerful cytokine storm will induce an aggressive attack by the immune system, which will lead to multiple organ failure and ARDS, and will ultimately result in death in severe novel coronavirus infection, as like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection (Xu et al., 
 <xref rid="B203" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).
