<p>Spike protein (S protein) of coronavirus determines the viral entry into the host cells (de Wit et al., 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Interestingly, the envelope spike glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for SARS-CoV (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">2003b</xref>) and SARS-CoV-2 (Wu et al., 
 <xref rid="B201" ref-type="bibr">2020b</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 for MERS-CoV (Raj et al., 
 <xref rid="B152" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), and CD209L for SARS-CoV [26]. Although it was initially identified that SARS-CoV enters into cells by direct fusion of plasma membrane and virus (Simmons et al., 
 <xref rid="B168" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). However, Belouzard et al. (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) revealed that a vital proteolytic cleavage process takes place at SARS-CoV S protein at position (S2â€²) that facilitated the membrane fusion and infectivity of the virus. For membrane fusion, MERS-CoV also has evolved an aberrant 2 steps furin activation (Mille and Whittaker, 
 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Other than membrane fusion, entry of SARS-CoV was also found to be mediated by the clathrin-independent and -dependent endocytosis (Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B185" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Kuba et al., 
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Following the entry of virus into the cells, RNA genome of SARS-CoV is released into the cytoplasm and is translated into 2 polyproteins and structural proteins, subsequently the viral genome starts to replicate (Perlman and Netland, 
 <xref rid="B143" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The newly generated envelope glycoproteins are then inserted into the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus, and the nucleocapsid is generated by the combination of nucleocapsid protein and genomic RNA. Subsequently, viral particles begin to germinate into the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment. Finally, virus particles containing vesicles then form fusion with the plasma membrane in order to release the virus (de Wit et al., 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).
