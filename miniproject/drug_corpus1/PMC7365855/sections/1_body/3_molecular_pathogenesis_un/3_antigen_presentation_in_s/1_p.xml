<p>When the SARS-CoV-2 enters into the cells, its antigen will be presented to the antigen presentation cells (APCs) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), this process is crucial for the anti-viral immunity of the human body (Kumar et al., 
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Peptides of antigens are presented via major histocompatibility complex (MHC; or human leukocyte antigen (HLA) in humans) and then identified by virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Therefore, the understanding of antigen presentation (AP) of the virus will provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of nCOVID-19. However, not much information is available regarding this, thus we can obtain information from previous studies on MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. AP of SARS-CoV-2 mostly relies on MHC I molecules (Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), nonetheless MHC II also plays roles in its presentation. Former studies revealed that many HLA polymorphisms associate with the susceptibility of SARS-CoV, for instance HLA-Cw*0801 (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2006b</xref>), HLA-B*0703, HLA-DR B1*1202, and HLA-B*4601 (Keicho et al., 
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), while HLA-A*0201, HLA-DR0301, and HLA-Cw1502 alleles are associated with the protection from SARS infection (Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B188" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In case of MERS-CoV, it was observed that MHC II molecules (for example HLA-DQB1*02:0 and HLA-DRB1*11:01) were linked with the susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection (Hajeer et al., 
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Other than mannose-binding lectin gene polymorphisms linked with AP are associated with the risk of SARS-CoV infection (Tu et al., 
 <xref rid="B180" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Indeed, the aforementioned findings will give us an important idea regarding the mechanism, prevention, and treatment of nCOVID-19.
