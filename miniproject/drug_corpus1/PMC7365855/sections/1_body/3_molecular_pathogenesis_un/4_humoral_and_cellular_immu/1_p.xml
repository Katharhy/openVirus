<p>AP subsequently induces the human body's humoral and cellular immune responses, which are then facilitated via virus-specific B and T cells. Like other common acute viral infections, antibodies including IgG and IgM are produced against SARS-CoV virus. It is estimated that at the end of week 12, SARS-specific IgM antibodies disappear. Whereas, SARS-specific IgG antibody can stay for a longer period, which is suggesting that IgG mainly has a protective function (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">2003a</xref>). Furthermore, it was also found that SARS-specific IgG antibodies mainly are N-specific and S-specific antibodies (de Wit et al., 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Most of the studies have focused on cellular immune responses, as compared to the humoral immune responses in case of coronavirus. Recent findings have revealed that the levels of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> and CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in the peripheral blood of nCOVID-19 individuals were significantly decreased, as confirmed by increased percentages of CD38 (CD8 39.4%) and HLA-DR (CD4 3.47%) double-positive fractions (Xu et al., 
 <xref rid="B203" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Likewise, acute phase response in individuals with nCOVID-19 is linked with a marked decrease of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T and CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells. Interestingly, it was found that although there is no presence of antigen, CD8
 <sup>+</sup>, and CD4
 <sup>+</sup> memory T cells can last for 4 years in individuals who have recovered from SARS-CoV and can perform IFN-Î³ generation, delayed-type hypersensitivity response and T cell proliferation (Fan et al., 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). After 6 years of infection with SARS-CoV, specific T-cell memory responses to the SARS-CoV S peptide library can still be identified in 14 of 23 recovered SARS individuals (Tang et al., 
 <xref rid="B175" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In mouse models, specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells also exhibited similar activity in the clearance of MERS-CoV (Zhao et al., 
 <xref rid="B216" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Indeed, these results might be useful in the rational designing of an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
