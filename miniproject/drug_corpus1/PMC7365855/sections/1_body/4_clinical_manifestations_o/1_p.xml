<p>Following an incubation period of around 5.2 days, the symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection appear (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">2020b</xref>). It takes around 6 to 41 days from the first appearance of the symptoms to death, along with a median of 14 days (Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B189" ref-type="bibr">2020d</xref>). However, the aforesaid durations depend on various factors including the patient's age and status of the immune system. This duration was found to be shorter for individuals older than 70-years old as compared to the individuals who are under the age of 70 (Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B189" ref-type="bibr">2020d</xref>). At the onset of the disease, the most commonly observed symptoms are cough, fatigue, and fever (

 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Huang et al., 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Ren et al., 
 <xref rid="B156" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B189" ref-type="bibr">2020d</xref>). Pneumonia has also been identified by computed tomography scan in nCOVID-19 patients, Unfortunately, various aberrant clinical features including ground-glass opacity (GGO), acute cardiac injury, and ARDS led to death (Huang et al., 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Occasionally, in subpleural areas of both lungs, the multiple peripheral GGOs were detected (Lei et al., 
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) and these triggered both localized and systemic immune responses, which collectively raised the level of inflammation. Unfortunately, treatment with interferon inhalation did not result in any clinical benefit, rather it aggravated the condition via facilitating pulmonary opacities (Lei et al., 
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).
