<p>Recently, it has been observed that nCOVID-19 might predispose to both arterial and venous thromboembolic disease because of immobilization, hypoxia, inflammation, and diffuse intravascular coagulation (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2020b</xref>; Guan et al., 
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Klok et al., 
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B184" ref-type="bibr">2020a</xref>; Zhou et al., 
 <xref rid="B218" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Furthermore, it was also revealed that respiratory failure in the disease is not only driven by the ARDS, rather microvascular thrombotic activities might also contribute in this regard (Grillet et al., 
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Therefore, Klok et al. (
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) have strongly suggested to administer pharmacological agents in a prophylactic manner to all the intensive care unit (ICU) nCOVID-19 patients.
