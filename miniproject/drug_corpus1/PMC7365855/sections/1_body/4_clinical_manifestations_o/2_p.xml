<p>Indeed, some of the symptoms of nCOVID-19 are similar to the earlier betacoronavirus including dyspnea, dry cough, fever, and bilateral GGOs (Huang et al., 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Nonetheless, there are some unique clinical manifestations of nCOVID-19 such as sore throat, sneezing, rhinorrhea (Lee et al., 
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Assiri et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). As revealed by chest radiographs following admission, in some cases it was observed that an infiltrate in lung's upper lobe is linked with growing dyspnea with hypoxemia (Phan et al., 
 <xref rid="B144" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Although nCOVID-19 exhibited digestive disorders like diarrhea, only a small proportion of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV showed similar gastrointestinal symptoms. Thus, testing urine and fecal samples are important to eliminate a possible alternative mode of transmission (Lee et al., 
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Assiri et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Henceforth, developing methods to detect different routes of transmission for example urine and fecal samples are immediately required to develop ways to suppress and/or minimize the transmission and also to discover therapies to treat nCOVID-19.
