<p>Previously, convalescent plasma therapy was used as a terminal therapy to increase the survival rate of individuals with a range of viral infections including SARS, severe infection caused by Ebola virus, pandemic 2009 influenza A H1N1, H5N1 avian influenza (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2020a</xref>; Shen et al., 
 <xref rid="B165" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Convalescent plasma therapy can be effective because viremia can be suppressed due to the presence of plasma immunoglobulin antibodies in recovering patients. In a study, Shen et al. (

In that study, convalescent plasma was transfused in those patients with a novel coronavirus-specific antibody (neutralization titer &gt;40 and binding titer &gt; 1:1000). The used convalescent plasma of that study was obtained from five nCOVID-19-recovered individuals. The obtained convalescent plasma was then administered to the 5 patients (in between 10 and 22 days following admission) along with methylprednisolone and antiviral drugs. After convalescent plasma transfusion, clinical conditions of the patients were found to be improved, including decreased viral loads (patients became nCOVID-19 negative within 12 days), elevated level of SARS-CoV-2-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), neutralizing antibody titers, normalized body temperature (within 3 days in four/five patients), improved ARDS (four patients at 12 days following transfusion), successful weaning from mechanical ventilation (three participating individuals within 2 weeks of therapy), increased partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen, and reduced score in sequential organ failure assessment. Out of the 5 participants, 2 of them were in stable condition (at 37 days following transfusions), while 3 of them were discharged from the hospital (following 51, 53, and 55 days of staying in the hospital) (Shen et al., 
 <xref rid="B165" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Finally, the researchers summarized that although there were a small number of participants in this study, they suggested the therapy with convalescent plasma can be effective in the nCOVID-19 treatment (Shen et al.,
