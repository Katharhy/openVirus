<p>Many 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses showed that S protein of SARS-CoV is crucial to mediate the viral entry into the host cells. In addition to this, the cleavage and subsequent activation of the S protein of SARS-CoV via a host cell's protease is vital for the entry of the virus (Glowacka et al., 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In cell cultures, it has been noticed that transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is a vital protease of host cells that causes activation of S protein of SARS-CoV, therefore it was studied as an important target for antiviral drugs (Sheahan et al., 
 <xref rid="B164" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Previously, camostat mesylate (an inhibitor of serine protease) showed inhibitory activity against TMPRSS2 (Kawase et al., 
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Furthermore, K11777 (a cysteine protease inhibitor) exhibited significant inhibitory activity (at submicromolar range) against replication of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV (Zhou et al., 
 <xref rid="B220" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Sarilumab is a human monoclonal antibody and 3 clinical trials are ongoing to assess the safety and efficacy of this antibody (alone or along with other standard therapies) in nearly 1,500 COVID-19 patients (ClinicalTrials.gov,
