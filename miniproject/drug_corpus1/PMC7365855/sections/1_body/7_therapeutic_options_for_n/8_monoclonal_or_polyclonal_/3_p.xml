<p>Eculizumab (a monoclonal antibody) is approved to treat neuromyelitis spectrum disorders, refractory generalized myasthenia gravis, and atypical hemolytic uraemic syndrome. This monoclonal antibody inhibits the terminal portion of the inflammatory response-associated complement cascade. Although the function of the complement cascade in nCOVID-19 pathogenesis is not clear, numerous studies revealed that its suppression may effectively function as a therapeutic technique (Ip et al.,

Currently, emapalumab (a monoclonal antibody) is being studied in an open-label, randomized, phase II/III study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this antibody in decreasing respiratory distress and hyper-inflammation in nCOVID-19 patients (ClinicalTrials.gov,
