<p>In a COVID-19 mouse model, when remdesivir was administered prophylactically and as early therapeutic intervention, it significantly decreased the pulmonary viral load, which ultimately reduced the progression of the disease and significantly improved respiration (Sheahan et al., 
 <xref rid="B164" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). In tissue culture models, Brown et al. (Brown et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) revealed that remdesivir showed half-maximal effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) of 0.074 mM and 0.069 mM for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, successively (Brown et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Furthermore, remdesivir (within the submicromolar EC50s) also effectively inhibited zoonotic CoV and human CoVs (HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43) (Brown et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Ko et al., 
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Similar results were also observed when remdesivir was administered therapeutically (12 h post-inoculation) and prophylactically (24 h before prior inoculation) in MERS animal (rhesus macaque) model (de Wit et al., 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Even 2 amino acid substitutions (V553L and F476L) in the non-structural protein 12 polymerase were found to show lower-level of resistance toward remdesivir (Agostini et al., 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).
