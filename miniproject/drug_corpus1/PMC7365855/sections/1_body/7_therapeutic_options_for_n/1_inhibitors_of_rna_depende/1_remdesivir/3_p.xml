<p>In humans, pharmacokinetic data of remdesivir is not available. However, it has been revealed in rhesus monkeys that intravenous remdesivir administration at the dose of 10 mg/kg increased the intracellular concentration (over 10 mM) of active triphosphate form in peripheral blood mononuclear cells for a minimum of 24 h, (Warren et al., 
 <xref rid="B191" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) which is indicating its clinical significance in nCOVID-19 treatment. Furthermore, human safety data of remdesivir are available online (Mulangu et al., 
 <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). In USA, the first patient with confirmed nCOVID-19 was effectively treated with remdesivir for the advancement of pneumonia on 7th day of hospital admission in January, 2020 (Holshue et al., 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Moreover, to assess its efficacy and safety to treat individuals with confirmed nCOVID-19, phase III clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2020e</xref>) have been started in March 2020. In that study, individuals received 200 mg of remdesivir on first day, subsequently received 100 mg/day. Although remdesivir showed promising

 <xref rid="B164" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Holshue et al., 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), recently it has been reported that there are some uncertainties because of its multiple adverse effects including hepatotoxicity, rectal hemorrhage (Jean et al.,
