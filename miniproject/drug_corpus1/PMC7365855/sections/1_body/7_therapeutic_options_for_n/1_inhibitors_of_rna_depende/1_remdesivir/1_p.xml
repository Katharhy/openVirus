<p>Out of all the investigational drugs, remdesivir (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) has appeared as the most effective and promising antiviral drug (Li and De Clercq, 
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). This antiviral drug targets RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the virus while escaping proofreading via viral exoribonuclease, (Agostini et al., 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) which can ultimately lead to early termination of viral RNA transcription as given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>. Interestingly, remdesivir is a phosphoramidate prodrug and has a wide range of activities against numerous virus families, such as pneumoviridae, paramyxoviridae, filoviridae, and orthocoronavirinae (for example pathogenic MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV) (Sheahan et al., 
 <xref rid="B164" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Martinez, 
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).
