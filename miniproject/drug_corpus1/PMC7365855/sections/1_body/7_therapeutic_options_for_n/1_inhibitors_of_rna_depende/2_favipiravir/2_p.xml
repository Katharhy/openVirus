To treat influenza, favipiravir's recommended oral dose is 1,600 mg two times on first day, subsequently 600 mg twice/day from day 2 to 5, and 600 mg once/day on the sixth day.

Furthermore, in China, randomized controlled trials involving nCOVID-19 patients are also assessing the efficacy of favipiravir plus baloxavir marboxil (an antiviral drug) (Qiu et al.,
