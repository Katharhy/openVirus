<p>Chloroquine (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) is mainly used as an antimalarial drug. Furthermore, chloroquine is also used to treat various autoimmune disorders including rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus. In an animal model, it has recently been observed that chloroquine can also play a role as a potent antiviral drug against various viruses including influenza H5N1 (Yan et al., 
 <xref rid="B204" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Interestingly, chloroquine can prevent the viral fusion with the cell membrane of host cell by increasing endosomal pH (

 <xref rid="B182" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B186" ref-type="bibr">2020b</xref>). Even though findings from 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies regarding chloroquine is auspicious (EC
 <sub>90</sub> = 6.90 mM, used nCOVID-19-infected Vero E6 cells), however use of chloroquine to treat nCOVID-19 infection is a completely off-label use. Furthermore, this drug is not strongly indicated due to some of its safety reasons including QT prolongation with ventricular dysrhythmia and adverse reactions on the renal, hepatic, and hematologic systems (Cortegiani et al.,
