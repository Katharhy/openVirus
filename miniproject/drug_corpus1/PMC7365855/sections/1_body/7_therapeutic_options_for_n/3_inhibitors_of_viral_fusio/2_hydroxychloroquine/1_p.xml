<p>Hydroxychloroquine (a chloroquine derivative, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) is also mainly used as antimalarial and anti-inflammatory drugs (Sinha and Balayla, 
 <xref rid="B169" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). It has been proposed that hydroxychloroquine controls cytokine storm (

 <xref rid="B208" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). As compared to chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine is more potent and their EC
 <sub>50</sub> values are 5.47 and 0.72, successively. In addition to this, hydroxychloroquine is less likely to interact with other drugs as compared to chloroquine. Moreover, in comparison with chloroquine phosphate, pharmacokinetic data confirmed that hydroxychloroquine is much more effective (5 days before) at inhibiting SARS-CoV-2

 <xref rid="B208" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). It has been declared on March 26, 2020 by Taiwan CDC that hydroxychloroquine has a significant role in the treatment of nCOVID-19 patients. However, treatment with hydroxychloroquine is contraindicated for the patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, allergic to hydroxychloroquine, glucose-6-phosphatase deficient, and for individuals with prolonged QT interval in electrocardiograms and retinopathy (Gautret et al.,
