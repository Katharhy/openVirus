<p>Umifenovir (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) is a potent antiviral agent that has a wide-range of activities against various viruses including HCV, influenza A and B viruses (Boriskin et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Umifenovir's mechanism slightly varies with different viruses. It has been revealed that umifenovir suppresses the fusion of the virus with the host cell membrane (

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).
