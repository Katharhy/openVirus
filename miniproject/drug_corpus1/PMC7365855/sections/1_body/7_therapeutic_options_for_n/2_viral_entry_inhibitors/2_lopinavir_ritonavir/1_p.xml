<p>In a clinical trial, it has recently been observed that lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) protease inhibitors that are mainly used in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment did not significantly improve the nCOVID-19 symptoms (Cao et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Furthermore, in a different study, effect of umifenovir plus LPV/r was compared with the sole treatment with LPV/r to treat nCOVID-19 (Deng et al., 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The findings of that study revealed that better effects were observed with the treatment of umifenovir plus LPV/r in comparison with the sole LPV/r treatment (Deng et al., 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). However, more studies are required to evaluate the incidence of resistance and efficacy. As coronavirus becomes activated on the membrane of the host cell, thus combination of LPV/r and umifenovir are likely to inhibit/prevent the viral entry into the host cell (
