<p>The occurrence of co-infection can widely vary among the patients with confirmed nCOVID-19. Various reports suggest that several co-pathogens including viruses (such as rhinovirus, influenza, and HIV) and bacteria (for example 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species, 
 <italic>Mycoplasma pneumonia</italic>) can co-exist in these patients. Among them, influenza A virus was most commonly found to co-exist (Jean et al., 
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">2020b</xref>). Furthermore, nCOVID-19 patients with pneumonia were found to be commonly treated by the coadministration of anti-influenza drugs and antibiotics (Jean et al., 
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">2020b</xref>). Therefore, careful selection of potential broad-spectrum antibiotic(s) is required for the long-stay (over 6 days) hospitalized patients (Chou et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Jean et al., 
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">2020a</xref>).
