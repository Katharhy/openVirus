<p>Vitamin C plays a significant role as an enzymatic cofactor in numerous physiological reactions including immune potentiation, collagen synthesis, and hormone generation (Kim et al., 
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In mouse models, it was revealed that vitamin C plays important role in the antiviral immune responses against the influenza A virus (H3N2) via the elevated generation of IFN-α/β, particularly at the early stages of infection (Kim et al., 
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Nonetheless, no significant benefit has been observed in using mega-dose of vitamin C as a prophylactic measure to lower the incidence of common cold caused by viral infections (Hemilä and Chalker,
