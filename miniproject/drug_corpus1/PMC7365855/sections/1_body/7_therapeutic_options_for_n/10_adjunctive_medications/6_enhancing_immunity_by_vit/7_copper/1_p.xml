<p>Copper (another essential trace element) has a significant contribution in the differentiation and development of immune cells (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). It has also been confirmed that copper exerted 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiviral effects. Intracellular copper was found to regulate the life cycle of influenza virus (Rupp et al., 
 <xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), while thujaplicin-copper chelates inhibited the replication of human influenza viruses (Miyamoto et al., 
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). In a study, Turnlund et al. (
 <xref rid="B181" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) determined the effects of chronic administration of copper on immune response, oxidative stress, and indices of copper status. These researchers observed that when copper was administered at a dose of 7.8 mg/day, copper significantly increased the level of superoxide dismutase, benzylamine oxidase, and plasma ceruloplasmin activity as compared to 1.6 mg/day dose, which further suggesting an enhancement in antioxidant status. Nonetheless, increased copper administration (7.8 mg/day) markedly decreased the proportion of antibody titer, serum IL-2R, and circulating neutrophils against the Beijing strain of influenza (Turnlund et al.,
