<p>Zinc (an essential trace element) contributes significantly in the growth, development, and maintenance of immune responses (Prasad, 
 <xref rid="B147" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Read et al., 
 <xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The deficiency of zinc is linked with an enhanced susceptibility toward infectious diseases, for example, viral infections. An individual's zinc status is a vital factor that can affect the immune response against viral infections. Indeed, zinc-deficient individuals are at greater risk of developing infections including HCV or HIV (Read et al., 
 <xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Acevedo-Murillo et al. (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) reported that there was a noticeable clinical improvement in the 103 children (1 month−5 years) with pneumonia in the zinc-receiving group as compared to placebo (Acevedo-Murillo et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The researchers also confirmed that there was a rise in the cytokine response in Th1 pattern (INF-γ and IL-2) only in the zinc-receiving group, along with Th2 cytokines (IL-10 and IL-4) being increased or remained elevated in both groups. Following stem cell transplantation, oral administration of a high dose of zinc (150 mg/day) increased thymic activity and output of new CD4
 <sup>+</sup> naive T cells, which eventually helped in the prevention of Torque Teno virus reactivation (Iovino et al., 
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Nonetheless, Provinciali et al. (
 <xref rid="B148" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>) summarized that prolonged administration of zinc (400 mg/day) or zinc plus arginine (4 d/day) in the elderly (age 64–100 years) people restored zinc concentrations in plasma, which was ineffective in stimulating or improving the antibody response or number of CD3, CD4, or CD8 lymphocytes following influenza vaccination.
