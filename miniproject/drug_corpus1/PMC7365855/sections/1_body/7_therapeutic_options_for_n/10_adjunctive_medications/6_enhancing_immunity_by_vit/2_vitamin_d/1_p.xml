<p>Vitamin D has a significant contribution in modifying both adaptive and innate immune responses (Aranow, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). It has been revealed by epidemiological studies that there is a link between deficiency of vitamin D and elevated susceptibility to acute viral respiratory infections (Monlezun et al., 
 <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). It has also been suggested that vitamin D significantly modulates the innate immune responses against various viral respiratory infections including RSV, parainfluenza 1 and 2, and influenza A and B (Zdrenghea et al., 
 <xref rid="B213" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Indeed, studies have revealed that there is a strong relationship between vitamin D deficiency and elevated risk of both lower and upper respiratory tract infections (Jolliffe et al., 
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Nonetheless, conflicting and heterogeneity in dosage regimens and baseline vitamin D conditions in study populations were observed in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (Jolliffe et al., 
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In a study, Aglipay et al. (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) observed no significant difference between the action of high-dose (2000 IU per day) vs. standard-dose (400 IU per day) vitamin D supplementation on viral upper respiratory tract infections (Aglipay et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Nevertheless, only one-third of the study subjects received vitamin D at doses below 30 ng/ml. Vitamin D increased the plasma level of TGFβ without ameliorating antibody generation in a RCT on the effect of vitamin D administration on influenza vaccine response in deficient elderly person (Goncalves-Mendes et al., 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). In addition to this, it was also indicated in the latter mentioned RCT that vitamin D administration perhaps directed the polarization of lymphocyte toward a tolerogenic immune response (Goncalves-Mendes et al., 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). In a different RCT, monthly administration of high-dose of vitamin D (100,000 IU/month) decreased the occurrence of acute respiratory infections in older long-term care residents as compared to a standard dose group (12,000 IU/month) (Ginde et al., 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Therefore, it is quite clear that the effect of vitamin D on antiviral immunity against respiratory infections is dependent on an individual's vitamin D status. Moreover, it has been confirmed that vitamin D supplementation is also useful in case of other viral infections, for instance, vitamin D addition to conventional Peg-α-2b/ribavirin therapy for treatment-naive individuals with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection considerably ameliorated the viral response (Abu-Mouch et al., 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), and similar action was also seen in individuals with HCV genotype 2–3 (Nimer and Mouch, 
 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).
