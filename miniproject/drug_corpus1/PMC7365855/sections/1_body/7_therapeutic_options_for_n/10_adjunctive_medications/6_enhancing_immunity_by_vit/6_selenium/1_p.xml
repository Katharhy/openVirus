<p>Selenium (a trace element) also exerts a range of important functions including antioxidant effects, various pleiotropic activities, and anti-inflammatory effects (Rayman, 
 <xref rid="B154" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Selenium deficiency is found to be linked with cognitive impairment, poor immune response, and elevated risk of mortality, whereas an increased level of selenium or treatment with selenium has exhibited antiviral actions (Rayman, 
 <xref rid="B154" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Broome et al. (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) assessed whether an increased selenium administration (50–100 μg/day) ameliorated immune response in adults with a borderline concentration of selenium (Broome et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Treatment with selenium elevated the plasma selenium levels, and also increased the activities of cytosolic glutathione peroxidase and lymphocyte phospholipid. Furthermore, selenium also increased the cellular immune responses (elevated level of IFN-γ and other cytokines), along with an increased level of T-helper cells and earlier peak T-cell proliferation. Nonetheless, it was observed that humoral immune responses were not affected (Broome et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Moreover, selenium treatment in participants also induced rapid poliovirus clearance.
