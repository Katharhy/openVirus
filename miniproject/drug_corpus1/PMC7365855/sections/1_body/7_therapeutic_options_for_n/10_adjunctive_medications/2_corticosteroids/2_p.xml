<p>These findings suggest that use of corticosteroids resulted in inconsistent outcomes. However, corticosteroids might be beneficial for patients with cytokine-linked lung injury and those who might rapidly develop progressive pneumonia (Shang et al., 
 <xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Indeed, healthcare professionals need to carefully assess the risk and benefit ratio of corticosteroid use for each patient. This necessity to assess risk and benefit of corticosteroid use in individual patients and its careful dose consideration has been demonstrated in diagnosis and treatment guidelines from China's National Health Commission. As per that guideline, glucocorticoid (equivalent to methylprednisolone 1-2 mg/kg per day for three-five days or less) may be considered based on chest imaging and respiratory distress. Large-dose of glucocorticoids can suppress the immune system, this can result in delayed SARS-CoV-2 clearance (McCreary and Pogue, 
 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Recently, Chinese Thoracic Society recommended a lower dose of methylprednisolone (≤ 0.5–1 mg/kg per day) for a maximum of 7 days in selected patients, prior to treatment these selected patients should be carefully assessed for potential risks and benefits (Shang et al.,
