<p>Mixed clinical findings were observed with the use of corticosteroids to treat SARS-CoV infections. Although various reports suggested that there was no significant contribution of corticosteroids in clinical outcomes (Stockman et al., 
 <xref rid="B174" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). In contrast, it was suggested by a report that decreased mortality rate was observed due to the use of corticosteroids in critically ill patients (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2006a</xref>; Wu et al., 
 <xref rid="B200" ref-type="bibr">2020a</xref>). Unfortunately, several reports suggested worse outcomes including longer time for viral clearance, or elevated composite endpoint of ICU admission or even death, owing to the use of corticosteroids (Auyeung et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). In a cohort (
 <italic>n</italic> = 309), a longer time in viral clearance was observed in the corticosteroids-receiving MERS-CoV patients (Arabi et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Nevertheless, in the same study, it was observed that there was an insignificant decrease in 90-day mortality in corticosteroids-receiving patients. Recent reports suggested that there was a decreased rate of mortality in nCOVID-19 patients with ARDS due to the use of corticosteroids (Wu et al., 
 <xref rid="B200" ref-type="bibr">2020a</xref>).
