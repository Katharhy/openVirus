<p>In a study, Yang et al. (
 <xref rid="B206" ref-type="bibr">2020b</xref>) mentioned that diabetes and cerebrovascular diseases were the commonly observed comorbidities in the non-survivors of nCOVID-19 in ICUs. Furthermore, Guan et al. (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) also observed similar results in their study and these nCOVID-19 patients received angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) or ACE inhibitors. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV can bind with the ACE2 receptors on the epithelial cells of lung, kidney, and intestine (Fang et al., 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Therefore, when ARDS is not present, ARB or ACE inhibitors can be administered to nCOVID-19 patients. Increased activity of ACE2 was found to be linked with decreased severity of ARDS among individuals with RSV-caused lower respiratory tract infection (WÃ¶sten-van Asperen et al., 
 <xref rid="B199" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Interestingly, Fedson (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) revealed in their study that statins mainly target host response to infection, instead of the virus itself. These researchers also indicated that combination therapy with statins and ARB may induce the reversal of homeostatic processes, which will allow the self-recovery of individuals (Fedson et al., 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).
