<p>Teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic and it has been revealed by Zhou et al. (Zhou et al., 
 <xref rid="B219" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) that teicoplanin exerted inhibitory activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> as low as 330 nm) against replication- and transcription-competent virus-like particles. Studies confirmed that teicoplanin can suppress the entry of MERS and SARS envelope pseudotyped viruses (Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B190" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Zhou et al., 
 <xref rid="B219" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In terms of its mechanism, teicoplanin can selectively suppress the effects of cathepsins B and L in host cell. These proteases are involved with cleaving the viral glycoprotein permitting exposure of the receptor-binding domain of its core genome and then release into the cytoplasm of host cells (Zhou et al., 
 <xref rid="B219" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Baron et al., 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Therefore, teicoplanin blocked the entry of Ebola virus in the late endosomal pathway. Also, the derivatives of teicoplanin including telavancin, dalbavancin, and oritavancin, were also found to block the entry of SARS, MERS, and Ebola viruses (Zhou et al., 
 <xref rid="B219" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Collectively, these findings suggest that teicoplanin and its derivatives might play a vital role in inhibiting the viruses that are dependent on cathepsin L (
