<p>Previously, azithromycin (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> activity against Ebola virus (Madrid et al., 
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). It was found that azithromycin was administered to individuals with viral infection, it prevented severe infections of respiratory tract in pre-school children (Bacharier et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In a recent study, when azithromycin was administered (i.e., 500 mg on first day, then 250 mg per day from day 2-5), it remarkably reinforced the hydroxychloroquine's efficacy (when 200 mg was administered 3 times/day for 10 days) to treat 20 severely ill nCOVID-19 patients (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). The mean serum concentration of hydroxychloroquine was 0.46 Â± 0.20 mg/mL. It is assumed that this excellent virus eliminating activity was achieved owing to the use of the aforesaid combination therapy (Gautret et al., 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Therefore, use of azithromycin along with hydroxychloroquine can be an effective future alternative to remdesivir in nCOVID-19 treatment. However, in this regard, a possible complication related to prolonged QT interval should be taken into consideration.
