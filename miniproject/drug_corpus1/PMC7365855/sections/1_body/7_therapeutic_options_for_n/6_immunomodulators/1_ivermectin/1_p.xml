<p>Ivermectin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) is an antiparasitic agent and it has broad-spectrum of activity (Caly et al., 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), Recent 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have revealed that this drug also has an antiviral effect against dengue and HIV viruses (Wagstaff et al., 
 <xref rid="B183" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). It has been found that the preformed IMPα/β1 heterodimer is accountable for the transport of viral protein into the nucleus and ivermectin can dissociate this heterodimer. Since this transport of viral protein into the nucleus is important for the replication cycle and suppression of the host's antiviral response, thus targeting this viral protein transport might prove as a significant target in the development of therapeutic agents against RNA viruses (Caly et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Yang et al., 
 <xref rid="B205" ref-type="bibr">2020a</xref>). Following 48 h of nCOVID-19 infection, a recent 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study has been demonstrated that ivermectin can decrease the level of viral RNA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) up to 5,000-times (Caly et al., 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Since ivermectin has an established safety profile as an antiparasitic agent, thus now it is needed to establish a safe and effective dose of this drug in clinical trials to treat nCOVID-19 infection.
