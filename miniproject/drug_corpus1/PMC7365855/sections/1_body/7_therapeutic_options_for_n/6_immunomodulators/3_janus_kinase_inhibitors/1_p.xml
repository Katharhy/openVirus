<p>Baricitinib most commonly used in rheumatoid arthritis treatment. This drug is a reversible and selective inhibitor of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and JAK2. It has been found that these latter mentioned enzymes transduce intracellular signals for growth factors and cytokines associated with immune response, inflammation, and haematopoiesis. Moreover, this JAK inhibitor blocks the activities of AP2-associated with protein kinase 1, which ultimately prevents viral binding with the alveolar epithelium (Mayence and Vanden Eynde,
