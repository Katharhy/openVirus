<p>Nitazoxanide (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) is an effective antiparasitic and antiviral drug (Rossignol, 
 <xref rid="B158" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). This drug has a broad-spectrum 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiviral activity against a range of viruses including RSV, rotavirus, parainfluenza, influenza, and coronavirus (Rossignol, 
 <xref rid="B158" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In Vero-E6 cells, nitazoxanide exerted a potent 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiviral activity against SARS CoV-2 (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.12 μM, at 48 h) (Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B186" ref-type="bibr">2020b</xref>). Furthermore, this strong antiviral effect is in line with the observed EC
 <sub>50</sub> values for nitazoxanide (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.92 μM) and tizoxanide (an active metabolite of nitazoxanide) (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.83 μM) against MERS-CoV in LLC-MK2 cells (Rossignol, 
 <xref rid="B158" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In terms of its mechanism of action, it is believed that nitazoxanide has potent antiviral effect because of its ability to interfere with the host-regulated pathways associated with viral replication instead of the virus-specific pathways (Rossignol, 
 <xref rid="B158" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Therefore, studies were carried out to evaluate the ability of this drug to treat influenza and other related acute respiratory infections. In the phase IIb/III of a clinical trial, positive effects of nitazoxanide were observed in the management of influenza symptoms, where 600 mg of nitazoxanide was orally administered twice a day (Haffizulla et al., 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Unfortunately, in phase II clinical trial it was observed that nitazoxanide neither alleviated the symptoms nor decrease the length of stay in hospitals of individuals infected with respiratory viruses (Gamiño-Arroyo et al., 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). However, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> data regarding the activity of nitazoxanide against coronavirus is promising. Therefore, further studies are required to estimate its potential in nCOVID-19 treatment.
