<p>In order to manage the current nCOVID-19 outbreak, extensive measures are needed to be taken to lower the person-to-person transmission of the virus. In addition to this, special efforts and attention are required to reduce or protect the susceptible populations such as elderly people, health care providers, and children. More studies are also essential to understand the mechanisms related to nCOVID-19 pathogenesis. This better understanding will help the development of specific and effective therapies against SARS-CoV-2. Since the respiratory tract is mainly affected by SARS-CoV-2, thus special consideration is required to deliver the drug into the respiratory tract. More studies in animals and clinical trials on drug repositioning can also be considered to identify potential drugs to treat nCOVID-19.</p>
