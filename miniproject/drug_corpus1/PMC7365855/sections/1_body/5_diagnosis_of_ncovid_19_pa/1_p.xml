<p>For any given emergency department (ED) visiting patients with the symptoms of fever and respiratory diseases, healthcare workers must need to get a travel history in detail from that patient. If a patient shows flu-like symptoms and has a travel history to a country or area with confirmed nCOVID-19 cases or if the patient came into close contact with a confirmed nCOVID-19 patient in the last 14 days then the patient ought to be considered as a patient under investigation (PUI) (NPR, 
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). It needs to be noted that here close contact means any individual who was within six feet of an individual with confirmed nCOVID-19 for an extended period. Furthermore, any individual who came into direct contact with the secretions of any nCOVID-19 patient will also be considered as a close contact.
