<p>Furthermore, it was also observed from the nucleotide sequence alignment that there were 93 missense mutations in the entire genomes of novel coronavirus (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Except for the envelope protein, 42 mutations were detected in all of the main structural and non-structural proteins. Whereas, 4 missense mutations were observed in the nucleocapsid protein, 1 in the matrix protein, 29 in the ORF1ab polyprotein, and 8 in the spike surface glycoprotein. Interestingly 3 mutations (i.e., Phe
 <sup>367</sup>, Tyr
 <sup>364</sup>, and Asp
 <sup>354</sup>) were found in the spike surface glycoprotein receptor-binding domain. Indeed, spike surface glycoprotein contributes significantly in binding to receptors on the host cell and eventually regulates host tropism (Fung and Liu, 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Furthermore, this spike glycoprotein is the main target of neutralizing antibodies (Yu et al., 
 <xref rid="B211" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Conformational changes of spike glycoprotein can be induced by the mutations, which can lead to altered antigenicity. Up until now, no study has identified the amino acids that are involved in conformational alterations of spike glycoprotein. Therefore, further studies are required to identify these important amino acids.
