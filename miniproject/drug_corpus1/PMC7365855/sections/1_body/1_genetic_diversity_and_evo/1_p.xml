<p>In nature, nucleotide substitution is considered as a vital step for viral evolution (Lauring and Andino, 
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The rapid spreading of SARS-CoV-2 raised a suspicion that mutations are driving its evolution. In a recent study, from GISAID, Phan (
 <xref rid="B145" ref-type="bibr">2020a</xref>) collected 86 complete or near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes to estimate its genetic variation. In addition to this, these strains of SARS-CoV-2 were identified in patients with confirmed nCOVID-19 from USA (11), China (50), Japan (5), Australia (5), England (2), Singapore (3), France (4), Germany (1), Belgium (1), South Korea (1), Vietnam (1), and Taiwan (2). ClustalX2 was used to align the pair-wise nucleotide sequence (Saitou and Nei, 
 <xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>). As a reference genome, the sequence of the strain “China/WHU01/2020/EPI_ISL_406716” was used. Interestingly, similar to other beta coronaviruses, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 contains a long ORF1ab polyprotein at the 5′ end, followed by 4 main structural proteins, such as nucleocapsid protein, matrix protein, small envelope protein, and spike surface glycoprotein (Phan, 
 <xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr">2020b</xref>). In addition to this, it was also observed that there were 3 deletions in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from Australia (Victoria), USA (Wisconsin), and Japan (Aichi). In contrast, 1 deletion (10 nucleotides) was found in the 3′ end of the genome, while 2 deletions (2 nucleotides and 24 nucleotides) were found in the ORF1ab polyprotein.
