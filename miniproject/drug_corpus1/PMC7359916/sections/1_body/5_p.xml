<p id="Par6">A mild rebounding effect that started demonstrating in early April does not seem to be sufficiently strong to catch up on the backlog of tests accumulated during the two slow months. To mitigate longer-term consequences, healthcare providers should take several steps, including resuming primary care services as soon as it is safe and practical, identifying population-based registries of patients with gaps in care, specifically targeting the gaps resulting from COVID-19-related deferrals, and creating options and ensuring insurance coverage for non-traditional lab collection options, such as neighborhood pharmacy, other specimen collection centers, or home testing kits. Practices need to emphasize the importance of ongoing prevention screening, monitoring, and treatment to patients who may continue to be fearful about returning to healthcare facilities. In the longer term, such strategies could be used to expand the capacity for screening or prevention to levels greater than during the pre-COVID-19 baseline.</p>
