<p id="Par5">The dramatic decline in preventive screening and monitoring for the 2 chronic diseases which occurred in February and March is concerning. It adds to a growing narrative about care delays during the COVID-19 pandemic, including acute care for patients with stroke or myocardial infarction, as well as cancer treatment and childhood vaccinations.

 </sup> Preventive services, routine monitoring, and treatment of lipid disorders and diabetes, though likely safer to temporarily defer during the current COVID-19 crisis than these other acute services, have been shown to be lifesaving. The cumulative risk over time may be significant. While it is unlikely that patients will suddenly die as a result of these delays, a number of patients who might have otherwise been detected and treated earlier will likely present to the ED with new or dangerously out-of-control diabetes. However, the real concern is the longer-term population-based consequences of failure to detect, prevent, and treat conditions, such as diabetes and cardiac risks from hyperlipemia.
