 </sup>. Vaccination is the primary means for controlling influenza transmission but is hampered by the variable efficacy and incomplete population coverage of annual vaccines, and thus is not yet sufficient for preventing large annual epidemics. Antiviral medications can shorten the duration of symptoms and reduce the likelihood of severe outcomes when administered to infected individuals shortly after they develop symptoms. Prior to 2018, the only approved influenza antivirals were viral neuraminidase inhibitors

 </sup>. Of these, only oseltamivir (Tamiflu) can be taken orally, thereby facilitating its widespread usage. Oseltamivir inhibits the release of progeny virus from the cell surface, which is the last step in the production of infectious virus. Multiple oseltamivir treatments over 5 consecutive days are required to fully arrest virus production.
