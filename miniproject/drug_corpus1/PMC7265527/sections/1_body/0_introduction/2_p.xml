 </sup>. This initiation step requires cap-snatching, a mechanism in which the viral polymerase binds to the cap structure (m
 <sup>7</sup>GpppNm) at the 5’ ends of pre-mRNAs, the nuclear RNA precursors to cellular mRNAs, and then the endonuclease enzyme in the polymerase itself cleaves the pre-mRNAs at a position 10–14 bases downstream from the cap to generate the capped RNA fragments that serve as primers to initiate viral mRNA synthesis. Because baloxavir almost completely inhibits the cap-dependent endonuclease, little or no initiation of viral mRNA synthesis occurs, and little or no virus is produced. Consequently, as predicted, baloxavir treatment of infected patients almost totally inhibits virus production rapidly, within 24 h
