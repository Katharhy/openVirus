<p id="Par5">In addition to reducing the duration of symptoms, influenza antivirals can reduce infectiousness by shortening the period of virus shedding. In fact, because baloxavir treatment rapidly inhibits virus replication, virus shedding is shortened by 2â€“3 days. Consequently, widespread baloxavir treatment is predicted to substantially reduce population-level incidence, analogous to the herd effect attributed to vaccines

 </sup>. Here, we estimate the impact of increasing baloxavir treatment coverage and varying times of treatment on population-level incidence using both clinical results and a hierarchical mathematical model that links within-host dynamics of viral load to between-host transmission. Our results indicate that scaling up and accelerating baloxavir treatment would substantially reduce influenza morbidity and mortality every year.
