<p id="Par7">We incorporated this viral replication model into a stochastic individual-based model of influenza transmission that tracks the daily evolution of infectiousness with disease progression. The infectiousness of a case at any given time depends on viral load, treatment status, and baseline transmission rates estimated from influenza surveillance data

 </sup>, we assume a logarithmic relationship between viral load and infectiousness (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Unless otherwise specified, each course of treatment is initiated within the first 48 h of symptom onset, with the exact treatment times following the distribution reported in the recent clinical trial

 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). A day after initiating treatment with baloxavir or oseltamivir, the model projects that infectiousness is reduced by 95% or only 21%, respectively, relative to a comparable untreated patient (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). In addition, baloxavir-treated patients are likely to become non-infectious within two days, whereas oseltamivir-treated patients are predicted to remain infectious for ~4 or 5 days.
