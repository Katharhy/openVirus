<p id="Par10">Finally, we estimate influenza-associated mortality and morbidity averted by scaling up baloxavir or oseltamivir treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Specifically, we calculate the reduction in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs)

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup> between simulated 2017–2018 epidemics with and without scaling up antiviral treatment. For averted cases, we use DALY estimates

 </sup> that include losses due to influenza-associated hospitalization (58%) outpatient care (4%) and mortality (38%). Clinical trial

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
 </sup> results indicate that baloxavir and oseltamivir reduce the duration of illness by at least 23 h. As the treatment rate increases, the number of courses of treatment required to avert one DALY decreases with baloxavir treatment to a greater extent than with oseltamivir treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). For example, when only 20% of cases are treated, every 10.6 courses of baloxavir treatment is expected to avert one DALY, whereas 18.6 courses of oseltamivir treatment are needed to avert one DALY. Hence, each course of baloxavir or oseltamivir treatment is expected to prevent the loss of ~5 weeks or ~3 weeks of healthy life, respectively.
