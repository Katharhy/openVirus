 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Seminal studies of the mitigation of influenza pandemics suggest that oseltamivir-based interventions can only partially mitigate a pandemic, with the proportion of cases averted inversely related to the treatment rate, speed of treatment, and transmission rate of the pandemic virus

 </sup>. Our new estimates of time-dependent baloxavir and oseltamivir efficacy against virus spread are qualitatively consistent with these prior studies and can be readily applied to the evaluation and updating of antiviral-based mitigation of pandemics.
