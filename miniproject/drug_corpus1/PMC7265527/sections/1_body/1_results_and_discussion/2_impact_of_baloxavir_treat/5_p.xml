<p id="Par11">Proactive case identification and antiviral treatment can significantly mitigate the burden of seasonal influenza in the United States. Using an influenza transmission model fitted to a recent clinical trial and incidence reports from the 2017 to 2018 season, we find that baloxavir offers individual-level and population-level benefits to a greater extent than oseltamivir. For a reasonably attainable scenario in which only 20% of cases receive baloxavir treatment within 48 h of symptom onset, the estimated herd effect is a 25% reduction in overall incidence, corresponding to ~15 million infected cases averted in the United States, potentially saving ~4200 lives. With a higher treatment rate (50%), the expected number of cases averted increases to ~37 million, potentially saving ~10,200 lives. Our results indicate that optimal reduction of overall infection occurs when a significant number of infected cases are treated with baloxavir within 24 h after symptom onset. Consequently, efforts to accelerate the diagnosis and treatment of influenza infections with antivirals such as baloxavir, including potentially cost-saving telemedicine

Thus, antiviral treatment of 20–30% of infected patients may be attainable in future influenza epidemics.
