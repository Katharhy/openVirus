<p id="Par15">In conclusion, our results indicate that both the scaling up and acceleration of baloxavir treatment would avert substantial influenza morbidity and mortality every year. Even modest baloxavir treatment rates can potentially spare millions of people from influenza virus infections during epidemics, thereby substantially reducing hospitalizations, morbidity, and deaths. This prediction provides an added incentive for accelerated healthcare delivery systems such as telemedicine and the development of rapid, sensitive assays for influenza virus infection.</p>
