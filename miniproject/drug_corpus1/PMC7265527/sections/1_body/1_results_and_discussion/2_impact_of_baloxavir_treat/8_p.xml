<p id="Par14">We assume that the efficacy and timing of antiviral treatment estimated from a clinical trial

 </sup> applies to the population as a whole, and have not modeled possible biases in the data with respect to disease severity or timing of treatment. Future epidemiological studies and clinical trials may allow us to address such biases and capture two key complexities not yet considered in our models. First, we have not considered that viral kinetics and the efficacy of treatment may substantially vary across age groups and risk groups, as demonstrated by others
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup>. We expect that incorporating such heterogeneity will enhance intervention assessments and the prioritization of medical resources, but not qualitatively change the results of this analysis. Second, we do not yet model the evolution and transmission of baloxavir-resistant viruses, which may alter the population-level benefits of ramping up treatment rates. In recent clinical trials, baloxavir-resistant viruses emerged in 23% of baloxavir-treated children
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>
 </sup> and 9.7% of baloxavir-treated adults
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
 </sup>, and in some cases prolonged symptoms and viral shedding. Combination therapy with baloxavir and a neuraminidase inhibitor (oseltamivir) may prevent the generation of baloxavir-resistant viruses, whereas preserving the strong herd effect provided by baloxavir treatment. Clinical evaluation of this combination therapy is currently underway with results expected in March 2021 (ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>
 </sup>). A prior study provides a flexible framework for estimating the efficacy of combination therapy depending on the timing of administration
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>
 </sup>. As another caveat, we follow prior studies
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup> in assuming that the infectiousness of a case is logarithmically related to their viral load. Although there is little doubt that infectiousness and viral load are positively correlated, transmission also depends on contact patterns during the time that an individual is infectious
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup>. We do not consider infection-mediated changes in contact rates, such as when individuals choose to stay home from school or work when ill.
