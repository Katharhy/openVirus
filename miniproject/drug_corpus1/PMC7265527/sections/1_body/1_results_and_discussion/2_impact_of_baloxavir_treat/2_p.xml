<p id="Par8">To project the population-level impacts of both scaling up and accelerating antiviral treatment, we fit our model to the 2017–2018 influenza epidemic in the United States, a severe epidemic which resulted in an estimated 63.3 million people infected, over 900,000 hospitalizations and more than 79,000 deaths

 </sup>. In the absence of scaling up antiviral coverage, the timing and magnitude of the epidemiological trajectories projected by the model match the 2017–2018 seasonal epidemic (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Treatment of 30% of infected cases with baloxavir or oseltamivir within 48 h after symptoms onset reduces the expected number of influenza infections throughout the virus season by 38% or 26%, respectively. We estimate the reduction in the number of overall infections at other treatment levels, ranging from 10% to 50% (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). As the percent of cases receiving antiviral treatment is increased, the estimated herd effect increases as reflected by a proportional decline in expected incidence. Baloxavir treatment is predicted to reduce the overall burden of influenza more than oseltamivir treatment across all treatment rates. If half of all cases are treated, baloxavir or oseltamivir are expected to reduce incidence by 58% or 39%, respectively. Similar herd effects are estimated for models that are fit to incidence data from the 2016–2017 and 2018–2019 influenza seasons in the United States (Supplementary Figs. 4 and
