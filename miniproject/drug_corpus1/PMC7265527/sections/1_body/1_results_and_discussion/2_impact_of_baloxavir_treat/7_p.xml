<p id="Par13">The critical importance of mass treatment by effective antivirals is exemplified by the global pandemic (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2. As of April 2020, COVID-19 has spread to ~200 countries, infected ~2.5 million people, and claimed the lives of more than 170,000 people

 </sup>. No antivirals specific for COVID-19 are currently available to treat patients and mitigate the spread of this virus during the time that an effective vaccine is being developed and deployed. Our results indicate that the rapid development of an antiviral against COVID-19 that, like baloxavir, quickly and almost completely inhibits COVID-19 virus replication could vastly reduce morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, the likelihood of pre-symptomatic transmission
