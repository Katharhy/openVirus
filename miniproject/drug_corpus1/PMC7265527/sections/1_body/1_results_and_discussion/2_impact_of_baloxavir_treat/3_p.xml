<p id="Par9">Using our model based on the 2017–2018 influenza season, we consider the population-level impacts of treatment initiation time within the 48 h period after symptom onset. Both the efficacy of baloxavir treatment and the increased benefit of baloxavir relative to oseltamivir are greatest in the first 24 h period (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). For a single infected individual, baloxavir treatment administered within the first 24 h period is expected to achieve nearly double the reduction in infectiousness (87%) than treatment administered within the second 24 h period. On a population level, baloxavir treatment within the first 24 h after symptoms onset results in a significantly greater reduction in total incidence than treatment within the second 24 h window following symptom onset (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). At the 30% and 50% case treatment rates, the early baloxavir treatment scenario is expected to avert 3.8 and 5.3 million infections more than the delayed treatment scenario, respectively. We also evaluated the distribution of treatment times reported in the baloxavir clinical trial:
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
 </sup> approximately equal numbers of patients treated in the 0–24 and 24–48 h time periods following symptom onset. This mixture is expected to reduce transmission to almost the same extent as accelerating all treatment to within 24 h of symptom onset (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). We restrict our analysis to treatment initiated within the initial 48 h window, given that later treatment will only negligibly impact incidence and that treatment within 48 h is clearly indicated

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>. In addition, treatment within 48 h is increasingly feasible with the expansion of telemedicine and online clinics (e.g., through the Xofluza website

 </sup> and insurance providers
