 </sup> that measured the viral loads of 1014 influenza virus-infected patients after treatment with oseltamivir, baloxavir, or a placebo (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Our model produces viral titer estimates similar to the clinical data, and, like the clinical data, shows that baloxavir inhibits influenza virus replication more effectively than oseltamivir (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Within 1 day of initiating baloxavir or oseltamivir treatment, virus load decreases by an estimated 84% or 56%, respectively, compared with an expected reduction in untreated cases of 39%. The observed differences in the time between symptom onset and the initiation of treatment for patients in the clinical trial accounts for most of the observed variability in virus replication (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, standard deviations). We used the fitted model to predict the effectiveness of drug treatment scenarios beyond those tested in the clinical trial, including the initiation of baloxavir or oseltamivir regimens at different times after symptom onset (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).
