 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>): (i) fitting a within-host model of antiviral-induced inhibition of influenza virus replication to clinical trial data to estimate the impact of treatment on the infectiousness of patients (2) fitting a between-host model of person-to-person virus transmission to seasonal influenza surveillance data to estimate influenza transmission rates, and (3) incorporate both sets of estimates into our simulation model to project the impacts of expanding and accelerating antiviral treatment during emerging epidemics.
