<p>As a hematologist with an interest in infectious diseases I would like to use this opportunity to repeat a long-standing message: community-acquired respiratory viruses (CARV) are potential killers, especially for cancer patients [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Influenza has long been famous for causing seasonal excess mortality in all populations and is therefore well known as a dangerous pathogen in cancer patients in particular [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Other CARV with complicated names such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza, or human metapneumovirus (hMPV) have also been described as causes of pneumonia with high fatality rates in patients with hematological malignancies inside and outside the transplant setting [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It seems that shortly after the novel description of a respiratory virus oncologists have previously never heard of, there is the report of an outbreak, sometimes with fatal consequences, on a hematology/oncology unit somewhere on the globe [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. So why should this be any different for SARS-CoV-2? The characteristics are the same, albeit probably aggravated, as for the other CARV: firstly, an infection with SARS-CoV-2 is per se potentially dangerous, secondly, the virus is highly contagious and has a high potential for nosocomial transmission, and lastly, clinicians are not used to and thus not sufficiently aware of this particular pathogen.
