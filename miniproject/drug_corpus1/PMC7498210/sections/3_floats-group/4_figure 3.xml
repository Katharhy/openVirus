  <p>Interaction diagram of barnidipine with M
   <sup>pro</sup>. (A) The protein-ligand contacts showing the bonding interactions fraction. (B) Interaction of barnidipine with residues in each trajectory frame. The darker colour higher the interaction or the residues make more contact; (C) Barnidipine interaction with the protein residues during MD simulation. Interactions shown are occurring more than 30% during the simulation time.
