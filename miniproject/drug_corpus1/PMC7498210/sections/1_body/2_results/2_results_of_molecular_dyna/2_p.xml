<p id="p0070">The M
 <sup>pro</sup>-bound aprepitant exhibited good binding mode during MD-simulation. The plot of the backbone of the protein structures enumerated during the MD-simulation aligned to the initial structure for the RMSD analysis. The protein-ligand complex was stable for the entire simulation period, indicates the binding stability of the ligand with the protein (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). During the MD-simulation, the residues CYS44, threonine (THR45) and GLU166 of M
 <sup>pro</sup> exhibited H-bond interaction with the ligand aprepitant. Bridged hydrogen bonding interaction was observed with residues CYS44 and glutamine GLU166 and the ligand. The HIS41 exhibited π-π stacking interaction (31%) during the MD-simulation. There were no ionic, and water bridges were observed throughout the simulation (
