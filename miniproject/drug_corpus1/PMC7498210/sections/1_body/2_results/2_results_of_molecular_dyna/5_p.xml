<p id="p0085">A combination of polar, as well as non-polar interactions, was shown by arbutin bound to M
 <sup>pro</sup> during MD-simulation. The plot of the backbone of the protein structures enumerated during the MD-simulation aligned to the initial structure for the RMSD analysis. As illustrated in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D, after 20 nsec initial fluctuations due to the equilibration, the RMSD for the protein-ligand structures remained between 2 Å until the end of the simulation. The residues CYS44, TYR54, GLU166 and GLN189 made hydrogen bonding different atoms of the ligand. The ligand interacted with the protein backbone by forming bridged hydrogen bonding interactions with CYS44 and GLU166 residues. The hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions with GLU166 accounted to be more than 100%. A π- π stacking interaction (32%) was demonstrated with HIS41 amino acid residue (
