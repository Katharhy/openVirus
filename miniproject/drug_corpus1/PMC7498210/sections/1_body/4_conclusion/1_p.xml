<p id="p0125">The SP-docking of USFDA approved drugs resulted in five potential SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors. These drugs include aprepitant, barnidipine, tipiracil, arbutin and terbutaline. Among these five drug-hits, aprepitant and tipiracil were found strongest in binding M
 <sup>pro</sup> by MD-simulation studies. Further, these drugs are cost-effective, least toxic and currently used in therapy for other diseases. Thus, the present study provides an insight into the inhibition of major protease M
 <sup>pro</sup> of SARS-CoV-2 using computation tools and shortlisted five drugs. Further, testing theses drugs, especially aprepitant and tipiracil, by in vitro M
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitory activity and in vitro antiviral activity can be fast-tracked for repurposing in COVID-19 clinical trials.
