<p id="p0025">Target selection and validation are the crucial steps in drug repurposing. One of the recently reported druggable target major protease M
 <sup>pro</sup> is the first protein crystallography structure published in PDB on January 26, 2020 (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). M
 <sup>pro</sup> is also known as 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>). Currently, the target M
 <sup>pro</sup> is validated, and some studies have reported drug repurposing (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). None of these studies is focussed on FDA approved drugs for repurposing. Hence, in this study, we tried drug repurposing using FDA approved drugs. We discovered a new compounds, whose binding could have potentials as SARS-CoV-2 replication inhibitors with less toxic and affordable compared to the currently available drugs.
