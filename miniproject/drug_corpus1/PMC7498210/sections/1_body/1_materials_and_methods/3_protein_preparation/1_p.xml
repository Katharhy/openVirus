<p id="p0040">The protein structure of major protease M
 <sup>pro</sup> coordinate with accession code 6LU7 was downloaded from Protein Data Bank (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The protein structure was optimized using Protein Prep Wizard (PPW) tool in Shrodinger software (
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The missing hydrogens, side chains, and residues were added, waters were deleted. Using PROPKA tool, the correct ionization state was generated at pH 7.4, and the hydrogen bond network was regenerated, and the protein structure was minimized (
