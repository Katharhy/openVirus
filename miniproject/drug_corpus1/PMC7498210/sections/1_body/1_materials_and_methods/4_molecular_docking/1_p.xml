<p id="p0045">For molecular docking, the Glide module in Schrodinger was used (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The binding site was identified using the Receptor Grid generation module with the default option. The centroid of the bound ligand was considered for Grid generation. The High Throughput Virtual Screening (HTVS) mode was initially followed for 2800 drugs, and top 500 drugs shortlisted based on docking score are screened by Standard Precision mode (SP-docking). Finally, the single best pose was saved for each molecule (
