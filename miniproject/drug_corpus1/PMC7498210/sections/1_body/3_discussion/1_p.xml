<p id="p0095">Repurposing and repositioning of drugs for COVID-19 is the area of interest for many researchers. For drug repurposing, the target selection is an important step. In this study, we have selected major protease M
 <sup>pro</sup> which is validated and highly explored for repurposing in COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> is 306 amino acid long and functionally inhibit replicase precursor polyproteins whereby prevent viral gene expression and replication. In M
 <sup>pro</sup>, there are three domains identified for each protomer. Domain-I with 8–101 residues and domain II with 102–184 residues have six-stranded anti-parallel β-barrel. Domain-III with 201–303 residues encompasses five α-helices grouped into the anti-parallel globular cluster and is linked to Domain-II by a long loop region (residues 185–200). SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> has a Cys–His catalytic dyad. The M
 <sup>pro</sup> substrate-binding site lies in a cleft between Domain-I and II. The inhibitor atoms form an anti-parallel sheet of long strand residues 164–168, 155–168 on one side, and residues 189–191 of the loop links domains-II and III. In the crystal structure of M
 <sup>pro</sup> the native compound N3 (also known as peptide-like inhibitor PRD_002214) binds to the substrate-binding pocket by covalent bonding (
