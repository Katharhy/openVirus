<p id="p0100">We have carried out the virtual screening of US-FDA approved drugs from the DrugBank database. The virtual screening is a powerful method in drug discovery by computational modelling for hit identification as a starting point for a medicinal chemist to synthesize new chemical entity as well as for drug repurposing. This method reduces the time and cost of drug discovery (

 <sup>pro</sup> and shortlisted 50 top-drugs based on docking scores (

 <sup>pro</sup>. The drug aprepitant is used as an antiemetic in chemotherapy-induced emesis and post operatives emesis (
