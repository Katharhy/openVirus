  <p>Pathophysiological similarities between DHF and Covid‐19. Plasma leakage, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy are the hematological hallmarks of DHF and Covid‐19. Both DENV and SARS‐CoV‐2 induce the activation of immune cells leading to the release of pro‐inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL‐6. This event promotes increased vascular permeability that leads to plasma leakage. In DHF cases, the destruction of platelets in the peripheral region by DENV has been suggested as the cause of thrombocytopenia which in the end culminates as coagulopathy, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and in some cases, resulting in the death. While thrombocytopenia was also evident in Covid‐19 patients, pathophysiological mechanisms on how such event has occurred remain to be elucidated. Current data indicating that endothelial damage coupled with platelet apoptosis and impaired bone marrow growth might be the drivers of thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy in SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected patients. The sequential pathophysiological process leads to the occurrence of DIC and the death of Covid‐19 patients remains to be demonstrated</p>
