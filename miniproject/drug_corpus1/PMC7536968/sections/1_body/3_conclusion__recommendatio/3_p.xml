 </xref> no strong evidence yet to support this and further studies are warranted to elucidate this association. There is minimal analysis of the immunological differences in the mechanisms of enhancement and differences in receptor binding viral proteins among two genetically diverse RNA viruses such as DENV and SARS‐CoV‐2. Detailed receptor sequence analysis would be required to substantiate the possibility of cross‐reactivity between DENV and SARS‐CoV‐2 antibodies and to establish the immunological relations between the antibodies elicited by DENV infection and their impact on Covid‐19 and vice versa.
