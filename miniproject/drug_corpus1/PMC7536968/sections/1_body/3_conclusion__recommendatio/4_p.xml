<p>Other perspectives that need to be explored are the role of vector control and changes of DENV serotype circulating during the Covid‐19 pandemic in the region. During the pandemic, vector control measures might have decreased in the community and dengue prevention programs might have been paused in some countries. Therefore, countries that are experiencing or have high risk for dengue outbreak should maintain the vector control measures during the pandemic.

 </xref> One of the most possible strategies is to improve within‐household strategies by encouraging community members to reduce mosquitoes breeding sites in and around the homes. Lastly, displacement of DENV serotypes or genotypes leading to the cyclic pattern of dengue have been reported in several countries in Asia previously.

 </xref> This could be another possible reason for the observed increase of dengue cases during Covid‐19 pandemic. Continuous dengue surveillance needs to be in placed to track transmission dynamics of DENV infection in the region.
