<p>Clinical symptoms of Covid‐19 include cough, muscle aches, fatigue, skin rash, and petechiae, making it challenging to differentiate Covid‐19 from other endemic viral infections in the region, such as dengue,

This article aims to: (a) provide evidence of Covid‐19 and dengue misdiagnosis in clinical settings and the possibility of cross‐reactivity between SARS‐CoV‐2 and DENV; (b) discuss the possible consequence of immune response overlapping on enhancement or protective effect, disease severity and vaccine development; and (c) provide insights for further studies that are urgently needed in the region.
