<p>Covid‐19 and dengue exhibit some pathophysiological similarities, such as capillary leakage, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy (Figure

 </xref> Plasma leakage is a crucial factor for dengue pathophysiology and is primarily mediated by the host immunological response. Several immuno‐mediators, including pro‐inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin‐6 (IL‐6), interferon gamma (IFN‐γ), and chemokines such as macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), are associated with plasma leakage.

 </xref> IL‐6, along with other inflammatory mediators, such as IL‐1, TNF, and IFN‐γ, contribute not only to plasma leakage but also to other vascular disorders, including vascular permeability and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

 </xref> In dengue, plasma leakage is associated with the interaction between nonstructural protein 1 (NS1)‐specific antibodies and proteins expressed on endothelial cell surfaces, that may pave the way for the elevated rate of viral replication and inflammatory cytokine secretion.
