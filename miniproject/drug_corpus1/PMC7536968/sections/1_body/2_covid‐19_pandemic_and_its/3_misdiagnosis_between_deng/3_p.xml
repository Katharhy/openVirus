<p>Beyond the similar clinical manifestations of Covid‐19 and dengue, misdiagnosis may be due to serological cross‐reactivity between SARS‐CoV‐2 and DENV. It was hypothesized that patients with previous exposure to DENV possess anti‐DENV antibodies that are cross‐reactive with SARS‐CoV‐2 antigens.

 </xref> Alternatively, there may be antigenic similarities between SARS‐CoV‐2 and DENV, such that upon SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, the body is triggered to generate anti‐DENV antibodies derived from memory B cells.
