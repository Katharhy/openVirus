<p>Misdiagnosis due to serology cross‐reactivity between Covid‐19 and dengue was first reported in Singapore where patients were initially confirmed to have dengue through dengue IgM and IgG rapid serological testing, but were later found to be positive for Covid‐19 using RT‐PCR testing.

 </xref> Subsequent RT‐PCR analysis were failed to detect DENV in both urine and blood samples, confirming the absence of dengue infection in the respective patients. This suggests the possibility of serological cross‐reactivity between DENV and SARS‐CoV‐2, in particular when using rapid serology‐based test, that could lead to significant challenges in dengue‐endemic countries in Asia. In Indonesia for example, there have been no reports of misdiagnoses between Covid‐19 and dengue in the literature. However, there has been an increase in dengue cases in the country; 68 000 cases have been reported as of June 21, 2020.

 </xref> In Indonesia, most dengue cases were exclusively diagnosed with IgM and IgG rapid serological testing, if not clinically diagnosed.

 </xref> Therefore, it is possible that there were Covid‐19 cases among these dengue‐diagnosed patients. In addition, it remains challenging to access Covid‐19 testing in Indonesia, as reported early in the pandemic.

 </xref> The lack of adequate laboratories across the country and low testing rate could hamper the diagnosis and management of Covid‐19 patients.
