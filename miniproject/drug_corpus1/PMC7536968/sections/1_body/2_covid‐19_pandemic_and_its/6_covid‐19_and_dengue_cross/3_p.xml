<p>A recent study demonstrated that SARS‐CoV‐2 infection provides protection from re‐challenge in rhesus macaques;

 </xref> however, the phenomenon in humans requires further investigation. Studies on vaccine candidates should examine whether antibodies raised by vaccine administration result in protection or ADE. Pre‐clinical trials of several SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccine candidates have demonstrated protection after challenge in animals,
