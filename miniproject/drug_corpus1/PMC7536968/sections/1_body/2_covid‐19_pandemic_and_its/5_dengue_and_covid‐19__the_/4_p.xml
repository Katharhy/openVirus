<p>ADE of SARS‐CoV is thought to utilize a novel cell entry mechanism for entry into immune cells, wherein antibody‐mediated infection is dependent on FcγRII but does not utilize the endosomal/lysosomal pathway through the ACE2 receptor.

 </xref> Viral neutralization was demonstrated with concentrated antisera against the S protein, although higher dilutions failed to neutralize the infective virus and even induced apoptosis caused by increased viral infection. In contrast, anti‐nucleocapsid (N) protein antibodies neither neutralized the virus, nor caused ADE. However, nucleocapsid proteins have been observed to induce cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) immune responses that are specifically SARS‐CoV‐2 protective.
