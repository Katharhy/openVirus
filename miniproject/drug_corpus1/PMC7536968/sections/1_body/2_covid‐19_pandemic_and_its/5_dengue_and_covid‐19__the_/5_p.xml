 </xref> A study in Colombia found that there was a decreasing trend of dengue during increasing reports of Covid‐19 and it was speculated it might due to viral interference of SARS‐CoV‐2 over DENV.

 </xref> Studies are needed to identify the interaction between these antibodies against dengue and Covid‐19. How will Covid‐19 pathogenesis in populations where the immunities to DENV or other arboviruses are present? Furthermore, the mechanism of ADE in viral infection has become a great concern to disease control by vaccination. Therefore, the development of SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccines has to incorporate approaches to develop the vaccine with minimum or no risk for ADE, if ADE exists in COVID‐19.
