 </xref> In coronaviruses, ADE may function through the interaction of Fc, or other receptors in susceptible cells, with the complex between virus and anti‐spike (S) protein‐neutralizing antibodies, thereby facilitating both inflammatory responses and persistent viral replication in the lungs.

 </xref> Polymorphic FcγRIIA on monocytes has been reported to favor ligation of non‐neutralizing antibody‐virus complexes in both dengue and Covid‐19. In dengue, this ligation activates the expression of negative regulators of dihydroxyacetone kinase and autophagy proteins (cascade of down‐regulatory pathways) to decrease production of type I IFN‐activated antiviral molecules and suppress the capacity of macrophage antiviral mechanisms, leading to enhanced viral replication.

 </xref> FcγRIIA‐mediated enhancement has been reported in SARS‐CoV in a study of 180 people from Hong Kong who were infected with SARS‐CoV. Moreover, it was found that FcγRIIA polymorphism affects disease severity.
