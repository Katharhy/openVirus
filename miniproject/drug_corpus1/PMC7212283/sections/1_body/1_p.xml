<p id="p0015">Many parallels in virology can be made between the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and prior epidemics related to coronavirus, including the SARS-CoV outbreak of 2002â€“2003. During that epidemic, up to 73% of patients had diarrhea, generally within the first week of the illness.

 </xref> The pathophysiologic mechanism postulated for this, as well as for the occurrence of digestive symptoms during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, is thought to be related to the virus's strong affinity for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor which is located in multiple human cell types, including both lung AT2 cells (accounting for the virus's pulmonary toxicity), and certain enterocytes in the ileum and colon.

 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> ACE2 is partly responsible for mediating inflammation, which could explain occurrence of diarrhea. In fact, the binding efficiency is thought to be stronger for SARS-CoV-2 than the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak of 2002, which could likely explain its high rate of transmission to others.

 </xref> The binding of virus to primary intestinal epithelial cells also raises the prospect of fecal-oral transmission, which is as of yet unconfirmed for SARS-CoV-2.
