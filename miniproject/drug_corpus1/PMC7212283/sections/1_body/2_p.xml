Nausea and vomiting occurred in two-third of the patients, diarrhea in 37%, and abdominal pain in 25% of those who presented with GI symptoms. AST and ALT were both mildly elevated in majority of patients. Notably, the study is retrospective in nature with a relatively small sample size, thus these results may not be generalizable. However, it provides a good starting point from which the managing clinician can put the digestive symptoms of COVID-19 patients in context.
