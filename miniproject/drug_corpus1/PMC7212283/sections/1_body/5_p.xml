<p id="p0035">To date, there has not been a study of COVID-19 patients in the United States that reports on gastrointestinal symptoms. In a case series of 21 critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Washington State, the initial symptoms were shortness of breath (76%), fever (52%), and cough (48%) but the authors do not report on other symptoms.

 </xref> Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea were the common symptoms; GI symptoms were more common with more severe Covid-19 disease (23% vs. 8.1%) and family clustering (31.1% vs. 20.5%) was also more common in those with GI symptoms. As such, more data will be necessary to gain a clearer understanding of the gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19. More importantly it is not known whether there is any correlation between those with gastrointestinal symptoms and worse outcomes.
