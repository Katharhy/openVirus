<p id="p0045">With regard to liver-related complications of COVID-19, a varying degree of liver test abnormalities has been described in affected patients. In one study, total bilirubin, AST and ALT was elevated in 10%, 21% and 22% of patients respectively.

It is difficult to separate the independent effect of viral infection from various treatment modalities, including antibiotics and experimental antiviral drugs that were utilized in these patients. In addition these changes could be nonspecific abnormalities related to the infection, sepsis or hypoxia. Other laboratory abnormalities such as leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and creatinine kinase were more common in patients who were sicker on presentation or who died. There is no information on liver pathology except one patient who had an autopsy and this showed showed micro vesicular steatosis, and mild lobular and portal inflammation on liver histology.
