 </xref> All patients were confirmed to have COVID-19 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In this study, 99 patients (48.5%) had gastrointestinal symptoms. Of these 99 patients, the symptoms included anorexia in 83 (83.8%), diarrhea in 29 (29.3%), vomiting in 8 (8.1%), and abdominal pain in 4 (4.0%), with some patients having multiple symptoms. Most notably, in 7 cases, digestive symptoms were the only complaint with no respiratory symptoms. Unfortunately, patients with digestive symptoms had a longer time from onset of symptoms to admission, likely related to delayed diagnosis as these symptoms are non-specific.
