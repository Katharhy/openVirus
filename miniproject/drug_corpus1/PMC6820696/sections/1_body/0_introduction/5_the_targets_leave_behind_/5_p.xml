<p>Looking at what is known about the “missing 10-10-10” for the second target-that 90% of people diagnosed with HIV are on ART-we find similar disparities as exist for knowing one's HIV status. First, we see vast geographic differences, ranging from about 29% in the Middle East and North Africa to about 85% in Western and Central Europe and North America.

 </sup> In this target, too, there are demographic disparities by sex/gender and age. Globally, in 2017, 53% of men aged 15 years or older were on ART, whereas 65% of women in this age group were; and treatment coverage for children (aged 0–14 years) generally was lower than that for adults.

 </sup> Others who comprise the 10% or more not covered by ART are key populations—gay men and other MSM, people who inject drugs, and female sex workers—who in many, if not most, contexts are socially marginalized, sometimes criminalized, and therefore, much less likely to access HIV care and treatment services. For example, in South Africa, although approximately 68% of gay men and other MSM living with HIV knew their diagnosis, only 26% of them were receiving ART.
