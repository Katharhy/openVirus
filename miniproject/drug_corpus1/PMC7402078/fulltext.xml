A general awareness of COVID-19 infection is addressed, and it is compared with the Spanish flu pandemic. Based on the successes, failures and lessons learned in the past, governmental efforts must be undertaken to empower citizens by providing accurate information and implementing post-COVID-19 precautions that need to be taken now to stop the spread and recurrence of the virus locally, and to restore health and economic normalcy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A detailed literature survey of past pandemics is undertaken in order to extract the successes, failures and lessons learned from previous breakouts. The comparison of past pandemics will enable us to determine post-COVID-19 precautions that should be followed. Separate tables are prepared to highlight the lessons learned and measures to be taken. Both general precautions and preventive measures for pregnant women are compiled.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">The literature shows a continuous struggle of humans with disease outbreaks, with the most adverse impact of the Spanish flu killing 20&#x02013;50&#x000a0;million people. Precautions need to be taken including social distancing, compulsory mask-wearing, avoiding public gatherings and washing hands regularly. The lessons from earlier pandemics show that they were equally devastating, and vaccines were not available at the time of outbreaks. Vaccines developed for polio, H1N1, measles, and other viral diseases have proven to save countless lives. Living with COVID-19 and evolving the work culture of protecting oneself and protecting others also has to be adopted.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">COVID-19 has become an everyday topic of discussion throughout the world, indicating the increasing number of COVID-19 cases, deaths and recoveries. The lessons learned from past pandemics such as social distancing, wearing masks, avoiding public gatherings and adherence to guidelines, along with personal hygiene, are the key measures that must be taken in order to live with COVID-19. Precautions for the elderly and pregnant women advised by medical authorities are to be strictly adhered to. These will help in reducing COVID-19 cases and in turn will reduce the pressure on hospitals to serve those in need. India has learned lessons from the past and the present pandemic and will move towards growth through its self-reliance.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>Spanish flu</kwd><kwd>Pandemics</kwd><kwd>HIV/AIDS</kwd><kwd>Social distancing</kwd><kwd>Severe acute respiratory syndrome</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par5">Since the birth of civilisation, humans have experienced health issues due to changes in the quality of panch maha tatvas, i.e. Bhoomi (earth), Jal (water), Akash (sky), Agni (fire) and vayu (air), which adversely affect human health or well-being (Pevey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2017</xref>). It has been written in the Vedas that these pancha tatvas have to be used and maintained in their purest state (Ahuluwali <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2013</xref>). From the Antonine period until today, civilisations have lived with epidemics and pandemics, causing panic among people, who could only turn to for prayer for protection, causing economic destruction, and highlighting human mortality (Benedictow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2005</xref>; Scheidel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2017</xref>). Epidemics have regional effects whereas pandemics have worldwide effects of disease spread. The history of virology dates back to the identification of the first virus, the tobacco mosaic virus, in 1892&#x000a0;(Lecoq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2001</xref>; Nicklin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2002</xref>), and has evolved since then with continuous development in virology studies using highly sophisticated microscopes (Baveja <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2018</xref>; Pelczar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">1993</xref>). Nevertheless, governmental efforts are ongoing to improve the study of virology and microbiology in India, which is gaining in significance with the use of a multidisciplinary/integrated approach (Heymann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2001</xref>) for developing vaccines and administering them to people for surveillance&#x000a0;(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">http://www.who.int/csr/response/publication/survillance/plague.pdf</xref> accessed on 25 May 2020). The effects of viral diseases like HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases (Rashid et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2016</xref>; Davey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2016</xref>) and the subject of biology and microbiology have entered technical institutions (Mann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2012</xref>; Vale and Dell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2009</xref>), with a priority to be taught in all engineering courses to engender an understanding of social and healthy living.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>World history of pandemics</title><p id="Par6">The very first pandemic, based on the available literature, was the Antonine plague in 165&#x000a0;AD, and the most recent is coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19).

Each of these pandemics was a threat to mankind (Reid et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2004</xref>; Raj et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2020</xref>) and created panic in the absence of a vaccine at the time of the outbreak. The COVID-19 outbreak spread rapidly, claiming 2462 lives and infecting 78,811 just in the first month (Chowdhury et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2020</xref>), and the rate of mutation of the virus is higher than that of a DNA virus (Raj et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2020</xref>). In light of the current deadly pandemic, it was felt that a brief review of past pandemics was needed.

After successfully containing deadly outbreaks of Nipah virus and other high-threat pathogens, and building on the success in eliminating polio, India is now readying itself to address the threat of an influenza pandemic. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) and WHO jointly hosted a gathering of leading experts from the fields of public health, virology, epidemiology, surveillance, clinical medicine, One Health, disaster management, behavioural science, risk communication and the defence sector to identify and address challenges that India would face during an influenza pandemic (WHO Report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2014</xref>; Swetha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">The study of microbiology, and especially virology, is time-consuming, with many steps involved. The isolation, identification, preservation, characterisation, screening of antimicrobial activity (Parija <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2016</xref>, and studying the behaviour of viruses in different laboratory conditions is both challenging and risky (Earnest Gould <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1999</xref>). The challenges in developing new generations of vaccines are substantial at the levels of basic biology and efficacy. The greater challenges, however, arise when introducing vaccines to the public (Rauch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2018</xref>). Communities at large will resist any change in the natural system. For example, when family planning was introduced, people had misconceptions regarding different methods (Khan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1980</xref>). Similarly, acceptance of the polio vaccine by the population took several months before it became a routine procedure to eradicate polio (Chowdhary et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2011</xref>). There were continuous struggles for HIV/AIDS programs in India to bring about changes in public attitudes (Satyajeet and Pramanik <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2009</xref>). It is not uncommon for India to experience sudden and rapid outbreaks of epidemics and pandemics. Studies have reported that outbreaks in developing countries are caused by malnutrition, lack of sanitation and proper public health systems, and unavailability of ready-made vaccines (Ergunay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2014</xref>; Rice et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2000</xref>; John et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2011</xref>; Sivabakya and Srinivas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2020</xref>). It is also a sad truth that India will have to be ready to face several more such outbreaks in the days to come (Mishra <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2015</xref>). Thus, preparedness has to be given immense importance, and control of spread should be the number one priority of the government, doctors and other health care workers, and the general public.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Post-coronavirus effects</title><p id="Par9">The novel coronavirus COVID-19 that originated in Wuhan, China (Zhou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2020</xref>; Chowdhury et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2020</xref>) is showing its severity in the form of new human-to-human transmission (Bhattacharya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2020</xref>) and has now become a global concern (Hassan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2020</xref>; Mothay and Ramesh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2020</xref>; Yaseen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2020</xref>).

The infection continues to spread due to its contagious nature (Lessler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2009</xref>), with the path of human-to-human transmission through respiratory droplets (WHO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2020</xref>) and variable incubation time for symptoms to appear (Hawker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2008</xref>). Another prevalent issue is that COVID-19 features are similar to those of common influenza viruses causing colds. The most common feature of common influenza viruses is seasonality, which implies that influenza caused by viruses increases during colder temperatures, and then subsides with warming of the air temperature. By analysing the data up to 7 March 2020 and by considering more than 80 locations comprising a number of confirmed cases and location-specific meteorological data, we showed that the spread of the virus is strongly dependent on the temperature and UV index (Nair and Neel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2020</xref>; Gunthe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">There is a long way to go before we will be able to say that COVID-19 is completely eradicated (Islam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2020</xref>). People may have to live with it for some time and resist infection by following strict guidelines of social distancing and hygiene, as too great an economic imbalance (Nicola et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2020</xref>) will pose many other problems such as increased poverty (Balaji and Sravendra <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2020</xref>), death due to hunger and malnutrition, and increased numbers of homeless (Banerjee and Bhattacharya <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>). From a business point of view, the retooling of production with new policies of safe social distancing and fewer workers will pose different challenges (Dasgupta and De <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>; Ramteke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2020</xref>). The phased lifting of restrictions on people&#x02019;s travel to work is also a concern (Page <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2020</xref>). Disruptions in the academic setting at institutions of higher learning and difficulties in conducting online classes affect the educational system (Singh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2020</xref>), and rural students without available Internet facilities are deprived of their learning. In addition, the transfer of people who are stranded due to the lockdown and additional administrative responsibilities are placed on government officers for control and movement of the public, such as issuance of passes and maintaining law and order (Khanna et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par12">With great disruption and number of deaths ranging from 20 to 50 million, the Spanish flu (1918&#x02013;1919) that occurred over 100&#x000a0;years ago appeared in three successive waves.
