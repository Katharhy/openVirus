<p id="Par5">Since the birth of civilisation, humans have experienced health issues due to changes in the quality of panch maha tatvas, i.e. Bhoomi (earth), Jal (water), Akash (sky), Agni (fire) and vayu (air), which adversely affect human health or well-being (Pevey et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2017</xref>). It has been written in the Vedas that these pancha tatvas have to be used and maintained in their purest state (Ahuluwali 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2013</xref>). From the Antonine period until today, civilisations have lived with epidemics and pandemics, causing panic among people, who could only turn to for prayer for protection, causing economic destruction, and highlighting human mortality (Benedictow 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2005</xref>; Scheidel 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2017</xref>). Epidemics have regional effects whereas pandemics have worldwide effects of disease spread. The history of virology dates back to the identification of the first virus, the tobacco mosaic virus, in 1892 (Lecoq 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2001</xref>; Nicklin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2002</xref>), and has evolved since then with continuous development in virology studies using highly sophisticated microscopes (Baveja 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2018</xref>; Pelczar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">1993</xref>). Nevertheless, governmental efforts are ongoing to improve the study of virology and microbiology in India, which is gaining in significance with the use of a multidisciplinary/integrated approach (Heymann et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2001</xref>) for developing vaccines and administering them to people for surveillance (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2016</xref>; Davey 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2016</xref>) and the subject of biology and microbiology have entered technical institutions (Mann 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2012</xref>; Vale and Dell 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2009</xref>), with a priority to be taught in all engineering courses to engender an understanding of social and healthy living.
