<p id="Par11">There is a long way to go before we will be able to say that COVID-19 is completely eradicated (Islam et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2020</xref>). People may have to live with it for some time and resist infection by following strict guidelines of social distancing and hygiene, as too great an economic imbalance (Nicola et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2020</xref>) will pose many other problems such as increased poverty (Balaji and Sravendra 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2020</xref>), death due to hunger and malnutrition, and increased numbers of homeless (Banerjee and Bhattacharya 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>). From a business point of view, the retooling of production with new policies of safe social distancing and fewer workers will pose different challenges (Dasgupta and De 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>; Ramteke 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2020</xref>). The phased lifting of restrictions on peopleâ€™s travel to work is also a concern (Page 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2020</xref>). Disruptions in the academic setting at institutions of higher learning and difficulties in conducting online classes affect the educational system (Singh 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2020</xref>), and rural students without available Internet facilities are deprived of their learning. In addition, the transfer of people who are stranded due to the lockdown and additional administrative responsibilities are placed on government officers for control and movement of the public, such as issuance of passes and maintaining law and order (Khanna et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2020</xref>).
