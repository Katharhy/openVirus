The most common feature of common influenza viruses is seasonality, which implies that influenza caused by viruses increases during colder temperatures, and then subsides with warming of the air temperature. By analysing the data up to 7 March 2020 and by considering more than 80 locations comprising a number of confirmed cases and location-specific meteorological data, we showed that the spread of the virus is strongly dependent on the temperature and UV index (Nair and Neel
