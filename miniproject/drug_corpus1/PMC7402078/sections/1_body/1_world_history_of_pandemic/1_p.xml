<p id="Par6">The very first pandemic, based on the available literature, was the Antonine plague in 165 AD, and the most recent is coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). Pandemics presented chronologically include the Antonine plague (165 AD), Plague of Justinian (541–542 AD), Black Death (1346–1353), third cholera pandemic (1852–860) (
