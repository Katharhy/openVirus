  <title>The maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree, summarizing the posterior tree distribution from the MultiTypeTree analysis.</title>
  <p>Nodes have been annotated with the type posterior probability (below) and associated dates (above). Only support values greater than 70 are displayed. The 95% highest posterior density (HPD) intervals of the dates associated to the root and select nodes are located within parentheses. The type posterior probability is defined as the posterior probability of the most probable location. Years are displayed as labels on the x-axis.</p>
