<p>We previously reported an explosive HIV-1 epidemic among PWID in the central Pakistani city of Sargodha in Punjab province [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Sequential cross-sectional surveys revealed a significant increase in HIV-1 prevalence within Sargodha’s PWID population from 9.0% in 2005–2006 to 51.5% in 2006–2007. The city is located along one of the country’s most important drug trafficking routes, connecting opioid production areas in eastern Afghanistan with southern and central Pakistan, ultimately providing the city’s estimated 2,500 PWID with easy access to inexpensive heroin (

The relationship between the HIV-1 outbreak in Sargodha and HIV-1 infections occurring in PWID or associated at risk populations in other regions of Pakistan remains unclear. In particular, a better understanding of the role that PWID migration between cities, for example as commercial truck drivers or migrant agricultural workers [
