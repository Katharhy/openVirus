<p>In summary, our results suggest that the current epidemic among PWID is no longer an onward transmission of a limited number of A1 subtype founder viruses as reported previously. The greater subtype heterogeneity would be consistent with sexual and/or drug injecting networks between PWID and other most-at-risk populations reported by others. Although it is evident that unsafe injection behaviors played a significant role in driving the rise in HIV-1 prevalence among PWID, local trends in illicit opioid trafficking may have influenced injection behaviors and facilitated HIV-1 transmission as a result. Based on both epidemiologic and molecular findings, the HIV-1 epidemic does not appear to have simply spread northward from Karachi but that Larkana may have had a more significant role in the amplifying of the PWID HIV-1 epidemic. Since the transmission of HIV-1 between PWID appears to be associated with trends in drug trafficking, it is possible that intimate knowledge of the drug trade may help anticipate future HIV-1 outbreaks. It will also be interesting to compare the phylogenetic data described above with that collected from other urban centers to determine if our observations are consistent in other PWID communities throughout Pakistan.</p>
