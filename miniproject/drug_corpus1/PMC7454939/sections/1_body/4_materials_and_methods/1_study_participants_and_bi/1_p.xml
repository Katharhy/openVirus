<p>PWID were recruited from the Pakistani cities of Karachi (n = 300), Larkana (n = 300), Peshawar (n = 253), Quetta (n = 300) and Hyderabad (n = 300) from August to December, 2014. A detailed mapping of size, geography and operation typology of the PWID population was undertaken prior to the actual survey to ensure that the collected sample accurately reflects the study population. Mapping methodology is described in detail elsewhere [

After obtaining informed consent, participants were interviewed using a structured questionnaire to collect information pertaining to sociodemographics, drug use practices, social networks, sexual behavior, and utilization of services for HIV testing and care.

Among those who answered (n = 49), only 4 individuals indicated that they were receiving ARVs. At the completion of the interview, DBS specimens were collected by the standard finger prick method using a self-retracting safety lancet device. After saturating each of the five spots printed on Whatman 903 filter paper cards (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Mississauga, ON), DBS were air dried for a minimum of 3 hours at ambient temperature prior to storage at room temperature in sealed gas-impermeable bags containing desiccant pouches [
