<p>Phylogenetic clusters were inferred using a second method based on tip-to-tip (patristic) distance between sequences measured on phylogenetic trees [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Briefly, HIV-1 pol sequences from all participants were aligned using MAFFT v7.2.2.1 [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], visually inspected using AliView v.1.15 [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and codons associated with major drug-resistance mutations were removed. A distribution of 100 phylogenies was inferred using a General Time Reversible (GTR) nucleotide substitution model and FastTree2 v2.1.8 [
 <xref rid="pone.0237560.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Phylogenetic clusters of 5 or more participants consistent across all 100 trees were identified using a tip-to-tip (patristic) distance cutoff of &lt;0.02 substitutions per site. Clusters were visualized and annotated in Cytoscape v3.7.2 (
