<p>A structured coalescent based analysis was undertaken in order to investigate the spatial relationship of HIV-1 transmission among the various cities under study. The analysis was limited to subtype A1 sequences since it represents the prevalent strain of HIV-1 circulating among PWID in Pakistan. Inferred HIV-1 migrations between cities can be found in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237560.g005">Fig 5</xref> while the relevant maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree is provided in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0237560.s001">S1 Fig</xref>. In general, the highest number of southward HIV-1 migrations events were observed from Quetta to Larkana (5.18 ± 3.85 HIV-1 migration events) and Peshawar to Quetta (6.84 ± 3.86 HIV-1 migration events) while the highest northward migrations rates were observed from Karachi to Larkana (36.60 ± 24.08 HIV-1 migration events) and Larkana to Quetta (58.66 ± 24.78 HIV-1 migration events). Although, the majority of the ancestral nodes were poorly supported according to the MCC tree (posterior probability &lt;0.70, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0237560.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). This was most likely due to polytomies as a result of a high degree of sequence clustering. Time to the most common recent ancestor was relatively short (approximately 1.5 years) and Quetta was identified as the most probable ancestral node location.
