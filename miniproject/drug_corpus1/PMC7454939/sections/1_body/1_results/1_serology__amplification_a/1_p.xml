<p>Serological testing for HIV-1 determined that 367 of the 1,453 (25.6%) 2014 PWID survey participants were HIV-1 reactive while seventeen did not have sufficient specimen for testing. Amplification and sequencing of HIV-1 was attempted on all available HIV-1 serology reactive PWID specimens. In total, we were able to amplify 290 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences of the 367 (79.0%) available specimens. In general, 80% of the HIV-1 reactive DBS specimens could be amplified from each city except Hyderabad where amplification success was closer to 70%. The observed 20–30% amplification failure was likely due to nucleic acid degradation during storage [

Even though our HIV-1 genotyping primers have been validated in-house as part of the Canadian HIV-1 Strain and Drug Resistance Surveillance program, we cannot rule out the possibility of amplification failure attributed to poor primer annealing efficiency to sequences from unique HIV-1 circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) recently reported in Pakistan [
