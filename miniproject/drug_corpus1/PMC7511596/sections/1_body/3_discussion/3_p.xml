<p>In the assessment of the overlapping risk of MSM and PWID in the Asia‐Pacific region, two different patterns were observed. In Australia and New Zealand, the extensive co‐clustering of HCV between MSM and PWID concurred with the results of another study conducted in 2009, which identified two intergroup clusters within the domestic transmission network in Australia [

 <xref rid="jia225618-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>]. Considering the substantial overlap between the two risk groups, a majority of the clustered individuals in both studies had acquired HCV probably through “slamming”, the term referring to sexualized use of recreational drugs (chemsex) by injection among MSM in recent years [

 <xref rid="jia225618-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref>]. Similar to the setting of HIV epidemics, drug‐injecting MSM appeared to constitute the overlapping risk profile of HCV [
 <xref rid="jia225618-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref>]. This was further supported by the similar set of prevalent genotypes among MSM and PWID in Australia and New Zealand [
 <xref rid="jia225618-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="jia225618-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>]. On the other hand, limited co‐clustering of MSM and PWID was identified in Taipei [
 <xref rid="jia225618-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>] and Tokyo [
 <xref rid="jia225618-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>], and the coexistence of the same clade was noted in Guangxi [
 <xref rid="jia225618-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>]. Given the disclosure of both risk behaviours by a small proportion of clustered individuals in these reported studies, HCV might have spilled‐over from PWID to MSM or vice versa. These putative and limited intergroup networks could have been derived in the presence of a small number of drug‐injecting MSM instead of non‐MSM PWID. However, the limited availability of published research did not allow us to conclude definitively the occurrence of any intergroup spread in countries/cities outside Australia and New Zealand. Similar to Europe where there were dissimilar subsets of leading HCV subtypes between MSM and PWID (subtype 1a &amp; 4d for MSM versus genotype 3 for PWID) [
 <xref rid="jia225618-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="jia225618-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>], distinctive sexual transmission networks were also seen in locations in the Asia‐Pacific like China [
 <xref rid="jia225618-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="jia225618-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="jia225618-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="jia225618-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="jia225618-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="jia225618-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>] and Hong Kong [
 <xref rid="jia225618-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="jia225618-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref>]. In perspective, evidence suggests the existence of the widespread overlapping risk of HCV in Australia and New Zealand but not in Asian countries. Interpretation of HCV molecular epidemiology is, however, made more difficult by the co‐existence of two different transmission routes, which are male‐to‐male sex and drug injection. Since the two populations, MSM and PWID, are not mutually exclusive, it might be hard to dichotomize study participants for comparison if they reported both risk behaviours. Nevertheless, identification on transmission pattern between properly defined PWID and MSM should be strengthened, considering the presence of PWID‐dominant subtype 6a cluster among MSM in Taipei [
 <xref rid="jia225618-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>], and the mounting dual risk among transgender populations in South Asia [
 <xref rid="jia225618-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref>].
