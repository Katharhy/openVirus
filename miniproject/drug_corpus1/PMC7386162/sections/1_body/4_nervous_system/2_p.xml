<p id="Par15">Although many other neurological symptoms, such as headache, dizziness, conjunctivitis, and trigeminal neuralgia can be recorded in these patients, recent studies identified association with many neurological diseases. Guillain-Barre-Strohl syndrome (GBS) is an acute demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy affecting cranial nerves, dorsal and ventral radices, spinal ganglia, and peripheral nerves. A type 4 hypersensitivity disorder is usually preceded by a respiratory (M. Pneumoniae, 
 <italic>H. influenzae</italic>, CMV, EBV) or gastrointestinal (C. Jejuni). Sedaghat Z. et al [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] speculates the association between the acute polyradiculoneuropathy and COVID-19. The patient tested negative the most common abovementioned infections classically related to GBS. Although the study could not exclude the possibility of an autoimmune or paraneoplastic polyradiculoneuropathy mimicking GBS, the postinfectious etiology, the acute clinical course, and the typical neurophysiologic findings on electroneurography make alternative diagnosis less likely.
