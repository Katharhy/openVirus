<p id="Par14">One-third of patients affected with COVID-19 have nervous system involvement. Virus can be detected in brain specimens and in cerebrospinal fluid. Acute onset smell and/or taste disorders are significantly more frequent in cases of COVID-19 which is a common influenza and should be considered a focus for clinical suspicion and consideration to self-isolation procedures. Anosmia and ageusia are frequently early manifestation of COVID-19. Although pathogenetic mechanisms are still unclear, Vaira L. A. et al [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] proposed a potential explanation. Ageusia could be related to the highly expression of ACE2, identified as the cellular receptor for SARS-COV-2, on the oral mucosa and tongue. Anosmia seems not to be related to a mere local inflammatory condition in the nasal mucosa: in the absence of rhinitis symptoms, one hypothesis could be that the alterations are due to direct damage caused by the virus to the olfactory pathway.
