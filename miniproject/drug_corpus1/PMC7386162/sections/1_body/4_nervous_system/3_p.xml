The authors concluded that the presence of the characteristic features of symmetric, multifocal lesions with thalamic involvement suggests that this is a case of acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy associated with COVID-19. ANE is a rare complication of influenza and other viruses resulting from intracranial cytokine storm and resulting in blood-brain barrier damage, plausible with COVID-19 pathogenetic signature.
