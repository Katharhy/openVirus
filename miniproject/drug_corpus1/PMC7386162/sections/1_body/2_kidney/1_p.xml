<p id="Par10">Three potential pathogenic mechanisms of kidney injury secondary to COVID-19 have been identified. First, cytokine release syndrome (CRS)—aka cytokine storm—has been implicated in the development of intrarenal inflammation and increased vascular permeability. IL-6, markedly elevated in ARDS patients, plays a major role in the pathogenesis of the disease. In CRS patients who have undergone CAR-T cell therapy, the cytokine is the target of the therapy with tocilizumab and, thus, is now also being used empirically in patients with COVID-19. Second, alveolar-tubular and cardiorenal crosstalk has been implicated. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the most frequent extra-pulmonary organ failure in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), according to a recently confirmed bidirectional organ crosstalk, possibly IL-6 mediated. IL-6 is not a risk factor for ARDS development, but high levels are associated to increased mortality rate in patients with ARDS. Independent risk factors are older age, disease severity, diabetes mellitus, and acidosis. Finally renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system increases both glomerular capillary and systemic hypertension, inducing hemodynamic injury to the vascular endothelium and glomerulus. Angiotensin II and aldosterone may also promote kidney damage with direct profibrotic and proinflammatory actions.</p>
