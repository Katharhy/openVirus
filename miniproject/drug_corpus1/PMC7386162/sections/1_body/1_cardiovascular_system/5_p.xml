 <bold>.</bold> Shi S. et al [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] reported that between 57 out of 416 patients, 10.6% had coronary heart disease, 4.1% had heart failure, and 5.3% had cerebrovascular disease underlying the importance of cardiac injury in COVID-19. A case report highlights myocarditis as a complication associated with COVID-19, even without symptoms and signs of interstitial pneumonia in an otherwise healthy 53-year-old white woman [

 <bold>.</bold> Another case report [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] of an infected 69-year-old man, from Lombardy, Italy, concluded that COVID-19 infection was the most likely cause of myocarditis since tests for common causes of myocarditis (parvovirus B19, human herpes virus, Epstein-Barr virus, enterovirus, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, HIV, and hepatitis C virus) were negative. Hydrocortisone improved its clinical picture. Also, very recently, an association between COVID-19 and medium size vasculitis—Kawasaki disease—has emerged. According to older studies, a suspected association between HCoVs and Kawasaki disease could not be confirmed. However, Shirato K. et al [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] postulated that HCoV-229E is a possible causative agent for Kawasaki disease. Future case control studies are needed to settle the issue.
