<p>Most studies on the stability of a virus on a surface are based on PCR, that is by detecting a small piece of intact viral genome. For example, biosafety officers who come to laboratories to take surface samples analyse them by PCR. A positive PCR result means that at least part of the virus is there, but this does not mean that it is infectious. Eike Steinman and colleagues wrote a review on the persistence of coronaviruses on different types of surface materials [
 <xref rid="feb213784-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>]. Infection studies showed that CoV can remain infectious on glass, plastic, iron and paper for hours to even a few days. The studies were performed with non‐SARS coronaviruses, but the results are likely to be similar for SARS‐CoV‐2. In any case, you can inactivate the virus with soap, especially alkaline soap, or high concentrations of ethanol (&gt; 60%).
