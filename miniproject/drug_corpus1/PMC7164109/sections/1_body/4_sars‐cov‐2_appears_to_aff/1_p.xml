<p>Statistics worldwide show that most of the deaths are among &gt;65‐year‐old people. Children are basically just as likely as adults to get infected and to transmit the virus to other people. However, they develop milder symptoms, or none at all, and the mortality rate is practically zero. This has been observed for other coronavirus infections, but it is very different from influenza virus infections, where young children and the elderly are usually more severely affected.</p>
