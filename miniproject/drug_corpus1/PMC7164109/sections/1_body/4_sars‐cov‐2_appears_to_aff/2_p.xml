<p>No one really knows what protects children from coronaviruses. Possibly, T‐cell responses in children lead to a better elimination of the virus (perhaps also via induction of different B cell responses or higher titre of antibodies) or a different type of inflammatory response. There might be differences in the innate phase of the immune response as well, such as production of different cytokines. There might also be a difference in the level of ACE‐2 expressed on lung cells between children and adults, or even the shedding of soluble ACE‐2, which might inactivate SARS‐CoV‐2. Understanding why children have a better immune response to COVID‐19 may help develop effective therapeutic strategies for infected adults.</p>
