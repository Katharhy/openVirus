<p>Recombination typically requires the coexistence of at least two CoVs in a single infected cell, a situation which is favoured by viral persistence, that is the maintenance of viral genomes in infected cells over long periods of time. With CoVs, this has been illustrated in a study, where scientists in Wuhan (China) analysed the nucleotide sequences in faeces from bats and found a range of novel coronaviruses with variable sequences from SARS‐CoV‐1 indicative of massive rearrangements of CoV genomes in bats [
