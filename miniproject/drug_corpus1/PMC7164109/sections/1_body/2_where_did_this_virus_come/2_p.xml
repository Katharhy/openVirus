<p>However, SARS‐CoV‐2 is clearly more infectious and deadly to humans than the other endemic coronaviruses. SARS‐CoV‐2 efficiently replicates in the upper respiratory tract and can proceed into the lower respiratory tract where it exacerbates pre‐existing lung conditions. It infects human cells when the S protein located on the surface of the coronavirus particle binds with high affinity to a protein exposed on the surface of the cells in the respiratory tract. Binding occurs through the receptor‐binding domain (RBD) of the S protein. SARS‐CoV‐2, akin to several other coronaviruses, uses angiotensin‐converting enzyme‐2 (ACE‐2) as an entry port into a lung cell [
