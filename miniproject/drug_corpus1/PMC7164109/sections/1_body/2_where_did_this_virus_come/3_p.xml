<p>A recent publication discussed the available evidence on the emergence of SARS‐CoV‐2. It suggested that SARS‐CoV‐2 emerged naturally, through a recombination of at least two viruses: a bat β‐coronavirus (β‐CoV) (genus 
 <italic>Rhinolophus</italic>) and a pangolin β‐CoV, neither of which normally infects humans [
 <xref rid="feb213784-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>]. The bat β‐CoV is 96% similar to SARS‐CoV‐2, but it has a divergent receptor‐binding domain in the S protein (only 60% similar to SARS‐CoV‐2) and binds poorly to human ACE‐2. This makes it unlikely to enter human cells. The pangolin β‐CoV is only 90% similar to SARS‐CoV‐2, but the RBD of its S protein has 99% similarity with SARS‐CoV‐2, and it has high affinity to ACE‐2 [
 <xref rid="feb213784-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>]. In fact, its affinity to ACE‐2 is higher than that of the SARS‐CoV‐1 RBD, as indicated in two recent studies [
