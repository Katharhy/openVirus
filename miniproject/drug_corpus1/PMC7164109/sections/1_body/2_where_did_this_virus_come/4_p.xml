<p>A likely scenario for the origin of SARS‐CoV‐2 is that the bat and the pangolin β‐CoVs have infected one and the same organism (we do not know which one exactly), and their genes recombined, resulting in the insertion of the pangolin RBD into the S protein of the bat β‐CoV. The RBD from the pangolin virus has additional implications for the infectious nature of SARS‐CoV‐2. It harbours a furin enzyme cleavage site. Cleavage of the S protein at a furin cleavage site facilitates the entry of many viruses, including influenza viruses and CoVs into human cells. The importance of proteolytic cleavage at the furin cleavage site for the zoonotic transmission of viruses is in part based on experimental data with the MERS‐like CoV from bats, which cannot efficiently enter human cells, unless small amounts of trypsin protease are added to the virion to mimic the furin cleavage of the S protein [
