<p>Other therapeutic approaches involve the use of antivirals, such as remdesivir, which is a nucleoside analogue that inhibits the replication of the viral genome. It works very well in cell culture against SARS‐CoV‐1 and SARS‐CoV‐2 [

 <xref rid="feb213784-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>]. Other strategies explore the use of furin protease inhibitors. Researchers around the world are making strong efforts to prepare cocktails of monoclonal antibodies that can neutralise the virus. If this works, it can be scaled up and used for patients with acute infection, in order to reduce the viral load. However, this approach is expensive and may be difficult to distribute because it involves biologicals which are subject to denaturation if stored improperly, or not kept in a cold chain. In addition, it is unclear how long‐lasting the effects of antivirals can be, because drug‐resistant viruses will inevitably emerge. Nevertheless, direct antivirals will be useful, as they buy time while patients develop immunity.
