<p>A vaccine is definitely the best route as it can protect a large portion of the human population on an affordable basis. The low mutation rate of SARS‐CoV‐2 means that the chances of obtaining an effective and long‐lasting vaccine are rather high. It will take 12–18 months to get the vaccine, however, unless someone finds a shortcut to make it faster. But shortcuts are dangerous since a vaccine failure may have devastating effects on society in terms of acceptance of vaccines in the future. We should only introduce a vaccine in humans after it has gone through animal trials, and we prove that it has antiviral efficacy.</p>
