<p>Alternative approaches involve developing inhibitors that target physiological functions that are not viral, but cell‐based, and are important for viral infectivity. For example, if we inhibit ACE‐2, we can slow down viral entry. This of course will also inhibit the receptor’s physiological function, but researchers believe the body could tolerate the inhibition. Yet, viruses have been shown to be able to switch cell receptors in some cases. Receptor‐targeting approaches might not be effective in the long run. Finally, doctors are using an IL6 receptor blocker, developed by Roche for treating rheumatoid arthritis. This drug basically inhibits the inflammatory response, easing out the symptoms in people who are heavily infected with lower respiratory disease. Whether an overshooting inflammatory response is a universal feature of lower respiratory tract SARS‐CoV‐2 infection remains to be seen.</p>
