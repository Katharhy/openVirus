<p>Viral transmission is measured with the transmission factor, R0. To have a better idea, when R0 &lt; 1 the virus will disappear from the population over time, whereas R0&gt; 2 means that the spread is exponential. One of the earliest hotspots of the virus was on the Diamond Princess cruise ship off the coast of Japan. A study performed on that ship showed that when social distancing was not implemented in the early phase of the epidemic, the transmission factor of SARS‐CoV‐2 was in the range of 15. This means that each infected person on the boat transferred the infection on average to 15 uninfected individuals. This is a very high transmission factor, similar to measles virus, and highlights the importance of social distancing in limiting the spread of the COVID‐19 [
