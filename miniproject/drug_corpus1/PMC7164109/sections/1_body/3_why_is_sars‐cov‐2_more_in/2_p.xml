<p>Mechanistically, we do not know all the factors that contribute to the high transmissibility of SARS‐CoV‐2. The furin cleavage site in the S protein likely makes the virus more transmissible. There are a number of possible ways that furin cleavage can cause increased transmissibility: the S protein could more easily detach from the cells enhancing viral shedding into aerosols; it could enhance replication or assembly of the virus; or it could increase their replication in the upper respiratory tract, which makes the virus easily exhaled (i.e. it goes in the aerosols with high efficiency).</p>
