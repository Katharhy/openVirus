<p>Viruses replicate rapidly and accumulate mutations due to their error‐prone viral polymerase, which allows them to adapt to changes in the immune system or different tissues in an organism. Yet, the coronaviruses encode several accessory proteins which reduce the error rate to about 1 in 0.5–2 million bases [

 <xref rid="feb213784-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>]. This means that only one out of 15–60 progeny viruses has a single point mutation in its genome. This is much lower than other RNA viruses and renders coronaviruses genetically rather stable, unless they recombine their genomes with a related CoV. In addition, the vast majority of the mutations have no phenotype, and they do not change viral infectivity. So, the good news is that SARS‐CoV‐2 has a low mutation rate (just one or two nucleotides a month, compared to four–eight nucleotides a month in influenza virus). Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the circulating virus has mutated to a more aggressive phenotype from November 2019 to March 2020.
