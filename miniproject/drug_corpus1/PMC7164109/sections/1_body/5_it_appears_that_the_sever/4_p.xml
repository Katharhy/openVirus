<p>In conclusion, unfounded speculation about virulence increase of the circulating SARS‐CoV‐2 can be detrimental to the community, as it confuses people and accelerates irrational decision‐making. There is absolutely no evidence as far as I understand that SARS‐CoV‐2 has become more aggressive in the course of the pandemic. Mortality rates may appear different due to different numbers of tests performed, different age groups tested, or different social behaviour between populations.</p>
