<p>A recent study conducted in Beijing sequenced 103 SARS‐CoV‐2 genomes and classified them into two groups, L and S, based on 2 nucleotide differences between them [

 <xref rid="feb213784-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>]). There is no convincing evidence that these two mutations are associated with the severity of the disease. Unless reverse genetics is used to study the questionable mutations, correlations between genetic changes and phenotypic changes in the course of an epidemic or pandemic are indirect, and strong claims are not justified.
