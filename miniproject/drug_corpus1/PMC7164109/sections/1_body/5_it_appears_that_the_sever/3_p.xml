<p>Occasionally, mutations can be detrimental to viral infectivity. A study on SARS‐CoV‐1, the virus that caused the human pandemic in 2002–2003, showed that a deletion of 29 nucleotides in open reading frame eight occurred along the initial human‐to‐human transmission chain. Cell culture experiments showed that this mutation caused a severe loss of fitness [

Unfortunately, such a mutation may not help in resolving the current SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic, as the wild‐type strain is highly prevalent.
