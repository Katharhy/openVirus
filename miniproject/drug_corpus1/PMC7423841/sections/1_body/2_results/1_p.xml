<p>Twenty complete or near complete genomes of norovirus strains were obtained from the samples sequenced using Illumina HiSeq. An average of 11,510,081 reads were generated per sample. The number of reads and the average coverage of each base for NoV is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. The sequences generated presented 7,503 nt in length on average [excluding the poly(A) tail]. The open reading frames (ORFs) were 5,094 (ORF1), 1,623 (ORF2), and 807 nt (ORF3) in length.
