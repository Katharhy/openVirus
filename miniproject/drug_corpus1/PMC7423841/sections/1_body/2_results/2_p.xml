<p>The maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of the complete ORF2 gene (1,623 nt) demonstrated that the epidemic strain segregated in two larger clades within the Sydney lineage, collected from 2012 to 2016. The GII.P16/GII.4 sequences of this study clustered with other emerging recombinants from China and the United States (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Sequence analysis in BLASTn demonstrated that these sequences had 98.8 and 98.6% nucleotide identity with other GII.P16/GII.4 recombinant strains from the United States (MK764013) and United Kingdom (KY887601), respectively. High nucleotide identity (&gt;98%) was also observed with the first report of a complete genome sequence of norovirus GII.P16/GII.4, isolated in Japan (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The GII.4_Sydney strains that have the GII.P16 polymerase form an independent clade of the other Sydney variants.
