<p>The capsid gene of this new recombinant (GII.P16/GII.4) shared 96.8% nucleotide identity with the capsid gene of the GII.4_Sydney prototype isolated in 2012 (JX459908) and 96.4% with GII.4[P31] from the same city of Brazil (MT474032), indicating that the nucleotide substitutions accumulated over the years, as expected for norovirus strains. GII.P16/GII.4 strains of this study presented changes in amino acids 310, 333, 373, and 393 and of the antigenic sites in the P2 subdomain (
