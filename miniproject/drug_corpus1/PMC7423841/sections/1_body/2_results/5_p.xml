<p>To reconstruct the time-scaled phylogenetic tree of the ORF1 gene (5,100 nt) for the RdRp of norovirus GII.P16, the Bayesian MCMC method was used with the best model lognormal GMRF Bayesian Skyrideon a strict clock. The path sampling (PS) and stepping-stone sampling (SS) parameters used in the evolutionary analysis are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>. The phylogenetic tree formed six clades classified into different capsid genotypes and locations. The cluster GII.P16/GII.4 was closer to the GII.P16/GII.2 Chinese strains. Notably, GII.P16-GII.2 re-emerged in Japan (2013–2014) with nucleotide modifications. Furthermore, the cluster GII.P16-GII.4_Sydney_2012 contained samples from the United Kingdom, United States and Japan described in 2016, including the LC175467 prototype (

 <sup>–3</sup> substitutions/site/year. Moreover, the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of GII.P16 strains was estimated in 2011 (2011–2012, 95% HPD) (
