<p>The GII.P31/GII.4_Sydney sequence isolates in this study showed a high degree of pairwise identity (more than 98%) with Japanese (AB972473), Brazilian (MN307994, MN308017), and American (KY486271) strains. BLAST analysis showed that the capsid gene sequence (1,623 bp) shared 97.2â€“99% identity with the Sydney prototype isolate obtained in 2012 (JX459908).</p>
