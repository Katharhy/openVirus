<p>NoVs are genetically diverse and classified into at least 10 genogroups (GI-GX) and more than 45 genotypes (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">ICTV Virus Taxonomy, 2020</xref>). Despite the wide variability in NoVs, the GII genogroup is responsible for most cases in humans, especially the GII.4 genotype, which has been most associated with outbreaks and sporadic cases of viral gastroenteritis. The viral genome is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 7.6 kb with a polyA tail. It is organized in three open reading frames (ORF1-3) (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Green, 2013</xref>). ORF1 encodes a large polyprotein that after cleavage forms six non-structural proteins, including the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) involved in replication. ORF2 encodes the major capsid protein (VP1) structurally comprised of two domains, shell (S) and protruding (P). The P domain is subdivided into the P1 and P2 subdomains. Antigenic sites and carbohydrates binding-sites map into the P2 subdomain, both playing a major role in susceptibility to norovirus infection (
