<p>To construct a time-scaled phylogenetic tree, a dataset formed of full or near-full GII.P16 ORF1 sequences (
 <italic>n</italic> = 117) available in GenBank combined with three complete GII.P16 sequences from Bel√©m was generated. The dataset was subjected to Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis implemented in BEAST software v1.10.8 (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Drummond et al., 2012</xref>). GTR + I + G was the nucleotide substitution model used. To choose the most appropriate molecular clock and the spatial model, several models were tested, and higher values of path sampling (ps) and stepping stone (ss) indicated the best model fit. A final clock ran in triplicate with 50 million generations.
