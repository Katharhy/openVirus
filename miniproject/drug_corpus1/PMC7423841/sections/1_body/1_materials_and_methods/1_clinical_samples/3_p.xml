<p>Considering the information available on norovirus epidemiological surveillance, 28 samples were selected for whole genome sequencing. The samples were previously characterized as the genotype GII.P31/GII.4 as well as three samples as GII.P16/GII.4 by direct sequencing of short genomic fragments (from 200 to 250 bp). To provide temporal representation, the samples were distributed by year and State, as shown in
