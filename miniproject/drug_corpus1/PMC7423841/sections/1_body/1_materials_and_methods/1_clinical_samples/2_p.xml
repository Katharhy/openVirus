<p>Stool samples analyzed in this study were collected between 2012 and 2016. From January 2010 to December 2016, 32.8% (557/1698) of the samples from the study region were positive for norovirus by the EIA test. GII.4 was the genotype most frequently detected, with the emergence of the GII.P31/GII.4-Sydney 2012, GII.17_2014 and GII.P16/GII.4 strains. Reports about GII.P31/GII.4 and GII.17_2014, as well as the temporal distribution and emergence period of these strains, have already been described (
