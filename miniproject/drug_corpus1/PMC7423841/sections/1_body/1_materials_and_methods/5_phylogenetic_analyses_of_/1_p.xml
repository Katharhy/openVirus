<p>The complete norovirus ORF2 sequences from this study were aligned with a database composed by 1369 genomes obtained from all norovirus GII.4 sequences of GenBank. To remove redundant sequences, CD-HIT was applied, resulting in 947 sequences. After removing identical sequences using as cut-off based on the e-value of the classification in groups with CD-HIT, 191 genomes had full VP1 sequences that were used to reconstruct the phylogeny. All sequences were aligned with Mafft (

To confirm the clades within GII.4_Sydney, we performed another ML tree, including all GII.4 variants with GII.P31, GII.P16 and GII.P4 polymerases, totalizing 342 sequences of diverse sizes. The parameters were the same previously described for RaxML.
