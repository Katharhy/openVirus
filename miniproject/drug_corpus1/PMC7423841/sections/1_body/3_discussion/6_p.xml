<p>The GII.P16 genotype has already been associated with several different capsid genotypes (GII.P16-GII.2, GII.P16-GII.3, GII.P16-GII.4, GII.P16-GII.1, GII.P16-GII.12, GII.P16-GII.10) (

 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Lun et al., 2018</xref>). This hypothesis was supported in this study, since strains clustered closer in the temporal reconstruction tree, and the TMRCA of both strains emerged in 2010. In conclusion, the results obtained strongly suggest that the recombinant GII.P16/GII.4 originated from the strains GII.P16/GII.2 and GII.P31/GII.4_Sydney.
