<p>While in this study we sequenced only samples from two states, making it difficult to fully recapitulate the evolutionary history of these pandemic viruses in Brazil, we present the first complete (or nearly complete) genome sequences of GII.P16/GII.4 viruses in Brazil. This information could facilitate the understanding of geographical distribution of this genotype at global level.</p>
