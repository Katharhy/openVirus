<p>Several studies have investigated the evolutionary pattern of norovirus, especially using partial regions of the genome and the VP1 gene (

 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Parra et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Tohma et al., 2018</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). However, a very limited number of studies have evaluated the evolutionary rate of the ORF1 gene. We found a time-scaled evolutionary tree of the complete ORF1 similar to that observed using GII.P16/GII.2 strains (2.03 × 10
 <sup>–3</sup> s/s/y) (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Nagasawa et al., 2018</xref>). 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Ozaki et al. (2018)</xref> estimated the evolutionary rate at 2.82 × 10
 <sup>–3</sup> s/s/y for strains of the GII genogroup considering RdRp; however, each genotype has an evolutionary mechanism. Evolutionary analyses may vary depending on the genotype and the database used (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Ozaki et al., 2018</xref>). The evolutionary rate found in our study is consistent for a conserved region of the genome such as ORF1. Viral genes involved in replication tend to undergo fewer changes in their proteins compared to the viral capsid. Thus, any change in these genes can have a major impact on viral fitness as proposed for the GII.P16/GII.4 strains.
