<p>While in this study we removing identical sequences to decrease the computational time-consuming, creating a selection-bias, we possibly ignored important temporal information. This limitation may have influenced to fully recapitulate the evolutionary history of GII.P16 sequences, including the tMRCA values. 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Nagasawa et al. (2018)</xref> found a common ancestor for the GII.P16/GII.2 strain detected between 2016 and 2017 in 1999, 17 years earlier that when they predominated. The only study that analyzed the tMRCA of GII.P16/GII.4 strains found values 2 years later (2013) (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Ruis et al., 2017</xref>) of those obtained in this study (2011), which reinforces the importance of conducting more studies like this one. This difference may be linked to the non-random selection of sequences, however, more studies should be conducted to clarify the ancestry of this recombinant.
