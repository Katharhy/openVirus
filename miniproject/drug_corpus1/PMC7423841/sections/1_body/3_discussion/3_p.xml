<p>The GII.P16/GII.4 strain emerged in the Amazon region in 2015 and was detected in 16.9% (16/95) of the cases during 2015â€“2016, being the second most prevalent virus since GII.P31/GII.4, which corresponded to 50.5% (48/95) of the NoV-positive cases (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Costa et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, nucleotide analysis by BLASTn indicated that the strains circulating in Brazil had high identity with sequences of GII.P16/GII.4 from the United States (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Barclay et al., 2019</xref>) and United Kingdom (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Ruis et al., 2017</xref>). These data suggest a possible importation of this strain from other countries, considering previous descriptions about the circulation of this genotype in other places.
