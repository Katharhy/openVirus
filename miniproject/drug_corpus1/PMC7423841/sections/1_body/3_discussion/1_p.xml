<p>Here, we demonstrated the evolutionary and molecular analysis of GII.4 strains detected in the states of Pará and Manaus, Brazil. In Brazil, the epidemiology of the norovirus GII.4 strain has been well established in recent years. Previous studies conducted by 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hernandez et al. (2018)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Reymão et al. (2018)</xref> demonstrated the emergence of the GII.P31/GII.4_Sydney lineage in 2012 and its high frequency from 2012 to 2016. Also, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Fioretti et al. (2014)</xref> observed the rapid evolutionary dynamics in GII.4 variants in several regions of Brazil.
