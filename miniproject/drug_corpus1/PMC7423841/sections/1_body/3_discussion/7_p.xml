<p>In recent years, most studies on norovirus immunogenicity have focused on the antigenic sites involved in the blocking of HBGA carbohydrates, namely A-G (

 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Tohma et al., 2019</xref>). Several studies have shown that amino acid changes in these epitopes result in the ability to escape from the action of the immune system, leading to global epidemics, as demonstrated in the GII.4 Sydney_2012 lineage. In this study, we analyzed the epitopes (A-G), extensions of previously predicted and new uncharacterized antigenic sites proposed by 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Tohma et al. (2019)</xref>. The GII.P16/GII.4 strains presented the same changes in amino acids 310, 333, 373, and 393 of the antigenic sites in the P2 subdomain already described previously among the GII.P16_GII.4 strains (

 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Ruis et al., 2017</xref>), which were not presented in the reference GII.P31/GII.4_Sydney_2012 strain. Some of these changes seem to be very frequent in GII.P31/GII.4 strains. These corroborates with previous studies that observed the new GII.P16 polymerase recombinant with GII.4 capsid as a component of viral fitness, which might have influenced the transmissibility and spread of this virus (
