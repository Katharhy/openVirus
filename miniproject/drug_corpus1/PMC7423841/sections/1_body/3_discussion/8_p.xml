<p>Therefore, the cause of the emergence of this strain in several countries could be changes occurring in the ORF1 region. We found AA changes in non-structural proteins such as p48, p22, and RdRp that could directly affect viral replication. Considering specifically p22 and p48, diverse pathways can be altered, as these proteins have a role in blocking the host secretory pathway, which avoids cytokine secretion and the complement system cascade (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Roth and Karst, 2016</xref>). Considering that noroviruses have high recombination rates and that the GII.4 genotype was prevalent in several places for a long time, additional and continuous evolutionary analyses of this genotype should be needed in the future.
