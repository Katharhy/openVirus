<p>GII.4_Sydney variant predominated for several years with the GII.P31 (GII.Pe) polymerase. However, in 2015â€“2016 emerged as GII.P16/GII.4_Sydney recombinant. In the same period, it was observed the co-circulation of all circulating pandemic strains related worldwide in samples from Northern region of Brazil, including the GII.P16/GII.4 (

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Barreira et al. (2017)</xref> detected GII.P16/GII.4 circulating in the Southeastern Brazilian coast state among children up 11 years old. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the molecular features of NoV-GII.4 strains in two states of the Northern region of Brazil, to better understand the circulation of these pandemic viruses in this country.
