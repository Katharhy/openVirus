  <p>Alignment of antigenic residues of major capsid protein (P2 region) of GII.P31/GII.4 (GII.P31 formerly known as GII.Pe) and GII.P16/GII.4 strains. Residues mapping on previously characterized A-H epitopes. The prototype strain representative of GII.P31/GII.4 variant that emerged 2012 is highlighted in gray. Amino acid residues that differ from those of the prototype is highlighted in blue. Sequences of this study are in bold.</p>
