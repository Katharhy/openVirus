  <p>Phylogenetic tree constructed by maximum likelihood method based on the ORF2 gene of 342 nucleotide sequences of norovirus GII.4 (GII.P31, GII.P16, and GII.4 polymerases). Bootstrap values equal to or more than 90% are represented in blue circles. The pink clades represent the GII.P31/GII.4 variant (GII.P31 formerly known as GII.Pe), the blue clades represent the GII.P16/GII.4 strains, and the green clades represent the GII.P4/GII.4 strains. The green triangle indicates samples from the city of Belém, Pará and the green square for samples from the city of Manaus, Amazonas. The outgroup used was the New Orleans strain (MG892083).</p>
