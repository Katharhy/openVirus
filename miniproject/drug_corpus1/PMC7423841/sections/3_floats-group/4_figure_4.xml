 <caption>
  <p>Time-scaled phylogenetic tree of the 117 sequences based on the whole nucleotide sequence of the ORF1 gene of human norovirus GII.P16 genotype strains. The tree was constructed using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (MCMC) and the GTR + I + G nucleotide substitution model. Branches are colored according to the distinct norovirus genotype. Norovirus strains isolated in this study are colored blue. The scale bar represents the unit of time (years).</p>
