  <p>Overview of dendritic cell subsets in the lung and DC-mediated immune responses. After influenza virus infection, viral antigen-captured cDCs migrate to lymph nodes draining from the lung where they promote the activation of adaptive immune responses via antigen presentation. Both cDC1s and cDC2s have the capacity to induce CD4
   <sup>+</sup> and CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cell activation, but cDC1s are generally characterized as cross-presenting DCs. pDCs, which produce type I IFNs, play a minor role in anti-influenza virus responses, and MoDCs are associated with immunopathology. *Human-specific marker.
