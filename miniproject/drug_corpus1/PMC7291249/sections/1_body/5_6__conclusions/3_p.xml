<p>The lack of proofreading ability in the viral RNA polymerase results in high mutation rates and the rapid evolution of influenza. The resulting changes in the protein targets of anti-influenza medications can lead to the rapid emergence of antiviral resistance. At present, there are three classes of FDA-approved influenza drugs targeting the influenza virus replication cycle. While these drugs are currently effective, a shifting pattern of changes in the viral genome can cause drug resistance and corresponding reductions in therapeutic efficacy. For example, most IAVs are now resistant to M2 channel inhibitors, and resistance to NA inhibitors has been reported with varying frequency across seasonal outbreaks [
