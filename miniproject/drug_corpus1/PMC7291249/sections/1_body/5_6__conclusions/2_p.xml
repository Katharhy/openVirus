<p>Immunogenicity has been a major concern for influenza vaccine development. Novel types of vaccines, such as recombinant vaccines, DNA vaccines, and mRNA vaccines, are relatively poorly immunogenic [
 <xref rid="B179-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">179</xref>], and several approaches have been tested to enhance their potency. For example, the inclusion of flagellin, a TLR5 agonist, has been shown to increase the effectiveness of recombinant influenza vaccines [

 <xref rid="B181-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>]. Similarly, the inclusion of a RIG-I agonist increases humoral immune responses to DNA influenza vaccines [
 <xref rid="B182-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">182</xref>], suggesting that innate sensor agonists can improve the immunogenicity of new types of influenza vaccines. In order to overcome the limitations of traditional and emerging influenza vaccines, it is necessary to first understand the complex interplay between host immune responses and the pathologic mechanisms of influenza viruses.
