<p>Influenza remains a major annual public health burden. Further, the average annual total economic burden of influenza has been estimated at $11.2 billion in the United States alone [
 <xref rid="B174-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>], and 294,000â€“518,000 deaths are caused by flu-related complications around the world each year [

Vaccination remains the best way to prevent influenza infection. Flu vaccines contain virus strains that are expected to circulate during the upcoming flu season, and vaccination can provide effective protection against viral infection. However, because influenza viruses constantly change their antigens to escape from vaccine-induced protection, we require a new flu vaccine each year. A long-standing goal of influenza research is the development of universal vaccines that provide protection against multiple subtypes of influenza viruses. Current studies are mainly focused on identifying conserved influenza epitopes, and the highly conserved HA stem has been suggested as one such promising target for universal vaccines [

Despite these encouraging recent developments, it is clear that further research is required to improve the effectiveness of universal vaccines. The current licensed influenza vaccine products have several limitations. Although the live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines can both confer virus-specific neutralizing antibody responses, only the live-attenuated vaccine induces cell-mediated immune responses [
