<p>TLR7, the receptor for single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), is involved in the recognition of the influenza virus [
 <xref rid="B69-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) express TLR7 in their endosomes, implying that the detection of ssRNA by TLR7 can occur prior to actual viral replication in pDCs [
 <xref rid="B70-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. TLR7 signaling induces the activation of IRF7 and NF-κB via the MyD88-mediated pathway, which initiates the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs. Due to conflicting results from previous studies, it remains unclear whether TLR7-MyD88 signaling is necessary for the protection against influenza infection. However, TLR7 deficiency results in attenuated production of type I IFN by pDCs [

 <xref rid="B71-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], and impaired activation and production of IFN-γ by lung natural killer cells (NK cells) during infection [
 <xref rid="B72-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], suggesting that TLR7 is responsible for efficient innate immune responses against the influenza virus. Indeed, prior evidence has supported the function of TLR7-MyD88 signaling in humoral responses [
