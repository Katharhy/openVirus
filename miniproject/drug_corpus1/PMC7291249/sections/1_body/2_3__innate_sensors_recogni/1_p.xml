<p>After entering the host, the influenza virus infects bronchiolar-alveolar epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract and replicates to spread throughout the airways [

 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The innate immune system is the first protective barrier against invading organisms and is responsible for the initiation of adaptive immune responses. To detect invading pathogens, cells of the innate immune system have pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and initiate innate immune responses. Recognition of the influenza virus is mediated by several types of PRRs, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), and the cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS) pathway. Activation of PRRs results in the expression and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs, which establish an antiviral immune microenvironment.
