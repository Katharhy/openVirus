<p>Several lines of evidence support a crucial role for the inflammasome in cellular defense against influenza virus infection. Inflammasome-deficient mice have impaired recruitment of monocytes and granulocytes to the lung and suffer from significantly increased disease severity compared to control mice. Although inflammasome deficiency did not affect viral clearance within the first 6 days after infection, late viral clearance (7â€“10 days post-infection) was significantly decreased by inflammasome deficiency [

Prior work has shown that the inflammasome plays a critical role in the activation of T and B cell responses against the influenza virus during low dose infection; deficiency of the inflammasome adaptor protein ASC and the downstream protein caspase-1 lead to impaired adaptive immune responses [
