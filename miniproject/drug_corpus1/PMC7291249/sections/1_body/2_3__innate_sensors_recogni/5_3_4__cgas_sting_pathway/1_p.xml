<p>cGAS is a well-known cytosolic DNA sensor that mediates cytosolic DNA-induced immune responses though its downstream signaling molecule, stimulator of interferon genes (STING) [
 <xref rid="B86-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Accumulation of cytosolic DNA triggers activation of cGAS-STING, resulting in the production of type I IFN and inflammatory cytokines through activation of IRF3 and NF-κB. Self-DNA, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), viral DNA, and bacterial DNAs are known ligands of cGAS [

 <xref rid="B91-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. It is well established that the cGAS-STING pathway plays an important role in the defense against DNA viruses including the herpes simplex virus [
 <xref rid="B92-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Interestingly, a recent study has revealed that infection with influenza, an RNA virus, also activates the cGAS-STING pathway [
 <xref rid="B93-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. After influenza virus infection, the M2 protein promotes the release of mtDNA into the cytosol, where it stimulates the cGAS pathway. Interestingly, the influenza virus NS1 protein appears to associate with mtDNA and inhibit mtDNA-induced expression of IFN-β. In addition, the relative expression of IFN-β mRNA in flu-infected lung tissue is reduced in cGAS- or STING-deficient mice. However, it is still unclear whether the cGAS-STING pathway is crucial for host survival after influenza virus infection.
