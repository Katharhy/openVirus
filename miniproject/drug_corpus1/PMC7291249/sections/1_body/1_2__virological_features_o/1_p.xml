<p>The influenza virus is a respiratory pathogen that causes acute febrile disease called influenza or flu. It belongs to the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family and can infect diverse host species including humans, pigs, and birds. The influenza viruses that cause disease in humans are classified into three types—influenza type A, B, and C—primarily based on antigenic differences in their NP and M proteins [

 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, it remains unclear whether influenza D virus (IDV) can cause disease in humans. While IDV infection in humans has not yet been reported, IDV specific antibodies have been detected in human serum samples from cattle-exposed workers, indicating that this virus has the potential to elicit an immune response in humans [
