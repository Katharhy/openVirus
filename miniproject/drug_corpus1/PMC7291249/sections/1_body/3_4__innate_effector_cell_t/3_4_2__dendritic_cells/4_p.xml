<p>cDC2 subsets are considered to be potent presenters of MHC-II-loaded antigens to CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells [
 <xref rid="B135-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. While cDC1 subsets are the dominant DC population that transports antigens to lymph nodes that drain from the lung, cDC2s remain the dominant source of proinflammatory cytokines produced in the lung [
 <xref rid="B131-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. Despite the increased presence of cDC2s in lymph nodes that drain from the lungs during influenza virus infection, these cells rarely carried intact viral antigens [
 <xref rid="B127-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. Consistently, migratory cDC2s are less efficient at priming and expanding antigen-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells compared to migratory cDC1s [

 <xref rid="B129-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. However, cDC2s have the potential to cross-present antigens to CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells [
 <xref rid="B136-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>], and a recent study demonstrated that IRF4-dependent DCs that express CD11b
 <sup>+</sup>CD24
 <sup>hi</sup> contribute to the development of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell memory responses following IAV infection, suggesting that cDC2s promote the differentiation of memory CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells [
 <xref rid="B137-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. Further investigation is required to better understand the role of cDC1s and cDC2s in the response to influenza virus infection.
