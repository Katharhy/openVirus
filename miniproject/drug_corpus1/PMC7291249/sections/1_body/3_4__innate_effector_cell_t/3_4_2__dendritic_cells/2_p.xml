<p>In the lungs, DCs are classified into migratory conventional DCs (cDCs), and pDCs at a steady state, and monocyte-derived DCs (MoDCs) are produced after exposure to inflammatory stimuli [

 <sup>+</sup> cDCs are distinguished by the surface expression of markers CD103
 <sup>+</sup> migratory cDC1, and CD11b
 <sup>+</sup> migratory cDC2 in mice, and CD141

 <sup>+</sup> (BDCA-1), cDC2 in humans [
 <xref rid="B125-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. Several studies have suggested that the various DC subsets have specialized functions in the response to influenza virus infection. Remarkably, respiratory DC subsets display different susceptibility to influenza virus infection. cDC1 is more susceptible to influenza virus infection than cDC2 and pDCs [
 <xref rid="B126-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>], but influenza infection of cDC1 does not lead to productive viral replication [
 <xref rid="B127-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. Following influenza infection, lung-migratory cDCs take up viral antigen and migrate to the draining mediastinal lymph nodes (mLNs) where they present antigens to na√Øve T cells and induce adaptive immune responses. In the mLNs, migratory and resident cDCs can both prime T cells, and are subdivided into CD8
 <sup>+</sup> cDC1 and CD11b
 <sup>+</sup> cDC2. While resident CD8
 <sup>+</sup> cDC1s in the mLNs have the potential to activate CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells [
 <xref rid="B128-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>], mLN-resident cDCs seem to be less effective at inducing anti-influenza CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses [

 <xref rid="B129-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. More research is needed to clarify the specific role of mLN-resident cDCs in the anti-influenza response.
