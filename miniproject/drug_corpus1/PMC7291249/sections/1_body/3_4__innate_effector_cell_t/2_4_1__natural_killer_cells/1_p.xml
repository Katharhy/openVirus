<p>Innate cells are initially recruited to the site of infection from the systemic circulation by the proinflammatory cytokines that are released by infected lung epithelial cells. NK cells recognize HA on influenza-infected cells via NKp44 and NKp46 receptors [

 <xref rid="B99-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>] or detect antibody-coated infected cells via CD16 [
 <xref rid="B100-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Then, activated NK cells lyse the infected cells by secreting perforin and granzyme [

 <xref rid="B102-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Defects in NK cells lead to increased susceptibility to influenza infection and uncontrolled viral growth in the lungs [

 <xref rid="B104-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. However, excessive NK cell-induced inflammation can also contribute to pathology following high dose influenza virus infection [

 <xref rid="B107-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. Neutrophils rapidly migrate to the site of infection and initiate phagocytosis, degranulation, and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps [
 <xref rid="B108-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. The importance of neutrophils has been demonstrated in animal studies showing that neutrophil depletion leads to increased influenza mortality due to impaired viral clearance [

 <xref rid="B110-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Neutropenic mice display reduced flu-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses in the respiratory tract [
 <xref rid="B111-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Further to this, neutrophils guide CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells to the infection site by leaving a trail of CXCL12 [
 <xref rid="B112-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. These studies indicate that neutrophils play a protective role in influenza infection, but that excessive recruitment of neutrophils can also contribute to immunopathology [
