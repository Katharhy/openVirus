<p>Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are lung-resident macrophages that control lung homeostasis at steady state and phagocytose opsonized pathogens and infected cells [

 <xref rid="B115-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. There are several lines of evidence supporting the protective role of AMs during influenza infection. Clodronate-induced depletion of AMs increases the mortality of mice and enhances pulmonary inflammation during influenza infection [

 <sup>−</sup> mice, which are deficient in AM development, experience respiratory failure and reduced resistance to influenza infection despite having normal adaptive immune responses against influenza virus [
 <xref rid="B117-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Consistently, an AM depletion model in CD169-DTR mice led to aggressive inflammatory responses and severe lung pathology after influenza infection [
 <xref rid="B118-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. AMs control lung dysfunction by increasing the antiviral resistance of type-1 alveolar epithelial cells, which are responsible for gas exchange [
 <xref rid="B119-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. These results indicate that AMs play a crucial role in maintaining pulmonary homeostasis during influenza infection.
