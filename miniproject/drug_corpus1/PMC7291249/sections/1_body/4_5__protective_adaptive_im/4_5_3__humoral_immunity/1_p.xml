<p>The protective role of B cells in the anti-influenza virus immune response has been extensively studied in recent years. During influenza virus infection, naïve B cells in the mLNs encounter the influenza virus antigen and differentiate into antibody-forming cells (AFCs). B lymphocyte-deficient μMT mice are more susceptible to influenza virus infection compared to wild-type mice [

Antibodies specific for HA and NA are important for protective immunity because these proteins are responsible for viral entry and release. HA-specific antibodies bind to the HA globular head and inhibit the attachment of the virus to the host cell’s surface [

 <xref rid="B168-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>]. This mechanism of viral inactivation is called neutralization. NA-specific antibodies do not neutralize the virus, but instead block viral replication by inhibiting the enzymatic activity of NA [

 <xref rid="B169-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>]. M2 proteins are also the target of specific antibodies. Passive transfer of M2-specific antibodies provide protection against viral replication [
 <xref rid="B170-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>]. Surprisingly, NP-specific antibodies are protective in nature despite having an internal viral protein as their target [

In addition to the previously described functions, influenza virus-specific antibodies mediate antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis. Therefore, these antibodies also contribute significantly to the clearance of infected cells [
 <xref rid="B172-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]. Moreover, B-1 cells that produce natural IgM, independent of antigenic priming, contribute to protection against influenza virus infection. Natural IgM in the airway has neutralizing activity and mediates early immune responses [
