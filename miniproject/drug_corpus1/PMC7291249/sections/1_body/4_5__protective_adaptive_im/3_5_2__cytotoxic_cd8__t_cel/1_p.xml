<p>CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells are important for viral clearance and host protection during influenza virus infection. CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells recognize viral antigens loaded onto MHC class I proteins on the surface of viral antigen-presenting cells. CD8
 <sup>+</sup> responses reach a maximum at 8 days after infection in the draining mLN and at 10 days post-infection in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) [

 <xref rid="B154-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. β2-Microglobulin-deficient mice, which lack CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, display delayed viral clearance and severe mortality following influenza virus infection [
 <xref rid="B155-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. Activated cytotoxic CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells (CTLs) eliminate virus-infected cells via cytolysis. They produce perforin to permeabilize the membranes of infected host cells and secrete granzyme into cells to induce apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B156-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. Additionally, CTLs can kill infected host cells via TNF receptor family-dependent pathways. CTLs express the Fas ligand (FasL) that binds to Fas on target cells, and the Fas–FasL interaction induces apoptosis via activation of a caspase cascade. TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, also expressed on CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, is another mechanism for CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell-mediated cytotoxicity [
 <xref rid="B157-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>]. Effector CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in the lung produce IFN-γ and TNFα, which contribute to viral defense mechanisms [

 <xref rid="B159-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>,
 <xref rid="B160-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>]. Remarkably, IL-10 is also produced by effector CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells and is responsible for the regulation of pulmonary inflammation during the response to influenza virus infections. Previous studies have suggested that CD8
 <sup>+</sup> effector cells are the major producers of IL-10 in the lungs of mice infected with the influenza virus [
 <xref rid="B161-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. Further, blockade of IL-10 signaling increases pulmonary inflammation and lethal injury following sublethal influenza virus challenge [
