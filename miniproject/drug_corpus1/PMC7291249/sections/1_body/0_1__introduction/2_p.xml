<p>Throughout history, several influenza pandemics have emerged as a result of cross-species transmission, resulting in millions of deaths. For example, a novel H1N1 strain was generated in 2009 after a reassortment event among H1N1 influenza subtypes in swine [

 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00504" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Seasonal epidemic influenza, which is marked by antigenic drift, is particularly dangerous for specific groups such as pregnant women, young children, the elderly, and patients with comorbidities. Because seasonal influenza mutations and cross-species events are relatively unpredictable, it is important to understand the factors that influence successful defense against influenza infections.
