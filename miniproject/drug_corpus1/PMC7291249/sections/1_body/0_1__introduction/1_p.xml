<p>The influenza virus, or ‘flu’, causes an acute respiratory disease that results in moderate to severe symptoms including fever, runny nose, cough, muscle pain, headaches, and sometimes even death. Each year, seasonal influenza strains spread across the globe, causing significant economic and clinical burdens. As a result, considerable resources have been devoted to preventing and treating flu infections. Vaccination is currently the most effective method for prevention of the flu. The World Health Organization releases a recommendation for the composition of the seasonal influenza vaccine each year on the basis of strains that are predicted to circulate [

Although vaccination results in protective immune responses against the surface antigens of influenza, continuous genetic mutations allow the virus to eventually bypass vaccine-induced protection. To date, three classes of anti-influenza drugs have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These drugs target several distinct steps of the viral replication cycle to inhibit influenza propagation in hosts. Matrix 2 (M2) inhibitors block the release of viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) into the cytosol, and neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors prevent viruses from budding out of host cells. The cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor, which received FDA approval for the treatment of influenza in 2018 [
