<p id="p0120">Upon infection from any microbes, the proteins exposed on the surface of these intruders are at first recognized by our immune system. A systematic and specific immune response is then elicited to fight back these infectious agents. However, in certain infections, the immune system might be taken over by the infectivity of the microbes which results in pathological conditions. Thus, in this condition supporting the immune system with synthetic drugs would not only help in combating the infection but might also enable in the recovery of defence of our body. Similar to the approach of the immune system, surface structures are always the first class of probable candidates to be addressed by the therapeutics development. Drugs to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection are in search. In particular, proteins of SARS-CoV-2 such as spike protein (S), RNA dependent RNA polymerase and Main protease are being studied to develop potential inhibitors. However, a detailed study of the other non-structural proteins is the need of the hour to increase the spectrum of proteins which can be targeted for control of COVID-19 infection.</p>
