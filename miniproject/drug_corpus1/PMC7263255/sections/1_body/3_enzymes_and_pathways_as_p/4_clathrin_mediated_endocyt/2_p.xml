<p id="p0130">Besides targeting viral proteins, the cellular mechanisms involved in virus internalization can also be a viable therapeutic strategy (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The entry mechanism and internalization process for SARS-CoV-2 into cells have not been clarified yet. Since SARS-CoV-2 binds to the similar receptor as SARS-CoV, and is also vulnerable to chloroquine, a lysosomotropic agent; hence there is an increased probability that the SARS CoV-2 also utilize the similar endocytic mechanism for the entry into the host cells. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the most prevalent process of internalization including that of SARS-CoV. Therefore, drugs such as chlorpromazine inhibiting clathrin-mediated endocytosis are tested for their potential in inhibiting SARS.CoV-2 [
