<p id="p0125">Metal ions are an essential part of some viral proteins and play a vital part in their pathogenesis and existence. Binding of metal ions might activate or inactivate the protein. Because metal ions can bind to viral proteins, different metal ion-conjugates were tested for their inhibitory properties of 3CL protease of SARS-CoV. Hg
 <sup>2+</sup>, Zn
 <sup>2+,</sup> and Cu
 <sup>2+</sup> exhibited inhibitory properties with Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> being more effective. These metals exhibited non-competitive inhibition [

 <sup>2+</sup> binding domain [
 <xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. A detailed molecular interaction study demonstrated that Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> ions and Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> ionophores effectively inhibited replicase and also RdRp at the elongation phase [
 <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Helicase is one of the enzymes from the nsp group of proteins in SARS-CoV. It is involved in unwinding the dsRNA or dsDNA in 5′ to 3′ polarity. The activity of helicase is vital for replication and also the transcription of the viral genome. Bismuth compounds efficiently inhibited the helicase activity [

 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> ). In the current pandemic, metal ion based coating to the hospital surfaces and personal protection equipment (PPE) are being extensively explored. However, molecular interactions and mechanism of the inhibitory properties of metal ions need to be explored in detail.
