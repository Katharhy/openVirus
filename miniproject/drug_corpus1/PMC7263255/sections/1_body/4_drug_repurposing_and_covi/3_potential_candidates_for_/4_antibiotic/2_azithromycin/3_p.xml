<p id="p0200">There are around 81 clinical trial registered for testing the efficacy of AZ in combination with several other drugs for treating COVID-19. An open label, randomized interventional study has been initiated to compare the efficiency of the two drugs hydroxychloroquine and AZ to see which one is better in the treatment of confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 [

 <xref rid="bb0675" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. A phase II B, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial has been initiated to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine and AZ to prevent the hospitalization or death in symptomatic adult outpatients with COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="bb0680" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. Gautret et al., conducted a non-randomized, observational, open-label, external control trial on COVID-19 patients of &gt;12 yrs age to deduce the efficacy of combination therapy of hydroxychloroquine and AZ [
 <xref rid="bb0685" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. They concluded that hydroxychloroquine (500 mg/day) and AZ (250 mg/ day for 5 days) successfully reduced the viral load. The activity of hydroxychloroquine in reducing the viral load was further reinforced by AZ.
