<p id="p0155">Remdesivir (RDV) is a broad-spectrum anti-viral and an adenosine triphosphate nucleoside analog. It is an investigational small molecule developed by Gilad Sciences. Inc in 2015 primarily for the treatment of Ebola and it is in Phase -II trials for its activity against the Ebola virus-induced hemorrhagic fever [

 <italic>In vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> animal study data shows that RDV is active against a host of virus-like: filoviridae, parmyxoviridae and the coronaviridae (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus [MERS CoV], Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) [
 <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. The prodrug of RDV (GS-443902) constrains the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase at the early stage of the viral infectious cycle. Chain termination and lethal mutagenesis are the other possible mechanisms of action of RDV [
 <xref rid="bb0385" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. RDV is an antiviral that is known to reduce the viral load by decreasing viral replication. The animal studies showed that the RDV efficiently decrease the viral load in the lung tissue of MERS-CoV infected mice and further it improved the pathological damage done to the lung tissue and lung function [
 <xref rid="bb0390" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Another study showed that the metabolite of RDV GS-5734 was operative against an array of CoVs like pre-pandemic bat CoVs, bat CoVs and circulating contemporary human CoV in primary human lung cells [
 <xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. They also showed that GS-5734 halts the replication of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV and thereby reduces the viral load in primary human epithelial cell cultures. RDV blocks SARS-CoV infection at a micromolecular and at a half cytotoxic concentration [
 <xref rid="bb0325" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. There is no sufficient data available on the pharmacokinetics of RDV, however, the data is extrapolated from 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse and non-human primate data. RDV is metabolized into its prodrug by anabolic intracellular kinase [
 <xref rid="bb0400" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Once-daily dosing was found to reach a maximum concentration with a half-life of approximately 20 h 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> non-human primate model and an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> human lung cell model [
 <xref rid="bb0405" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. The data relating to protein binding, hepatic clearance, adverse effects, and dosing information is not yet available. As per the clinical study data currently, a loading dose of 200 mg intravenous RDV is given followed by 100 mg intravenously for 5 to 10 days [
 <xref rid="bb0410" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. In order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of RDV in COVID-19 patients, several clinical trials have been started. A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of RDV in hospitalized patients with moderate to mild COVID-19 respiratory disease has been initiated by China-Japan friendship hospital, China. The trial consists of 08 patients divided into 2 groups with one group receiving active RDV and the other control group receiving RDV placebo. The results of the trials are expected to be obtained by the end of April 2020 [
 <xref rid="bb0415" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Gilead Lifesciences has initiated a phase-3 randomized study to evaluate the efficacy of RDV regimens with respect to clinical status by a 7-point ordinal scale on day 14 with 2400 participants The study completion date is expected to be May 2020 [
 <xref rid="bb0420" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has initiated a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, adaptive, placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of RDV in hospitalized adults diagnosed with COVID-19 [
