<p id="p0165">Arbidol (ARB) or Umifenovir is an antiviral drug currently approved in China and Russia for the prophylaxis treatment of respiratory viral infections and influenza [
 <xref rid="bb0475" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. It is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that has demonstrated activity against many other viruses like the Lassa virus, zika virus, Ebola virus, flavivirus, herpes simplex and in food – mouth disease [
 <xref rid="bb0480" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Furthermore, it has shown activity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> against a host of other viruses like hantaan virus, chikungunya virus, hepatitis B and C virus, reovirus and coxsackievirus [
 <xref rid="bb0485" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. ARB has shown activity against SARS-CoV-2 virus and thus it's been currently investigated for its potential to treat COVID-19 prophylactically [
 <xref rid="bb0475" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. The broad-spectrum activity of ARB is mainly because of its dual action as a host targeting agent (HTA) that acts on one or multiple stages of the viral life cycle and as a direct-acting antiviral (DAA) which induces direct virucidal effects on virus [
 <xref rid="bb0475" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. The DAA action is mainly because of the ability of the ARB to form interactions with amino acid residues. ARB interferes with intracellular trafficking, clathrin-mediated endocytosis and directly with viral lipid envelope [
 <xref rid="bb0490" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. The interaction of ARB with viral glycoprotein aromatic residues that are involved in fusion and cellular recognition is the main reason for ARB's antiviral activity [
 <xref rid="bb0495" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Because of its ability to interact with both viral proteins and lipids ARB can interfere with the later stages of the viral life cycle [
 <xref rid="bb0500" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. The antiviral activity of ARB against SARS-CoV-2 has gained the attention of researchers in the use of ARB as a potential treatment therapy alone or in combination therapy to treat COVID-19. Currently, China is conducting various studies to evaluate the potential of ARB in treating COVID-19 and has recommended the use of ARB as a treatment option. A study conducted in China reveals that ARB effectively inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection at low concentration of 10–30 μM 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. The National Health Commission (NHC) of the People's Republic of China has included ARB in the latest version of the Guidelines for the Prevention, Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus-induced Pneumonia for the tentative treatment of COVID-19. ARB is rapidly absorbed following its oral administration. The maximum concentration of the drug in plasma is estimated to be 415–467 ng/ml and the time taken to reach maximum plasma concentration is between 0.65–1.8 h [
 <xref rid="bb0505" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. It undergoes cytochrome P450 dependent hepatic metabolism and it is also metabolized by intestinal microsomes [
 <xref rid="bb0510" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Phase-1 metabolic pathways include hydroxylation, sulfoxidation, and N-demethylation, whereas the Phase-2 pathway is mainly due to glucuronide and sulfate conjugation reactions [
 <xref rid="bb0515" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. The plasma half-life of ARB is 17–21 h and it is eliminated majorly through feces. Currently to treat COVD-19 a dose of 200 mg of ARB 3 times a day is given orally for not more than 10 days [
 <xref rid="bb0520" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. A phase-4 for pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2, randomized, multicenter, open study has been initiated by Jieming QU, Rujin Hospital, China to observe the safety and efficacy of ARB in the treatment of pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="bb0525" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Another randomized, open study to assess the safety and efficacy of Bromhexine Hydrochloride tablets given in combination with ARB and recombinant human interferon-α 2b in the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 pneumonia has also been initiated [
