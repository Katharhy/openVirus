<p id="p0175">In order to determine the viability of FPV for COVID-19 repurposing, we carried out a literature survey of clinical trials using FPV as an investigational drug for different indications. Results of the research published for a multi-centric Phase II study (

FPV may also have possible antiviral activity on SARS-CoV-2 which is an RNA virus. A clinical study on FPV for the treatment of COVID-19 conducted by the Shenzhen Third People's Hospital and the Clinical Medical Research Centre of the National Infectious Diseases obtained positive results on 14 February. Preliminary outcomes from a total of 80 patients (along with the experimental group and the control group) showed that FPV had a more potent antiviral action than LPV / RTV. There were no major adverse reactions in the treatment group FPV, and there were slightly less adverse effects than the LPV / RTV group. In terms of disease development and viral clearance FPV demonstrated stronger therapeutic responses to COVID-19 [
