<p id="p0190">Interferons (INF) are a cluster of cytokines that are secreted by dendritic, plasmacytoid and other types of cells [
 <xref rid="bb0590" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. These are the body's natural defense against viral infection and also play an important role in combating tumors and regulating immunity. FDA has approved INFs for the treatment of various conditions like multiple sclerosis, hepatitis B and C viral infection, hairy cell leukemia and Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) [
 <xref rid="bb0595" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. INFs are the first cytokines released during a viral infection. The interferon stimulating genes (ISG) which are mainly involved in immunomodulation, signaling and inflammation are activated by the INF fixation on Interferon α/β Receptor (IFNAR) receptors present on the plasma membrane of most of the cells [
 <xref rid="bb0600" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. The ISGs activates the adaptive immunity by decreasing the secretion or metabolism of cytokines by interfering with viral replication. ISGs further prevents membrane fusion by decreasing the membrane fluidity and sensitize the cells to pathogens thereby inhibiting the virus-cell cycle steps [
 <xref rid="bb0605" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. INF, when given as a monotherapy, showed that higher serum concentration of INF is required to halt viral replication. Whereas the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of INF given in combination with ribavirin showed a potent synergistic effect in treating SARS [
 <xref rid="bb0610" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. The combination of INF and ribavirin at a lower dose showed an inhibitory action on the replication of MERS-CoV [
 <xref rid="bb0450" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Among the subtypes of INFs, INFβ1b and INFβ1a are the most potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="bb0615" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>] and MERS-CoV [
 <xref rid="bb0620" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. With respect to coronavirus infection INFβ1 plays an important role because of its protective role in the lungs. It maintains the endothelial barrier function of the lungs by up-regulating Cluster of Differentiation 73 (CD73) in the endothelial cells of lungs and results in the secretion of anti-inflammatory adenosine [
 <xref rid="bb0625" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. These studies showed that INF can be used in the prophylactic treatment of COVID-19. INF is an investigational drug and hence its complete pharmacokinetic profile is not yet established. However, the half-life of the pegylated form of INF is 4.6–22 h. As of now, there is no established dosage regimen for INF in treating COVID-19. Several clinical trials with INF alone and in combination with other drugs have been initiated. An early phase randomized open blank control study has been planned to evaluate the safety and efficacy of recombinant INFα1b as monotherapy in treating corona virus infection [
 <xref rid="bb0630" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. In another case, an randomized open-label controlled trial on the combination therapy of lopinavir/ ritonavir, ribavirin and INFβ1b in comparison with monotherapy of lopinavir/ ritonavir as a treatment for novel coronavirus infection has been planned [
 <xref rid="bb0470" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Peginterferon alfa-2a marketed as Pegasys has been used in the treartment of chronic Hepatitis C in combination with Ribavirin. With repect to COVID-19 several clinical trials with using Pegylated interferon alfa have been initiated. Open label, controlled, randomised Phase II clinical trial to estimate the antiviral efficacy and safety of Pegylated INF Lamda (
