<p id="p0240">ACE-2 inhibitors (captopril, ramipril) are widely used in treating hypertension. ACE-2 receptors are overexpressed on the epithelial cells of the oral mucosa and they are also present immune reactive cells like lungs blood vessels macrophages and intestine [

 <xref rid="bb0865" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. SARS-CoV has a transmembrane spike glycoprotein (S-protein) on its outer shell which binds to the ACE-2 receptors. Once the virus is attached to the ACE-2 receptors of the host cell the cellular proteases starts priming the S-protein and allows the virus to get fused into the cellular membrane of the host cell which results in the entry of the virus and replication in the host target cell [
 <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The amino acid configuration of SARS-CoV-S protein is almost 80% similar to that of SARS-Co-2-S-protein and thus shares the same binding affinity to ACE-2 receptors as like SARS-CoV. Hence, SARS-CoV-2 also utilizes ACE-2 receptors as an entry point into the host cell [
