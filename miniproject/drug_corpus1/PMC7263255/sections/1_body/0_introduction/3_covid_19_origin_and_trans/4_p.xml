<p id="p0050">The transmission from patients to healthcare workers was seen on 20th January. After this Wuhan and other cities of Hubei province were placed under complete lockdown. There were cases of COVID-19 in individuals who did not travel to China, which further suggested transmission between humans. All the domestic and international airports had a screening mechanism in place in order to detect any symptomatic travelers who were kept under quarantine and were allowed to go if they tested negative for the COVID-19 test. It soon became apparent that the disease could transmit from an asymptomatic person (before the commencement of any related symptom). All the countries evacuated their respective citizens from Wuhan and travelers from China and other affected countries were kept under quarantine/isolation for 14Â days and went through the COVID-19 test. On 1st February, WHO declared COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Cases have continued to exponentially increase since then. On 11th March, WHO finally acknowledged COVID-19 as a Pandemic. As of April 16th, the total COID-19 cases are almost 2 million worldwide. It is to be noted that the number of cases has reduced in China, with a drastic increase in countries like the USA with 6.44 lacs cases, Spain and Italy with almost 1.8 and 1.6 lacs cases each. Most of the affected countries have declared a lockdown, with travel restrictions of any kind and border control measure taken to control the pandemic and reduce the transmission.</p>
