<p id="p0250">The FDA provides access to convalescent plasma (CP), materials abundant in antibodies obtained from suitable donors who are healed from COVID-19. The FDA indicates that evaluating its safety and effectiveness by clinical trials is necessary prior to clinically prescribing CP for patients with COVID-19, and for the same FDA has issued guidelines to investigators and health care providers. For investigators seeking to review CP for use in patients with extreme or imminent life-threatening COVID-19, the FDA has posted details through the use of the single-patient emergency Investigational New Drug (IND) application process for particular patients. Also, the FDA is closely interacting with investigators to explore the prospect of cooperation on creating a master protocol for the use of CP, with the aim of minimizing duplicative attempts [

Plasma includes a mixture of inorganic salts, organic compounds, water, and over 1000 proteins. The others factors identified are albumin, immunoglobulins, complements, coagulation and antithrombotic factors. Main convalescent plasma components are depicted in

Additional protective antibodies, including immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM), are found in plasma in addition to neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) which might show antiviral effect. IgG and IgM are the key isotypes, although immunoglobulin A (IgA) can also be important, especially for viral mucosal infections. Non-NAbs which bind to the virus but do not affect its ability to replicate could contribute to prophylaxis and/or improvement in recovery. The humoral immune response targets mainly spike (S) protein. (

The pilot study findings indicate CP treatment could be a safe and effective therapeutic alternative for severe COVID-19 infections. A group from China administered a single 200 ml dose of CP to 10 patients with severe COVID-19 with elevated levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Clinical symptoms, such as cough, fever, chest pain and shortness of breath, substantially improved three days after the injection, as per the investigators. The patients have had elevated numbers of lymphocytes, better liver function and decreased inflammation. The researchers also reported that the levels of neutralizing antibodies in the patients either increased or stayed elevated following CP transfusion [
