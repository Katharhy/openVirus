<p id="p0070">SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent for the current pandemic situation is similar to SARS-CoV, which caused an epidemic in early 2003. Both viral strains belong to the B lineage of β-coronaviruses genera. These viruses are the largest RNA viruses reported to date. SARS coronaviruses have a single-stranded positive-sense RNA that complexes with capsid protein into a bead-on-the-string arrangement which forms the protein-ribonucleic helical core of the virus particle. The genetic core is enveloped in a lipid bilayer where structural proteins of the virus particle are anchored. Membrane (M) protein, the most abundant triple-spanning membrane protein that is crucial for virus assembly. Envelope (E) protein, the smallest among the other foremost structural proteins, predominantly localizes in vesicle trafficking organelles such as Golgi and ER/Golgi interface thus play a central role in maturation and budding. Spike (S) protein forms the trimeric spike which extends from the lipid membrane that gives a crown-like appearance; hence this family of the virus is named ‘corona’ viruses. Spike protein is crucial for the infectivity of the virus, tissue tropism, and virus internalization into the host cell. Structural proteins work in synchrony with each other to bring about virus replication in the host cell [
