<p id="p0095">The S protein on the surface of a virus particle is present in a pre-fusion form [
 <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Upon contact with host cell, S protein undergo a priming by host cell membrane proteases such as TMPRSS2 (serine protease) to induce membrane wrapping and efficient internalization [

 <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Structural analysis demonstrated that the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 bound with ~10 times advanced affinity to ACE-2 than that of SARS-CoV and in receptor unbound state, the S2 domain was more flexible [
 <xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Another notable change in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the presence of the S1/S2 furin-like rift spot that is absent in SARS-CoV. Several reports suggest that the presence of this proteolytic site increases the pathogenicity of the virus. Furin like rift spot is also reported to increase the tissue tropism of viruses [
