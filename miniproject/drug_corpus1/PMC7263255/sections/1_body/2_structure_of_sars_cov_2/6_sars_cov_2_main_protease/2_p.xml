<p id="p0105">The main protease (M
 <sup>pro</sup>) also recognized as 3C-like protease is encoded by nsp5. It is the first protein that is auto-cleaved and it further cleaves the polyprotein into individual members of non-structural proteins at the cleavage site LeuGlnâ†“ (Ser, Ala, Gly). It attains a stable active form as an octamer while it's monomer and dimer exist in equilibrium. [

 <sup>pro</sup> showed that polar amino acids in the dimer interface have been replaced with non-polar ones. This mutation has resulted in the increased catalytic activity of the dimer while dimer dissociation constants have remained the same [

 <sup>pro</sup> is considered as one of the potential targets to treat COVID-19.
