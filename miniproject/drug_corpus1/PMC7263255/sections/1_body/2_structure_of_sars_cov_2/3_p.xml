<p id="p0075">Recent studies have demonstrated that similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also utilizes ACE-2 on the host cell surface for cellular entry. Upon binding to the receptor, virus is thought to be internalized by receptor mediated endocytosis and RNA (viral genomic material) is then released into host cell cytoplasm. Viral genome is translated to form non-structural proteins, which constitute replication transcription complex (RTC). The RTC leads to the formation of sub-genomic mRNAs which encode structural and accessory proteins. The new viral genomic RNA bound to nucleocapsid protein and other accessory proteins of virus present as virions (viral buds) in endoplasmic reticulum and golgi are transported via vesicle cargoes to fuse with the plasma membrane and finally are released out of cell as depicted in
