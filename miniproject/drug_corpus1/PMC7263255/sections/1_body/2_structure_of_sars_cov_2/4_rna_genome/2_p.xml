<p id="p0080">SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense RNA virus, with a genome scope of 30 kb consisting of flanking untranslated regions (UTRs) at both 5′ and 3′ ends. The open reading frames ORF1a (open reading frame) and ORF1b present at 5′ proximal RNA genome encodes for a polyprotein, which upon proteolytic cleavage results in 16 putative nonstructural proteins (nsps) such as viral proteases (nsp3, cysteine protease, and nsp5), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ([RdRp], nsp12), helicase (nsp13), and other nsps which are expected to be tangled in the viral transcription and replication. The distal portion of the viral genome towards 3′ end consists of 12 nested orfs which code for the structural proteins namely spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M) and Nucleocapsid (N) and other accessory proteins. Genome analysis has tremendously helped in gaining more insights about the SARS CoV-2. Sequence analysis revealed a major distinction in spike, orf3b and orf 8 regions which were previously reported as recombination hotspots [
