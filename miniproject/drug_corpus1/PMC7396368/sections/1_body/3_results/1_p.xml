<p>A total of 75 HIV‐infected patients with NSCLC at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center (Department of Thoracic Surgery) from November 2011 to August 2018 were included in the study. Of these, 52% (39/75) patients were diagnosed at advanced stages (IIIB–IV), 48%(36/75) patients were diagnosed at early stages (I–IIIA), but three patients were excluded due to surgery being abandoned. Finally, 33 patients (median age 56 years, 27 men) were included in the analysis (Fig 
 <xref rid="tca13519-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The demographics and clinical characteristics of these patients are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="tca13519-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>. At diagnosis, mean serum CD4 + T cell count was 343.24 ± 148.84/μL (range 82–641/mm
 <sup>3</sup>).HIV virus was detected in 23 of the 33 patients and the highest preoperative HIV viral load was 3.51E + 05 copy/mL. In total, 20 patients had been treated with HAART before lung cancer was diagnosed, and 13 patients were diagnosed with lung cancer and HIV infection, and did not receive HAART. The mean size of tumor was 3.4 cm (range 1.1–8.9 cm). The histological type of lung cancer was adenocarcinoma in 20 patients, squamous cell carcinoma in eight patients, and others included NSCLC in five patients. The clinical stage was IA in 15 patients, IB in six patients, IIA in one patient, IIB in seven patients, and IIIA in four patients. However, the pathological stage was slightly different to the clinical stage; pathological stage was IA in 19 patients, IB in five patients, IIA in one patient, IIB in three patients, IIIA in four patients, and IV in one patient. Clinical lymph node stage and pathological lymph node stage were also compared, and the former (N0/N1/N2/NX: 29/2/2/0) was slightly different from the latter (N0/N1/N2/NX: 23/3/3/4). A total of eight patients (24.3%) underwent segmentectomy, 23 (69.7%) underwent lobectomy, and two (6%) bilobectomy. Thoracotomy was performed in 23 patients (69.7%), and VATS in 10 patients (30.3%). Among all 33 patients who underwent surgery, 30 patients were simultaneously taking antiretroviral and chemotherapy agents; and one patient was simultaneously taking antiretroviral and targeted drug therapy. The other two patients gave up postoperative chemotherapy. Two patients with postoperative recurrence were given simultaneous antiretroviral and targeted drug therapy. There were 10 patients who died from recurrence and metastasis of lung cancer. The average survival time was 34.3 months. Another three patients with relapse are still receiving targeted drug treatment, and the current average survival time is 26.7 months (Table 
 <xref rid="tca13519-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The current mean observation time of all patients is 35.3 months (range 13 to 94 months). Among the four patients who underwent gene testing, two patients harbored an 
 <italic>EGFR</italic> mutation, one had an 
 <italic>ERBB2</italic> mutation, and one patient had a 
 <italic>KRAS</italic>/
 <italic>PIK3CA</italic>/
 <italic>RET</italic> mutation (Table
