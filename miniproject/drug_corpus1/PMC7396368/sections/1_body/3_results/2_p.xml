<p>The prevalence of the comorbidity in accordance with the CCI score and the GPS is described in Table 
 <xref rid="tca13519-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The CCI was greater than or equal to eight in 26 (78.7%) of the patients, and 25 (75.8%) had GPS equal to zero. The most common comorbidities were congestive heart failure (six cases, 18.2%) and chronic pulmonary disease (six cases, 18.2%). A total of 22 (66.7%) patients developed postoperative complications and seven of them developed multiple complications (Table 
 <xref rid="tca13519-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). During the time of observation, 20 (60.6%) patients were alive without cancer, three patients were alive with cancer, 10 patients had died of cancer; and none of the patients had died due to surgery‐related causes. A 30‐day mortality was observed in none of the patients. We defined patients who had relapsed, metastasized or died at the last follow‐up time as cases of cancer recurrence and designated them as the Cancer Group; patients with no recurrence were designated as the Cure Group. The variables of BI, operative time and p‐stage were selected into the multivariate survival analysis via forward stepwise (likelihood ratio). A best model is reported in Table 
 <xref rid="tca13519-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>, in which the combination of BI and p‐stage formed the best model. The −2 log likelihood was 56.773, Chi‐square was 19.745, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001. According to the uni‐ and multivariate logistic regression analyses, p‐stage was an independent significant risk factor for cancer return; ie, alive with cancer or died of cancer (odds ratio 1.281–4.818, 
 <italic>P =</italic> 0.016; Table 
 <xref rid="tca13519-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>). The Kaplan‐Meier curves stratified based on p‐stage are shown in Figure 2. Median survival time was 65 months: for p‐stage I patients MST was 65 months; for p‐stage II MST was unestimable; for p‐stage III it was 21 months; and for p‐stage I/II it was 67 months. The average follow‐up time of those three groups were: 35.5, 48.3, and 26.8 months, respectively. The variables of BI, HIV RNA, Haart, CCI, and CD4 cell count were selected into the multivariate logistic regression analysis via forward stepwise (likelihood ratio). A best model was reported in Table 
 <xref rid="tca13519-tbl-0005" ref-type="table">5</xref> in which the combination of HIV RNA, CCI, and CD4 cell count formed the best model. Its Nagelkerke R2 was 0.63 and the test of the goodness‐of‐fit by the Hosmer‐Lemeshow test showed an appropriate fit with a 
 <italic>P</italic>‐value of 0.635. It should be noted that in the optimal model, all three variables can independently predict the postoperative complications of patients. According to the uni‐ and multivariate logistic regression analyses, independent significant risk factors for postoperative complications were HIV viral load (odds ratio 1.008–92.546, 
 <italic>P =</italic> 0.049), CCI (odds ratio 1.161–199.791, 
 <italic>P =</italic> 0.038), and CD4+ T cell count (odds ratio 0.008–0.949, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.045) (Table 
 <xref rid="tca13519-tbl-0005" ref-type="table">5</xref>).
