<p>This study has several obvious limitations, including a small sample size and the absence of a comparative analysis between HIV‐infected patients and those without HIV infection. Nevertheless, using data from our Chinese single‐institutional cohorts, we found that the risk factors for postoperative complications were HIV viral load, CCI and CD4 + T cell count, and that p‐stage was the predictive factor for long‐term survival in our single‐arm retrospective analysis. Despite the lower smoking prevalence found in this study, smoking cessation strategies are strongly recommended due to the potential contribution of smoking to lung cancer pathogenesis. In our study, we treated HIV‐infected patients with NSCLC according to the treatment guide for lung cancer in the general population. Such patients were maintained on combination antiretroviral treatment during cancer treatment. Considering the drug‐drug interactions and overlapping toxicity during the concomitant administration of chemotherapy with antiretroviral treatment, it is crucial to have multidisciplinary collaboration among thoracic surgeons, pulmonary specialists, radiologists, and medical and radiotherapy oncologists to obtain the optimal treatment in these patients.</p>
