<p>Previous data on postoperative outcomes for HIV‐infected patients specific to lung cancer surgery are limited. In our study, we found that HIV‐infected patients with NSCLC had higher rates of some post‐operative complications. The most common complications were postoperative pneumonia and atelectasis, which were thought to be associated with decreased immune status.

 </xref> Treatment with HAART has been indicated as being protective against opportunistic and other infections in patients not undergoing surgery. This was found to be the case in our study. Our results of univariate analysis suggested a history of HAART use 30 days before surgery was associated with a lower incidence of postoperative complications than when there was no history of HAART use. However, there was no significant difference by multivariate analysis.
