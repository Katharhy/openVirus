<p>Common opportunistic infections in HIV‚Äêinfected patients include pneumocystis pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, nontuberculous mycobacterial infection, pulmonary cryptococcus infection, and cytomegalovirus infection. In these patients with recurrent opportunistic pulmonary infection, adhesion of the pleural and mediastinal lymph nodes is frequently found, In our case series, 10 cases of pleural and mediastinal lymph node adhesions were found intraoperatively. Tracing the medical histories revealed that they all had previous opportunistic lung infections. These included eight cases of tuberculosis infection and two cases of pneumocystis pneumonia. Pleural and mediastinal lymph node adhesion is a contraindication for thoracoscopic surgery and resulted in a high proportion of our patients with early stage lung cancer undergoing thoracotomy.</p>
