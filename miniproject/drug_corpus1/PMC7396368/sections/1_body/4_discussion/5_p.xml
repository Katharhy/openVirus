<p>Historically, it has been agreed that HIV‐positive individuals tend to have more advanced cancer stage at diagnosis and that this might contribute to poorer outcomes. Other studies have also shown that HIV‐infection patients with lung cancer have a worse prognosis than those in the general lung cancer population.

 </xref> However, this understanding of poorer outcomes in HIV‐related lung cancer has been recently challenged. Another study based on the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) cancer registry from 2000 and 2005 evaluated 322 persons with HIV‐associated NSCLC compared to 71 976 HIV‐negative controls with lung cancer and found no difference in stage at lung cancer diagnosis. HIV‐infected patients who underwent surgical resection had similar survival when compared to HIV‐negative counterparts.

 </xref> In this study, it is p‐stage, not HIV‐related clinical indicators such as HIV viral load and CD4 + T cells, that was found to be associated with survival time. The mean survival time for HIV‐infected patients with stage I/II NSCLC undergoing surgical resection was 67 months, which was better than the report from Hooker
