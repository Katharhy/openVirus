<p>Previous studies have suggested that CCI and GPS can be used as prognostic markers to predict overall survival in patients with NSCLC.

 </xref> The GPS and p‐stage were significant prognostic factors in 98 patients aged 80 years and older who had clinical stage I lung cancer.

 </xref> In another study including 337 lung cancer patients older than 80 years, uni‐ and multivariate analyses showed that p‐stage, CCI, GPS were independent prognostic factors for overall survival.

 </xref> However, neither the CCI nor the GPS were correlated with cancer‐related deaths in our study. All of the deaths were due to lung cancer recurrence and metastasis. This may be due to the small patient population in our single‐center study. Additionally, some patients were not observed for a significant duration. Further study is needed to establish whether CCI and GPS can be regarded as a reliable predictive markers of survival time for HIV‐infected patients with NSCLC.
