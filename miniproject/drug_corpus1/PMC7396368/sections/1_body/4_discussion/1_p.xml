<p>With the increasing number of non‐AIDS defining malignancies, cancer screening has become an important component of health maintenance in HIV clinical practice. With increases in lung cancer screening, especially in low‐dose CT screening, the observed prevalence of localized cancers is also likely to increase in HIV‐infected patients.

 </xref> Surgical resection for early‐stage lung cancer is potentially curative. It is time to establish the safety of lung cancer surgery in this group and decrease the existing disparities in cancer treatment in China. Using prospectively collected surgical outcomes data, we found that a lower CD4+ T cell count and higher HIV viral load were associated with higher complication rates post operation. The use of HAART before the operative procedure resulted in no appreciable decrease in complication occurrence. Additionally, immune status at surgery was irrelevant to long‐term survival, which was only associated with the p‐stage of lung cancer in our cohort. These findings further validate prior recommendations advocating surgery for HIV‐infected patients regardless of immune status.
