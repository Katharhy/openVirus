<p>The advent of antiretroviral therapy has led to a decreased mortality from opportunistic infectious diseases associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Similarly, deaths from a wide variety of cancers have been increasing among this population. Lung cancer represents the leading cause of cancer‐related death and a major source of morbidity among persons living with HIV infection in the United States.

 </xref> Although China's national antiretroviral therapy (ART) program began later than those of most developed countries, China might experience HIV‐related cancer epidemics in the ART era. Non‐AIDS‐defining cancers (NADCs) have emerged as a major problem and have contributed to excess mortality among individuals living with HIV: the most prevalent NADCs in China were reported to be Hodgkin's lymphoma (27%), gastrointestinal cancer (16%), liver cancer (14%) and lung cancer (13%), at rates higher than the crude incidence rate of cancer in general populations.
