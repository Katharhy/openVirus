<p>Surgical resection is regarded as a major component of lung cancer treatment for stage I–IIIA disease and can be curative in some circumstances.

 </xref> However, the published studies of surgical treatment mostly came from HIV‐infected lung cancer patients in Western counties, few studies have been reported from Asian populations, and they have crucially lacked detailed clinical characteristics. In the only report from Asian countries other than Japan, only 12 lung cancer patients with HIV or AIDS were included and their detailed clinical characteristics were not documented (TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database).
 <xref rid="tca13519-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> We therefore studied the clinical characteristics and surgery outcomes of Chinese lung cancer patients infected with HIV in our institution. This study drew upon an eight‐year retrospective cohort at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center to focus retrospectively on clinical data among HIV‐infected patients with non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We examined the relevance of HIV disease features (CD4+ T cell count, HIV viral load and use of antiretroviral treatment) for survival time and aimed to elucidate the risk factors for postoperative complication in this Chinese single‐institutional cohort.
