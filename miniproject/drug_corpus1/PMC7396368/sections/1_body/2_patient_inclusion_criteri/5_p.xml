<p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 22.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). The risk factors for postoperative complications were assessed using uni‐ and multivariate logistic regression analyses. The p‐stage was analyzed as a categorical variable. Survival curves were calculated via the Kaplan‐Meier method; differences in survival were assessed using the log‐rank test. Univariate analyses for long‐term survival were calculated via the Cox proportional hazard model. A 
 <italic>P</italic>‐value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Only variables that could significantly (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) predict the dependent variable in the univariate logistic regression were included in the multivariate logistic regression and survival analysis. The method of forward stepwise (likelihood ratio) was applied in the multivariate logistic regression analysis and the multivariate survival analysis to develop the best predictive equation model.
