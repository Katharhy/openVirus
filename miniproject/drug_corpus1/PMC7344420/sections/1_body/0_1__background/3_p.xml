Patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 may experience fear of the consequences of infection with a potentially fatal new virus, and those in quarantine might experience boredom, loneliness, and anger. For example, in the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a range of psychiatric morbidities, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidality, was reported [

However, much of the evidence on COVID-19 relating to the stress of the pandemic has emerged from China, and few studies have examined the burden of COVID-19-related stress in the general population from other countries. One of the worst COVID-19 outbreaks was reported from Iran, and no studies have examined the stress in the general Iranian population or in the Middle East. Thus, the purpose of this study is to measure Iraniansâ€™ stress levels and the associated factors during the COVID-19 outbreak.
