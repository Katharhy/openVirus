<p>The results of this study are subject to several potential limitations. First, the study results are restricted by all traditional limitations of cross-sectional study designs (e.g., reliance on self-reported behaviors, recall bias in participants, socially desirable responses, and the inability to establish cause-and-effect relationships). Second, this study measured the prevalence of variables rather than incident cases, and we were unable to assess the levels of variables before COVID-19 outbreak in Iran as a control. Third, stress patterns in individuals often have a variety of simultaneous influences that need to be accounted for. Fourth, a major threat to external validity is that the sample is limited in nature and extent (e.g., dominated by female participants, those who were employed and &lt;49 years old, and from developed provinces). This would mean that the results of the study cannot be generalized to several groups of individuals across the region and other countries. Despite these limitations, our study is the first and largest study across the middle East, with robust measures, of COVID-19-associated stress and the factors associated with stress during the pandemic.</p>
