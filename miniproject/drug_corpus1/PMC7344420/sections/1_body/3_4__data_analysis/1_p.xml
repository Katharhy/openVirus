<p>Data were in Excel file and were checked for duplicates and any errors before importing and analyzing using IBM SPSS 22 (Chicago, IL, USA). In the primary approach, a descriptive analysis of demographic and background characteristics of study participants was conducted. Next, we compared the average stress scores using 
 <italic>t</italic>-tests or ANOVA based on demographic characteristics, awareness about signs and symptoms of COVID-19, awareness about at-risk groups, knowledge about COVID-19 transmission methods, knowledge about COVID-19 prevention methods, awareness about the unavailability of COVID-19 prevention vaccine, trust in sources of information, and the availability of facemasks and sanitizers. The effect of the predictor variables on stress was assessed by univariate and multivariate generalized linear models. First, each predictor variable was entered into the univariate model separately, then the variables that had 
 <italic>p</italic>-values &lt; 0.2 were entered into the multivariate model simultaneously. Statistical significance was assumed at 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05.
