<p>Pearson’s correlation coefficients showed that participants’ knowledge about transmission methods of COVID-19 did not correlate with stress scores (r = 0.11, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.08), whereas there was a statistically significant correlation of stress scores with knowledge about prevention methods for COVID-19 (r = 0.21, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.01) and trust in sources of information about COVID-19 (r = −0.18, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.01).
