<p>The COVID-19 outbreak has severely increased psychological distress among people in Iran. It has changed peopleâ€™s routines in several aspects and made it difficult to cope with the new situation. Affected people, especially vulnerable groups, need professional support and community-based mental health promotion services to deal with the multiple stressors and burden imposed by the current pandemic. Family-centered social and economic policies and programs are necessary to support people during the COVID-19 epidemic. Employment and income protection, flexible working arrangements, paid leave to care for family members and access to medical services, cash transfers, and food distribution for low-income or no-income families, and providing long-distance psycho-social interventions are some examples of family-friendly policies to support people during this pandemic or any future epidemics of a regional or global nature.</p>
