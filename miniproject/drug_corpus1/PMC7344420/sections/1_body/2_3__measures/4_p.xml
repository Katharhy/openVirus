<p>Ten questions were about the participants’ trust in various sources of information about COVID-19. Sources of information included people they interact with (such as family, friends, and colleagues), health professionals, official websites (such as the Ministry of Health website), health centers (such as hospitals and public health centers), social networks (such as WhatsApp, Telegram, and Instagram), television, radio, newspapers, online news agencies, and international websites such as WHO website. Participants could indicate their level of trust in each of these sources using a 6-point Likert scale (very much, much, moderate, low, very low, and not trustable, with a score range of 5–0 for each question). The mean of the score on the 10 trust-related questions was the average of individual scores of trust in sources of information about COVID-19. To assess the internal consistency reliability of this scale on trust in sources of information, we computed a Cronbach alpha from the final sample of respondents, and the reliability was found to be high (α = 0.83). The questionnaire also included questions about the availability of facemasks and disinfectant gel and sanitizers to assess the individuals’ access to these protective strategies (yes/no, with a score range of 1–0 for each question).</p>
