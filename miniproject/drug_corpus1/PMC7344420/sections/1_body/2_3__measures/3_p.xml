<p>Stress-related data was collected by asking five questions about the level of feeling calm, tense, upset, relaxed, and worried. Studies show that participants who receive short questionnaires are more likely to respond [

 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-17-04441" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. For each question, participants could select responses from a set of options (very high, high, moderate, low, and very low, with a score range of 5–1 for each question). The mean of the responses on the five questions measures the stress level of individuals, and a higher score indicates higher stress. Internal consistency reliability of the stress scale was assessed by computing Cronbach’s alpha from the total sample of participants and was found to be high (α=0.81). Additionally, there were five questions about awareness of signs and symptoms of COVID-19 (true or false, with a score range of 1–0 for each question), two questions about the awareness of at-risk groups (true or false, with a score range of 1–0 for each question), four questions about the knowledge about COVID-19 transmission methods (true/false/not sure with a score range of 2–0 for each question), and one statement about the awareness of lack of COVID-19 prevention vaccine: “there is no vaccine for COVID-19” (true/false/not sure with a score range of 2–0). A group of questions (
 <italic>n</italic> = 19) was included about the knowledge of effective COVID-19 prevention methods (true/false/not sure, with a score range of 2–0 for each question). The internal consistency reliability for this scale (
 <italic>n</italic> = 19 questions) was assessed by computing Cronbach alpha and was found to be reasonable (α = 0.73).
