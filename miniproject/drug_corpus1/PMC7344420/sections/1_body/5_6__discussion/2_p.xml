<p>There is an interaction between external conditions (threat) and internal ones (vulnerability) that influences the level of risk for debilitating stress that could lead to mental health problems [

In this study and given the pandemic, it is highly likely that women face multiple and additional stressors, including work, taking care of others in the household, arranging for materials and supplies for the household, and arranging school work and education for children. Their routines have been dramatically changed and profoundly disrupted, causing more stress. Second, individuals with chronic diseases have higher stress in general, and this could be accentuated by the lack of sanitizers, protective masks, and the awareness of lack of a vaccine to prevent COVID-19 infection. The lack of protective supplies and heightened awareness could have severely impacted even those without chronic diseases or lifestyle problems. Third, those in the middle age groups and working-class could have more stress due to multiple social, economic, and personal stressors. It could be possible that they are worried about losing their jobs or their income. Those who had part-time jobs were more stressed than those who had full-time jobs. The instability of part-time jobs, low incomes, and lack of savings could affect some groups more than others. Additionally, healthcare access, coverage, and the ability to pay are influenced by employment, and this could be a major stressor for middle-aged working-class individuals. Fourth, there is an interesting relationship between education and stress levels. Individuals with lower stress had the lowest and highest education levels compared to those who had 13â€“16 years of formal education. One possible reason could be that during the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran, there was a lot of misinformation circulating on social media networks. Those with lesser education were not generally able to read the information in other languages (such as English) and had lesser access to mass media and technology to use social media. However, with increasing education, this stress seemed to have been alleviated, possibly due to the ability to screen for and use authentic information [
