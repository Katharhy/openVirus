<p>Similar to many epidemics in the past and the response of various governments, it appears that mental health care is not a priority for governments during such national crises, epidemics, and disasters. In addition, factors such as the ruralâ€“urban divide, lack of access to technology and authentic information, income inequality, availability of healthcare or other resources, lack of awareness, and literacy could pose additional burdens and cause psychological distress [

The HIV/AIDS epidemic that captivated world attention in the 1980s and 1990s, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and 2003, the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009, the Ebola virus outbreak in 2013, and the Zika virus outbreak in 2016 are some examples of sudden outbreaks that posed monumental challenges to the mental health service system [

For example, in the Ebola-affected regions, few measures were taken to address the mental health needs of confirmed patients, their families, medical staff, or the general population, and this resembles the responses to all recent epidemics. The absence of mental health and psycho-social support systems and the lack of well-trained psychiatrists and/or psychologists in these regions increased the risks of psychological distress and progression to psychopathology [
