<p>Governments and scientific organizations should provide clear information about COVID-19 or any infectious disease-related symptoms, signs, transmission methods, and prevention strategies through scientific websites, daily briefings, and public awareness campaigns. This will help citizens deal with pandemics more effectively and also mitigate the chain of transmission and spread of disease. Denying epidemics and the associated population health risks will cause a loss of confidence in the government and credibility of scientific organizations, which poses an additional burden on disease management and population health services. Lack of effective flow of information and disease-related data and statistics has been a major problem worldwide with the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
