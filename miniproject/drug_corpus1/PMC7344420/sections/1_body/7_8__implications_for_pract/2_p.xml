<p>People may speculate and/or spread rumors, myths, and misinformation about COVID-19 or infectious disease agents. This has been a major problem with the current pandemic, given the widespread use of mass and social media methods, increasing stress and spreading panic. It is essential to encourage the public not to spread misinformation and inform them of verified and credible sources of information. Governments should engage in effective and efficient risk communication and share information regarding disease prevention methods and strategies.</p>
