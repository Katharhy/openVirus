<p>People may be worried, anxious, and depressed due to the constantly changing alerts, media cycle, and social or mass media coverage regarding the spread of COVID-19. Therefore, providing psychological support services by volunteer social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, and counselors could help alleviate stress and persistent excessive arousal. In this regard, long-distance psycho-social support (including telecounseling and online services) can be deployed. Because peopleâ€™s routines may change dramatically during pandemics and quarantine periods, they should receive compassionate services and guidance on becoming familiar with alternative programs and lifestyles. Opening online platforms with audio- and video-based information and demonstrations and providing counseling services and telephone helplines for those with new-onset symptoms or existing mental illnesses can be used until routine mental healthcare services are available.</p>
