<p id="Par13">STIs, especially syphilis, co-occur with HIV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Lab machines that test for STDs are different than those used to test for COVID-19, but the clinics and clinicians who test and treat STDs are involved heavily in the fight against COVID-19. This risks further the release of a key lever to diagnose and treat STIs and HIV. Now is the time to broaden venues for STI testing to involve primary care, addiction treatment settings, or anywhere that makes sense in each jurisdiction. This may require considerate and strategic communication with policymakers and community leaders to keep attention to STIs in this era of COVID-19. Strategy sessions now can help re-commit to keeping free or low-cost STI testing as the bellwether of sexual health in our communities.
