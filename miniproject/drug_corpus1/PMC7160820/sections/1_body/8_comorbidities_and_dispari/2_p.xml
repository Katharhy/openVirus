The objective of this activity is to identify where and how stigma-reduction interventions might most optimally be implemented and to explore how the promotion of resilience might contribute to this process. To accomplish this objective, the HIV Center, the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, the New York State DOH, and the Northeast/Caribbean AIDS Education and Training Center have established a partnership to establish the NYC Stigma and Resilience Coalition, a multi-sector, interdisciplinary coalition of HIV-related organizations, affected communities, non-traditional partners, public health officials and academic researchers, to devise strategies for overcoming HIV and related stigmas.
