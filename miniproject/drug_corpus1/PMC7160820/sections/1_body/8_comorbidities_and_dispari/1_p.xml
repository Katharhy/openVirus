<p id="Par14">Persons living with HIV or who live in communities disproportionally affected by HIV often also are grappling with combinations of mental health issues, substance use disorder(s) and barriers to social determinants of health, including unstable housing and incarceration, and multiple intersecting stigmas and discrimination [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and to persisting in HIV prevention [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and sadly some of these may even be magnified during this pandemic. Differential costs for redirecting resources to COVID-19 include leaving further behind those who live with these comorbidities, including increasing numbers of those living with consistently high viral counts, of those who cannot sustain PrEP use, and consequently with the number of those who become HIV-infected. Now is the time to scale-up innovative, technology-driven, community-based prevention outreach and HIV care for those who are living with these comorbidities of mental health, substance use disorders, and barriers to social determinants of health.
