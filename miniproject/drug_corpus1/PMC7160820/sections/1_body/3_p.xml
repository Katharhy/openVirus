<p id="Par4">As recently as late January, we at UCLA
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> hosted a meeting of public health and community leaders from all eight impacted California counties to plan transformation of our collective HIV prevention and treatment efforts and to re-commit to the efforts needed to End the HIV Epidemic. The goals of the meeting were: to identify barriers and facilitators to sharing and scaling-up HIV prevention across the counties; to examine techniques for regional HIV surveillance to identify “hot spots”/micro-epidemics to guide allocation of prevention resources and trim the outbreak; to engage stakeholders and policy makers to prepare for long-acting injectable medications. Then COVID-19 shifted all of our work; we need now to integrate into our objectives shifts that accommodate responses needed for COVID-19 and to maintain commitments to make measurable progress not only to maintain gains in HIV treatment and prevention, but to end the HIV epidemic.
