<p id="Par6">First, we know that HIV is not transmitted when people living with HIV keep their viral levels undetectable [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Yet remaining undetectable depends on regular access to blood tests to show medications are working. As machines and people who conduct these tests are re-purposed for COVID-19, fewer tests for HIV viral load will be available. Fewer clinicians will have time to meet with patients. Patients will be less certain of their HIV status. This threatens hard fought scientific advancements, including treatment as prevention [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Now is the time to triage viral load tests, and prioritize tests for patients with histories of poorly controlled levels. Tele-health visits for patients with histories of consistently undetectable levels can preserve valuable clinician resources. We know how to do this, but never before at scale. Let us try to do that now, and study the process as we do. Work is already underway by University of Pennsylvania researchers
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> to work with the public health department and community to evaluate the most effective existing and new U=U messaging. A similar effort has been initiated by Yale investigators in Puerto Rico.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3">3</xref> This work continues and could be undertaken in many more communities.
