<p id="Par9">HIV prevention is built upon free and accessible HIV antibody testing and counseling—particularly in neighborhoods and communities disproportionally affected by HIV. Today, most of these venues are closed for safety reasons. Unfortunately, the need for these testing services is unchanged. Moreover, in-person testing in clinics and emergency rooms is all but impossible as infectious disease expertise is shifted toward COVID-19. The costs for even temporary stoppage of freely available HIV testing risks new, undetected HIV infections—backsteps our communities cannot afford. Science shows that most new HIV transmissions are linked to people who become newly infected but are unaware of their HIV positive status [

On-line web pages on sexual health can be developed easily in collaboration with individuals who have lost their jobs or companies who want to be altruistic, to distribute kits. Yale-funded researchers are partnering with collaborators in Puerto Rico to learn how best to ramp up home HIV-testing, never more important. In Miami,

They aim to adapt an evidence-based sexual health services intervention designed to increase PrEP uptake to fit the local HIV epidemic in Sacramento County where racial and ethnic minority populations are disproportionately affected by HIV. It’s important to duplicate this work in high-need jurisdictions around the country.
