 </xref> has provided a good example of repurposing clinical drugs for potential treatment of ZIKV infection. For any repurposed drug to work, the compound exposure level must be greater than the efficacious concentration for the repurposed indication. Since the human exposure levels of approved drugs are usually known, a compound with the human exposure level above the EC
 <sub>90</sub> value (a drug concentration required to inhibit 90% of viral replication) may be readily advanced to clinical trials for the new indication.

To achieve this goal, rilpivirine analogs previously synthesized during lead optimization could be tested against ZIKV. Because HIV-1 and ZIKV may have different structure-and-activity (SAR) relationships, compounds with better potency for ZIKV may be identified from the rilpivirine analogs. Meanwhile, efforts could be made to solve the co-crystal structure of compound-RdRp complex. The structural information could be used for rational design, as previously shown for dengue RdRp inhibitors.
