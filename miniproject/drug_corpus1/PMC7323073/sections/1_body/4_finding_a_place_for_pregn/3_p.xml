<p>The Covid‐19 pandemic highlights the need for giving pregnant women the opportunity to make informed, autonomous decisions about whether to participate in preventive and treatment trials. This should hold true independently of how research risks and benefits are distributed within the maternal‐fetal dyad: whether an experimental intervention aims to manage a maternal health condition with some secondary benefit to the fetus (such as treatment of maternal hypertension with the reduction of preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, and preterm delivery) or aims to manage a fetal condition with little or no secondary benefit for the woman (such as in utero repair of meningomyelocele). At the same time, research involving pregnant women must take into consideration the significant unknowns about Covid‐19, its prevention, and treatment. This calls for weighing the unknown risks of SARS‐CoV‐2 and Covid‐19 against the known medical, ethical, and social harms of excluding pregnant women from clinical trials. Finally, research involving pregnant women must be responsive to the evolving understanding of the virus and associated disease for the pregnant woman, fetus, and newborn.</p>
