<p>The design and conduct of research including pregnant women may be fraught with logistical and ethical considerations that often require additional time and effort to address. Yet these should not dissuade researchers from conducting the key studies needed to advance the understanding of Covid‐19 in this population, nor should policy‐makers refrain from advocating for and supporting such research. Without these efforts, the harms from the Covid‐19 pandemic will be increased for pregnant women, their fetuses, and their families—not just from the virus itself but also from the choices that scientists, policy‐makers, and society have made about acceptable levels of risks for women.</p>
