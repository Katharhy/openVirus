 <bold>S</bold>ome may contend that the risks to pregnant women in taking part in experimental trials of drugs or vaccines is unacceptably high when nonpharmacologic alternatives may exist. For instance, a recommendation for prolonged social distancing may initially appear as a more acceptable alternative for the management of pregnant women during a pandemic. There are, however, unique risks to extending the nature or duration of social distancing for pregnant women while other members of the community have access to experimental vaccines and treatments. This approach would disproportionally expose pregnant women to economic and social hardships within their communities, including threats that may be worsened in the context of pregnancy (such as the risk of domestic abuse). Furthermore, persistent social distancing may limit access to community‐based group prenatal care support programs, particularly for women who suffer the brunt of health care disparities and/or do not have access to the Internet.
