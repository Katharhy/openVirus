<p>Pregnant women are recognized as a “scientifically complex” population whose inclusion in clinical research must take into consideration the unique state of pregnancy and the relationships of the maternal‐fetal dyad.

 </xref> This is due, in part, to the physiological and anatomical changes accompanying pregnancy. These changes alter pregnant women's responses to pharmacological agents and can increase the risks of morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases (such as the H1N1 influenza virus) compared to the risks for the general population. In addition, pregnant women's interests and actions are often the subject of public ethical debate; societal values and beliefs about women's autonomous choices during pregnancy may be at odds with women's reported interests and priorities. This becomes apparent in discussions about the nature of risks deemed acceptable for women to expose themselves to during pregnancy and the impact of those decisions on the well‐being of their future newborns.

 </xref> The Covid‐19 pandemic is a call to revisit existing frameworks for the inclusion of pregnant women in research, as these individuals have an important stake in accessing new drugs and vaccines. In the rush to prevent and treat SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, it is crucial that the interests of pregnant women be prioritized in a way that enables them to make autonomous, informed decisions about participating in clinical trials. To neglect their interests could result in grave harm to them, their fetuses and neonates, and their families.
