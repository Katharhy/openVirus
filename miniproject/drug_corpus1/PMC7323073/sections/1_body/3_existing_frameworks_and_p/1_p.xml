 <bold>P</bold>regnant women's exclusion from clinical trials testing the safety and efficacy of Covid‐19 vaccines and treatments is occurring even though, over the past two decades, several advisory bodies and ethics experts have issued recommendations for including pregnant women in clinical trials. In 1994, a U.S. Institute of Medicine committee unanimously recommended that pregnant women not be excluded from drug trials and that U.S. federal regulations governing research with humans move from a presumption of exclusion of pregnant women to one of inclusion.

 </xref> The latter recommendation came to fruition with guidance the National Institutes of Health (NIH) issued in 2001, but pregnant women were not removed from the list of “vulnerable” groups for research purposes until the revised Common Rule for federally funded research took effect in 2019. Although the NIH has specifically emphasized inclusion in recent guidance, exclusion criteria figure prominently both in the Common Rule and in guidance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, contributing to researchers' ongoing reluctance to include pregnant women in their studies.

 </xref> Moreover, methodologies have been proposed that include a staggered approach, increasing inclusion while allowing for customized safety and research protocols.

 </xref> Despite these changes, data from clinical trials reveal that pregnant women are still significantly underrepresented as trial participants. For example, 73% of drugs approved by the FDA between 2000 and 2010 included no clinical trial data about risk in pregnant women. And a 2012 study found that 95% of industry‐sponsored clinical trials that included women of childbearing age specifically excluded pregnant women.
