<p id="p0195">Harmalkar et al. performed the total synthesis of the natural gramistilbenoids A, B, C, and of their analogues (

 <xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. The stilbenoid 
 <bold>26</bold> bearing a vinyl group displayed a moderate inhibitory activity against HNV replication on HG23 cells. Therefore, SAR studies were performed on 
 <bold>26</bold>, and it was observed that a vinyl moiety and –OMe groups on ring A, a substituent at the 
 <italic>para</italic>-position on ring B, and the 
 <italic>trans</italic> configuration of the double bond were crucial for the antiviral activity. An optimum of antiviral potency, low cytotoxicity and highest metabolic stability in human and mouse liver microsomes was achieved in compound 
 <bold>28</bold> (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.43 μM, CC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 100 μM). 
 <bold>28</bold> inhibited the viral RNA genome replication probably involving the heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1) dependent stress inducible pathway, a host signal target and a new mechanism of action that may lead to the development of new anti-HNV drugs [
