<p id="p0135">Han et al. evaluated the antiviral activity of other twenty-six resveratrol analogues, originally synthesized as anti-cancer agents [
 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In particular, the compounds PNR-4-44 and PNR-5-02 showed a dose-dependent inhibition of DENV2-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) in Huh 7 cells, with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 8.12 ± 0.82 nM and 7.22 ± 0.85 nM, respectively (
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). The cytotoxicity was also low, with CC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1.7 μM and 1.9 μM, resulting in SI values of 209 and 263, respectively. In the time-of-addition (TOA) assay, the compounds resulted inactive when added 12 h after the infection, suggesting an activity in the post-entry and fusion events, such as viral translation, replication, or events prior to viral proteins assembly. Both compounds were found to inhibit RNA viral synthesis in DENV2 replication, but they resulted inactive against the viral RdRp. In a pretreatment cells study, only PNR-5-02 affected the DENV2 replication, implying at least partially interactions with host cell factors required for viral replication. On the other hand, PNR-4-44, inactive in the pretreatment, seemed to directly target the virus. The exact mechanism of action is not known. Interestingly, Dengue virus belong to the same family of HCV, sharing a similar NS3 protein [

 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], Dengue virus NS3 could be likely one of the possible target. The key molecular features of resveratrol analogues involved in the anti-DENV activity still need to be elucidated and the authors underlined that SAR studies are still needed to improve their activity-cytotoxicity profile [
