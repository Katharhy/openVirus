<p id="p0130">Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne virus, causing a wide spectrum of diseases, which can vary from mild fever to acute-flu like illness and life-threatening haemorrhagic fever (severe dengue). DENV belongs to the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family, possessing a single-stranded RNA genome, and includes four serotypes (DENV-1-4). 100–400 million dengue virus infections are estimated each year. Dengue affects in particular South-East Asia (about 70% of the global burden) and Western Pacific regions, but it has rapidly spread worldwide in recent years. So far, there is no specific treatment for dengue fever [

In 2019, Jasso-Miranda and coworkers studied a collection of polyphenols, including resveratrol, for their potential beneficial effects against dengue virus. Unfortunately, resveratrol did not exhibit antiviral activity for U937-DC-SIGN cells infected with DENV-2 and DENV-3, although showing low toxicity [
