<p id="p0125">In 2019, the same authors confirmed the inhibitory capability of (+)-ϵ-viniferin against HCV [

 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) was isolated from the extract of roots of 
 <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> and, thanks to an efficient synthetic methodology, substantial amounts of (±)-ϵ-viniferin ((±)-ϵ-VF) and penta-acetylated (±)-ϵ-viniferin ((±)-ϵ VF–5Ac) were made available. All the three compounds showed potent anti-HCV activity in 2a and 1b HCV genotype replicon cells with low cytotoxicity (CC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 10 μM). The results from genotype 2a luciferase reporter assay showed that (+)-ϵ-VF exerted the most potent antiviral effects with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.1 μM, followed by the racemates (±)-ϵ-VF (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.2 μM) and (±)-ϵ-VF-5Ac (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.37 μM). In general, the pure enantiomer (+)-ϵ-VF exhibited 2.0- and 3.2-fold higher antiviral activity than that of the racemate in both genotypes 2a (RT-PCR and Western blot). These data suggested a lower potency of (−)-ϵ-viniferin. However, similar experiments on genotype 1b HCV replicon cells showed that (±)-ϵ-VF displayed higher antiviral activity (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.7 μM) in comparison to (+)-ϵ-VF (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 7 μM). Additionally, the authors confirmed that (+)-ϵ-VF suppressed HCV NS3 helicase activity, using a GO-based NS3 helicase assay described by Jang [
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] and comparing the effect to resveratrol activity. The pharmacokinetic profile of (±)-ϵ-VF were studied on mice after oral and intraperitoneal administration. The intraperitoneal dosing resulted in much higher plasma concentrations than those after oral administration, suggesting that the low oral bioavailability of (±)-ϵ-VF is due to poor absorption through the intestinal epithelium and to intestinal first pass effects [
