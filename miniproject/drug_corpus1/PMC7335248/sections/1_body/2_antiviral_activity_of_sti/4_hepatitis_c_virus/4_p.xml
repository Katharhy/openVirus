<p id="p0120">Other natural stilbenoids were identified as potent anti-HCV. In the last years, Lee et al. published two papers about this topic. In 2016, they observed the inhibitory effect of an extract from the roots of 
 <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> on HCV infected- Huh7.5 hepatocarcinoma cells and identified five oligostilbenes as responsible for the suppression of HCV replication exerted by the extract. The compounds were two resveratrol dimers, ampelopsin A (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> ) and (+)-ϵ-viniferin (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), and three resveratrol tetramers, vitisin A (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), wilsonol C and vitisin B (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Also in this case, compounds with more complex structures (tetramers) demonstrated higher potency in comparison to simpler ones (dimers). In particular, vitisin B resulted to be the most potent oligostilbene, displaying its activity by directly binding the NS protein HCV NS3, dramatically decreasing viral replication at nanomolar concentrations (EC
 <sub>50</sub> value = 6 nM) (

 <italic>in vivo</italic> pharmacokinetic studies, after intraperitoneal injection in rats, vitisin B showed a preferred tissue distribution in the liver, which is a major organ of HCV replication [
