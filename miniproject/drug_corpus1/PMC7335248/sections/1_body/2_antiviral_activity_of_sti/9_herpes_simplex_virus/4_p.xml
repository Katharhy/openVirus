<p id="p0225">Ito et al. reported the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 of some oligostilbenoids isolated from 
 <italic>Shorea uliginosa</italic> (Dipterocarpaceae) and other plants belonging to the same family [

 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), (−)-hopeaphenol, shoreaketone, vaticanol B, vaticanol G and α-viniferin showed a potent inhibitory effect towards the replication of HSV-1 and HSV-2. (−)-Hopeaphenol and shoreaketone showed the same IC
 <sub>50</sub> value (2.8 μM) against HSV-1, while IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 6.4 μM and 6.8 μM against HSV-2, respectively, with SI ranging from 55 to 180. Additionally, the authors performed TOA assays to outline the drug-sensitive phase of HSV-2 replication to hopeaphenol and shoreaketone in comparison with acyclovir (ACV). The two oligostilbenoids acted as potent virucidal when added to the medium during viral infection, and throughout the incubation thereafter, or immediately after infection, whereas ACV exhibited a lower effect. This study suggested that the antiviral activity of these compounds is due to a different mode of action in comparison with that of the current clinically-used drug ACV [
