<p id="p0215">Herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) belong to 
 <italic>Herpesviridae</italic> family, 
 <italic>Alphaherpesvirinae</italic> subfamily. Differently from all the other viruses treated above, they are double-stranded DNA viruses and exist as two types: HSV-1 and HSV-2 [
 <xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. HSV-1 is the most common form of herpes. More than 60% of the human population contract orofacial infections, that can lead to infectious blindness and viral encephalitis in adults [
 <xref rid="bib97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. On the other hand, HSV-2 infection affects the genital area and is a major cause of sexually transmitted diseases (STD), such as HIV and human papillomavirus (HPV) [

 <xref rid="bib99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. The infections may be latent and appear periodically, due to the virus capability to infect neurons, in particular the sensorial nerve termini, then traveling in a retrograde manner. Therefore, HSV may reactivate a lytic-replication cycle leading to a recurrent infection, viral shedding and transmission to new hosts [

 <xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Nucleoside analogues, such as acyclovir and pencyclovir, are administered as therapeutic agents against HSV. However, it is necessary to develop new antiherpetic compounds due to the growth of herpes simplex virus strains resistant to acyclovir [
