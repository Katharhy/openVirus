 <italic>Hopea</italic> genus, was screened as anti-HSV-1 and anti-HSV-2 agents by Chen. et al. [
 <xref rid="bib103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. In general, the compounds were more active against HSV-2 infection than that from HSV-1. Vaticaffinol, a tetramer with reported antifungal properties, was one of the most promising compounds, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 3.2 μM against HSV-2. The results of this study showed a potent, dose-dependent antiviral effect of the compounds, which promoted ROS production, coinciding with suppression of HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication in treated cells [
