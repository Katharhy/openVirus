<p id="p0220">In 2016, Ma et al. [
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] demonstrated the anti-HSV activity of some stilbene derivatives isolated from Mulberry (
 <italic>Morus alba</italic> L.) leaves. All the compounds (
 <xref rid="fig18" ref-type="fig">Fig. 18</xref> ) were tested against HSV-1 (15577 and a clinical strain) and HSV-2 (333 strain), and resulted to have good IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 2.5 to 25.0 μg/mL, but low SI in many cases. In particular, mulberrofuran G resulted in SI values of 3.6 and 4 on the HSV-1 tested strains, and 3.5 on HSV-2. Kuwanon X was the best compound of the series with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 2.2, 1.5 and 2.5 μg/mL and SI values of 37, 55 and 32 for HSV-1 15577, HSV-1 clinical strain and HSV-2 standard, respectively. For this reason, the authors deeply analyzed the mechanism of action of kuwanon X against HSV-1 by various experiments, including virucidal assay, inhibition of attachment and penetration assay and TOA assay. They concluded that kuwanon X was active as anti-HSV with multiple mechanisms of action, including inhibition of viral adsorption and penetration, reduction of immediate-early (IE), late (L) gene expression and viral DNA biosynthesis, and inhibition of the NF-κB activation induced by HSV. Indeed, NF-κB has been demonstrated to be highly activated by HSV-1 and HSV-2 in many cell lines, being necessary for initiation of viral replication and viral protein synthesis. The NF-κB pathway suppression has been revealed to inhibit HSV replication [
