<p id="p0200">The genus 
 <italic>Enterovirus</italic>, belonging to the large family of 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>, includes enteroviruses (EVs), coxsackie A (CVA) and B (CVB) viruses, echoviruses, polioviruses (PV), and rhinoviruses (RV). This wide class of viruses is responsible for several illnesses, such as hand-foot-and-mouth (HFM) disease, encephalitis, paralysis, respiratory diseases, poliomyelitis, affecting millions of people worldwide. Enteroviruses are non-enveloped small positive-strand RNA viruses, encapsulated by an icosahedral capsid. The life cycle starts when the virus binds to a surface cell receptor, and it is internalized by endocytosis into the cell. The RNA is released into the cytosol and translated into a polyprotein, which is cleaved by the viral proteases to yield the structural and NS proteins. The NS proteins are involved in the replication of RNA via a negative strand intermediate that works as template for the synthesis of new positive strands. The new synthesized RNAs may be further translated and replicated, or directly encapsulated in the viral capsid proteins to form new infectious virions. The viral proteases trigger also host cell factors, which help virus replication, reproduction and proliferation [
