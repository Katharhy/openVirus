 <italic>cis</italic>-resveratrol isolated from the methanol extract of the twigs of 
 <italic>Caesalpinia latisiliqua</italic> were tested for the antiviral activity against HRV1B-, CVB3- and EV71- infections by Oh et al. Resveratrol showed antiviral activity against HRV1B with IC

 <italic>cis</italic>-resveratrol exhibited significant antiviral activity in CVB3 infection with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 12.2 μM and in EV71 infection with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 37.6 μM [
