<p id="p0140">Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus of the 
 <italic>Lentiviridae</italic> family [
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], responsible for the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which currently affects more than 37 million people [
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. HIV infects CD4-positive T-helper through viral envelope glycoproteins (gp120 and gp41) that recognize and bind the CD4 receptor and other coreceptors (CCR5, CXCR4). Once inside the cells, the virus exploits a reverse transcriptase (RT) to transcribe its RNA into DNA that is incorporated in the cell host genome by a viral integrase. At this point, as an integrated provirus, HIV can remain latent for years. The transition from latency to HIV replication and subsequent infection occurs when host cellular transcription factors are activated along with regulatory HIV proteins [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Antiretroviral drugs effectively control viral replication, but the high mutation rate of HIV-1, along with the huge number of viral particles produced by host cells, has led to drug resistance and expedited the development of novel drug therapies [
