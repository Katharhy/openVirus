<p id="p0175">Cellular proteins, like NF-κB, and regulatory viral proteins, like Tat (transactivator of transcription), are involved in the reactivation of HIV-provirus after latency by binding sites in the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) [
 <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. NF-κB transcription factors take part to several biological processes such as immune and inflammatory responses, cell transformation, apoptosis, embryonic liver development, and transcription of viral genes, including HIV. NF-κB is highly produced upon activation of the primary human T cells, the primary HIV target, and it activates a complex array of systems resulting in increased transcriptional activation and virus multiplication, binding target sequences in the LTR. Since NF-κB is a normal part of human cells, it should not mutate, like viral targets [

On the other hand, Tat is a viral regulatory protein, which recruits cellular factors binding the enhancer region of the HIV-LTR, like NF-κB, enhancing virus replication. Moreover, Tat induces the HIV-coreceptor expression, such as CXCR4 and CCR5, and the release of chemokines, which attract monocytes and CD4 T lymphocytes to perpetuate the infection [

 <xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 14</xref> ), was found to bind directly Tat protein and to prevent the upregulation of the HIV coreceptor CXCR4. The two negative charged sulfonate groups, the spacer between them, and the pyrazolic nucleus of CGA137053 seemed to be fundamental in the interaction with Tat. The inhibition of Tat protein was demonstrated to work intracellularly and to inhibit HIV-1 replication on HIV-infected, primary human leucocytes (PBL) and macrophages in a dose-dependent manner (EC
