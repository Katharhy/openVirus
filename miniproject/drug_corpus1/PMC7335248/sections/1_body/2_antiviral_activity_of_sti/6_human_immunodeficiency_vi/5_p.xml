<p id="p0155">Resveratrol along with various glucopyranoside derivatives was extracted and isolated from 
 <italic>Polygonum cuspidatum</italic> and 
 <italic>Polygonum multiflorum</italic> by Lin et al. [
 <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The compounds were tested on cell line C8166 as anti-HIV-1 agents. Resveratrol showed the greatest inhibitory activity against HIV replication with EC
 <sub>50</sub> 4.37 μg/mL and therapeutic index value (TI = CC
 <sub>50</sub>/EC
 <sub>50</sub>) of 8.14, while the glycosylated derivatives showed a severe decrease of potency with respect to their corresponding aglycones (
 <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref> , 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> ). Among the glycosylated compounds, the position of sulphate group did not influence the antiviral activity. Conversely, the stereochemistry of the double bond seemed to affect the activity, as the 
 <italic>cis</italic> isomer 
 <bold>14</bold> (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 84.77 μg/mL) was more active than the 
 <italic>trans</italic> isomer 
 <bold>13b</bold> (EC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 200 μg/mL), even if more cytotoxic (CC
 <sub>50</sub> = 98.82 μg/mL and CC
 <sub>50</sub> = 812.88 μg/mL for 
 <bold>14</bold> and 
 <bold>13b</bold>, respectively) [
 <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Interestingly, compounds 
 <bold>14</bold> is characterized by a 
 <italic>cis</italic> configuration at the double bond, which likely favors the interaction with the target, thus increasing the antiviral activity.
