<p id="p0165">Cardin et al. studied the stilbene disulfonic acids 4,4′-diisothiocyanato- stilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS), 4,4′-diisothiocyanatodihydrostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (H
 <sub>2</sub>DIDS), and 4-acetamido-4′-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (SITS) as CD4 antagonists (
 <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref> ). CD4 is the receptor expressed on the cell surface of T helper lymphocytes and macrophages, involved in the activation of immune system response, but also mediator of the HIV fusion, binding the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120. All the three compounds inhibited the growth of HIV-1 strain RF in C8166 and MT4 cells, and GB8 strain in JM cells. In particular, DIDS and H
 <sub>2</sub>DIDS seemed to covalently bind a lysine residue in the CDR-3 domain of CD4, a region that is not closely involved in CD4-immune system response activation, thus blocking the CD4-gp120 interaction. Hence, the two diisothiocianate functions were fundamental in the interaction with the target, since SITS resulted less active. DIDS resulted the most active compound, maybe due to the constraint conferred by the double bond with respect to the less rigid dihydrostilbene H
 <sub>2</sub>DIDS [
