In this respect, biocatalysis has a number of important advantages such as high efficiency, mild reaction conditions, versatility and high selectivity (chemo-, regio- and stereoselectivity). Notably, preliminary 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies reported in the literature have shown that in general, stilbenoids show low bioavailability and undergo extensive metabolism and it has been pointed out that bioconverted forms of polyphenols, (phase I and II metabolism) may probably have more importance than the parent compound found in the diet or administered in therapy. In many cases, synthetic efforts produced stilbene derivatives with greater potency than their parent compounds, allowing to expand knowledge on modes of action and to deepen structure-activity relationship studies of the most active compounds [
