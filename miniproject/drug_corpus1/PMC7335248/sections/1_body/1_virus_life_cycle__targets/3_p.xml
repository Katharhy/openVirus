<p id="p0065">Depending on the type of virus and on the host cells, several assays are available to investigate the activity of antiviral compounds. In the plaque reduction assay (PRA), infected cells are treated with a potential antiviral agent, which should cause a decrease of the number of pfu (plaque forming units) in comparison with untreated cells, allowing the determination of IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (the concentration of the compound able to decrease plaque numbers by 50% with respect to untreated cells). Determining compounds cytotoxicity as the concentrations reducing cell viability by 50% (CC
 <sub>50</sub>), the selectivity index (SI) can be calculated as the ratio of CC
 <sub>50</sub> to IC
 <sub>50</sub> [

 <sub>50</sub> values as the inhibitory concentrations of antivirals needed to lower by 50% the viral induced CPEs [

Other methods, such as immunoassays, flow cytometry, fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, enzymatic assays (i.e. NA activity assay), are also used to study viral replication, to detect viral products such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and to identify the target of the antiviral agent studied [
