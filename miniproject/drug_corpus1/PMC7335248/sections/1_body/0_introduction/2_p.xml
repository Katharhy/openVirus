<p id="p0035">Viruses represent a major threat to the global health and economy. Every year emerging and re-emerging viruses from natural reservoirs constantly infect human population causing risks of viral epidemics and pandemics [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In 1997, avian influenza A (H5N1) directly spread from poultry to humans. In 1999 a severe encephalitis outbreak, caused by a new paramyxovirus (Nipah virus), occurred in Malaysia and Singapore. During 2002 to 2003, a novel coronavirus (CoV), known as SARS-CoV, caused more than 8000 infections, spreading to 37 countries. In 2009, a swine H1N1 influenza A virus provoked a pandemic influenza, followed by the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), caused by a new deadly (&gt;30% mortality) MERS-CoV in 2012. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa (2014–2016) became the deadliest occurrence of the disease since its discovery in 1976, and finally the viral pneumonia outbreak, caused by 2019-nCoV, started in China in December 2019 and officially declared as a pandemic by WHO on 11
 <sup>th</sup> March 2020 [
