<p id="p0040">The urgent need of antivirals appeared since 1980s because of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) spread causing acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Zidovudine (AZT) was the first anti-HIV drug approved in the United States in 1986. Since then, many research efforts to treat HIV led to important improvement in antiviral research and many new classes of drugs targeting a wide variety of human viruses have been introduced. Natural products from marine sponges, sea algae, arthropods and plants were largely screened as source of inspiration for new antiviral agents [

Indeed, natural materials, such as herbs, spices, roots, leaves, barks have been used throughout the history as traditional medicines, flavours or food preservatives. Nowadays, many clinically used drugs have been inspired by natural products, which constitute a broad biodiversity of molecules in terms of chemical space and biological properties. In the last 40 years, 185 antiviral agents were introduced. Vaccines account for 47%, but looking at small molecules, 19 were totally synthetic molecules, while 53 were natural derivatives or nature-inspired semisynthetic compounds [
