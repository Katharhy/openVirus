<p id="Par26">Much COVID-19-related RWO data have political or institutional sensitivities, some have personal components. Sensitive and personal data cannot be ‘open’ and the sensitive and personal data associated with COVID-19 cannot leave the country, and in most cases, the institution that controls them. Such data can only be accessed partially and in controlled circumstances, and for this to be achieved, the data must be FAIR. We need, therefore, to make a rigorous choice in favour of FAIR (as opposed to always Open) while continuing to emphasise the policy: As open as possible, as closed as necessary.</p>
