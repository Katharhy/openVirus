<p id="Par22">In VODAN, we clearly distinguish between ‘established knowledge’ (EK) based on the published literature, databases and public datasets, and what we call ‘Real World Observations’ (RWO), made on actual situations in real time. The main challenge of VODAN is on the latter class of data, as many other public as well as private organisations are already dealing with FAIR-enabled public databases and applications (such as for instance ELIXIR, BBMRI, EBI, NLM, Euretos). Those organisations that work on EK bases and biomedical research results are obviously candidate ‘data stations’ in the Personal Health Train sense and these are welcome to the VODAN IN and to format their assets also according to the FAIR principles.</p>
