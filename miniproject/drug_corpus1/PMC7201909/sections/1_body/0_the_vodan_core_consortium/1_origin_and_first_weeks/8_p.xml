<p id="Par24">First, there is the established ‘GDPR’ issue of citizen/patient privacy and this means that the RWO cannot just be ‘open’. VODAN will also demonstrate the difference between ‘FAIR’ and ‘open’ by combining restricted data with opne data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Second, this epidemic is particularly highly politicised, and there is little chance that countries (or even institutions) will ‘share their RWO data’ in the classical way, i.e. by ‘sending’ them to a central data warehouse, not even at WHO. A third issue to address is that, like in the earlier HIV epidemic, there will be so much money forthcoming for research and experimental interventions that there will be an enormous variety of overlapping, and even redundant projects and consequently a wave of data, of which a significant portion will be of questionable quality. This means that we need a strong emphasis on distributed analytics as well as on vetting and annotation of data, for which we need (expert) distributed annotation in near-real time. This can only be done with machine-assistance and through (expert) community-based massive annotation.
