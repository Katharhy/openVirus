<p id="Par1">The Virus Outbreak Data Network (VODAN) Implementation Network (IN)
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> was conceived to kick-start a ‘community of communities’ that could design and rapidly build a truly international and interoperable, distributed data network infrastructure that supports evidence-based responses to the viral outbreak. The IN has a longer-term goal to reuse the resulting data and service infrastructure, also for future outbreaks. As a GO FAIR IN, VODAN will restrict itself to projects that are directly associated with FAIR data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and services relevant to COVID-19. This also means that VODAN will not concern itself with projects purely aimed at studying, for instance, transmission and severity genetics, experimental drug development, vaccine development or actual clinical interventions currently executed to control the epidemic. Only insofar as such activities are in need of access to, and processing of, FAIR data, VODAN partners can add FAIR data and services value.
