<p>Healthcare personnel arriving at the patient’s room prior to the specialized response team can assist the patient with resuscitation interventions that have a low risk of viral transmission, such as placing an oral airway, placing an oxygen mask with an exhalation filter, chest compressions, defibrillation and cardioversion, obtaining intravenous or intraosseous access and administering drugs. Higher risk interventions which may generate aerosol and increase risk for infection to staff and nosocomial spread include high flow nasal cannula, bag-mask ventilation, CPAP/BiPAP (continuous positive airway pressure/bilevel positive airway pressure), and endotracheal intubation [
