<p>The coronavirus has also demonstrated the ability to emerge into new hosts and then cause novel severe disease. In 2012, the MERS coronavirus was discovered in Saudi Arabia, isolated from the sputum of a man who died from a severe respiratory syndrome. The illness was subsequently termed MERS and since then 2494 cases have been reported, resulting in 858 deaths. This yields a higher case fatality rate than SARS, at 36%, with mechanical ventilation needed in 50–89% of patients [
