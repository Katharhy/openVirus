 </xref> Serology testing is currently not widely available. It is important to ensure that routine local protocols for testing in acute pneumonia/pneumonitis are also followed, such as bacterial cultures, urinary antigen testing, acute and convalescent serology and respiratory virus panels. At this stage, faecal sampling is not standard; however, this may be indicated in those with gastrointestinal symptoms. A positive test for COVID‐19 must be immediately notified to the relevant communicable diseases agency.
