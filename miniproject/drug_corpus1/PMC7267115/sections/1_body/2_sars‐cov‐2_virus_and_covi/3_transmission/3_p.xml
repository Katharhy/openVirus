<p>Entry of coronaviruses into human target cells requires spike (S) protein binding to a cellular receptor followed by S protein priming by host proteases to facilitate cell entry.

 </xref> SARS‐CoV‐2 human‐to‐human transmission is enabled by the interaction of the SARS‐CoV‐2 S‐protein with the human angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor.

 </xref> Transmission occurs when the virus enters the nose, mouth or eyes, and potentially the digestive system and attaches to cells that produce ACE2. ACE2 are found in multiple organs and are highly expressed in lung AT2 cells, enterocytes of the small intestine and colon.

 </xref> Once the virus is attached to ACE2 it uses the host serine protease TMPRSS2 for S priming allowing fusion of viral and cellular membranes and viral entry into the cell.
