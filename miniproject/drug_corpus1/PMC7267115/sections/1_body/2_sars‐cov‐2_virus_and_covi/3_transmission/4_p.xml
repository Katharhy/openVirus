<p>Once a person develops initial symptoms of COVID‐19, respiratory viral shedding occurs for a median of 20 days in survivors and is sustained until death in nonsurvivors.

 </xref> However, the implications of this prolonged shedding are unknown as virus detected by PCR does not necessarily indicate viable virus or infectivity; a study of nine COVID‐19 patients demonstrated that infectious virus was only isolated from samples taken before day 8 of symptom onset despite ongoing high viral loads and shedding after this time point.

 </xref> Asymptomatic people are also potential sources of SARS‐CoV‐2 as transmission may occur in the pre‐clinical period (2‐14 days) or from an oligosymptomatic individual.
