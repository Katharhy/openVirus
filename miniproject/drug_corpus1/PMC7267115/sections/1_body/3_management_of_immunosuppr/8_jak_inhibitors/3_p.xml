<p>Interestingly, baricitinib, a JAK inhibitor used in rheumatoid arthritis, has a potential therapeutic role in the management of SARS‐CoV‐2 through both its anti‐inflammatory action and Numb‐associated kinase (NAK) inhibition. Tofacitinib has no affinity for this particular kinase. NAKs are involved in the function of clathrin, which mediates endocytosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 into cells resulting in infection.

 </xref> Due to the anti‐inflammatory effects of the JAK inhibitors, it has also been speculated that they may be able to combat the elevated levels of cytokines observed in COVID‐19 which may potentially further decrease the severity of the infection.
