<p>Tofacitinib, an orally active Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, is employed in the management of UC, particularly in those patients with disease refractory to biologic agents. Tofacitinib may impair immunity to viral infections and has been shown to increase the risk of herpes zoster (HZ) infection, with 5.6% of UC patients developing HZ on long‐term extension trials.

 </xref> However, long‐term follow‐up of patients treated with this agent for rheumatoid arthritis have described rates of URTI (18.8%) and nasopharyngitis (14.6%) comparable to that of anti‐TNFs.

 </xref> Serious infection was found to be increased with tofacitinib in the induction trials for UC, but similar across treatment groups including placebo in the maintenance trial.

 </xref> Of 4789 patients treated with tofacitinib in phase II, III and LTE studies, 259 patients had serious infections (3.09 events per 100 PY [95% CI 2.73, 3.49]), and the most common infection was pneumonia.

 </xref> Higher doses of 10 mg twice daily as opposed to 5 mg twice daily, age &gt;65 years, corticosteroids &gt;7.5 mg/d and diabetes were also independent factors associated with increased serious infection risk.

 </xref> Therefore, patients on tofacitinib should be maintained on the lower 5 mg twice daily dose compared to 10 mg twice daily where possible and weaned off corticosteroids.
