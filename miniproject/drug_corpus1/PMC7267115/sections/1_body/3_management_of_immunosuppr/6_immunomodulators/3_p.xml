<p>Methotrexate has variably been demonstrated to increase the risk of infections in patients with inflammatory diseases. Reassuringly, a recent systematic review reassuringly found that in the nonrheumatoid arthritis inflammatory disease population, there was not an increased risk of infection with methotrexate (1.03, 95% CI0.82‐1.3).
