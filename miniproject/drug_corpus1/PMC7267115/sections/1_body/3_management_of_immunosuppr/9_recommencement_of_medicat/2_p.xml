<p>If a patient is exposed to or gets infected with COVID‐19, the withholding of immunosuppressive medications should be considered where possible. Patients exposed to COVID‐19 will usually display symptoms of COVID‐19 within 14 days and therefore if they remain asymptomatic, recommencement of these medications can occur at this time point. If a patient develops COVID‐19 and has held/delayed their IBD medication, recommencement of medication can occur once the infection has been cleared.</p>
