<p>Chloroquine is a widely used anti‐malarial and autoimmune disease drug. It has a broad spectrum anti‐viral action that is exerted on SARS‐CoV by inhibiting the pre‐entry point of the viral cycle by interfering with viral binding to cell surface, increasing endosomal pH required for virus/cell fusion and interfering with the glycosylation of cell surface receptors (ACE 2).

 </xref> It also has immunomodulator properties against many cytokines (IL‐1b, IL‐1, IL‐6, IL‐12, TNF‐a, INF‐a, IFNb, IFNy,) which may enhance its anti‐viral effect and reduce COVID‐19 complications synergistically.
