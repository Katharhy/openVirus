<p>IBD patients present a unique challenge in the setting of the current COVID‐19 pandemic. Of concern is that, at least theoretically, many medications used to treat IBD may result in a degree of immunosuppression and this may lead to an increased risk of infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 and complications arising from COVID‐19. Despite this, global registries and reports are reassuring and there does not appear to be a signal that IBD patients are at greater risk or severe COVID‐19 compared to the general population. These guidelines summarise the treatment approach to IBD patients in the current climate and emphasises the importance of avoiding corticosteroids and maintaining remission by encouraging compliance with patients’ usual maintenance medications. If an IBD patient does develop COVID‐19, immunosuppressive medications should be withheld where possible until infection resolution and if a medication trial is being considered and patients remain on IBD medications, interactions with current IBD medications should be evaluated.</p>
