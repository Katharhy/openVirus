<p id="p0170">Unlike many respiratory viruses, children have been relatively spared by severe illness in the global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 and appear to be only minor contributors to virus transmission. These aspects of SARS-CoV-2 in children likely result from differences in their immune response to the virus, including a lower predisposition to pro-inflammatory states, fewer co-morbidities, and the differential expression of ACE2 in children, which may attenuate viral entry, as well as ongoing replication and subsequent inflammation, hypoxia and tissue injury.</p>
