<p id="p0180">There remain significant questions needing to be addressed regarding the intricate pathogenic mechanisms underlying the differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection between children and adults. Research to better define the immune response and assess the possibility of altered ACE2 tissue distribution and affinity for SARS-CoV-2 in the paediatric population should be a focus for future studies. Understanding the nature of host-virus interactions, and particularly which features of the paediatric immune system facilitate protection or (conversely) delayed multi-system inflammation, will shed light on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and may lead to necessary improvements in therapeutic options. Furthermore, it is important that future epidemiological and clinical cohort data describe clinical comorbidities and coinfections in children with more precision, as well as delineating disease findings implicated in severe COVID-19 and potential SARS-CoV-2 multisystem inflammatory sequelae more clearly. This will enable clarification of risk factors for SARS-CoV-2-related disease and its associated disease entities in children.</p>
