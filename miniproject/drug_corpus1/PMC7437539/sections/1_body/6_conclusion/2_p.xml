<p id="p0175">At the time of writing, the multisystem inflammatory syndromes associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS/MIS-C), which present with KD-like clinical features, remain under investigation. Temporal and serological plausibility of a link with SARS-CoV-2 infection is supported by consistent data, but further studies are required to refine case definitions, establish SARS-CoV-2 as an inciting agent, understand the immune-mediated response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and determine optimal management strategies.</p>
