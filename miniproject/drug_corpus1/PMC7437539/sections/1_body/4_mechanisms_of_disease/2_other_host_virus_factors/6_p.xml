<p id="p0135">It has been hypothesised that SARS-CoV-2 may directly attack vascular endothelial cells expressing high levels of ACE2, resulting in abnormal coagulation and a sepsis-like picture.

 </xref> Dysfunction of the vascular endothelium tends to result in organ ischaemia via a shift in the vascular equilibrium towards vasoconstriction, which further exacerbates tissue inflammation.

 </xref> SARS-CoV-2 may facilitate induction of endotheliitis, as autopsy evidence has revealed the presence of viral inclusion bodies within endothelial cells alongside an accumulation of inflammatory cells, impairing microcirculatory function and resulting in clinical ischaemia of multiple organs.
