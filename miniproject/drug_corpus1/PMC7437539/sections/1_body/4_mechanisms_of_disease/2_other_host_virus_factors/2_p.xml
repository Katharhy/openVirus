<p id="p0115">ACE2 is an enzyme that functions to convert angiotensin II to its metabolite angiotensin-(1–7), particularly within the lung microenvironment, where ACE2 levels are intrinsically elevated.
 <xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref> Angiotensin-(1–7) has a homeostatic role in the regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), a finely tuned cascade of vasoactive peptides that orchestrates key processes of human physiology.

 </xref> The RAAS is an important regulatory pathway for the cardiovascular system and the counter-regulatory enzymes ACE and ACE2 have been identified as key elements of the inflammatory processes established in conditions such as cardiac hypertrophy, pulmonary hypertension, lung injury and sepsis.

 </xref> Diminished expression of ACE2 can result in chronic heart failure and pulmonary compromise, implying a protective mechanism of ACE2 and alluding to a mechanism whereby dysregulated ACE2 in COVID-19 may imbalance the angiotensin-II/angiotensin-(1–7) equilibrium to tend towards inflammation and hypoxia.
