<p id="p0110">One of the most consistent and biologically plausible theories emerging in the literature regarding the mild (if any) disease SARS-CoV-2 causes in children surrounds age-related differences in ACE2. Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on the binding of the viral spike (S) protein to cellular receptors, as well as the cleavage or priming of this S protein by host cell proteases (

 </xref> SARS-CoV-2 (and its predecessors SARS-CoV and the seasonal coronavirus, CoV-NL63) engage ACE2 for cell entry, and utilise the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) for S protein priming.
