 </xref> While ACE2 expression has been found throughout the cardiorespiratory and gastrointestinal systems (with TMPRSS2 expressed even more broadly), nasal epithelial cells exhibit the highest expression of ACE2/TMPRSS2 within the entire respiratory tract, which may explain the prominence of the symptom of anosmia in patients with COVID-19.
