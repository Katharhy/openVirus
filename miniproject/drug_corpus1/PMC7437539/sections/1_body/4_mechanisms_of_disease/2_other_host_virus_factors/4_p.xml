<p id="p0125">In the lower respiratory tract, where both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 appear to have their most acute pathogenic effects, ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression has been identified in both type I and type II pneumocytes.

 </xref> In children, a higher concentration of ACE2 in pneumocytes has been documented, which may explain the protection for this age group against the severe clinical manifestations of COVID-19.

 </xref> Age-dependent ACE2 gene expression has also been documented in the nasal epithelium, with the lowest gene expression evident in younger children and increasing expression evident with age.

 </xref> As this is the first point of contact for SARS-CoV-2 in the human body, lower ACE2 expression in the nasal epithelium of children may explain the infrequent infectivity in this age group.
