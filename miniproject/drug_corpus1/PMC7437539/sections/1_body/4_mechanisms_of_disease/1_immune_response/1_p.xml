<p id="p0095">Similar to SARS-CoV, which caused the 2003 SARS epidemic, several features of SARS-CoV-2 suggest the immune response is central to disease pathogenesis. For both viruses, the delay to onset of significant symptoms points to the priming of an immune response and high levels of inflammatory markers supports an inflammatory pathogenesis, while the worsening of disease in the presence of decreasing viral titres suggests that direct viral cytopathic effects may no longer be of relevance at that time.
