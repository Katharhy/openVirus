<p id="p0105">Very little research currently exists regarding the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in children. Data from New York city has shown that severe disease is associated with obesity in older children, and a pro-inflammatory profile demonstrated by a high C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 levels at admission.

 </xref> Therefore, it seems that a pro-inflammatory state in predisposed children may be associated with severe adult-like COVID-19. Indeed, a key unanswered research area regarding SARS-CoV-2 is how the immune response in children differs from adults, and whether this difference may explain the spectrum of disease susceptibility and severity associated with COVID-19. Postulated reasons as to why most children appear to be protected from an acute hyperinflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 include: (i) the capacity to mount a more controlled and efficient immune response; (ii) relatively fewer co-morbidities that predispose to a pre-existing pro-inflammatory state; and (iii) relatively lower viral loads that may not trigger as intense an inflammatory response.
