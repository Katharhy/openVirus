 </xref> Using single cell ribonucleic acid sequencing (scRNA-seq) several studies have now established the immune profile of adult patients with COVID-19. One study found that in hospitalised adults with COVID-19, especially those with ARDS, there is depletion of natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells and CD16+ monocytes, but expansion of plasmablasts.

Another study focused on the early recovery phase of COVID-19 and identified a prominent population of CD14IL1Î² monocytes in the peripheral blood of adults seven days after showing a negative PCR for SARS-CoV-2, which was associated with increased signalling by inflammatory cytokines (such as type 1 interferons and IL-6 in several immune cell subsets, including monocytes, T cells and B cells).
