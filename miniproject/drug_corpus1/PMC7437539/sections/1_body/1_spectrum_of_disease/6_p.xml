<p id="p0050">The direct long-term outcomes for children from SARS-CoV-2 infection remains to be seen. Aside from the multisystem inflammatory sequelae potentially associated with SARS-CoV-2 (see section 
 <xref rid="sec6" ref-type="sec">Multisystem inflammatory sequelae</xref>) there are no outcome data for children with SARS-CoV-2 infection beyond acute infection. There are preliminary adult data that raise concerns for the longer-term respiratory, cardiac and neurological sequelae. Observations from China in non-critical hospitalised SARS-CoV-2 adult survivors demonstrated persisting pulmonary function defects on discharge; the most common being diffusion capacity, followed by restrictive ventilatory defects, both of which correlated with the severity of acute infection.

 </xref> Myocardial involvement (as evidenced by elevated troponin levels) has been reported in up to 30% of adults hospitalised with SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may be related to myocarditis, myocardial ischaemia/infarction, cardiomyopathy or coronary vasculitis.
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref> The long-term prognosis for such patients is extrapolated from the long-term outcomes of other viral-associated myocardial injury (myocarditis, cardiomyopathy and vasculitis) and general myocardial insults (e.g., myocardial ischaemia/infarction). One concern that requires consideration is the long-term cardiac outcomes for children with SARS-CoV-2 who develop coronary artery abnormalities in the context of the suspected SARS-CoV-2 associated multisystem inflammatory conditions (see section 
 <xref rid="sec6" ref-type="sec">Multisystem inflammatory sequelae</xref>). As may occur in other viral illnesses, there have been case reports of neurological complications in adults with SARS-CoV-2 including neuroinflammatory syndromes (such as encephalitis and acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis), stroke and peripheral nervous disorders (including Guillain–Barré syndrome, plexopathies, and cranial nerve palsies) that may lead to long-term morbidity (with prognoses extrapolated from other viral-associated and general neurological insults).

 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> However, as demonstrated in the differences regarding how children are affected by acute SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to adults, identifying and prognosticating the long-term outcomes for children must be independently evaluated to that of adults, and in the literature to date, there has not been a clear indication that these neurological complications predominate in children infected with SARS-CoV-2.
