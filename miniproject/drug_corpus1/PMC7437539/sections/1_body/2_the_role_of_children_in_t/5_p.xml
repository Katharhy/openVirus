<p id="p0075">Despite the weight of evidence suggesting children are not major drivers of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at a population level, children in many geographic areas have been subject to the same social isolation rules as adults, including widespread school closures. These policies have significant repercussions for education, development and wellbeing.

 </xref> Furthermore, reduced economic productivity at household as well as national levels, and negative impacts on the psychosocial wellbeing of parents and/or caregivers may be expected corollaries. Limiting transmission from adult source cases is essential through prioritisation of optimal hygiene and physical distancing measures; yet the need to enforce physical distancing in children with the same rigour (including universal school closures or restrictions) poses a risk of marked social and emotional morbidity which is not proportionate to the existing evidence for the role of children in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
