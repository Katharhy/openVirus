 </xref> yet studies investigating this method have included very small numbers of children and have revealed higher cycle thresholds when compared with nasal nasopharyngeal specimens, indicating a lower viral load assessed via this sampling method. Although saliva specimens have been investigated in studies involving small numbers of adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection,

Most of the available data regarding the timing of viral detection via PCR is based on evidence obtained from the adult population, and indicates that viral detection via PCR tends to decline more quickly in upper respiratory tract samples than lower respiratory tract samples.
