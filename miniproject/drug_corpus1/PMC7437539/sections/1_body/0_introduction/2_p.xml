<p id="p0015">There are a number of hypotheses postulated to explain children's lower risk of being infected by, and affected by, SARS-CoV-2. These include differences in viral kinetics, a mucosal burden of competing pathogens, and alterations in their immune response including vascular susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most notably, a hyperinflammatory state, with features of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), appears to be a central feature of the pathogenesis of acute severe disease in adults. Children are seemingly acutely protected from this state for reasons that are as yet unclear, yet one of the leading hypotheses regarding their protection from acute illness and transmission relates to age-related differences in expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in different tissue types. ACE2 is a key mediator of SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry and plays an integral role in the endothelial inflammatory response. However, with the recent recognition of potential late multisystem inflammatory sequelae from SARS-CoV-2 infection, differences in the immune-mediated response to SARS-CoV-2 is also of interest.</p>
