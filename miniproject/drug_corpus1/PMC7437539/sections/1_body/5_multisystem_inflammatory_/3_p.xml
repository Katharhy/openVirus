 </xref> Twenty-nine of these cases (50%) developed shock and required intensive care support. Twelve of these children (20%) met the diagnostic criteria for KD, while 24 children (40%) showed no features of KD. However, the patients described were generally older than KD cohorts and showed higher inflammatory markers than is common in KD. Eight (14%) cases developed coronary artery dilation or aneurysms, revealing a possible shared pathogenesis with KD. Almost all children recovered (1 death), with the majority receiving systemic immunomodulatory treatment. Other reports have described a high prevalence of macrophage activation syndrome in PIMS-TS, which is less common in endemic KD than in PIMS-TS.
