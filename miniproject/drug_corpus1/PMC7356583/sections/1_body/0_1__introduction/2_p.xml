<p>Observational studies of COVID-19 individuals with underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) showed that they were at increased risk of severe manifestations of the disease and mortality [

Wang et al. found that SARS-CoV-2 patients needing intensive care unit (ICU) admission were older and more likely to having underlying comorbidities, including hypertension (58.3% vs. 21.6%), diabetes (22.2% vs. 5.9%), CVD (25% vs. 10.8%), and cerebrovascular disease (16.7% vs. 1%) compared to those who did not need ICU treatment [

Furthermore, the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention published a case series of COVID-19, with an overall case fatality rate of 2.3%. Importantly, in patients with underlying CVD, the mortality rate was 10.5% (in comparison to 7.3% for diabetes, 6.3% for chronic respiratory disease, 6.0% for hypertension, and 5.6% for cancer) [

Patients with high troponin T (TnT) levels (in response to SARS-Cov-2 infection) were more likely to develop COVID-19 complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (57.7% vs. 11.9%), malignant arrhythmias (17.3% vs. 1.5%), acute coagulopathy (65.8% vs. 20.0%), and acute kidney injury (36.8% vs. 4.7%), as compared with those with normal TnT levels. Patients with underlying CVD were more likely to exhibit high levels of TnT (54.5% vs. 13.2%) and had a nine times greater mortality rate than those with normal TnT levels and without CVD (69.44 vs. 7.62%) [

Therefore, CVD prevention strategies are extremely important in the COVID-19 pandemic, especially strategies with a wide spectrum of possible beneficial effects. It appears that statins may be especially useful, as they not only reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications, but may have independent antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antithrombotic effects [

 <xref rid="B9-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The combination of these effects may translate into an overall health benefit in COVID-19 patients.
