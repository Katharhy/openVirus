<p>The role of cholesterol in viral entry has been studied for several coronaviruses including SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B14-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], murine coronavirus [
 <xref rid="B15-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], porcine deltacoronavirus [
 <xref rid="B12-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and infectious bronchitis virus [
 <xref rid="B16-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thus, cholesterol present in the cell membrane and viral envelope has been found to contribute to coronavirus replication by acting as a key component in viral entry [

 <xref rid="B11-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover, cholesterol was recently shown to be involved in binding and altering the oligomeric status of the N-terminal fusion peptide of SARS-CoV, which is essential for virus entry into the host cell [

 <xref rid="B14-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It was observed that cholesterol depletion impaired viral entry and virus-induced fusion, suggesting that cholesterol is important during the post-binding stages [
 <xref rid="B13-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Although the above reported in vitro data suggest an essential role of lipid rafts and cholesterol in viral entry, specific confirmation in vivo is needed. The seemingly important role of lipid rafts in promoting cellular entry of coronavirus can guide new therapies that may be directed against SARS-CoV-2.
