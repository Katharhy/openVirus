<p>A significant complication of the COVID-19 infection is the development of ARDS. Approximately 5% of COVID-19 patients will require intensive care [

 <xref rid="B45-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] investigated the impact of pravastatin therapy on ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) frequency and mortality. The authors showed that the pravastatin group had significantly increased probability of survival compared to controls during the 30-day treatment period (

However, this study was limited by a short duration of simvastatin administration, which was probably administered too late to see an effectâ€”patients received a statin after several days in the ICU and had dysfunction of at least one organ [

 <xref rid="B47-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] supported a role for these drugs in severe infections.
