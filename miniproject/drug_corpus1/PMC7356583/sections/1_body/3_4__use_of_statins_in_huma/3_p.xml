<p>Nevertheless, total cholesterol levels in admitted COVID-19 patients can be extremely variable and time-dependent. A recent study revealed that COVID-19 patients had sharply decreased total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (3.70 ± 0.09 mmol/L (143 ± 3.5 mg/dL), and 1.82 ± 0.08 mmol/L (70.4 ± 3.1 mg/dL), respectively,

Lastly, a recent in silico analysis showed that several statins could serve as potential SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors, with pitavastatin, a highly lipophilic molecule, exhibiting the strongest binding [
