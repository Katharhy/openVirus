<p>In addition to the importance of cardiovascular risk factors in exacerbating acute respiratory infections [

 <xref rid="B10-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], there is also evidence showing that viral infections may cause cardiac complications [
 <xref rid="B6-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Accordingly, previous studies have established acute respiratory viral infections such as those caused by influenza virus and coronaviruses to trigger cardiovascular (CV) complications such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS) [
 <xref rid="B19-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], myocarditis, arrhythmias [
 <xref rid="B20-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and heart failure (HF) acceleration. There have been several reports on the burden of myocardial injury in the COVID-19 pandemic [
 <xref rid="B6-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Huang et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] identified virus-related cardiac injury in 12% of patients who had raised troponin I. Similarly, in three independent studies, evidence of cardiac injury was found in 7.2, 19.7 [
 <xref rid="B22-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and 29% of COVID-19 patients [
 <xref rid="B23-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], respectively. Also, Guo et al. identified 27.8% of COVID-19 patients as exhibiting myocardial injury as indicated by elevated TnT [
 <xref rid="B6-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Conversely, patients with myocardial injury showed significantly higher mortality than those with normal TnT levels (59.6% vs. 8.9%) [
 <xref rid="B6-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Similarly, Shi et al. reported a higher mortality rate in those with vs. without cardiac injury (51.2% vs. 2.4%) [
 <xref rid="B22-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Those who developed myocardial injury had a more severe clinical course with higher reports of needing to be assisted with ventilation and also with a higher mortality [
 <xref rid="B6-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Several mechanisms have been suggested for the increase in cardiac injury seen in COVID-19 patients. Some authors have suggested that the cytokine storm caused by COVID-19 may result in the development of fulminant myocarditis [
 <xref rid="B6-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Such mechanisms have also been reported in previous viral epidemics such as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which have been characterised by cytokine storms resulting in their highly pathological effects on lungs and other organs [
 <xref rid="B26-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Shi et al. further proposed that the acute inflammatory response that has been reported in COVID-19 might exacerbate the inflammatory activity within atherosclerotic plaques as well as cause endothelial dysfunction, finally resulting in atherothrombotic complications. Thrombo-inflammation can further exacerbate cardiac ischemia and injury [
 <xref rid="B22-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. An additional mechanism possibly explaining the detrimental impact of COVID-19 on CV complications includes the affinity of SARS-COV-2 for the ACE2 receptor, which is highly expressed in the heart [
 <xref rid="B3-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], suggesting the possibility of direct viral infection of the heart. This hypothesis is further supported by previous reports detecting the presence of the viral genome in 35% of SARS-CoV infected autopsied hearts [
 <xref rid="B6-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], suggesting the potential for direct myocardial damage.
