<p>In addition to its cholesterol-lowering and plaque-stabilisation effects, the pleiotropic effects of statins include attenuation of chronic low-grade inflammation [
 <xref rid="B35-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and the immune response to infection. These effects may be beneficial in the context of the cytokine storm caused by COVID-19 [

 <xref rid="B21-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Their anti-inflammatory effects have been postulated to be a result of reduction of isoprenylation, which reduces the magnitude of the signalling pathways and thus counteracts the cytokine storm [

 <xref rid="B36-jcm-09-01909" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This suggests statins may have the potential to significantly reduce the inflammatory burden and exacerbation of the clinical course of COVID-19, which might otherwise result in ARDS and myocarditis. These effects might also be the result of the reported antiviral effects of statins (
