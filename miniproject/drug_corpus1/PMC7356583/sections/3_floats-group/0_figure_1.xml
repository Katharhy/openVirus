  <p>Proposed mechanism of the role of cholesterol and statins in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Lipid rafts rich in cholesterol serve as docking sites for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and viral attachment via the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, which is then taken into the cells by clathrin. In addition, acute infection with SARS-COV-2 and macrophages via paracrine factors can lead to plaque instability and embolization causing occlusion of distal microvasculature. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Statins disrupt lipid rafts and viral binding; reduce cholesterol; and have plaque stabilising, antithrombotic, and anti-inflammatory properties.
