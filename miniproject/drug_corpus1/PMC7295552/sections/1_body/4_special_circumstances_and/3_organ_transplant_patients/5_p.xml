<p>More data from a recent study published by Akalin et al [
 <xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] has shown significant mortality in kidney transplant patients. The study identified 36 consecutive adult kidney transplant recipients who tested positive for COVID-19. They concluded that kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 had less fever as an initial symptom, lower cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3), CD4, and CD8 cell counts, and more rapid clinical progression than persons with COVID-19 in the general population. These patients had very low CD3, CD4, and CD8 cell counts indirectly support the need to decrease doses of immunosuppressive agents in patients with COVID-19, especially in those who have recently received antithymocyte globulin, which decreases all T-cell subsets for many weeks. The study reported extremely high early mortality, 28% at 3 weeks as compared with the usual 2-5% mortality in the general population. In this limited cohort of kidney transplant patients, COVID-19 induced pneumonia is characterized by a high risk of progression and significant mortality. Hopefully, more studies in the future will guide us with the management strategy of COVID-19 infection in solid-organ transplant patients and immunosuppression medications.
