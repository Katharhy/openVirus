<p>Although immunosuppressed solid-organ transplanted patients could be more susceptible to COVID-19 with severe clinical manifestations, the anti-inflammatory effects of immunosuppression could diminish the clinical expression of disease.

They reduce the production of IL-2, a regulator of proliferation, survival, and maturation for all T cell populations [
