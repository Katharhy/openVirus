 <xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] described their preliminary experience with 18 solid-organ transplant (kidney, liver, and heart) recipients diagnosed with COVID-19. Fever (83.3%) and radiographic abnormalities in the form of unilateral or bilateral/multifocal consolidations (72.2%) were the most common presentations. They reported that the case fatality rate was 27.8% (5/18) and which suggested that COVID-19 has a severe course in solid-organ transplant patients.
