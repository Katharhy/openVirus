<p>Data from five small series, including 56 pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 during the second and third trimester, demonstrated that most common symptoms at presentation were fever and cough. Two-thirds of patients had lymphopenia and increased C-reactive protein (CRP), and 83% of cases had a chest CT scan showing multiple patches of ground (glass opacity in the lungs). The study by Chen et al looked into details of nine live births in patients with COVID-19 suggested there was no evidence of vertical transmission in late pregnancy. There is currently insufficient evidence regarding the safety of breastfeeding and the need for mother/baby separation [

If the patient is asymptomatic or mildly affected, breastfeeding and rooming-in can be considered by the mother in coordination with healthcare providers.
