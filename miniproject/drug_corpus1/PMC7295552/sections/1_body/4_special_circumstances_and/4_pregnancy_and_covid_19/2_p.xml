<p>Comorbidities like hyperglycemia and hypertension should be carefully managed with existing protocols as in routine pregnancy. COVID-19 infection itself is not an indication for delivery unless maternal health is severely jeopardized. Timing and mode of delivery should be individualized, depending mainly on the clinical status of the patient, gestational age, and fetal condition. Currently, there is no evidence that COVID-19 infection is associated with fetal or placental complications or risk of congenital malformation. The treatment approach depending on the severity of COVID-19 infection is the same as for confirmed, suspected, and probable cases in the general population. In severe cases, the patient should be managed with the support of a multidisciplinary team (obstetricians, intensivists, internists, neonatologists, infectious disease specialists). Currently, there is no proven antiviral treatment for COVID-19 patients, although antiretroviral drugs are being investigated on patients with severe symptoms. A chest CT scan may be included in the workup of pregnant women, if necessary, with suspected/probable/confirmed COVID-19 infection after discussing the risk and benefits with the patient.</p>
