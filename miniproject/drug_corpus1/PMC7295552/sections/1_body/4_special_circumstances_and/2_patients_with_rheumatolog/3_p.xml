<p>Case series from Italy by Monti et al [
 <xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] looked at the clinical course of COVID-19 in a series of 320 patients with chronic arthritis treated with targeted immunosuppressive therapies. This included patients with rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis, treated with biological derived disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs), targeted synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (tsDMARDs) or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors. bDMARDs or tsDMARDs were held in eight patients with symptomatic COVID-19 with fever and shortness of breath. The study reported no significant relapses of the rheumatic disease, no mortality from COVID-19. It is suggested that patients with chronic arthritis treated with bDMARDs or tsDMARDs are not at increased risk of respiratory or life-threatening complications from COVID-19 compared with the general population [
