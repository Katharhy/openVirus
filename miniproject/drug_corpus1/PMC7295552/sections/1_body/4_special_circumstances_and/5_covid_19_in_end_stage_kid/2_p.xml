<p>A dialysis team consisting of nephrologists, nursing staff, dieticians, and social workers are playing a critical role in the prevention and containment of COVID-19. Staff members have been particularly educated on guidelines to minimize the infection risk and also to manage patients with signs of infection. CDC has recommended guidelines to keep the dialysis units safe to continue treatment at the dialysis unit itself without placing a burden on the hospitals, which are already overwhelmed with the COVID-19 cases. Sick members of the team are advised to stay home. Patients are instructed to stay at home while off dialysis. Screening of each individual that arrives at the dialysis unit using a questionnaire and temperature check has been implemented. Early recognition and isolation of individuals with a respiratory infection, fever, cough, and upper airway involvement have been critical. Aggressive disinfectant strategies and universal mask usage policies have been implemented. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection are admitted to cohort dialysis units if they are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms. Patients with moderate to severe symptoms are admitted to the hospital for isolation and treatment [

In light of the ongoing pandemic, the advantage of home dialysis modalities is evident from the perspective of minimal exposure risk. However, home dialysis patients, including peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, can also contract this viral infection [
