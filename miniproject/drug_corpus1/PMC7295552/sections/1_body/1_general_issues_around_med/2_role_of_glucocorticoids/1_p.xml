<p>In the past, glucocorticoids have been associated with an increased risk for mortality in patients with influenza and delayed viral clearance in patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Although they were widely used in the management of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was no good evidence for benefit, and there was persuasive evidence of adverse short- and long-term harm [

Therefore, CDC recommended against the use of systemic glucocorticoids in patients with COVID-19, unless there are other indications such as asthma or chronic obstructive lung disease exacerbation, refractory septic shock, and adrenal insufficiency. However, their administration in critically ill patients with COVID-19-related adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is controversial. Based on data suggesting the potential benefit of glucocorticoids in patients with all-cause ARDS, the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) provided a conditional, weak recommendation in favor of glucocorticoids in patients with COVID-19 who have severe ARDS. If clinicians choose to administer glucocorticoids, the SCCM suggests that they should begin within the first 14 days, doses should be low, and courses should be short (e.g., intravenous (IV) dexamethasone 20 mg once daily for 5 days, then 10 mg once daily for 5 days). Data from retrospective Chinese cohort [
