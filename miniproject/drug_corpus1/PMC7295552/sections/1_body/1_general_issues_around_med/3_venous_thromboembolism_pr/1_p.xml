<p>Patients with COVID-19 may carry an increased risk for systemic thrombosis. This is suggested by published case reports of pulmonary embolism in patients with COVID-19, and several cohorts reported to have elevated D-dimer levels and other markers of dysregulated coagulation [

Additionally, markers of dysregulated coagulation and evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) have been seen to be associated with more severe disease and death in patients with COVID-19 [

As with all hospitalized patients, pharmacologic prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism is recommended even in COVID-19 patients, typically using low-molecular-weight heparin, unless there are clinical contraindications such as active bleeding or severe thrombocytopenia.
