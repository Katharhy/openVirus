<p>Clinical features of COVID-19 are challenging to distinguish from bacterial pneumonia. Empiric treatment for bacterial pneumonia may also be reasonable in patients with documented COVID-19 if there is clinical suspicion. Empiric antibiotic therapy, if initiated, should be guided by microbial diagnosis (e.g., sputum Gram stain and culture) and reevaluate the need to continue antibiotic therapy daily. A low procalcitonin level usually is helpful to suggest against bacterial pneumonia; however, elevated procalcitonin has been described in the late stage of COVID-19 and does not necessarily indicate bacterial pneumonia [
