<p>The symptoms of infected people with this novel coronavirus can range from being asymptomatic or minimal respiratory symptoms to febrile illness, as well as severe respiratory failure needing ventilator support. Despite reported observational data about the experimental use of certain drugs, there is no proven curative therapy for COVID-19 as of now; however, remdesivir received emergency use authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently for use in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Most interventions and guidelines for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic are related to prevention, isolation, and supportive treatment strategies. There are several ongoing clinical trials related to the pharmacological choices of therapy for COVID-19 patients; however, drug trials related to observational studies so far have yielded mixed results and therefore have created a sense of confusion among healthcare professionals (HCPs). In this review article, we seek to collate and provide a summary of treatment strategies for COVID-19 patients with a variable degree of illness, and discuss pharmacologic and other therapies intended to be used either as experimental medicine/therapy or as part of supportive care in complicated cases of COVID-19.</p>
