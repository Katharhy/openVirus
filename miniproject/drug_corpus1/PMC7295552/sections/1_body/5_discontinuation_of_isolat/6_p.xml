<p>It is hard to estimate the costs of management and pharmacotherapy for COVID-19 as the cost significantly varies from country to country, including hospital management as well as the cost of the drugs. As per the article from Forbes, the recently approved remdesivir, it could cost up to $4,500 for a course of treatment, which could still be cost-effective as per the institute of clinical and economic review.

Other drugs under a further investigation like favipiravir costs $1.45/day, hydroxychloroquine $0.08/day, azithromycin $0.10/day, lopinavir/ritonavir $0.39/day. If the repurposed drugs demonstrate efficacy agonist COVID-19, as per the above, they could be manufactured at lower costs [
