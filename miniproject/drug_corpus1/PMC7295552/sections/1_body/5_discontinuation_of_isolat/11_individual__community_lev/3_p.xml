<p>The first step is to keep the infection rates low by imposing strict social distancing measures. Meanwhile, we need to significantly ramp up testing capabilities so that when we are ready to ease restrictions, anyone who needs a test can be tested for infection as well as antibodies that would identify who are immune. Second, when it is time to relax the social distancing, people with immunity could be provided with “immunity passports” utilizing digital approval pass, and could be allowed to move freely and get back in the active workforce. People who test negative for immunity may be allowed to move freely and work; however, they will need to be tracked to make sure they are not in close contact with people with suspected or active infection. The tracking has been done by some countries using peer-to-peer tracking apps such as trace together and covidnearyou.org so that we eliminate the need for centralized data-keeping and protect privacy and civil liberties of the public.</p>
