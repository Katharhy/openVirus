<p>Gattinoni et al conceptualized two distinct phenotypes: the “L” and “H” types (later stages/ARDS) at the ends of the clinical spectrum with possible intermediate cases with overlapping features [
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The “L” type is seen early on with low elastance/high compliance, low lung weight, low VQ mismatch, and low recruitability. The lungs at this stage are compliant, can hold a good amount of air, are not affected by much edema; VQ ratio is due to defects in vasoregulation and perfusion, and since most of the lung is already aerated, there is not much scope for recruitability [
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These patients have mild dyspnea, limited ground glass infiltrates on computed tomography (CT) scans, and they can withstand the distress. The “H” type is found later in the COVID-19 disease process with more resemblance to ARDS. It is the exact opposite of the “L” type with high elastance/low compliance, high lung weight, high VQ mismatch, and high recruitability [
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These explain the resemblance to ARDS (non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, shunting, and decreased lung size for gas exchange). These patients are symptomatic and with extensive infiltrates on CT suggestive of alveolar edema, and increased risk of ending up on the ventilator support device. Based on these concepts, respiratory support in COVID-19 should focus on optimizing oxygenation, reducing pulmonary and vascular stress, preventing edema and lung injury, and recruitment of functional lung units [
