<p>Histamine has pleiotropic effects on the immune system from different natures of its receptors. One of its effects being immunomodulation resulting in sepsis was noticed in diabetic mice. This happens through decreased neutrophil recruitment and impaired oxidative burst from elevated histamine levels [
