<p>Azithromycin is an antibacterial macrolide and works through binding to 50s ribosomal subunit and inhibition of messenger RNA directed polypeptide synthesis. Antiviral mechanism of macrolides is scarce and was hypothesized to inhibit respiratory syncytial virus through the reduced expression of fusion protein receptor, activated isoform A of the Ras homologous (Rho) family, and the inhibition of subsequent Rho-kinase activation in human airway epithelial cells [
