<p id="para0011">This issue presents modeling analyses that predominantly focus on a single health outcome, such as HIV, HCV, or overdose. Yet, the syndemics of substance use, incarceration, infectious disease transmission, and overdose are highly complex and overlapping (
 <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">Singer, 2009</xref>). We hope that future models will stop focusing on single health outcomes, and increasingly consider the many forms of harm that result from injecting drug use as well as the multiple health benefits from interventions. Indeed, interventions such as OST can prevent HIV and HCV transmission, overdose, as well as reduce reincarceration and improve HIV treatment uptake and retention (
 <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">Degenhardt et al., 2019</xref>). Models are well poised to incorporate these complex, and possibly synergistic, interactions to fully quantify the benefits of public health interventions for people who use or inject drugs (
 <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">Degenhardt et al., 2019</xref>). This broader view could also help challenge the siloed funding Stuart and Wilson discuss, because most interventions have multiple benefits for this group.
