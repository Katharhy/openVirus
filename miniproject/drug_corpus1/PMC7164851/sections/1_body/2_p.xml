<p id="para0003">Along with overdose, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality among people who inject drugs. The World Health Organization (WHO) elimination goal of 80% reduction in HCV incidence by 2030 underscores the urgent need to scale-up treatment and prevention interventions for PWID to prevent transmission and mortality (

Indeed, due to frequent incarceration and short sentences, scaling up prison-based testing and treatment in Montreal could reduce HCV incidence among all PWID by roughly 40% by 2030, with further impact being achieved if this is done in combination with improved harm reduction interventions.
