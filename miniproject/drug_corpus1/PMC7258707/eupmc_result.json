    "Research to discover and develop antibacterial and antiviral drugs with potent activity against pathogens of biothreat concern presents unique methodological and process-driven challenges. Herein, we review laboratory approaches for finding new antibodies, antibiotics, and antiviral molecules for pathogens of biothreat concern. Using high-throughput screening techniques, molecules that directly inhibit a pathogenâ€™s entry, replication, or growth can be identified. Alternatively, molecules that target host proteins can be interesting targets for development when countering biothreat pathogens, due to the modulation of the host immune response or targeting proteins that interfere with the pathways required by the pathogen for replication. Monoclonal and cocktail antibody therapies approved by the Food and Drug Administration for countering anthrax and under development for treatment of Ebola virus infection are discussed. A comprehensive tabular review of current in vitro, in vivo, pharmacokinetic and efficacy datasets has been presented for biothreat pathogens of greatest concern. Finally, clinical trials and animal rule or traditional drug approval pathways are also reviewed.Opinions; interpretations; conclusions; and recommendations are those of the authors and are not necessarily endorsed by the US Army."
