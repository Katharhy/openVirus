<p id="par0140">Asymptomatic infections are an important aspect of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the data addressed here show that the characteristics of asymptomatic and presymptomatic infection are not identical. Asymptomatic infections will be a key contributor to COVID-19 spread. Infectivity studies confirm the existence of transmission by asymptomatic individuals but are contradictory when comparing viral loads and virus shedding in symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. Younger age correlates strongly with asymptomatic and mild infections and consequently suggests children as hidden drivers of the pandemic. However, since childhood infections are usually far below the age average in COVID-19 infections, children's role in transmission events is not yet clear.</p>
