<p id="par0065">As these findings differ significantly, it is difficult to accurately determine the extent of asymptomatic infections. Discrepancies could result from imprecise definitions of the term “asymptomatic” or a different understanding of “asymptomatic” in the various studies (
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table1</xref> ). Extremely high incidences could result from the unintended inclusion of presymptomatic and very mild cases. The true incidence of asymptomatic infections can only be determined if close surveillance is initiated and continued at least over the estimated average incubation period of at least five days in order not to miss a possible onset of symptoms.
