<p id="par0060">Several studies have focused on determining the incidence of asymptomatic infections. On the cruise ship Diamond Princess, with 3711 passengers, a major outbreak of 634 cases occurred after an infected asymptomatic passenger had boarded in Hong Kong. Due to the dense living conditions and frequent passenger contacts, the R0 value was initially four times higher than in Wuhan (

In Vo, the first Italian city with a confirmed COVID-19 fatality, 3711 were surveyed twice. 2.6 % of the population tested positive before the lockdown, and 1.2 % tested positive after the lockdown; of these, 41% and 45% were asymptomatic before and after the lockdown, respectively (

A first nationwide population-based study from Spain, including 61,000 participants from 35,883 households, concluded that one in three infections seems to be asymptomatic and emphasized the need to maintain public health measures to avoid a second epidemic wave (
