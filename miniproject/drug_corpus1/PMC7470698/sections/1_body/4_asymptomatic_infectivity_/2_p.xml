<p id="par0075">In a study of 21 infected Chinese, a subgroup of five asymptomatic patients had the longest period of RNA positivity, with prolonged viral shedding. The virus was thriving in asymptomatic subjects for a median of 18 days compared to mild (median 10 days) and severe COVID-19 cases (median 14 days) (

Although the initial Ct values were similar, asymptomatic individuals showed prolonged virus release (asymptomatic individuals: median 19 days, symptomatic individuals 14 days) (
