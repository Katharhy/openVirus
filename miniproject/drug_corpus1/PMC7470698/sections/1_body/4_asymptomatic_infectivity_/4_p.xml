<p id="par0085">To ascertain an asymptomatic who does not meet the case definition, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs is the only currently available standard diagnosis (

 <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">Piras et al., 2020</xref>). False-negative results can have a significant negative impact on efforts to contain the epidemic. The probability of false-negative results in RT-PCR tests is influenced by the time since exposure and the onset of symptoms (
 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">Kucirka et al., 2020</xref>). On the other hand, technical problems, insufficient virus load, and inadequate and inappropriate sampling may be other reasonable causes of false-negative results. The challenges in laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR are multifactorial, and well-defined guidelines are warranted to fill the gaps in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatics.
