<p id="par0070">When assessing public health risks raised by asymptomatic COVID-19 cases, it is important to determine whether the infectivity varies between asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals. A study of the first 243 patients in Singapore revealed a proportion of 6% presymptomatic cases with transmission occurring 1â€“3 days before the onset of symptoms (

The time from exposure to eventual negativity indicates that asymptomatically infected persons likely carry the virus for a relatively long period (

Infectivity exists in presymptomatic and/or asymptomatic men; however, further analyses of the viral loads and viral shedding duration are required. Viral shedding is the release of the virus from somatic cells after replication; it does not necessarily imply that it is infectious (

The virus load is measured by the cycle threshold (Ct value), which corresponds to the diagnostic RT-PCR assays' amplification cycles. Ct values increase with decreasing viral load; low Ct values indicate a high viral load. Also, the duration of virus detectability serves as an indicator of infectivity.
