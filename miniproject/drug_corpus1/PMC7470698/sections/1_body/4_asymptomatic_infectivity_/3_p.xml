Of 31 infected persons from Guangzhou, China, who tested positive, 22 proved to be presymptomatic on admission and developed symptoms later, whereas nine remained asymptomatic. There was a statistically significant difference between asymptomatic and presymptomatic infection, with higher Ct values in asymptomatic than in presymptomatic individuals. However, there was no significant difference in viral shedding (
