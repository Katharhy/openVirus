<p id="p0045">The medical care system changed as a result of AIDS and will certainly be altered as we respond to COVID-19. In the HIV epidemic, we realized that gaining fundamental knowledge of the virus and the resulting immune deficit was central in designing more effective therapies. As a country, we realized the benefit of that investment and in the close linkage of knowledge generated and its application at the bedside. AIDS research did not invent the concept of translational research, but it amplified its perceived value. Research on COVID-19 is proceeding at an amazing speed. Research funds are being provided, and we have already learned much about the disease process and ways to improve care. Similarly, the lessons learned in the HIV epidemic about the significance of understanding the social setting of the disease must apply to COVID-19. Better understanding who is at highest risk and the reasons for disparities will improve our prevention approaches, and behavioral science can help us better understand how to engage those at risk on strategies of social distancing and masking that are to date our only effective means of reducing risk, although they may be seen as intrusive and limiting in many social settings.</p>
