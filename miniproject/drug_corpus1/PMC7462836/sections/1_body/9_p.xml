<p id="p0060">As a profession and as a society, we face enormous challenges in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. We do not have the luxury of our 4 decades of experience and research in the HIV response. We are truly at the very start in responding to COVID-19. New clinical observations are made seemingly daily and communicated immediately. The AIDS epidemic preceded the Internet and immediate posting of new data in “pre-prints.” There was no Zoom. With COVID-19 we are now beginning to learn of clotting disorders, serious inflammatory effects in children, neurologic sequalae, and so much more. We hear of those recovering after prolonged intubation but also that mortality rates in ventilated patients may be extremely high. On a social level, we recognize that the early and rigorous sheltering-in-place measures invoked in many parts of the world had huge economic consequences and are difficult (perhaps impossible) to maintain. The economic consequences for our medical centers are also staggering. As we failed to develop better testing and epidemic surveillance and modeling early in the pandemic, many hospitals were closed to needed but “elective” care. Cancer care was delayed, and hospitals have lost substantial revenue. At the same time, patients have been understandably afraid to return to hospitals, which they perceive as places where they might come in contact with COVID-19. Medical centers struggle to redesign facilities to recover an efficient yet safe means of caring for a high volume of patients. We are far from an effective antiviral drug for SARS-CoV-2, and although vaccine candidates are being feverishly developed, none are available. Furthermore, the cost and logistical demands of deploying a vaccine on a global scale are almost unimaginable, along with the challenge of the many people who, for a wide variety of reasons, are afraid of vaccines and unlikely to accept them, at least any time soon.</p>
