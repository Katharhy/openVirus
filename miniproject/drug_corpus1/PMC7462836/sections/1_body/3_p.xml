<p id="p0030">Strategies to reduce an epidemic’s impact on the population and health care system require detailed knowledge of the causative agent’s biology and the natural history of the resulting disease. Our knowledge of HIV is quite complete, but we are still learning about the coronavirus and COVID-19. HIV infection is typically silent for months to years before complications caused by progressing immune damage appear. During this silent phase, HIV can be transmitted, but the long time frame and often multiple sexual partners makes it extremely difficult to identify those exposed to an index case. SARS-CoV-2, in contrast, can cause illness very quickly, within days to several weeks of exposure; thus, contact tracing possible, although we still are not certain how many cases of infection are asymptomatic or the risk and duration of further transmission from these individuals.</p>
