<p id="p0040">In the HIV epidemic, those at highest risk, including injection drug users and men who have sex with other men, were often stigmatized with harmful consequences. In the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, Chinese Americans have faced discrimination from those who blame China for “starting” the epidemic. Furthermore, COVID-19 disproportionately affects those who are unable to protect themselves from exposure as a result of crowded work or living conditions and those who have pre-existing health conditions including obesity, diabetes, and heart and respiratory disease, leading to worse COVID-19 outcomes. Stigma surrounding these social and economic conditions are primary drivers of the horrible impact of the pandemic on medical care systems that disproportionately serve these populations and must be considered in planning to improve care access and care success.</p>
