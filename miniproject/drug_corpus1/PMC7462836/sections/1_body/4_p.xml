<p id="p0035">Responding to both epidemics demands accurate diagnostic testing. Although it took years to identify HIV as the cause of AIDS, antibody tests were soon made available. The unique horror of HIV was soon appreciated; antibodies had no effect on the infection, and all those with positive tests were actively infected, were capable of transmission, and had progression of disease. The situation with COVID-19 is still not clear. Positive antigen testing is thought to confirm active infection and transmission risk. The development of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is less clear. Antibodies may imply the ability to neutralize and clear the virus, but the degree to which this is true may vary. Antibodies may suggest immunity to secondary infection; however, this is not yet clear but an area of very active research.</p>
