<p id="p0015">Our society and medicine confronted a frightening global epidemic almost 40 years ago with the recognition and spread of HIV infection and the disease it caused, AIDS. That epidemic was large and, for affected individuals and communities, devastating and expensive. We now are in the very early phases of seeing yet another epidemic with the newly described coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and the disease it causes, COVID-19. The scale of the current epidemic is massive and truly global. Although the mortality rate of HIV is much worse—essentially all infected persons die without treatment—COVID-19 has already killed more than 100,000 in the United States alone because all are at risk and so many have been infected. It seems fair to consider the relationship between these 2 epidemics, in particular how HIV affected the medical care system, what we might yet see from the coronavirus pandemic, and the lessons from AIDS that might help us face our current disaster.</p>
