<p id="p0065">We can do a better job in responding to COVID-19, but we must do so with a strong sense of urgency and solidarity. We must have better information in real time of the prevalence of the coronavirus in the broad population and in those subgroups at increased risk. We need to anticipate more accurately what will be needed in terms of acute hospital and intensive care facilities in a way that allows us to care for those patients without disrupting care for all of our other patients—perhaps by designing new COVID-19–specific facilities. We need to rethink the sources of funding for medical care, perhaps a federal program as we have for AIDS so those who are sick will not worsen their outcomes by delaying diagnosis. And we must learn how to communicate more effectively to gain the population’s trust as we all, together, face the most serious challenge to our health system we could ever have imagined.</p>
