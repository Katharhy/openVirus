<p id="p0025">Epidemic infections spread by the most rapid transportation available. Both HIV and the new coronavirus had access to jet travel, although the fewer global connections between central Africa and the rest of the world in the 1970s and 1980s slowed the global distribution of HIV whereas the extensive commercial linkages from Wuhan, China, facilitated nearly instantaneous and simultaneous spread of SARS-CoV-2 to all continents excluding Antarctica. Epidemics at a more personal level are also spread by social and biologic factors. HIV is predominantly a sexually transmitted infection with an initial concentration among men who have sex with other men. Even with direct sexual exposure, HIV is seldom transmitted. In contrast, the coronavirus is a highly contagious respiratory virus. In the United States, high HIV risk was concentrated in subpopulations, whereas every person is susceptible to COVID-19. Yet, at least in our early experience, COVID-19 affects regions differently, with “hot spots” in densely populated cities such as Wuhan and New York and areas of Italy and Spain while relatively sparing rural areas with low population density. This variability, of course, has implications for advance planning for each epidemic’s impact on health care systems.</p>
