<p id="p0050">HIV has led to fundamental alterations in care delivery. HIV care was, from the start, complex and demanded better coordination between hospital and community-based care delivery. Patients with AIDS became seriously ill, often needing multiple hospitalizations, but they also needed prolonged intervals of outpatient medical support in the community. Many patients with AIDS had insufficient means of paying for the services they so clearly required to prolong life. For these reasons, systems of care were developed that included dedicated inpatient facilities and comprehensive outpatient programs. Because all patients with AIDS died in the early epidemic, hospice care—still a novelty in the 1980s—grew in sophistication and effectiveness and became an essential care component. To remove the ability to pay for AIDS care as a barrier, the federal government created an entitlement device, the Ryan White Program, analogous to one paying for renal dialysis; this continues with strong bipartisan support.</p>
