     <p>25HC inhibits SARS‐CoV-2 pseudovirus entry into Caco‐2 cells. Following a 16‐h incubation with EtOH or indicated concentrations of 25HC, cells were challenged with SARS‐CoV-2 pseudovirus encoding FLuc. After virus removal at 2 h, cells were lysed and luciferase activity was measured after 24 h. Statistical analyses were conducted by Student's

     <p>25HC is not cytotoxic to Caco‐2 (B) or Calu‐3 cells (C). Cell were treated with EtOH or indicated concentrations of 25HC for 24 h, and cell viability was measured by CellTiter‐Glo (Promega). Bar represents mean ± SD of

     <p>25HC does not affect VSV genome replication. Cell were infected with VSV pseudovirus encoding FLuc for 2 h. Then, medium with EtOH or 25HC was added. At 24 h post‐infection, cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured. VSV replication was quantified by luciferase assays. Bar represents mean ± SD of

     <p>TMPRSS2 inhibitors camostat blocked entry of SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV pseudoviruses. Calu‐3 cells were treated with 10 μM camostat or DMSO for 1 h. Then the cells were infected with SARS‐CoV or MERS‐CoV pseudovirus with EGFP for 1 h. EGFP signals were captured by fluorescence microscope 24 h post‐infection. Scale bar, 100 μm</p>

     <p>25HC inhibits cell–cell fusion on Vero cells. Vero cells were treated with EtOH or 25HC (5 μM) for 16 h prior to transfection with pLVX plasmids encoding SARS‐CoV-2 S. After 4 h, medium was changed and re‐supplemented with EtOH or 25HC. At 48 h post‐transfection, syncytium formation was visualized after trypsin treatment by fluorescence microscopy. White arrows indicate syncytia. Scale bar, 50 μm. Bar represents mean ± SD of
