     <p>Rescue of cholesterol depletion on the plasma membrane (PM) reverses SARS‐CoV-2 entry block in Calu‐3 cells. 25HC induces the depletion of accessible cholesterol on the plasma membrane and supplement of additional cholesterol can reverse the depletion and viral entry.</p>

     <p>25HC depletes accessible cholesterol on the plasma membrane. (B) Calu‐3 cells were treated with indicated concentrations of 25HC for 1 h and subsequently incubated with ALOD4 for 30 min. Cell were washed twice with PBS, lysed, and the amounts of bound ALOD4 were examined by Western blotting. (C) Calu‐3 cells were treated with 5 μM 25HC for 1 h, and subsequently incubated with AF488‐labeled ALOD4 for 30 min. Cells were washed twice and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Scale bar, 50 μm.</p>

     <p>Cholesterol rescues the level of accessible cholesterol on the plasma membrane of 25HC‐treated cells. Calu‐3 cells were pretreated with ethanol or 5 μM 25HC for 1 h. Cells were washed and incubated with PBS or 20 μM cholesterol for 1 h. After further incubation with ALOD4, cells were washed with PBS twice and lysed. The amount of bound ALOD4 was examined by Western blotting.</p>

     <p>Addition of cholesterol rescues entry of SARS‐CoV-2 pseudovirus, SARS‐CoV pseudovirus, and MERS‐CoV pseudovirus into 25HC‐treated Calu‐3 cells. Cells were pretreated with ethanol or 5 μM 25HC for 16 h, washed, and incubated with PBS or 80 μM cholesterol for 1 h prior to infection with SARS‐CoV-2 pseudovirus. Entry of SARS‐CoV-2 pseudovirus (E and F), SARS‐CoV pseudovirus (G), and MERS‐CoV pseudovirus (H) was assessed by luciferase assay or by fluorescence microscopy at 24 h post‐infection. Scale bar, 100 μm. Bar represents mean ± SD of
