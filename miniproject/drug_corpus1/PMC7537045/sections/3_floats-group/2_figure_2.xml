     <p>25HC inhibits entry of SARS‐CoV-2 pseudovirus (A and B), SARS‐CoV pseudovirus (C), and MERS‐CoV pseudovirus (D). Calu‐3 cells were treated with EtOH or indicated concentrations of 25HC for 16 h. Cells were then challenged with FLuc‐expressing pseudovirus (A, C and D) and EGFP‐expressing pseudovirus (B, C and D) at MOI = 0.2, with EtOH or 25HC. After 2 h of infection, virus was removed and pseudovirus infection was quantified by luciferase assay at 24 h post‐infection (A, C and D) or visualized by fluorescence microscopy (B, C and D). IC
      <sub>50</sub> was calculated by GraphPad using non‐linear regression analysis. Statistical analyses were conducted by Student's

     <p>25HC does not inhibit SARS‐CoV-2 pseudovirus receptor binding. Calu‐3 cells were treated with EtOH or 25HC (2.5 or 5 μM) for 24 h prior to challenge by SARS‐CoV-2 pseudovirus at 4°C for 1 h. Total cellular RNA was extracted and quantified for VSV‐L by qPCR. Bar represents mean ± SD of

     <p>25HC inhibits membrane fusion mediated by SARS‐CoV-2 S (F), SARS‐CoV S (G, left), and MERS‐CoV S (G, right). 293FT or Vero cells were treated with EtOH or 25HC (5 μM) for 16 h prior to transfection with pLVX plasmids encoding SARS‐CoV-2 S (F), SARS‐CoV S (G, left), and MERS‐CoV S (G, right) in the absence of EtOH or 25HC. At 24 h post‐transfection, syncytium formation was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Scale bar, 50 μm. White arrows indicate syncytia. Quantification of membrane fusion was performed by calculating the percentages of nuclei involved in syncytia formation from all nuclei in GFP‐positive cells. Bar represents mean ± SD of
