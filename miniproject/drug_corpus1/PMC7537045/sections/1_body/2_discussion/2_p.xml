<p>Sterols and oxysterols influence immune system and viral infections through both general and cell‐specific mechanisms (Spann &amp; Glass, 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Cholesterol has multiple functions on lipid bilayers. An increase or decrease of cholesterol can be accompanied by changes in the fluidity, polarity, thickness, and intrinsic curvature of membrane. Changes in cholesterol could affect the function of integral membrane proteins, including viral receptor or co‐receptors, by altering their conformation or distribution on the plasma membrane (Yang

 <xref rid="embj2020106057-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). These alterations will directly or indirectly affect virus–cell membrane fusion, which is essential for viral genome release (Chazal &amp; Gerlier, 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). The depletion of cholesterol by 25HC did not affect viral binding and TMPRSS2 priming (Figs

 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0003ev" ref-type="fig">EV3</xref>F). It is possible the depletion of cholesterol directly affects virus–cell fusion. Given the importance of membrane cholesterol for virus–cell fusion, the mechanism of 25HC could possibly be extended to other viruses that fuse with a cellular membrane before entry. Indeed, cholesterol has been proved to be important for the fusion and post‐entry steps in the flavivirus life cycle (Osuna‐Ramos 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Depletion of cholesterol blocked HIV fusion at the plasma membrane (Yang 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Given that 25HC seems to inhibit the entry of multiple enveloped viruses, we speculate that enveloped viruses inhibited by 25HC at the fusion step utilize our proposed mechanism, suggesting a fundamental role for this small molecule in the innate immune system (Liu 
 <italic>et al</italic>,
