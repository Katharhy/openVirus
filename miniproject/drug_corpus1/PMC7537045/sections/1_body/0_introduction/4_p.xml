<p>In this paper, we report the antiviral activity of CH25H against SARS‐CoV‐2 entry into human lung epithelial cells and show that 25HC broadly inhibits infection by human coronaviruses including SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV. By addressing the mechanism of 25HC function, we provide evidence that 25HC induced depletion of cholesterol on the plasma membrane through activating acyl‐CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), thereby restricting virus fusion at the cell surface. We further confirmed the inhibitory effect of 25HC on authentic SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of lung epithelial cells and viral entry in human lung organoids. These results shed light on one of the mechanisms by which interferon signaling and type I interferon therapy in COVID‐19‐infected patients counteract SARS‐CoV‐2 at the molecular level, with implications for cholesterol homeostasis in broad‐spectrum antiviral immunity.</p>
