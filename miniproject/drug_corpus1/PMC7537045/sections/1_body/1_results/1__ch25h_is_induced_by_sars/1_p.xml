<p>Since 
 <italic>CH25H</italic> is an ISG and broadly inhibits viruses (Liu 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>), we sought to investigate the role of CH25H during SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. We analyzed RNA‐seq data of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in two lung epithelial cell lines, Calu‐3 and A549‐ACE2 (Blanco‐Melo 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), for up‐regulated ISGs. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection dramatically induced type I and III interferons, including IFNB1 and IFNL1, but not type II interferon (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Multiple well‐known ISGs were simultaneously elevated, such as 
 <italic>ISG15</italic>,
 <italic> OASL</italic>,
 <italic> IFITMs,</italic> and the 
 <italic>IFITs</italic> (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Importantly, 
 <italic>CH25H</italic> expression was significantly up‐regulated in both cell lines (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Similar results were obtained from infections by human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) but not influenza A virus, whose NS1 protein could completely block interferon pathways (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). In corroboration with these cell line‐based data, scRNA‐seq analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from healthy donors and COVID‐19‐infected patients revealed an up‐regulation of 
 <italic>CH25H</italic> in macrophages and epithelial cells in COVID‐19‐infected patients compared to healthy donors (Figs 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B and 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0001ev" ref-type="fig">EV1</xref>A; Liao 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Another RNA‐seq analysis also showed robust induction of 
 <italic>CH25H</italic> in PBMCs from COVID‐19‐infected patients relative to healthy donors (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0001ev" ref-type="fig">EV1</xref>B; preprint: Daamen 
 <italic>et al</italic>,
