<p>Considering that CH25H has been demonstrated to restrict entry of several viruses including HIV, HSV, and a positive strand virus ZIKV (Liu

 <xref rid="embj2020106057-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Li 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), we constructed SARS‐CoV‐2 pseudovirus based on VSV to investigate the viral entry process. We first checked the expression SARS‐CoV‐2 spike during packaging of VSV pseudovirus bearing spike (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0001ev" ref-type="fig">EV1</xref>C). Immunoblotting revealed two forms of the spike protein: full length S and the S2 subunit (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). Consistent with previous findings, S2 is highly abundant in SARS‐CoV‐2 (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C), because of a furin cleavage motif near the boundary of S1/S2 that promotes proteolytic processing (Hoffmann 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2020a</xref>). Similar bands were observed for VSV particles bearing the SARS‐CoV spike protein (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C), though the S2 band was less prominent due to the lack of any furin cleavage site (Hoffmann 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2020a</xref>). In addition, utilizing a fusion inhibition peptide EK1 targeting the HR1 domain of the spike protein, we confirmed that pseudovirus entry is mediated by the spike protein because EK1 treatment potently inhibited viral infection in Calu‐3 cells (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). To further authenticate our pseudovirus, we tested infection of the human lung epithelial cell line Calu‐3 treated with TMPRSS2 inhibitors camostat and nafamostat (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0001ev" ref-type="fig">EV1</xref>D). SARS‐CoV‐2 pseudovirus infection was abolished in cells treated with inhibitors as compared with vehicle control (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0001ev" ref-type="fig">EV1</xref>D). Furthermore, infection was significantly repressed in ACE2 knockout Calu‐3 cells (Figs 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E and 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0001ev" ref-type="fig">EV1</xref>E). Altogether, our results demonstrate that the entry of SARS‐CoV‐2 pseudovirus is mediated by spike and primed by cellular ACE2 and TMPRSS2, providing the validation of our pseudovirus system to authentically mimic SARS‐CoV‐2 entry.
