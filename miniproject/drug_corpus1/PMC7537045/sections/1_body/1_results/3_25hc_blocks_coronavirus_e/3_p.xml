<p>Given that 25HC inhibits viral entry of SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C and D), we asked whether such inhibition was achieved through the same mechanism as described above for SARS‐CoV‐2. To address this question, Calu‐3 cells were pretreated with ethanol or 25HC and challenged with SARS‐CoV or MERS‐CoV pseudoviruses with or without a prior supplement of cholesterol. Addition of cholesterol reversed the inhibitory function of 25HC on viral entry for both SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV pseudoviruses (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>G and H). Altogether, our results show that 25HC restricts coronavirus entry by depleting accessible cholesterol on the plasma membrane.
