<p>Next, we sought to elucidate the mechanism of cholesterol mobilization induced by 25HC. 25HC enhances cholesterol esterification and in turns trigger cholesterol transport from the plasma membrane to the ER (Du

 <xref rid="embj2020106057-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). We hypothesized that the enzyme catalyzing the esterification of cholesterol, ACAT, can be activated by 25HC and SARS‐CoV‐2 to direct the trafficking of cholesterol from the plasma membrane. To test this hypothesis, we employed the selective ACAT inhibitor, Sandoz 58‐035 (SZ58‐035), to determine the role of ACAT in modulating accessible cholesterol and suppressing SARS‐CoV‐2 pseudovirus entry (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). Since upon esterification by ACAT, cholesteryl esters are stored in cytosolic lipid droplets, we used a lipid droplet stain to monitor ACAT activity (Dong 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). We first confirmed that 25HC could activate ACAT by staining intracellular lipid droplets in vehicle‐ or 25HC‐treated Calu‐3 cells. We found a dramatic increase in lipid droplets in 25HC‐treated cells, indicating an increased ACAT‐mediated cholesterol esterification (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). Next, we treated vehicle‐ or 25HC‐conditioned Calu‐3 cells with or without SZ58‐035 and analyzed accessible cholesterol at the plasma membrane by ALOD4. Our results showed that when ACAT was inhibited, accessible cholesterol was increased suggesting that SZ58‐35 stalls the depletion of accessible cholesterol by 25HC (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C). In accordance with these observations, SZ58‐035 treatment rescued SARS‐CoV‐2 pseudovirus entry (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D and E). Furthermore, we infected Calu‐3 cells with the SARS‐CoV‐2 isolate USA‐WA1/2020 strain and analyzed lipid droplet formation. Our results showed that authentic virus infection efficiently activated ACAT that was comparable to 25HC treatment (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0004ev" ref-type="fig">EV4</xref>). To further define the specificity of ACAT inhibition and its effect on viral entry, we silenced ACAT by shRNAs and analyzed pseudovirus entry in the presence and absence of 25HC. We found that ACAT knockdown by shRNA enhanced pseudovirus entry into 25HC‐treated Calu‐3 cells compared to non‐targeting shRNA (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>F), a finding similar to drug mediated inhibition of ACAT (Fig 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D).
