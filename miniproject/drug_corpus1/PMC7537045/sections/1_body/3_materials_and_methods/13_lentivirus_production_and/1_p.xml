<p>Two sgRNA oligos targeting ACE2 were cloned into lentiCRISPR v2 (addgene 52961) and two shRNA oligos targeting ACAT1 and ACAT2 were cloned into pLKO.1 (addgene 8453). 
 <italic>CH25H</italic> was cloned into pLVX vectors. The target sequences of sgRNA and shRNA are as follows: 
 <italic>ACE2</italic>‐sgRNA1: CAGGATCCTTATGTGCACAA; 
 <italic>ACE2</italic>‐sgRNA2: CCAAAGGCGAGAGATAGTTG; 
 <italic>ACAT1</italic>‐shRNA: GCCACTAAGCTTGGTTCCATT; 
 <italic>ACAT2</italic>‐shRNA: GCTCTTATGAAGAAGTCAGAA. The cloning primers for CH25H (Forward: GGATCTATTTCCGGTGAATTCATGAGCTGCCACAACTGCTCC; Reverse: GCGGTCATACGTAGGATCCTTACCGCGCTGGGACAGATG). 293FT cells seeded in 6‐well plates were co‐transfected with pMD2.G (0.6 μg), psPAX.2 (1.2 μg), and sgRNA, pLVX, or pLKO.1 vector (1.8 μg) using Opti‐MEM and Lipofectamine 3000 according to the manufacturers’ instruction. At 4 h post‐transfection, supernatant was replaced with fresh medium. At 48 h post‐transfection, supernatant was harvested and used to transduce Calu‐3 cells. After 12 h transduction, lentivirus was removed and replaced with fresh medium.
