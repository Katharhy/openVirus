<p>293FT or Vero E6 cells were treated with EtOH or 25HC overnight, and then co‐transfected with pEGFP‐C1 and a pLVX vector expressing one of SARS‐CoV‐2‐S, SARS‐CoV‐S, and MERS‐CoV‐S using Lipofectamine 3000, in the absence of EtOH or 25HC. 4 h post‐transfection, fresh medium containing EtOH and 5 μM 25HC was supplemented. For 293FT cells, 24 h post‐transfection, cells were stained with Hoechst for 10 min at 37°C and examined under Leica fluorescence microscope (DMI 3000). For Vero E6 cell, 48 h post‐transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS, and incubated with 2 μg/ml Trypsin in PBS for 20 min. Trypsin‐containing PBS was subsequently removed, and cells were further incubated in medium for 40 min, prior to a 10‐min Hoechst staining at 37°C and examination under a fluorescence microscope. For quantification of membrane fusion, the percentage of nuclei involved in syncytia formation in each group was calculated by averaging three corresponding fields, and the extent of membrane fusion for each group was calculated by averaging 3 independent biological replicates for that group.</p>
