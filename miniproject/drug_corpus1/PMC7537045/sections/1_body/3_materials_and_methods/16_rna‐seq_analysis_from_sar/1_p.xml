 <xref rid="embj2020106057-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), target gene expression in infected cells relative to uninfected controls were calculated and log2(fold change) was displayed as a heatmap. For single‐cell RNA sequencing analysis from COVID‐19‐infected patients, scRNA‐seq dataset for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from four healthy controls, three moderate COVID‐19‐infected patients, and six severe COVID‐19‐infected patients were downloaded from GEO under the accession number GSE145926 (Liao 
 <italic>et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Analysis was based on the read count matrix, with cell type information provided by meta annotation text file. Reads counts of each gene were collected and calculated using the HDF5 matrix file provided. The read count box plot for HD, moderate, and severe COVID‐19‐infected patients are drawn based on this analysis.
