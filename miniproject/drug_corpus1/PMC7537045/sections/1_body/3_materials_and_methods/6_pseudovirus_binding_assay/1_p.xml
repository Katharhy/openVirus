<p>Calu‐3 cells were treated with EtOH or indicated concentrations of 25HC for 16 h, prior to incubation with SARS‐CoV‐2 pseudovirus at MOI = 2 at 4°C. Cells were then washed with chilled PBS three times and lysed with TRIzol. The RNA was extracted using a Direct‐zol RNA Kit (Zymo). The amount of bound virions was measured by RT–qPCR using primers for VSV‐L. The primers are as follows: 
 <italic>GAPDH</italic> (Forward: GGCCTCCAAGGAGTAAGACC; Reverse: AGGGGTCTACATGGCAACTG),
