 <italic>et al</italic>, Manuscript under preparation). These 60D differentiated lung organoids were pretreated overnight with 25HC (5 μM) and were infected with luciferase‐expressing SARS‐CoV‐2 pseudovirus (100 μl). At 2 h post‐infection, organoids were incubated with fresh medium containing 25HC. After 24 h, luciferase activity was measured to quantify viral infection.
