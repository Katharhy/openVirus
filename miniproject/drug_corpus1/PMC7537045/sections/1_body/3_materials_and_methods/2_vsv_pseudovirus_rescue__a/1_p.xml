<p>Pseudo typed VSV was generated based on previously described work (Whitt, 
 <xref rid="embj2020106057-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). In brief, BHK‐21/WI‐2 cells were infected with vTF7‐3 expressing T7 polymerase for 45 min and then transfected with pVSV‐EGFP‐dG (addgene 31842) or pVSV‐FLuc‐dG, along with pBS vectors expressing VSV‐N, VSV‐P, VSV‐L, and VSV‐G (Kerafast) at ratio 3:3:5:1:8, using Opti‐MEM and Lipofectamine 3000 according to the manufacturers’ instructions. 48 h post‐transfection, culture supernatants were collected and filtered through 0.22 μm filters to remove residual vaccinia virus. 293FT cells transfected with pMD2.G (addgene 12259) encoding VSV‐G for 24 h were inoculated with the filtrate to amplify the VSV pseudovirus. 24 h post‐inoculation, supernatants were collected and either stored at −80°C. Titration of EGFP‐expressing pseudovirus was performed by inoculating Vero E6 cells seeded in 96‐well plates with 10‐fold serial dilutions of the virus stock. 24 h post‐inoculation, numbers of GFP‐positive cells were counted and used to calculate virus titer as infectious unit per milliliter (IU/ml). Titration of FLuc‐expressing pseudoviruses was performed by inoculating Vero E6 cells transfected with VSV‐G in 24‐well plates with 10‐fold serial dilutions of the virus stock. 1 h post‐inoculation, new medium containing 1.5% methylcellulose was used to replace the inoculum. 2 days post‐inoculation, cells were washed and stained with crystal violet. Plaque numbers were counted and used to calculate virus titer.
