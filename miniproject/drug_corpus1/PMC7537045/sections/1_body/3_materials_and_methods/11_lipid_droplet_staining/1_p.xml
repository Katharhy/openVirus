<p>Calu‐3 cells were suspended in MEM medium with 2% lipid depleted serum and seeded in the wells of a Lab‐TEK II 4‐well chamber or a 96‐well plate. For the treatment with 25HC, cells were treated with 5 μM 25HC for 16 h. Then, the cells were washed and stained with 1× LipidSpot 488 (Biotium) for 30 min. The signals were captured by fluorescence microscope. For the infection with live SARS‐CoV‐2 virus, Calu‐3 cells were infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 USA‐WA1/2020 at MOI = 2 for 1 h at 37°C. Then, cells were washed, and fresh medium was supplemented. Cells were stained with 1× LipidSpot 488 for 30 min after 24 h post‐infection. The fluorescence signal was captured by Incucyte S3.</p>
