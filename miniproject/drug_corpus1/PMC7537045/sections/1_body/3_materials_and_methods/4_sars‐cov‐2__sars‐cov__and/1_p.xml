<p>Cells were pretreated with 25HC for 16 h and then infected with SARS‐CoV‐2, SARS‐CoV, and MERS‐CoV pseudovirus in fresh medium without 25HC. After 2‐h infection, virus was removed and fresh medium without 25HC was added. For pseudovirus with Fluc, cells were lysed at 24 h post‐infection and subjected for luciferase activity assay according to manufacturer's instruction. For pseudovirus with EGFP, infected was evaluated by taking picture for at least 5 random fields at 24 h post‐infection.</p>
