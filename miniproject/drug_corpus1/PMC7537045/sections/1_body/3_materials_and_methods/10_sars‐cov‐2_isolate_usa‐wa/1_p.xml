<p>SARS‐CoV‐2 isolate USA‐WA1/2020 was obtained from BEI Resources. SARS‐CoV‐2 was propagated and infectious units quantified by plaque assay using Vero E6 cells. Calu‐3 cells were pretreated with 25HC overnight and then infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 at MOI = 0.1 for 1 h at 37°C. Then, cells were washed and fresh medium with 25HC was supplemented. 48 h post‐infection, supernatant and infected cells were lysed using TRIzol and RNA was extracted using a Direct‐zol RNA Kit (Zymo) and quantified by RT–qPCR using SARS‐CoV‐2 N primers. The primers are as follows:
