<p id="para0004">Take the Liu Jiao Ting MMT clinic as an example, the clinic is located in central area of the COVID-19 epidemic (close to the Hua Nan Seafood Market) in Wuhan, serving 300 MMT patients living in the surrounding communities. The average number of visits decreased from 127 persons per day to 109 persons per day. We just finished a small survey using PHQ-9 and GAD-7 for 17 clients. Participants experienced some level of depression (PHQ mean score 14.65±5.37) and anxiety (GAD mean score 11.65±4.14). 14 participants reported it was difficulty to go to the clinic for medication, and 2 participants reported having been exposed to COVID-19 patients, while luckily no patients have been infected so far. The situation of the other 11 MMT clinics in Wuhan is very similar to that in Liu Jiao Ting clinic.</p>
