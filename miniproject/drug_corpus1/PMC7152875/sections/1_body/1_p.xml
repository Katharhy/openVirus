<p id="para0003">Since the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, the local government of Wuhan has implemented measures to control the epidemic, including restricting population mobility through traffic control, etc. However, these measures make it difficult for MMT patients to go to the clinics. Furthermore, some patients were afraid of walking to the clinics because it may increase the risk of contracting virus in public. If the patient is offered to take methadone home without a comprehensive monitoring plan, it may cause serious consequences such as overdose and illegal drug trade.</p>
