<p id="Par16">All spectra were acquired using an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer controlled by Xcalibur 3.0 software (Thermo Scientific) and operated in data-dependent acquisition mode. FTMS1 spectra were collected at a resolution of 120,000 over a scan range (m/z) of 375–1550 (for tryptic peptides) or 325–1500 (for chymotryptic peptides), with an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 4E5 and a max injection time of 50 ms. Precursors were filtered according to charge state (to include charge states 2–7), with monoisotopic peak determination set to peptide and using an intensity threshold of 1E3. Previously interrogated precursors were excluded using a dynamic window (40s ± 10 ppm). The MS2 precursors were isolated with a quadrupole isolation window of 0.7 m/z. ITMS2 spectra were collected with an AGC target of 2E4, max injection time of 35 ms and HCD collision energy of 30%.</p>
