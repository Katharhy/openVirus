<p id="Par17">A targeted analysis was performed to confirm the identification of the S protein deletion specific peptide (QTQTIASQSIIAY) identified by a single peptide spectral match (PSM) in the initial analysis of chymotryptic peptides. However, there were changes to the acquisition workflow. Precursors were filtered according to charge state (to include charge state 2) and previously interrogated precursors were excluded using a dynamic window (2 s ± 10 ppm). A targeted mass was specified with m/z 712.3759 and
