<p id="Par15">Protein lysates were prepared from the Vero E6 cells used for viral stock production. The cells were harvested in 4X Laemmli buffer (BioRad) and heated to 95 °C for 15 min. A 25-μl aliquot of the sample was separated using SDS-PAGE and the gel lane cut into 20 slices. The slices were reduced (10 mM DTT, 56 °C, 30 min), alkylated (100 mM iodoacetamide, room temperature, 20 min) and digested with trypsin (0.5 μg trypsin per slice, 37 °C, overnight). This whole process was repeated with chymotryptic digestion (0.5 μg chymotrypsin per slice, 25 °C, overnight). The resulting tryptic and chymotryptic peptides were fractionated using an Ultimate 3000 nano-LC system in line with an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). In brief, the peptides from each gel slice in 1% (vol/vol) formic acid were injected onto an Acclaim PepMap C18 nano-trap column (Thermo Scientific). After washing with 0.5% (vol/vol) acetonitrile 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid, peptides were resolved on a 250 mm × 75 μm Acclaim PepMap C18 reverse phase analytical column (Thermo Scientific) over a 150 min organic gradient, using 7 gradient segments (1–3% solvent B over 1 min, 3–15% B over 58 min, 15–32%B over 58 min, 32–40%B over 5 min, 40–90%B over 1 min, held at 90%B for 6 min and then reduced to 1%B over 1 min) with a flow rate of 300 nl min
 <sup>−1</sup>. Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid and solvent B was aqueous 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. Peptides were ionised by nano-electrospray ionisation at 2.2 kV using a stainless-steel emitter with an internal diameter of 30 μm (Thermo Scientific) and a capillary temperature of 250 °C.
