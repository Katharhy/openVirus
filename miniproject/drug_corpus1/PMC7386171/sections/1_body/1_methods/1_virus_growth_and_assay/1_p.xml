<p id="Par10">Vero E6 (ATCC® CRL 1586™) cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco™, ThermoFisher) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). All work with infectious SARS-CoV-2 strain England/2/2020 (VE6-T), isolated by Public Health England (PHE), was done inside a class III microbiological safety cabinet in a containment level 3 facility at the University of Bristol. A SARS-CoV-2 stock was produced by infecting Vero E6 cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 and incubating the cells for 72 h. The culture supernatant was clarified by centrifugation and stored in aliquots at − 80 °C. The titre of the stock was determined by preparing 10-fold serial dilutions in Eagle’s minimal essential medium (MEM; Gibco™, ThermoFisher) supplemented with 2% FBS. Aliquots of each dilution were added to 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> Vero E6 cells in the same medium in each of 12 wells of a 96-well plate. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 5–7 days and then examined for cytopathic effect. The TCID
 <sub>50</sub> was calculated according to the method of Reed and Muench [
