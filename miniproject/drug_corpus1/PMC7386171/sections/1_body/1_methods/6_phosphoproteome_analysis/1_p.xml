<p id="Par18">Six 30 μl aliquots of the infected cell total protein lysate were separated by SDS-PAGE until the dye front had moved approximately 1 cm into the separating gel. Each gel lane was excised as a single slice and subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion as above but using 1.5 μg trypsin per slice. The resulting peptides were subjected to TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-based phosphopeptide enrichment according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Pierce). The flow-through and washes from the TiO
 <sub>2</sub>-based enrichment were then subjected to FeNTA-based phosphopeptide enrichment, again according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Pierce). The phospho-enriched samples were evaporated to dryness and then resuspended in 1% formic acid prior to analysis by nano-LC MSMS using an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) as above.
