<p id="Par14">To prepare intracellular SARS-CoV-2 RNA, total cellular RNA containing SARS-CoV-2 RNA was extracted from the Vero E6 cells used for viral stock production using TRIzol™ Reagent (Invitrogen™, ThermoFisher) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Viral RNA was extracted from cell culture supernatants using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Approximately 3 kb RT-PCR products covering the S gene deletion were amplified from the viral RNA using the gene specific primers F9newF and F9newR (5′-TAAGGTTGGTGGTAATTATAATTACCTG-3′ and 5′-AAAATAGTTGGCATCATAAAGTAATGGG-3′) and a SuperScript™ IV One-Step RT-PCR System (Invitrogen™, ThermoFisher). A region spanning the deletion was sequenced using primers Wu_24_L and Wu_24_R (5′-TTGAACTTCTACATGCACCAGC-3′ and 5′-CCAGAAGTGATTGTACCCGC-3′).</p>
