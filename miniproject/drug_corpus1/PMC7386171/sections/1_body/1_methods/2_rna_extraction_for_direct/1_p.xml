 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Briefly, total RNA was extracted using TRIzol™ reagent (#15596026, Ambion) and the RNA extracted as per the manufacturer’s recommendations but with 3 × 70% ethanol washes. After resuspension in RNAse-free water, the RNA was polyA enriched and sequenced immediately using SQK-RNA002 kits and MIN106D R9 version flow cells (Oxford Nanopore Technologies).
