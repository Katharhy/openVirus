<p id="Par19">The raw data files were processed using Proteome Discoverer software v2.1 (Thermo Scientific) and searched against the UniProt 
 <italic>Chlorocebus sabaeus</italic> database (downloaded March 2020; 19,525 sequences), an in-house “common contaminants” database and a custom SARS-CoV-2 protein database using the SEQUEST HT algorithm. Peptide precursor mass tolerance was set at 10 ppm, and MS/MS tolerance was set at 0.6 Da. Search criteria included oxidation of methionine (+ 15.995 Da), acetylation of the protein N-terminus (+ 42.011 Da) and methionine loss plus acetylation of the protein N-terminus (− 89.03 Da) as variable modifications and carbamidomethylation of cysteine (+ 57.021 Da) as a fixed modification. For the phosphoproteome analysis, phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine (+ 79.966 Da) was also included as a variable modification. Searches were performed with full tryptic or chymotryptic digestion and a maximum of 2 missed cleavages were allowed. The reverse database search option was enabled and all data was filtered to satisfy a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%.
