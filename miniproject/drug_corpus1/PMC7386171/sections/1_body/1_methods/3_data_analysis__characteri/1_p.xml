<p id="Par12">To cope with the very wide range of transcripts, and to enable grouping of transcripts into classes, our previously described ORF-centric data analysis pipeline was utilised [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The transcripts were mapped to the viral genome with minimap2, and the mapping data was used to try to identify transcription regulatory sequences (TRS) and the sites where the transcript meets the polyA tail at the end of the genome. This is complicated by the repetitive nature of the leader and body TRS and thus mapping software struggles to determine where the breakpoint should map. Canonical and non-canonical junction sites were also identified, which the software refers to as splice acceptor/donor sites as it was originally used to describe spliced adenovirus transcripts. This script produces tables indicating where on the genome and how often in the data each junction occurs. Subsequently, nearby events are grouped together for simplicity of analysis. Once this is complete, the software then assigns each transcript to a “transcript group” depending on its pattern of TRS, junction sites and poly A locations and counts how many transcripts belong to each transcript group. Nanopolish [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] was used to determine the polyA length of each sequenced transcript and subsequently a simple average polyA length was calculated for each transcript group alongside the standard deviation.
