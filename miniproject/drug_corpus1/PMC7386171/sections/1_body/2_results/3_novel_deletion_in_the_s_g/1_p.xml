<p id="Par23">Manual inspection of the transcripts aligned to the virus genome revealed a large number of reads that aligned to the gene encoding the S glycoprotein but included a 24 nt deletion. This was predicted to result in a deletion of 9 aa, encompassing the proposed furin-like cleavage site (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a) with the replacement of a single isoleucine residue. Indeed, there were a large number of transcripts coding for this deleted S glycoprotein that had both a polyA tail &gt; 20 nt and a start at the proposed transcription start location, more than the full length S glycoprotein (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). To confirm this finding and examine if the deletion was present in the original stock samples at the PHE reference laboratory, the region was PCR amplified from the virus passaged at Bristol or from the original stock. These amplified fragments were sequenced using the Sanger method. This revealed that the Bristol stock was indeed a mixture of genomes but the deleted transcript was not detectable in the original stock. Subsequent examination of a very high quality dataset reported recently by Kim et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] did not detect any evidence of similar significant deletions in the S glycoprotein in their data. However, their dataset contained a spontaneous deletion within the region of the genome coding for the E protein resulting in a 9 aa in-frame deletion in almost two thirds of the mapped transcripts (Additional file

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], there is a 10 nt deletion near the 3′ end of the viral genome outside of any reading frame, the significance of which is unknown (Additional file
