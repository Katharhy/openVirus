<p id="Par21">Complete characterisation of a novel and dangerous pathogen at a molecular level is fundamental. Although analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome enables high confidence prediction of potential transcripts and ORFS, there is a pressing need to have the predictions confirmed and novel transcripts identified and assessed for biological significance and their role in virulence and pathogenesis. At the same time, there is also a need for independent confirmation that viral transcripts are expressed, which can be achieved by tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomics. In this way, we have provided direct observation of the whole range of viral proteins expressed in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and helped resolve ambiguities in the transcriptomic data. Finally, the identification of phosphorylation sites provided an invaluable list of potential therapeutic targets based on kinase inhibitors. Using proteomics informed by transcriptomics (PIT) [
