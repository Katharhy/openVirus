<p id="Par26">In Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, we note that approximately 14% of transcripts do not code for a known ORF and are collated under the heading “none from list”. In principle, this is a large body of transcripts that could code for novel proteins. As we have shown before, transcriptomics and proteomics can be combined to explore this question more deeply and provide an unbiased evaluation of the proteome of viruses and higher eukaryotes [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. We used our ORF-centric pipeline to remove errors in the nanopore sequence data and generate a list of possible ORFs by translating the first ORF present on every transcript sequenced [
