<p id="Par27">Using this list of predicted, and potentially novel, proteins revealed a large number of possible proteins which do not correspond to the standard list of predicted viral proteins. In the majority of cases, they appeared to be transcripts with rare and unusual structures likely resulting from rare rearrangements of the viral genome or potentially during subgenomic mRNA synthesis. However, in some cases, the translation of specific classes of relatively abundant transcripts was supported by direct peptide evidence. In particular, multiple versions of the N protein with distinct small internal deletions were detected and more than 20 transcripts that could encode for these proteins were also identified (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>: Table S7). A schematic of such a deletion in the N protein is shown, indicating the peptide that was identified by tandem mass spectrometry to support the observed transcripts (Fig.
