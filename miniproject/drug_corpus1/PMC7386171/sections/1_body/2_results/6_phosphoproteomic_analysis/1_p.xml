<p id="Par28">Allied to an analysis of viral peptides, the phosphorylation status of viral proteins was investigated as this could reveal potential targets for licenced kinase inhibitors. Phosphopeptides corresponding to locations on the N, M, ORF 3a, nsp3, nsp9, nsp12 and S glycoprotein were detected (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). The detection of phosphorylation sites on the S glycoprotein has not been previously noted and may be of significance in the context of vaccines based on this protein; the location of these sites is illustrated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The location of the phosphorylation sites on the proteins listed is illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, and additional models of the phosphorylation sites on the N-terminal RNA-binding domain of the N protein are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>.
