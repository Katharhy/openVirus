<p id="Par24">Tandem mass spectrometry was utilised to detect as many viral peptides and phosphopeptides as possible (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Table S5). Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> illustrates the numbers of peptides found for each of the predicted ORFs. Notably, whilst most of the ORFs detected were also confirmed in the recent report by Bojkova et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], there were some differences. Whilst we could not detect peptides from ORF9b as described by Bojkova et al., peptides corresponding to the ORF9a protein were identified. This leaves only the E, ORF7b and ORF10 proteins to be detected by mass spectrometry. In addition, peptides unique to proteolytically processed components of the viral replicase polyprotein pp1ab, namely nsp4, nsp9, nsp12, nsp13, nsp14 and nsp15, were identified indicating that these important processing steps occurred as predicted (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).
