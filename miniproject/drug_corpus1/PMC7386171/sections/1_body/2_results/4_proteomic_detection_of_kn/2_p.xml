<p id="Par25">Initially, no unique peptides corresponding to the novel deleted version of the S glycoprotein were detected by tandem mass spectrometry. However, a typical tryptic digest of this region would generate a very large peptide which would not be detectable within the standard mass range used for analysis. Accordingly, samples were digested using chymotrypsin and the analysis repeated revealing a single spectra which matched to the peptide corresponding to the deleted version of the S-glycoprotein, but only when using a 5% false discovery threshold. However, this did provide an accurate
