<p id="Par22">Long read length sequencing using an Oxford Nanopore MinION on polyA+ RNA from cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 was used to characterise viral RNA species. This technique has recently been used to study herpes viruses, coronaviruses and adenovirus transcriptomes [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In total, 1,588,330 sequences were base called and passed QC; of those, 527,401 were mapped to the BetaCoV/England/02/2020 genome using minimap2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). In addition, an average polyA tail length for each transcript was generated using nanopolish [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and this information was added to the analysis pipeline. A cutoff of a 20 nt minimum polyA length was employed and 386,903 transcripts passed this test. Finally, the data from the analysis pipeline was tabulated describing the structure of transcripts, how often they were observed, what features were present on each transcript and the location of the dominant transcription start sites and junctions (Additional files

 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Tables S1- S4). Accurately determining the 5′ end of direct RNAseq transcripts has been shown to be problematic [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The accepted model for coronavirus transcription (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a) proposes that all viral mRNAs have a common 5′ end [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and the analysis herein was further restricted to those transcripts that met this criterion. This important step reduces the total number of identified full length subgenomic mRNA molecules to 72,124 and enables an overview of the viral transcriptome of those transcripts that have an authentic 5′ end—transcripts that do not are most likely a result of degradation, a problem with dRNAseq that has also been previously noted [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c illustrates a transcription map of those transcripts that start at the expected location and have a known ORF as the 5′ most ORF. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c, only the dominant transcript for each ORF is shown; thus, there may be transcripts with structural differences that code for the same ORF but this figure illustrates the structure of the dominant transcript only. This approach was used by us previously to successfully recapitulate the highly complex adenovirus transcriptome de novo [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Transcripts that could express all of the predicted ORFs were present, including for the newly predicted ORF10 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, only one ORF10 transcript was detected, and as previously suggested [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], the status of this as a functional mRNA needs further investigation. Moreover, non-canonical TRS joining events were detected leading to, for example, apparently bone fide subgenomic transcripts coding for ORF7b, as was also recently reported by Kim et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Accurate mapping of the junction between the canonical leader and body TRS sequences is problematic as the two sequences are effectively repeated in the viral genome. Mapping algorithms cannot confidently determine a junction breakpoint within repetitive sequences like the TRS sequences, and this is further confounded by the error prone nature of dRNAseq. The full range of identified transcripts (and their structure) that could code for any given ORF is, however, compiled by the pipeline (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S3). Moreover, identification and assignment of individual transcripts by our ORF-centric pipeline is not affected by this as it classifies transcripts by 5′ most ORF. Detailed information on the transcripts with a 5′ UTR consistent with the model of coronavirus mRNA expression that would also code for a predicted protein are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Also reported are the average polyA tail lengths of each transcript group. These are consistent with recently reported findings for SARS-CoV-2 [
