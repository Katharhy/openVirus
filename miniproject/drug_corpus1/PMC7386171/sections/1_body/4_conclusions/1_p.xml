<p id="Par34">This integrated transcriptomic and proteomic dataset is a rich resource for research teams building a picture of this novel virus as it enables an accurate overview of the transcription profile and adds significant new direct observational data for the viral proteins. Critically, it provides direct observation of both transcripts and proteins and potential phosphorylation sites and highlights this virusâ€™s potential to mutate via genomic recombination/deletions. This latter observation has potential to directly affect vaccine challenge studies and may have a role to play as the pandemic progresses and vaccines or antivirals are widely deployed.</p>
