<p id="Par8">The SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic mRNAs encoding the structural proteins and their expression profiles are of particular interest as the encoded proteins are likely targets of a protective immune response. The coronavirus S glycoprotein is present as a homotrimer, protruding from the surface of the virion. It is a key determinant of viral tropism and the major antigenic target [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The S glycoprotein is a class I fusion protein comprised of two domains, S1 and S2, responsible for receptor binding and the fusion of viral and cellular membranes respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The S glycoprotein of coronaviruses is primed for cell entry by host cell proteases that cleave the protein at one or more positions. Cleavage of a “S1/S2” site at the boundary of the S1 and S2 domains occurs for some coronaviruses whilst cleavage at an “S2” site is common to all coronaviruses and results in activation of a highly conserved fusion peptide immediately downstream of the S2 site [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Although the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein shares 97% identity with that of bat coronavirus RaTG13 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], an important difference is the presence of a four amino acid insertion (
 <sub>681</sub>PRRA
 <sub>684</sub>) at the S1/S2 junction that introduces a potential furin-like cleavage site [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The furin cleavage site is also not found in other “lineage B” betacoronaviruses including SARS-CoV, but has been detected in betacoronaviruses in other lineages, suggesting that this region has arisen during natural evolution [
