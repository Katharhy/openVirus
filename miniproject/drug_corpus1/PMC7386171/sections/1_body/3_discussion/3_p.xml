<p id="Par31">In addition to the S glycoprotein deletion, we were also able to find an additional significant deletion, in high-quality data recently deposited by Kim et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], in the region of the E protein. This deletion removes one of the primer sites recently recommended as a first-line screening tool [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. This finding reinforces the potential of the virus to incur unexpected spontaneous deletions in viral genes during passaging that are hard to predict and detect. A recent analysis showed that deletion of ORF8 from human clinical isolates is possible [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and our data shows that novel SARS-CoV-2 viruses containing deletions or even insertions can arise naturally and successfully propagate. As the virus continues to spread and potentially comes under selective pressure from the host response in humans, vaccines and antiviral drugs in the future, vigilance will be required to detect novel rearrangements/deletions. Coronaviruses use a distinctive complex mechanism for genome replication that needs to be considered during bioinformatic analysis of their genomes relative to viruses causing other epidemics and pandemics where the principle driver of viral change would be single nucleotide polymorphisms and/or small (&lt; 3 nt) insertions/deletions. If the plasticity of the SARS-CoV-2 genome follows the same pathway as HCoV-NL63 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], then different isolates will emerge through recombination and this may result in repeat infection as protection will not be effective.
