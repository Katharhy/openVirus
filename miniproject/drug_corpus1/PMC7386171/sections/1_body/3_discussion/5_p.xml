<p id="Par33">Transcriptomically, our findings broadly agree with those recently reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Our assessment of polyA tail length is in line with both the data reported for SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and for data on bovine coronavirus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] although the role and significance of this data is unclear in either viral system. One area of difference is in the abundance of each transcript where we disagree with Kim et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; however, our ORF-centric pipeline assessment of individual transcript abundance does broadly agree with Taiaroa et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and the recent report of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA abundance determined by Northern blot [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].
