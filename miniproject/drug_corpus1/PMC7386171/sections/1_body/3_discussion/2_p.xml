<p id="Par30">The SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein deletion identified in this study removes the furin cleavage site, but also Arg
 <sub>685</sub> (corresponding to SARS-CoV Arg
 <sub>667</sub>) required for cleavage of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein. However, the sequence

 <sub>697</sub> (numbering of undeleted S glycoprotein, cleavage shown by “/”; Fig.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] suggesting that either the deleted SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein could be cleaved at this site or only use the S2′ site for cleavage. Recently, pseudoviruses expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein and the corresponding S glycoprotein with the furin cleavage site removed at the S1/S2 boundary (residues 
 <sub>680</sub>SPRR
 <sub>683</sub> removed) were made and their ability to mediate entry to Vero E6 and BHK-21 cells expressing hACE2 compared [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Deletion of the furin cleavage site enhanced the entry of the corresponding pseudovirus into Vero E6 cells but diminished entry into hACE2 BHK-21 cells. Although the engineered deletion differed from the naturally occurring deletion described here, this observation suggests that the naturally occurring deletion (in cell culture) enhances the ability of the virus to enter Vero cells and was selected for during passage in Vero E6 cells, a cell line that lacks a working type I interferon response. This has clear implications for the use of Vero cells to propagate and grow large batches of the virus for research and especially virus batches grown for use in vaccine challenge studies. Moreover, it also raises the possibility that even virus stocks which have been carefully assayed for homogeneity could still spontaneously generate this deletion during animal challenge studies—particularly in non-human primates and perhaps especially in animals from the 
 <italic>Chlorocebus</italic> genus. Thus, vaccine studies will need to carefully monitor the homogeneity of the challenge virus throughout the study period. Indeed, the functional impact of this kind of deletion is already beginning to emerge from recent preprint data. For example, viruses carrying the deletion in the S glycoprotein reported in this study may well be attenuated in vivo in NHPs as this type of furin deletion virus has been shown to exhibit reduced pathogenicity in a hamster disease model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The early emergence of a viral population carrying a deletion in the S glycoprotein that removes the furin cleavage site within an individual challenge animal could give the false impression that an individual animal had a mild infection. Given that animal studies are required to use the smallest number of animals needed for statistical significance, just one such event could confound the study. Since our initial findings were reported by pre-print archive, other teams have detected deletions in the S glycoprotein that remove the furin cleavage site at low levels alongside wild type S glycoprotein sequences in clinical samples [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Other teams have also reported the emergence of this type of deletion and other mutations at this location in independent cell culture based experiments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. This independent cell culture passage analysis concluded that viruses containing deletions in the S glycoprotein, that removed the furin cleavage site, result in a large plaque phenotype in Vero E6 cells and that this mutation is strongly and frequently selected for in Vero E6 cells. These observations raise the potential that in vivo, there are a subset of host cells where the deletion variant has a selectable advantage over the wild type. However, it is important to note that even where these types of deletions have been reported in clinical samples, they do not appear to dominate in vivo as there is still relatively little global variation reported in viral genomes including the S glycoprotein at this time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].
