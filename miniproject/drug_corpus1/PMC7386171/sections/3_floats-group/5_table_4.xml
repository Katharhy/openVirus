 <table-wrap-foot>
  <p>Listed for each protein is the number of distinct phospho sites identified along with the locations and amino acid modified as well as how many contributing PSMs there are in total. Each named site has confidence of at least 70% as defined by the PhosphoRS node of Proteome Discoverer software. For proteins ORF3a and nsp12, no distinct site could be identified despite a phosphorylated peptide being found; in these cases, the peptide sequence is provided</p>
