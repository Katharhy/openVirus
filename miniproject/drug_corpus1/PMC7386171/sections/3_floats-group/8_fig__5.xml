  <p>Modelling phosphorylation on the RNA binding domain of N protein. The positions of phosphorylation sites identified by mass spectrometry were mapped on the x-ray crystal structure of the N-terminal RNA binding domain of the N protein (aa residues 47â€“173) from SARS-CoV-2 (6YVO.pdb). The four monomer units in one asymmetric unit are distinctly coloured and shown as side (
   <bold>a</bold>, 
   <bold>b</bold>) and top (
   <bold>c</bold>, 
   <bold>d</bold>) views as ribbon (left hand figures) and space filling models (right hand figures)
