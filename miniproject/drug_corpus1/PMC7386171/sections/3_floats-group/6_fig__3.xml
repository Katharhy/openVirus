 <caption>
  <p>A space filled model of the wild type SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein in a trimeric form using the sequence of 
   <bold>a</bold> the native or 
   <bold>b</bold> spike deletant virus, in which the aaâ€™s 
   <sub>679</sub>NSPRRARSV
   <sub>687</sub> have been replaced with isoleucine. The model was built using a cryo-EM structure (6VSB.pdb) of the S glycoprotein in the prefusion form (25). Each of the monomers is coloured differently. The loop containing the furin cleavage site (or the shortened loop in the deleted version in 
   <bold>b</bold>) is indicated in red. The positions of phosphorylation sites identified by mass spectrometry and surface located were mapped on the native structure and shown in yellow in 
   <bold>a</bold>
