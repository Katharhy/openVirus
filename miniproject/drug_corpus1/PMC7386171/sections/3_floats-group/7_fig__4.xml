 <caption>
  <p>Schematic of the location of phosphorylation sites. Proteins M, N, NSP3, NSP9 and S glycoprotein are shown as we have accurate phospho-site data for these proteins. For each location, we indicate the amino acids (S, T or Y) and the amino acid numbering. The S glycoprotein is shown as S1 and S2 to illustrate where the sites would be relative to the major cleavage site on the wild type S glycoprotein</p>
