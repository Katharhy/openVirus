 <p>DAM and ADD led the conception and design of the work and led the manuscript drafting. MKW, DAM and ADD performed the infections and harvesting of virally infected cells; ADD supervised all work with live virus at CL3. SL and DAM extracted and sequenced the infected cell mRNA. MZ and JE led the virus detection and isolation work from UK patients and initial characterisation including genome sequencing. DS led the analysis of three-dimensional structures and phosphorylation site locations. DAM led the transcriptomics data analysis. JAH and MCW provided additional data interpretation and assisted the manuscript drafting. KH led the proteomics and phosphoproteomics data acquisition and analysis with PAL providing additional analysis and proteomics figure preparation. All authors contributed to manuscript drafts and figure preparation. The authors read and approved the final manuscript.</p>
