  <title>Recombinant information of DENV genomic coding regions.</title>
  <p>UTR sequences were excluded for recombinant analyses. (A) The recombinant region distribution along the viral genome. Because of the little difference in the CDS regions of DENV1-4, only one genomic organization of DENV is represented in the upper panel. In the lower panel, the recombinant isolates in this study are labelled on the left (with local isolates in black and imported isolates in red) and the major parental sequences of recombinant isolates are marked on the right, with minor parental sequences in the middle. D1, D2, D3, and D4 represent DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4, respectively. “Unknown” means that only one parent sequence is detectable. (B) No. of recombinant isolates from Guangdong province, China (Local) or other countries (Imported) in indicated years. (C) Number (primary axis) and frequency (secondary axis) of recombinant event per DENV gene. Every involved gene will be counted once if the recombinant regions are across more than one gene, and the frequency per gene is calculated by its own recombination number divided by the total recombinant events.</p>
