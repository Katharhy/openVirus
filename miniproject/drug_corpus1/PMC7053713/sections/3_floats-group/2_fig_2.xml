   <bold>Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of DENV-1 (A) and DENV-2 (B) genomic coding regions.</bold> UTR sequences and recombinant regions were excluded for phylogenetic analyses. Two published sequences (GenBank accession JQ920481, KX812530) were selected as their out-groups and the out-groups were removed for better presentation. “Locations” means the country where of sequences were obtained, and “Imported” means the original country of imported cases. Both are labelled by colored rectangles. The collection time are presented in red rectangles (sequences in this study) and in gray rectangles (sequences in GenBank). The recombinant isolates in this study are indicated by black stars. Bootstrap values are labelled at major nodes. Scale bar means nucleotide substitutions per site.
