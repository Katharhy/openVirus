  <title>The normalized SNP distributions along DENV genome.</title>
  <p>(A) Intra-subtype comparison of normalized SNP distributions along DENV genomic regions. The normalized SNP are obtained by total SNPs per gene or UTR divided by the sequence number and gene length (kb). The normalized SNP of each gene is compared with that of CDS (one-tailed Fisher’s exact test for a 2 × 2 contingency table, and 
   <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.01 is considered statistically significant). (B, C) Inter-subtype comparison of normalized SNP of UTR (B), non-synonymous mutations (C, red shade), and synonymous mutations (C, blue shade). Statistical significance was assessed using all pairwise Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA test with 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01. The values marked without the same superscript differ significantly.
