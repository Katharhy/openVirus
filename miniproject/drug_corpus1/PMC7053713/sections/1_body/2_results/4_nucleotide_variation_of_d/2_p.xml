<p>Next, we performed inter-subtype comparison of each gene. For viral UTRs, 5'-UTR of DENV-2 and DENV-4 had more mutations than of DENV-1 and DENV-3. 3'-UTR of DENV-4 possessed the highest SNPs among the four subtypes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008049.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). In addition, rapider mutation of DENV3-4 than of DENV-1 occurred in both synonymous and non-synonymous SNP in CDS regions (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Genetically, consistent inter-subtype differences occurred in three genes (
 <italic>NS2A</italic>, 
 <italic>2K</italic>, and 
 <italic>NS5</italic>) between synonymous and non-synonymous mutations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008049.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). For non-synonymous SNP, no significant inter-subtype difference was found in six genes (
 <italic>C</italic>, 
 <italic>M</italic>, 
 <italic>NS2B</italic>, 
 <italic>NS3</italic>, 
 <italic>2K</italic>, and 
 <italic>NS4B</italic>, 
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.01), and among the remaining five genes, 
 <italic>E</italic> and 
 <italic>NS2A</italic> of DENV-3 and 
 <italic>NS1</italic>, 
 <italic>NS4A</italic>, and 
 <italic>NS5</italic> of DENV-4 exhibited the fastest variation rate, respectively. For synonymous SNP, significant inter-subtype differences occurred in all genes except 
 <italic>2K</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008049.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). In general, more significant inter-subtype differences appeared in non-structural genes than in structural genes. Furthermore, normalized non-synonymous SNP were significantly different between DENV3-4 and DENV1-2, indicating that DENV3-4 evolved more rapidly than DENV1-2, especially DENV-4, which appeared to have the fastest mutation rate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008049.g005">Fig 5C</xref>).
