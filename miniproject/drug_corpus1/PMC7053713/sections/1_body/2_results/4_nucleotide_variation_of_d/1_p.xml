<p>We implemented single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analyses of dengue genome via homemade PERL script. Total synonymous (S) and non-synonymous (N) mutations in coding sequence (CDS) and SNP in UTR within each dengue subtype were calculated. The results showed that synonymous mutations were much higher than non-synonymous mutations or SNP in UTR in each serotype (

 <italic>NS5</italic> had the maximum SNP while 
 <italic>2K</italic> had the minimum (

Considering that both the sequence number in DENV1-4 and the sequence length of each gene varied, SNP was then normalized. The normalized SNP represented an even distribution along DENV genome and it was further compared with that of CDS to examine the variation of each gene within subtypes by a 2 Ã— 2 contingency table. Our results showed that no significant difference was found in intra-serotype DENV genes (
