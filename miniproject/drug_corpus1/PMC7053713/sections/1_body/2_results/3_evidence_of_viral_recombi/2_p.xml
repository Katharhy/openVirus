<p>The number and frequency of recombinant event in each DENV gene were further examined and the results showed that recombinant event occurred in every gene of DENV genome except 
 <italic>2K</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008049.g004">Fig 4A and 4C</xref>). The recombinant signal of 
 <italic>NS4A</italic> was detected only in DENV-4, and other genes (but 
 <italic>2K</italic>) were detected in at least two dengue serotypes. Furthermore, 
 <italic>NS3</italic> not only had the most recombination events, but also the only one, in which recombination signal was detected simultaneously in DENV1-4. For the four DENV serotypes in this study, recombination signal was detected in two genes of DENV-1, seven genes of DENV-2, five genes of DENV-3, and nine genes of DENV-4 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008049.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Meanwhile, DENV-1 had the highest sequences but the lowest recombination frequency (3/52) while DENV-4 had the highest recombination frequency (4/9).
