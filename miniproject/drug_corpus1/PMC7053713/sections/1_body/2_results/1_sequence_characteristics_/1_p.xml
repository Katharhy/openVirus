<p>One hundred and fourteen DENV complete genomes were sequenced in this study (DENV-1 = 52, DENV-2 = 30, DENV-3 = 23, DENV-4 = 9). In contrast, there were 79 published DENV genome sequences (DENV-1 = 55, DENV-2 = 17, DENV-3 = 6, DENV-4 = 1) isolated from Guangdong province, China from 2012 to 2017 in GenBank (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008049.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Sequences from local cases were a little higher than sequences from imported cases (59:55), with ratio of 33:19 in DENV-1, 13:17 in DENV-2, 11:12 in DENV-3, 2:7 in DENV-4 (
