<p>In geographical distribution, 75 of 114 DENV genome sequences were derived from five cities, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Foshan, Dongguan, and Zhongshan (all five cities were located in the Pearl River Delta, Guangdong Province, which was characterized by developed economy, dense population, and frequent personnel flow). Moreover, sequences from Shenzhen and Foshan simultaneously included DENV1-4, and there were three DENV serotype sequences distributed in Guangzhou, Dongguan, Zhongshan, Shantou, Jiangmen, and Yangjiang. Only one DENV serotype was derived from Zhanjiang, Zhuhai, Zhaoqing, Shanwei, Huizhou, and Shaoguan. No sequences were distributed in Heyuan, Jieyang, or Meizhou (
