<p>To illuminate the phylogenetic relationship among DENV genome sequences in this study, we conducted maximum likelihood (ML) trees of DENV1-4. Our results showed that the sequences in this study presented a scattered distribution and they were not grouped into a single cluster in DENV1-4 ML trees (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008049.g002">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008049.g003">3</xref>). In addition, most imported cases of dengue infection were from Southeast and South Asian countries and most DENV isolates were closet to those from Southeast and South Asian countries (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008049.g002">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008049.g003">3</xref>). For DENV-1, the sequences from the same year showed a discrete distribution along ML tree and the sequences from different years were not grouped into a single cluster. Furthermore, the most imported cases of DENV-1 infection were from Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Viet Nam, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka with only one case from Brazil. Most DENV-1 isolates in our study were closely related to isolates from Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka (

The most imported DENV-2 cases were concentrated in Malaysia, Thailand, Maldives, the Philippines, Viet Nam, and Myanmar. Only a few imported DENV-2 cases were from Taiwan and New Guinea. Similarly, most DENV-2 isolates in our study were closely related to those from Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia (
