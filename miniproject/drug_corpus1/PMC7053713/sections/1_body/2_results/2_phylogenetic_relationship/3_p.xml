<p>Given that the potential recombinant events influence phylogenetic relationship, we further conducted ML trees of DENV1-4 without the recombinant regions excluded. The results showed that DENV1-4 sequences in the present study were not grouped into a single obvious cluster in their ML trees (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008049.s002">S1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008049.s003">S2</xref> Figs) and most DENV isolates were closely related to those from Southeast and South Asian countries (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008049.s002">S1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008049.s003">S2</xref> Figs). However, many isolates, especially the recombinant isolates (marked by black stars) changed their topological positions in the ML trees (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008049.g002">Fig 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008049.s002">S1 Fig</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008049.g003">Fig 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008049.s003">S2 Fig</xref>), which demonstrated that recombinant events took place in DENV genomes.
