<p>Recombination detection was performed using Recombination Detection Program 4 (RDP4) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008049.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] with UTR sequences eliminated. Seven methods were selected, including RDP [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008049.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], GENECONV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008049.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], BootScan [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008049.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], MaxChi [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008049.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], Chimaera [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008049.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], SiScan [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008049.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and 3Seq [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008049.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The recombinant event was determined when recombinant signal was detected by at least two methods and 
 <italic>p</italic> value &lt; 0.05 was considered positive recombinant signal. Detailed detection information of the recombinant isolates is shown in
