<p>Sequences were aligned using ClustalO [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008049.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] with subsequent manual correction by BioEdit (version 7.1.3.0). For phylogenetic analyses, UTR sequences were removed. Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees were constructed using online web server (CIPRES) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008049.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], as implemented in RAxML [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008049.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] program (version 8.2.10), under the General Time Reversible (GTR) model of nucleotide substitution with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. The final ML trees were visualized using Figtree (version 1.4.3).
