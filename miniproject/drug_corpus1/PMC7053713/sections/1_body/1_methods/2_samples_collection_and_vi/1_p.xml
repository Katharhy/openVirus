<p>The patient's history of travelling was obtained through inquiry. Patients with DENV who did not leave Guangdong within two weeks prior to the onset of the disease were classified as local cases; otherwise classified as imported cases. After collecting serum from patients, type-specific monoclonal anti-DENV bodies were used to identify the serotype by indirect immunofluorescence. DENV positive samples were further used for viral isolation by inoculation into C6/36 cell lines. When cytopathic effect was clearly observed, cells were centrifuged to remove any debris and supernatant were collected and stored at ˗80°C.</p>
