<p>We sequenced 114 whole genomes in this study (DENV-1 = 52, DENV-2 = 30, DENV-3 = 23, and DENV-4 = 9). Each analyses dataset of four DENV serotypes was composed of complete genome sequences in this study and those possessing the location and year of isolation available in GenBank database (up to December 31, 2018). Each complete sequence of DENV1-4 was firstly performed through BLASTN analyses and the top 50 hit complete sequences were selected. Next, top hit sequences were combined into a dataset, along with published complete genome sequences isolated in Asia from 2012 to 2017. Sequences with duplicated accession numbers, poor quality, and positive recombinant signal (see “Evidence of recombination”) were excluded from dataset. Finally, four separated datasets (527 DENV-1, 314 DENV-2, 154 DENV-3, and 110 DENV-4 genome sequences) were collected for subsequent analyses. All published DENV complete genome accessions involved in this study are supplied in
