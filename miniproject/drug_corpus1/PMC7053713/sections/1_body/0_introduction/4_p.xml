<p>In the current study, we sequenced 114 full-length genomes of DENV1-4 from 2013 to 2017, involving 18 of 21 cities in Guangdong Province and we further performed phylogenetic, recombinant, and nucleotide variation analyses. Our analyses revealed that dengue fever was not endemic in Guangdong but it is still necessary to strengthen the survey of dengue disease. By this investigation, we aimed to provide further support for the control of dengue fever in Guangdong Province.</p>
