<p>In some Southeast Asia countries, Dengue fever outbreaks had been endemic [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008049.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, whether dengue disease is endemic in Guangdong province, China is controversial. Previous reports suggested that endemic prevalence introduced by imported isolates and endogenous epidemic outbreak co-triggered dengue outbreak in Guangdong in recent years [

This, we believe, could provide information that is much more reliable about molecular epidemiological characteristics of DENV in Guangdong in recent years.
