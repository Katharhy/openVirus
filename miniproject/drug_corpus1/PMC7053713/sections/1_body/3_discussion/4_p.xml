<p>Recombination is considered an important driver of viral evolution and adaption [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008049.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Numerous DENV recombinant events have been identified in previous studies [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008049.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,

 <italic>2K</italic>, and this was further conformed by the inconsistency of ML trees constructed with or without recombinant regions. Frequent recombination generated multiple genotypes, giving rise to the current complicatedly epidemic situation in Guangdong (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008049.g002">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008049.g003">3</xref>). Among these recombinant isolates, fourteen isolates were from imported cases while only six isolates were from Guangdong. This means that the majority of recombinant events took place outside Guangdong, which indirectly indicated that dengue disease is not endemic in Guangdong Province. Among DENV genes, 
 <italic>NS3</italic> possessed the most recombinant events covering simultaneously DENV1-4. This may be in connection with its function that plays a crucial role in viral replication [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008049.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The precise recombinant mechanism needs further investigation via co-infection model of different dengue strains
