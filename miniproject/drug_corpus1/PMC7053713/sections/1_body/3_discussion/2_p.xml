In this study, we sequenced 114 complete genomes of DENV1-4 from 2013 to 2017 and it provided a huge support for the research of dengue fever in Guangdong, China. In the meantime, DENV1-4 coexisted in Guangdong province, especially in the Pearl River Delta area, and this was in agreement with earlier reports [
