<p>To illuminate viral phylogenetic relationships, ML trees of DENV1-4 were conducted. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008049.g002">Fig 2A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008049.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, sequences from Singapore (DENV-1 from 2012 to 2016 and DENV-2 from 2007 to 2013) were grouped into a single obvious cluster. It revealed that successive dengue outbreaks in Singapore were caused by endemic circulating strains. A similar characteristic was presented in sequences from Thailand (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008049.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, DENV-4 from 1991 to 2010). All the above-mentioned characteristics showed that dengue fever had been endemic in Singapore and Thailand [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008049.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, DENV1-4 sequences from the same or different years in this study represented a scattered distribution along ML trees. Although four closely related DENV-3 sequences were successively isolated from 2014 to 2017, three of them were from imported cases outside Guangdong Province (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008049.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Furthermore, majority of isolates were closely related to those from Southeast and South Asian regions where most imported cases were obtained. This indicated that dengue epidemics in Guangdong were mainly induced by randomly imported cases from increasing tourism and economic exchanges between Southeast-South Asian countries and Guangdong province, China. Hence, we believe that dengue is still an imported disease in Guangdong.
