<p>Nucleotide mutation is another driver of viral evolution [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008049.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and SNP analyses reflects the selection pressure within the viral population [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008049.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Our analyses showed that much more synonymous mutations were detected than non-synonymous mutations in DENV1-4, suggesting that most non-synonymous mutations of DENV1-4 were deleterious, and purification selection was shaping dengue virus population to prevent them from evolution 
 <italic>in situ</italic>. Additionally, there were no obvious intra-serotype differences in DENV genes, but more significant inter-subtype differences in non-structural genes than in structural genes were detected. This was possibly because of the biological functional difference between the structural and non-structural proteins. For flavivirus, the structural proteins constitute the virion and they mediate cellular adsorption, penetration, and fusion while the non-structural proteins combined with their UTRs participate in viral replication, translation, and impairment of host antiviral responses [
