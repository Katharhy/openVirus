<p id="Par9">From March 22 to April 22, 2020, 2043 patients were admitted to our emergency department, presenting symptoms compatible with those stated in our case definition. PCR was positive for nasopharyngeal samples of 475 adult patients. We run a 3-step treatment algorithm, and our approach is displayed in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. We hospitalized moderate to severe cases and administered lopinavir combined with doxycycline and ceftriaxone to 343 patients, among whom 161 had positive PCR test results (161/343, 46.9%). Unfortunately our lab ceased respiratory viral PCR panels and allocated all resources to SARS-CoV-2 PCR test during the study time. Therefore, we could not identify other causes and diagnosed COVID-19 PCR negative patients as viral respiratory tract infection of unknown etiology.
