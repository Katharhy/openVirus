<p id="Par20">We supplemented doxycycline to both lopinavir and hydroxychloroquine due to its immunomodulatory activity. Recent findings revealed the adverse effect of dysregulated immunity on the outcome of COVID-19 patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Doxycycline induces the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins, a regulatory system on cytokine release [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Evidence accumulates that SOCS proteins, mainly SOCS-3 protein, prevent interleukin- and interferon-associated toxicity [

Notably, in the early stage of the disease, when there are enough healthy cells in the bronchi and alveoli, doxycycline might have some effect on preventing the upcoming cytokine storm. Doxycycline had been successfully used in dengue hemorrhagic fever due to its immunomodulatory activity [
