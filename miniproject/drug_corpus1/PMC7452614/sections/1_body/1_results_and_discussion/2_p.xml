<p id="Par10">We followed 1700 mild cases under the treatment with hydroxychloroquine plus doxycycline at home. Besides, 314 patients isolated at home were found to have positive PCR test results (314/1700, 18.5%). PCR results were mostly available within 48 h, and patients with positive PCR test results were further followed by filiation teams of the Turkish Health Ministry. Filiation teams provided them with a 5-day course of hydroxychloroquine. Twenty-three of all patients treated at home were readmitted to the hospital because their initial symptoms worsened, and we administered lopinavir plus doxycycline. If these patients do not respond in 48 h, we instituted favipiravir treatment.</p>
