 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> presents the baseline characteristics of PCR positive hospitalized patients. We administered our standard regimen, lopinavir plus doxycycline plus ceftriaxone, to these hospitalized patients. Among 161 cases, 31 required ICU support, and 20 deceased during ICU stay. However, 12 of these patients were severe at admittance. Of these nine patients immediately admitted to the ICU, five of whom died. Three other patients transferred to the ICU on the second day of admittance to the hospital also died.
