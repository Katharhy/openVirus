<p id="Par7">We managed COVID-19 patients with a 3-step treatment approach in our institute. First, mild cases were isolated at home and prescribed with hydroxychloroquine plus doxycycline for 3 days. Second, moderate to severe cases were hospitalized and prescribed with a regimen of lopinavir plus doxycycline plus ceftriaxone for 5 days. Third, we used a salvage therapy for patients who did not respond to or whose conditions worsened under the lopinavir treatment. This therapy involved the oral administration of favipiravir 600 mg twice daily after two loading doses.</p>
