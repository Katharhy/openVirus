<p id="Par35">In 2001, following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the U.S. experienced its first bioterrorism incident. Letters filled with anthrax were delivered to political officials on Capitol Hill. While bioterrorism is different in many ways from an epidemic, the psychological distress is similar. Much like the effects of COVID-19, the magnitude and effect of the anthrax attacks were delayed and uncertain. This uncertainty commonly leads to fear and can manifest and exacerbate mental instability and illnesses. The anthrax threat demonstrated a time that stress was not only experienced by those directly exposed, but also in those that believed they were exposed [

During an outbreak trusting and following recommendations set by healthcare officials is the way that the outbreak is controlled. The risk of individuals changing their healthcare behavior based on distrust in authorities is an important risk that can be translated to the COVID-19 pandemic. Whether an individual was exposed or not, the beliefs about their exposure may be a more powerful predictor of mental health outcomes [

With constantly changing and differing policies between countries and states surrounding COVID-19, steps taken to control the spread of disease, and the vast amount of misinformation distributed among the general public, the belief of exposure is likely to widely vary among individuals.
