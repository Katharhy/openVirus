<p id="Par18">Individuals with pre-existing mental illnesses already have a fragile and purposefully balanced lifestyle. Coping strategies and routines are built around challenges in everyday life in order to maintain a degree of certainty and control over personal emotional and mental stability. During and after pandemics, individual coping strategies, routines, and support systems can be disrupted. The role of stress in precipitating a psychotic episode in vulnerable individuals is well documented [

Similarly, the role of stress in producing an acute exacerbation in currently stable patients with a known diagnosis of a psychotic disorder is also well documented. Individuals with a mental disorder involving psychotic features represents an example of patients at particular risk of becoming unstable. Patients who have experienced psychosis commonly experience biased cognitive processes [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Patients with existing mental illnesses with or without psychosis are likely to have experienced, to some degree, one of these biased cognitive processes. Bi directionality is hypothesized to exist between stress and biased cognitive processes, so that not only does perceived threat increase stress, but stress also increases the tendency of patients to look for threat [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The risk of mental instability and positive feedback cycles in this population is likely to occur during this pandemic, where stress is heightened, and threat is likely to be fueled by fear of illness and changing of routines.
