<p id="Par22">Individuals who have an underlying predisposition for developing a mental illness are also at an increased risk of becoming mentally unstable during and after the pandemic. The stress-vulnerability model suggests that mental illness manifests when an individualâ€™s threshold for tolerating elicited stress is exceeded [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Our body experiences stress through the release of cortisol. Increased cortisol acts on areas of the brain including the hippocampus and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to alter intracellular levels of trophic factors such as BDNF in neurons. Ultimately affecting neurogenesis and plasticity in the brain [

In addition to a genetic predisposition, the ability of stress to change the neural signaling within the brain, there is a biological balance that is important for individuals to maintain during times of crisis. Not everyone who has a genetic predisposition for a disease develops that disease, however, it is important to identify this population with an aim to decrease the additional psychosocial stressors vulnerable populations experience. Preventing individual thresholds for stress from being overwhelmed and identifying when these thresholds are overwhelmed will be two important aspects in preventing and managing disease.
