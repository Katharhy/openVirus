<p id="Par49">The long-term impact of COVID-19 on mental health and well-being is likely to take months before it becomes fully apparent. In the meantime, managing this impact will require a concerted effort from the health care system at large, not just from mental health care providers. It will be important to identify patients with existing illnesses who present in acute crisis, to catch new cases of mental illness in individuals not previously diagnosed, and to provide support for those who do not meet criteria for a mental disorder but will need therapy. In order for these three groups to be identified and services made available, there will need to be an increased amount of screening performed.</p>
