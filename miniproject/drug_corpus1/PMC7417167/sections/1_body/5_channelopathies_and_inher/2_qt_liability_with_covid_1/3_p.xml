<p id="p0175">A case report by Mitra etÂ al. (
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>) reports a possible benefit of addition of lidocaine or mexiletine to allow combination therapy with azithromycin and chloroquine in patients with a prolonged QT interval. Class Ib antiarrhythmic agents, due to their effect on the late sodium current by blocking the INa-L channel, have been shown to slightly shorten the QT interval and suppress TdP in acquired LQTS. Other known therapies to alleviate risk of TdP, such as maintaining potassium and magnesium levels and heart rates &gt;70 beats/min have also been described (
