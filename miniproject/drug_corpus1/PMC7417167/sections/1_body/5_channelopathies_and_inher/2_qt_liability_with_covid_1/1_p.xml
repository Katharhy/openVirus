<p id="p0165">Experimental drugs used for treatment of COVID-19 hold a significant risk for QTc prolongation. A case series by Ramireddy et al. (
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>) reported an increase in QTc interval in 12% of patients receiving hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both; however, no TdP was seen. In a randomized controlled trial, CloroCOVID-19 trial (Chloroquine Diphosphate for the Treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Secondary to SARS-COV2), studying the effect of low-dose (450 mg twice daily for 1 day, then 450 mg daily for 4 days) versus high-dose (600 mg twice daily for 10 days) chloroquine in addition to azithromycin in severe COVID-19 patients showed lethality in the higher dose group with an odds ratio of 3.6 (95% confidence interval: 1.2 to 10.6) and thus recommended against the use of high-dose chloroquine in severe cases (

 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). It consists of ≥68 years of age, female sex, use of loop diuretics, potassium level ≤3.5 mEq/l, baseline QTc interval ≥450 ms, acute myocardial infarction, number of QT-prolonging medications, sepsis, and heart failure. A score of ≤6 predicts low risk, 7 to 10 medium risk, and ≥11 high risk of drug-associated QT prolongation (
