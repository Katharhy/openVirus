<p id="p0170">An algorithm (
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>) proposed by Mayo Clinic for patients in whom QTc-prolonging drugs like (hydroxy)chloroquine ± azithromycin or lopinavir/ritonavir are under consideration recommend to obtain a pre-treatment baseline QTc measurement, baseline electrolytes (K+, Ca+2, and Mg+2), to determine if any home QTc-prolonging medication can be discontinued and to document high-risk cardiovascular and comorbid conditions. QTc interval can be measured using standard 12-lead ECG, telemetry, or mobile ECG devices. However, if using a handheld ECG device, either a multilead handheld ECG device or a single-lead handheld ECG device in at least 3 lead positions are recommended as a single position may lead to under-reporting of the QTc interval (

A QTc measurement of &lt;460 ms in pre-pubertal patients, &lt;470 ms in post-pubertal male patients, and &lt;480 ms in post-pubertal female patients is considered low risk to prescribe or continue therapy. In patients with QTc interval &gt;500 ms at baseline or an increase in QTc measurement of ≥500 ms or if the change in QT interval is ≥60 ms, 2 to 3 h after a dose of hydroxychloroquine or other QT-prolonging agent, we recommend re-evaluation of the risk of TdP, discontinuation of other QTc-prolonging medications, correction of all electrolyte abnormalities, and placing of the patient on continuous telemetry, with consideration of a wearable defibrillator or placement of external defibrillator patches. In patients with a wide QRS either due to bundle branch block or ventricular pacing, wide QRS-adjusted QTc interval can be calculated to account for the wide QRS: [wide QRS-adjusted QTc interval = QTc interval − (QRS interval − 100 ms)] (
