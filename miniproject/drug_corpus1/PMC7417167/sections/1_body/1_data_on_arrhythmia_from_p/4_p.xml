<p id="p0050">There are several manifestations of arrhythmias observed in COVID-19 patients. Bradyarrhythmias have been described by several authors in the literature. A case of transient complete heart block requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation was reported in a patient with COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Another case of transient high-grade atrioventricular (AV) block was reported, which was thought to be as a result of subclinical myocarditis (

 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), 1 of the 2 patients with COVID-19 was found to have transient complete heart block along with temporary occurrence of S1Q3T3, which suggests transient pulmonary artery hypertension secondary to ARDS. Along with cases of bradyarrhythmias, tachyarrhythmias including atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, supraventricular tachycardias, as well as ventricular arrhythmias, have been reported in patients with COVID-19. A case of multifocal ventricular tachycardia was preceded by electrocardiography (ECG) findings of ST-segment elevation in a patient with COVID-19 (

 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). A case of atrial flutter with 2:1 AV block was seen as the presenting rhythm in a male with symptoms of COVID-19 who was later tested to be positive for the novel coronavirus (
