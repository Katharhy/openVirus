<p id="p0035">Because we currently have limited data on the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, it is worthwhile to understand from previous historic coronavirus epidemics due to SARS-CoV and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus. In a case series of 121 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, 71.9% were found to have tachycardia independent of hypotension and fever, and 14.9% were found to have bradycardia as a transient event (

It was noted that the tachycardia persisted in 40% of patients at follow up after discharge. In a case series of 70 patients with laboratory-confirmed Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus in 2014 in Saudi Arabia, cardiac arrhythmias including tachyarrhythmias and severe bradyarrhythmia requiring temporary pacemaker occurred in 15.7% of patients (

Also, patients with high influenza activity were reported more likely to have a ventricular arrhythmia treated with shock and with antitachycardia pacing (
