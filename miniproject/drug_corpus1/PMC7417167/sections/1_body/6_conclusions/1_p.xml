<p id="p0195">Our understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on arrhythmias continues to evolve as new data emerge. Current data suggest that arrhythmias are more frequent in the critical care settings. The increasing risk of arrhythmias in COVID-19 patients is likely as a result of systemic illness and not merely as a result of direct effect of the viral infection. To manage arrhythmias in patients with COVID-19, it is imperative to increase the awareness of potential drug-drug interactions, to monitor QTc prolongation while receiving COVIDm-19 therapy, and provide special considerations for patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes. It is also crucial to minimize exposure to COVID-19 infection by stratifying the need for intervention and using telemedicine. As COVID-19 infection continues to prevail with a potential for future surges, more data are required to better understand pathophysiology and to validate management strategies.</p>
