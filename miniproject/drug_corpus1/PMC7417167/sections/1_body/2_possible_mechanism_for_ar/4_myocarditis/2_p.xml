<p id="p0080">Another possible mechanism is via cell-mediated cytotoxicity in which primed CD8+ T lymphocytes migrate to the cardiomyocytes and cause myocardial inflammation. Via cytokine storm, proinflammatory cytokines, which are released into the circulation, augment T lymphocyte activation, which further releases more cytokines resulting in a positive feedback loop of immune activation and myocardial injury (

Myocarditis can cause arrhythmia in the acute stage due to a direct cytopathic effect, causing electrical imbalance, ischemia from microvascular dysfunction, and gap junction dysfunction from impaired myocardial expression of connexins, or due to ion-channel impairment, especially seen in patients with overlapping inflammatory channelopathies. In viral myocarditis, host and viral factors can cause structural as well as electrophysiological remodeling, which can cause abnormal calcium handling and down-regulation of potassium channels, leading to prolonged repolarization and abnormal conduction. Prolonged repolarization can induce triggered activity, whereas a combination with abnormal conduction (which involves reduced conduction velocity, decreased refractoriness, and increased diffusion of conduction in the myocardium) can cause either circus-type re-entry or phase 2 re-entry without an obstacle (
