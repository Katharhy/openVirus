<p id="p0075">SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis has been reported several times in the literature so far (
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The proposed mechanism for the pathophysiology of myocarditis includes direct myocardial injury as a consequence of direct viral tissue involvement (
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) or due to extrapulmonary migration of infected alveolar macrophages, and can potentially predispose to enhanced arrhythmic risk by disrupting electrical conduction (
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the spike protein to bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the myocardial cell membrane (
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). In theory, when the SARS-CoV-2 attaches to the ACE2 receptors found on the myocardium, there is down-regulation of the ACE2 receptors, which causes unopposed angiotensin II accumulation, leading to adverse myocardial remodeling by its action on angiotensin II type 1 receptors (
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Intracellular presence of the virus also inhibits stress granule formation via its accessory protein, promoting its replication and causing cell damage. Based on prior in-vitro studies on SARS-CoV, amiodarone and other cationic amphiphilic drugs like dronedarone, verapamil, and the calcium-channel blocker bepridil seem to target this part of the viral life cycle by accumulating in the late endosomes or lysosomes and increasing the pH of these organelles, thereby affecting coronavirus replication (
