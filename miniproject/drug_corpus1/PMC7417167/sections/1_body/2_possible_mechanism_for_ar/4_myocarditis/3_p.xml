<p id="p0085">Tavazzi etÂ al. (
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) describe a case of COVID-19 presenting with cardiogenic shock and new onset cardiomyopathy with echocardiography showing a dilated left ventricle (LV), severe and diffuse LV hypokinesia (LV ejection fraction 34%), and coronary angiography showing normal coronaries. Endomyocardial biopsy demonstrated cytopathic interstitial inflammatory cells, but no viral particles were observed in the myocyte. This observation suggests that myocardial localization was either due to a viremia phase or due to migration of infected alveolar macrophages in extrapulmonary tissues (
