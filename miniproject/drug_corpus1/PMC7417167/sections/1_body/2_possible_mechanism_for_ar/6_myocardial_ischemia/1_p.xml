<p id="p0095">Potential causes for myocardial ischemia are microvascular dysfunction and a hyperinflammatory state, leading to activation of inflammatory cells within a pre-existing atherosclerotic plaque, causing vasoconstriction due to dysregulation of the coronary vascular endothelial function. In one study, microvascular dysfunction was found to be in the form of disseminated intravascular coagulation due to hyperinflammation and immune activation (

Cytokine surge and inflammatory mediators can also cause acute coronary syndrome due to activation of inflammatory cells within a pre-existing atherosclerotic plaque as well as vasoconstriction due to dysregulation of the coronary vascular endothelial function (
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Pathogen-associated molecular patterns are formed with viral products in the systemic circulation, which can cause activation of innate immune response as well as activation of inflammasome resulting in the formation of biologically active cytokines (
