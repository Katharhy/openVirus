<p id="p0090">Along with a direct role in myocardial injury (
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), cytokines including interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and IL-1 can modulate the expression and function of potassium and calcium channels (inflammatory cardiac channelopathies) and cause prolongation of ventricular action potential (
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Inflammatory cytokines are a well-studied trigger for arrhythmia, especially in patients with long QT syndrome (LQTS), due to overactivation of the cardiac sympathetic system using the hypothalamus-mediated inflammatory reflex and peripheral-mediated activation of the stellate ganglion pathway (
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), which can lead to QT prolongation (
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Furthermore, IL-6 inhibits cytochrome P450 (CYP450), which increases the bioavailability of QT-prolonging drugs (
