<p id="p0100">Right myocardial strain can be seen as a result of pulmonary embolism, which has been reported as the most common thrombotic complication in COVID-19 patients (
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>), or due to pulmonary hypertension, causing increased right sided pressures secondary to severe ARDS, sepsis, or heart failure (
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). On the one hand, increased right atrial pressure along with increased sympathetic tone in patients with pulmonary hypertension and hypoxia can predispose to increased risk of atrial tachyarrhythmias (
