<p id="p0130">Bradycardia including sinus or AV block in COVID-19 patients can be seen because of drug side effects with use of (hydroxy)chloroquine, lopinavir/rotinavir, and azithromycin. AV blocks could also be seen in myocarditis if there is involvement of the conduction system. Intubated patients can experience transient bradycardia during tracheal secretion suctioning or during proning of the patient due to transient increased vagal tone. In patients with persistent bradycardia, use of isoprenaline and atropine can be considered prior to temporary pacemaker implantation (

Temporary pacemaker implantation is considered a reasonable option prior to implanting a permanent device due to the transient nature of bradyarrhythmias, nature of critical illness, risk of bacterial superinfection, and risk of device infection. However, evaluation of a permanent pacemaker should be reassessed after recovery from COVID-19 infection (
