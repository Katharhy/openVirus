<p id="p0150">Rhythm control strategy can be achieved with synchronized cardioversion or AAD medications like amiodarone; however, close monitoring with caution is recommended with the use of amiodarone in patients undergoing treatment with fingolimod. Propafenone or flecainide is preferred in structurally normal hearts who are on fingolimod (

 <sub>2</sub>-VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack or thromboembolism, vascular disease, age 65–74 years, sex category) score may underestimate risk of stroke. Myocardial injury should be considered if new onset LV dysfunction is noted on TTE, which would necessitate escalation of immunosuppressants in patients with myocarditis (

Data suggest that COVID-19 infection can be associated with a hypercoagulable state that might increase the risk for thromboembolism, especially in patients with markedly elevated D-dimer levels and severely ill patients admitted in the ICU (
