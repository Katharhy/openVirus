<p id="para0002">Harm reduction aims to reduce the negative consequences of drug use while respecting autonomy and acknowledging the social contributors to drug use. While strong evidence supports the use of harm reduction interventions including syringe exchange programs (SEPs), MOUD, naloxone distribution, and HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis, most remain inaccessible to incarcerated people in the US. Prisons elsewhere, however, have implemented many efficacious programs to reduce the harms of untreated SUD and ongoing IDU among incarcerated people. A WHO report evaluating the effectiveness of HIV interventions in prisons cites numerous successful examples of prison-based harm reduction dating back to 1992 
 <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The earliest prison-based SEP began in Switzerland and quickly decreased transmission of HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. Prison-based SEPs have since been initiated in &gt;60 countries with additional successful outcomes: prisons with SEPs in Germany and Spain, for example, reported no cases of HIV/HCV seroconversion among incarcerated people, strongly reduced needle sharing, and demonstrated no increases in drug use. In Australia, Canada, Iran, and throughout Europe, many prisons offering MOUD have noted improved prison safety, decreased rates of recidivism and reincarceration, and reduced injection drug use, needle sharing, and mortality. Lastly, in countries such as Canada, Australia, Brazil, South Africa, Iran, and Indonesia, prisons widely offer condoms, lubricant, and dental dams to reduce the risk of HIV/HCV sexual transmission; none of these prisons have reversed their policy nor have they reported any unfavorable outcomes or security issues 
 <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In the US, access to harm reduction, even outside the prison system, is limited. North American Syringe Exchange Network data show seven states have no SEPs and 26 states have â‰¤5 SEPs, leaving much of the population without access to sterile injection equipment. In US prisons, there are no SEPs and limited access to MOUD and condoms, leaving thousands of incarcerated people at elevated risk of drug use-associated morbidity and mortality.
