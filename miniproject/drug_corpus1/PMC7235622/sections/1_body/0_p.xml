<p id="para0001">The United States (US) has the highest incarceration rate in the world at 860 per 100,000 adults 
 <xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Incarcerated people have a high prevalence of chronic medical conditions, including substance use disorder (SUD)—present in 65% of people incarcerated in the US—and chronic viral infections 
 <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among incarcerated people in the US is three times higher than the general population and, each year, one in seven people living with HIV will be incarcerated 
 <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Additionally, one-third of the 20,00,000+ incarcerated Americans have hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection—and many are unaware of their diagnosis 
 <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Despite high rates of addiction-associated and injection drug use (IDU)-associated infectious diseases, only 11% of incarcerated people receive any addiction treatment while in prison, jail, or other correctional facilities (hereafter all referred to as “prison”) 
 <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Many people receiving evidence-based medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) have these discontinued upon entering prison; in turn, unavailable addiction treatment and sterile syringes contribute to riskier drug use, like sharing/reusing syringes 
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Together, chronic viral infections, untreated SUD, and syringe sharing among incarcerated people coalesce to drive the substance use and infectious disease syndemic; in US prisons, harm reduction is an essential intervention.
