<p id="para0004">There are no insurmountable barriers to the implementation of harm reduction services in US prisons. No federal law prohibits the provision of sterile injection equipment to incarcerated people. Most of the resistance to SEPs lies in unsubstantiated fears that they encourage drug use and could lead to syringe-associated violence against guards. In reality, there is no evidence to show that SEPs increase drug use; instead, they lead to engagement with the healthcare system and can facilitate entry into SUD treatment 
 <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Among all international prison-based SEPs, no cases of syringe-associated violence have been reported; instead, prison staff report feeling more protected from infection after the institution of SEPs 
 <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Furthermore, every dollar spent on SEPs returns $4 in healthcare savings and every dollar spent on MOUD can return $12 in total savings, accounting for both the cost of drug-related crime and healthcare delivery 
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. While the cultural barriers to prison-based SEPs are formidable, harm reduction interventions are uniformly beneficial and cost-effective.
