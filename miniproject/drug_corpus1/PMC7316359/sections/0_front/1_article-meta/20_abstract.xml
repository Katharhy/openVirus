 <p>Three influenza viruses, A(H1N1), A(H3N2) and B currently co-circulate in humans and cause severe epidemics. Their continuous evolution and ecological interactions shape transmission dynamics and are thus crucial for devising public health interventions (e.g., vaccine development and epidemic prediction). Here we develop a model-inference system and apply it to estimate these characteristics from incidence data collected in Hong Kong since 1998. We are able to estimate timings of punctuated surges in population susceptibility following antigenic innovations, consistent with genomic/antigenic analyses. We also find key ecological interactions and intricate balance that allow the three influenza viruses to co-circulate. Our model-inference system only requires (sub)typed incidence data, commonly collected in routine surveillance, and thus could be adapted to study influenza transmission worldwide.</p>
