  <title>Epidemic and co-circulation patterns under different strengths of cross-immunity.</title>
  <p>Box and whisker plots show the distributions across 1000 simulations for each cross-immunity scenario: scenario 1 as estimated in green; scenario 2 with stronger cross-immunity from A(H3N2) against A(H1N1) in orange; and scenario 3 with no cross-immunity in grey. Horizontal thick black lines show the median; box edges show the 25
   <sup>th</sup> and 75
   <sup>th</sup> percentiles; the whiskers show the full ranges and dots show outliers. Red segments show the corresponding observations in Hong Kong.
