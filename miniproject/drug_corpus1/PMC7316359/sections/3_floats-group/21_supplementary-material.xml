  <title>Schematic of the multi-strain SIRS model.</title>
  <p>Thick solid black arrows show the epidemic dynamics for each of the three influenza viruses (H1, H3, or B): susceptible (
   <italic>S</italic>) individuals can get infected and move to being infectious (
   <italic>I</italic>), who subsequently recover (
   <italic>R</italic>) from the infection; due to warning immunity and influenza virus evolution, recovered individuals can lose prior immunity and return to being susceptible. While the infection processes for each virus happen independently (hence the three separate panels for the three viruses), interactions (thin dashed black arrows) among the three viruses can occur via cross-immune protection, which convert new infections by other viruses to a loss of susceptibility (thin solid black arrows). Demographic processes (birth and death) are shown by the thin solid grey arrows. See the main text for model equations and parameter notations.
