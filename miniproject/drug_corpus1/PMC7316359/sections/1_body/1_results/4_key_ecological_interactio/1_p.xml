<p>The strength of cross-immunity may modulate the ecological completion among co-circulating influenza viruses. Here we estimated the pair-wise cross-immunity strength, relative to specific-immunity from the same type/subtype (

 </sub>) and cross-immunity appears to be weaker from types/subtypes with higher mutation rates. In particular, among all virus-pairs, cross-immunity was the weakest when gained from infection of A(H3N2) (the mean was 17% of the strength of specific-immunity against A(H1N1) and 11% against B). Second, as expected, homotypic- is stronger than heterotypic cross-immunity. Among all virus-pairs, cross-immunity from A(H1N1) against A(H3N2) was the strongest (40%; 23–56%). Third, cross-immunity appears to mediate ecologic competition among the three influenza types/subtypes, with B "controlling" A(H1N1) and the latter further "controlling" A(H3N2). Specifically, the second strongest cross-immunity was from B against A(H1N1) (32%; 26–40%); this, along with the strong cross-immunity from A(H1N1) against A(H3N2), formed a control cascade of B → A(H1N1) → A(H3N2). The higher mutation rate of A(H3N2) virus [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007989.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] then allowed it to escape prior immunity including cross-reactive ones from A(H1N1) and B. On the other hand, cross-immunity from A(H1N1) against B (23%; 19–32%) was comparable to the reverse, allowing the two viruses to maintain a more balanced bidirectional ecologic competition.
