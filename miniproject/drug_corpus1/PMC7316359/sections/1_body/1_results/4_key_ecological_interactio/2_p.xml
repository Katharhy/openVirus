<p>As our estimates that cross-immunity from A(H1N1) against A(H3N2) is stronger than the reverse appeared to contradict previous notion that A(H3N2) outcompetes A(H1N1) (see, e.g., [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007989.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]), we further used model-simulation to test the long-term impact of cross-immunity under three different scenarios: 1) As estimated here, i.e., setting all cross-immunity terms to the posterior mean estimates; 2) A(H3N2) outcompeting A(H1N1) via stronger cross-immunity, for which we set

 </sub>); and 3) No interactions, i.e., setting all cross-immunity terms to 0 (see details in

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007989.s014">S10</xref> Figs). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007989.s015">S11 Fig</xref>, scenario 1 most closely reproduced the observed pattern of co-circulation. In contrast, scenario 2 (i.e., A(H3N2) outcompeting A(H1N1)) largely underestimated the frequency of A(H1N1) epidemics, whereas scenario 3 (i.e., no cross-immunity) largely overestimated the frequency of co-epidemics caused by multiple types/subtypes.
