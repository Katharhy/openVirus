<p>During Jan 1998â€“July 2018 (~20 years), there were 17 A(H1N1), 21 A(H3N2), and 18 B epidemics, respectively (or 13, 19 and 14, respectively, if only counting larger epidemics; see

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007989.g001">Fig 1</xref> shows the superimposed annual cycle for each influenza type/subtype in Hong Kong during the study period and the average cycle excluding 2009 for the A(H1N1) pandemic in that year. All three types/subtypes were able to circulate any time in the year. Epidemics of A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) occurred in both winter and summer with similar magnitudes (
