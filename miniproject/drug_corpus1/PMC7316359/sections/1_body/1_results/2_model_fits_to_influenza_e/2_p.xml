<p>In addition to running the model continuously without re-initiation to correct for model errors, we included a continuous seeding at a constant rate of 1 case per 100,000 population per 10 days for all types/subtypes. This epidemic seeding represents travel-related importation of cases into local population, since Hong Kong is a transportation hub highly connected to places worldwide. This seeding is also designed to test the accuracy of estimates of key model state variables and parameters, as they are intricately linked to the infection rate. Foremost, overestimation of population susceptibility would lead to overestimation of cases during non-epidemic periods, as the seeded cases would lead to an epidemic should the effective reproductive number

 </sub> times population susceptibility) be above unity and sustain so. Conversely, underestimation of susceptibility would lead to underestimation of cases during epidemic periods or require unrealistically frequent antigenic changes prior to an epidemic. Further, population susceptibility is also linked to the duration of immunity and the strength of cross-immunity. Loss of immunity (determined by the immunity period) replenishes the susceptible pool whereas gaining of cross-immunity from infection by other types/subtypes (determined by the strength of cross-immunity) can reduce susceptibility. As such, estimates of these related parameters should also be accurate in order to achieve accurate estimation of infection rate. Taken together, the accurate infection rate estimates suggest that the model-inference system was also able to accurately estimate key state variables and parameters.
