 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007989.g002">Fig 2</xref> shows the model-fits to the epidemic curves of the three influenza types/subtypes. Despite the highly irregular epidemic timing and intensity, the model-inference system, run continuously through the entire 20-year study period, was able to recreate the observed epidemic dynamics for all three types/subtypes. Distributions of residuals were centered at 0, indicating no systematic biases of the model (

In addition, the model-inference system was able to accurately estimate the infection rates during both epidemic and non-epidemic periods for all types/subtypes. In particular, over the 20-year study period, epidemics of A(H1N1) were less frequent compared to the other two types/subtypes. For instance, few A(H1N1) cases were reported during Jan 1998 –Dec 1999 (the entire 2-year period) and May 2002 –Dec 2004 (the entire 2.5-year period). While
