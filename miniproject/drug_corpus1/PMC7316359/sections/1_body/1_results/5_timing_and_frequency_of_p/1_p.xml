<p>Analyses of the antigenic evolution of influenza have shown that major antigenic changes occur in a punctuated fashion, allowing substantial increases in population susceptibility and in turn surge of influenza epidemic [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007989.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. To capture such punctuated antigenic changes, our model-inference system allowed abrupt increases in population susceptibility in response to unexpected epidemic surges that are potentially due to major antigenic evolution in the influenza virus. We then used the major increases in population susceptibility (i.e., &gt;15% increase relative to the preceding week; results using 10% as cutoff are consistent; see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007989.s002">S1 Table</xref>) to identify potential punctuated antigenic changes. Over the 20-year study period, we detected such major changes in population susceptibility 7 times for A(H1N1), including two due to the 2009 pandemic (

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007989.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the estimated timing of each potential antigenic innovation. Based on these estimates, punctuated antigenic changes occurred every 4.6 (SD = 4.6; exponential distribution) years in A(H1N1) (excluding the 2009 pandemic), 1.8 (SD = 1.2; gamma distribution) years in A(H3N2), and 6.2 (SD = 6.2; exponential distribution) years in B during Jan 1998 â€“July 2018. These results are consistent with reported estimates based on antigenic testing of influenza virus isolates [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007989.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Further, interestingly, for A(H3N2), such potential antigenic innovations occurred with comparable frequencies in both summers (7 times in May, June or July) and winters (5 times in Jan or Feb) during the 20-year study period. In contrast, it occurred mostly in winters for A(H1N1) and only in winters for B.
