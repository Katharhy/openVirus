<p>The length of immunity period determines the duration of immune protection from prior infection and is thus a key epidemiological parameter shaping the long-term dynamics of influenza epidemics. However, it remains difficult to estimate due to the complex nature of immunogenicity and lack of detail, longitudinal serological data [

These estimates accounted for cross-immunity from infections of other types/subtypes, for which, after conversion based on the strength of cross-immunity, was treated the same as specific-immunity from the same type/subtype (see
