 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007989.s011">S7 Fig</xref> (infectious period, immunity period, and cross-immunity). During Jan 1998 –July 2018, estimated population susceptibility was higher for A(H1N1) and B than A(H3N2) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007989.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The mean levels and ranges were 66.6% (range: 50.9–90.3%) for A(H1N1), 60.8% (46.4–89.0%) for A(H3N2), and 68.6% (50.6–87.8%) for B, respectively. These estimates were consistent with the relative infection rates of individual types/subtypes. Note, however, due to stringent public health interventions (i.e., case isolation, contact tracing, and school closure) implemented from early May to mid-July 2009 [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007989.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and self-protection (e.g., improved personal hygiene and social distancing) during that time [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007989.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], the pandemic in Hong Kong unfolded relatively slowly and estimated population susceptibility at the beginning of the 2009 pandemic was relatively low (~71% in mid-July;
