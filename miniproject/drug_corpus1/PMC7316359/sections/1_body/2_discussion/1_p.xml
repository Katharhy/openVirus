<p>Cross-immunity among different influenza viruses has been reported and its resulting potential interactions have been modeled; however, to date, its strength and impact on influenza transmission dynamics at the population level remains unclear. Utilizing a long-term incidence surveillance dataset in Hong Kong since 1998, here we have quantified the strength of cross-immunity among the two influenza A subtypes and B currently co-circulating in humans and the pattern of viral interactions. We have also estimated the timing and frequency of punctuated surges in population susceptibility representing population-level response to antigenic innovations in influenza viruses over the last 20 years as well as identified key variations among three influenza types/subtypes. These estimates, along with other key epidemiological variable estimates including the population susceptibility and basic reproductive number, provide great insight into the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of influenza.</p>
