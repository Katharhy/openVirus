<p>In summary, using a comprehensive model-inference system, we have revealed in great detail the epidemiological interactions among the three influenza types/subtypes, the antigenic innovations for each type/subtype, and their combined impact on the transmission dynamics of influenza over the last two decades in Hong Kong, a city of global public health significance for influenza epidemic and pandemic control. The intricate epidemiological interactions among influenza viruses and key underlying population features underscore the importance of monitoring population immunity to different influenza viruses, incidence rates, and viral genetic and antigenic changes. Meanwhile, the model-inference system developed here has proven powerful for estimating key evolutionary and epidemiological characteristics of influenza viruses based on type/subtype-specific incidence data and could be extended to study influenza epidemic dynamics in other regions with limited antigenic data.</p>
