<p>Unlike previous analyses of genomic and/or antigenic data, here we tentatively estimate the timing and frequency of punctuated antigenic innovations based on incidence data alone. The rationale is that punctuated antigenic innovations in influenza viruses would lead to surge in population susceptibility and subsequently surge in incidence. That is, incidence data encapsulate the population response to antigenic innovations and thus may complement analyses of genomic and/or antigenic data (note the latter do not provide information as to if an antigenic mutation would lead to an epidemic). Indeed, our results are consistent with estimates from phylogenetic analyses. For instance, the two surges in susceptibility to A(H1N1) during the 2009 pandemic (i.e., around 9/13/09 and 1/5/10; 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007989.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) roughly matched with the estimated timings of amino acid mutations from NextStrain [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007989.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]: 1) HA1: S185T and HA2: S124N around 10/1/09 (CI: 7/26/09-1/16/10) and 2) HA1: D97N round 10/30/09 (CI: 09/03/09-02/07/10). In addition, previous studies estimated that punctuated antigenic innovations occur roughly every 2 to 8 years in A(H3N2) [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007989.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], 4 to 9 years in A(H1N1), and 3 to 14 years in B [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007989.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], based on antigenic analysis of influenza virus isolates. Consistently, we estimate that antigenic innovations occurred very 4.6±4.6 years in A(H1N1), every 1.8±1.2 years in A(H3N2), and every 6.2±6.2 years in B during Jan 1998–July 2018. These consistent results suggest incidence surveillance data could be an inexpensive alternative to support detection of evolutionary changes in influenza viruses, especially since these estimates reflect changes in population immunity in response to antigenic innovations and thus the potential of epidemic surge.
