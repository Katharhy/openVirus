<p>Our study has several limitations. First, as B lineage data were only available since 2014 in Hong Kong, in this study, we did not differentiate the two B lineages (i.e. Yamagata and Victoria). Future work will extend the model-inference system to include and test the epidemiological interactions with the two B lineages. Second, while using the empirical seasonal cycle to account for the epidemic seasonality in Hong Kong has proven critical in this study and may be applied to other subtropical and tropical regions with similar diverse epidemics, better delineation of influenza seasonality in these climates is needed. Third, we assumed that the probability of seeking medical attention for influenza is comparable to other illnesses and, for simplicity, we did not consider the differences in health seeking behavior among patients infected by different influenza (sub)types. Based on this assumption, the estimated annual attack rates ranged from 13% in 2013 to 42% in 2005. There is large uncertainty in estimated influenza attack rates. Recent estimates ranged from 3–11%

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007989.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]). It could also be due to overestimation of A(H3N2) incidence rates, as patients infected with A(H3N2) may be more likely to seek treatment due to more severe symptoms compared to A(H1N1) and B. Further, while we calibrated the incidence rates of A(H1N1) during the 2009 pandemic to the estimated attack rate from serological data (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec012">Methods</xref>), our model-inference system did not include public health interventions implemented particularly at the beginning of the pandemic. As a result, our model-inference system—entirely based on incidence data—likely underestimated the increase in susceptibility at the onset of the pandemic. Nevertheless, the estimated timing of antigenic innovations (6 July 2019) was very close to the observed onset of the pandemic in Hong Kong (30 June 2019 [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007989.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]). Fourth, while our study has demonstrated the utility of incidence data for inference of antigenic change, we note that the estimated timing of surges in population immunity in HK may not necessarily match the timing of the first emergence of antigenic change; discrepancies may be due to a delay in antigenic variants arriving and taking off locally. Finally, due to a lack of age-specific incidence data and for simplicity, we did not include age structure in our model. Recent studies have reported differences in immune imprinting in children compared to adults [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007989.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Future work may investigate such age differences further should age-specific incidence data become available.
