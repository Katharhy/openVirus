<p>In addition, we note the different seasonal timing of antigenic innovations for A(H3N2). While the identified antigenic innovations predominantly occurred in winters for A(H1N1) and B, we find that A(H3N2) could undergo major antigenic changes in both summers and winters. Further investigation is warranted, as, if confirmed, this seasonality suggests that sampling A(H3N2) strains in the summer may be essential for selection of vaccine strains.</p>
