<p>Multiple lines of evidence have suggested cross protection offered by infection of influenza viruses of the same type/subtype as well as across types/subtypes [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007989.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. As noted by authors of those studies, the cross-sectional serological surveys used therein may miss the window of cross-immunity and/or immunity mechanisms not related to antibodies against the hemagglutinin surface protein (e.g., from T cells mediated immunity). In this study, based on the long-term type/subtype-specific incidence data, we estimate that there were relatively strong cross-immunity against A(H3N2) by infection of A(H1N1) (~40% of the specific-immunity) and moderate level of cross-immunity between A(H1N1) and B (20–30%). Consistently, our simulations showed that interactions among the three types/subtypes are needed to produce the pattern of co-circulation observed in Hong Kong (
