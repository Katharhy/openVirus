<p>However, our estimates of weak cross-immunities to A(H1N1) and B conferred by infection of A(H3N2) appear to contradict the common notion that A(H3N2) outcompetes A(H1N1) and B and, as a result, causes more frequent and larger epidemics. For instance, Goldstein et al. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007989.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] showed a negative correlation between early A(H3N2) incidence and subsequent non-A(H3N2) incidence in the same season, suggesting A(H3N2) may interfere with the other two types/subtypes. To test this discrepancy, we simulated epidemics under both scenarios and showed that combining the frequent and large epidemics of A(H3N2) with stronger cross-immunity conferred would likely drive A(H1N1) to extinction (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007989.s013">S9 Fig</xref>; note epidemics of A(H1N1) were only possible after the imposed antigenic innovations). Conversely, the strong cross-immunity from A(H1N1) against A(H3N2), as estimated in this study, is consistent with the predominant circulation of A(H1N1) during the 2009 pandemic despite the frequent circulation of A(H3N2) during inter-pandemic seasons.
