<p>Thus, to understand the co-circulation pattern of influenza viruses, we need to take into account other key epidemiological features. In particular, A(H3N2) confers shorter immunity following infection and also undergoes more frequent genetic/antigenic mutations. Based on the estimated mean immunity period and implicit assumption of exponential distribution in the model (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1007989.e003">Eq 1</xref>), the mean half-life of immunity (i.e. ln2 times of the mean) was 1.6 years for A(H3N2), 2.2 years for A(H1N1), and 2.1 years for B. Note our estimates were shorter than reported elsewhere (e.g., 3.5 to 7 years in [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007989.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]), likely because, unlike those studies based on titers of antibodies against specific strains, our estimates broadly applied to the entire type/subtype. Nevertheless, the relative lengths of immunity period for the three influenza types/subtypes were consistent. A recent cohort-specific analysis [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007989.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] further showed that birth-cohorts whose first exposure was A(H1N1) had long-term protection against subsequent infection by the same subtype whereas those first exposed to A(H3N2) did not (See Table 4 in ref [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007989.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]). It is thus likely that A(H3N2) virusâ€™ shorter/weaker immunity and more frequent mutations lead to more frequent A(H3N2) epidemics, and that combining its larger epidemic size and weaker cross-immunity (roughly, the product of these two factors is the decrease in susceptibility to its complement types/subtypes) allows the two less frequently circulating influenza types/subtypes to coexist in humans.
