<p>The Centre for Health Protection in Hong Kong monitors seasonal influenza activity through a sentinel surveillance network of approximately 50 private-sector outpatient clinics that report weekly proportion of outpatients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI; defined as fever &gt;38.0°C plus cough and/or sore throat) [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007989.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In addition, the Public Health Laboratory Services Branch thereof conducts laboratory testing for influenza viruses in samples submitted mainly from local hospitals and also a small number of samples submitted by the sentinel outpatient physicians. We obtained weekly records of ILI consultation rate and concurrent (sub)type-specific influenza detection rate from the week ending 04 Jan 1998 to the week ending 14 July 2018. To obtain a more specific measure of the incidence of influenza virus infections in the community, we multiplied the weekly ILI rate by the concurrent viral isolation rate for A(H1N1), A(H3N2) and B, respectively [
