<p>The priors for initiating the SR-IF2 were uniform distributions as follows: 
 <italic>S</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>~U[50%, 90%] of total population and 
 <italic>D</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>~U[2, 4] days for 
 <italic>i</italic> = A(H1N1), A(H3N2), or B. To account for seasonality of each (sub)type, the prior of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub> for week 
 <italic>t</italic> of the year was drawn from a uniform distribution with a range of the mean empirical estimate for that week plus/minus one standard deviation. Correspondingly, the prior of transmission rate 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> for week 
 <italic>t</italic> of the year was then computed as 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>,
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>t</italic>)/
 <italic>D</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>t</italic>). For the immunity period 
 <italic>L</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>, given the wide range reported in the literature (from months to ~8 years [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007989.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007989.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]), we tested prior ranges from 1 to 9 years, divided into four 2-year segments (i.e., [1, 3], [3, 5], [5, 7], and [7, 9] years) for each type/subtype; this resulted in 4
 <sup>3</sup> = 64 combinations for the three type/subtypes. Cross-immunity has been observed for influenza strains of the same subtype as well as across types/subtypes [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007989.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007989.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and types [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007989.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007989.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; however, the strength has rarely been reported. We thus tested prior ranges from 0% to 80% of the strength of specific immunity, divided into two levels: [0%, 40%] (low) and [40%, 80%] (high); this resulted in 2
 <sup>6</sup> = 64 combinations for 6 virus-pairs (
 <italic>c</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>ij</italic>
 </sub>, 
 <italic>i</italic> = H1N1, H3N2, or B and 
 <italic>j</italic>≠
 <italic>i</italic>). To reduce the number of combinations, 
 <italic>a priori</italic>, we further assumed that heterotypic cross-immunity is low especially when the immunity period (
 <italic>L</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>) is long; thus, for 
 <italic>L</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>&gt;5 years, we only included combinations with low A(H1N1) (or H3N2) and B interactions. Note, however, with perturbations in the IF2 procedure, the posterior estimates can go outside the prior range. Together, we tested a total of 736 combinations of 
 <italic>L</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> and 
 <italic>c</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>ij</italic>
 </sub> priors in the first round of search. We then selected the top ~1% runs with the best model-fits (highest likelihood 
 <italic>and</italic> fewest space re-probing needed) and used their posterior estimates to compute the prior range for subsequent round of search. We repeated this process until the parameters converge. It took two rounds for the synthetic data and three rounds for the observed data.
