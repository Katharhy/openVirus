<p>While the original IF2 incorporates perturbations of model parameters, our preliminary tests showed that these perturbations alone are insufficient to capture the unexpected surges in population susceptibility due to potential punctuated antigenic changes in the influenza virus. To tackle this issue, we further incorporated space re-probing (SR) in the IF2 (see algorithm in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007989.s004">S3 Table</xref>). Briefly, the SR step allows a small fraction (here 1%) of the model ensemble to sample from the full prior range for key model variables/parameters (here, the susceptibility), whenever filter divergence is detected (i.e., the likelihood drops below a threshold); in addition, to capture other possible changes in parameters related to the virus (e.g.,

 </sub> and strength cross-immunity), we set time points requiring SR as break-points, for which larger perturbations are applied to all model parameters/variables [
