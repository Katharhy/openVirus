<p>For each SR-IF2 model-inference run, we performed 50 iterations of filtering with 5000 particles. Each run took round 8 to 10 hours to complete on a high-performance cluster (

To account for stochasticity in model initiation, we performed 5 runs for each prior in the first round and 50 runs in the second and third round (i.e., final round for the observed data). From the final round, we selected ~10 runs with the best model-fits (highest likelihood
