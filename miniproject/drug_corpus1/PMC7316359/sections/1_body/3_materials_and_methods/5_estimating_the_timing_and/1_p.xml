<p>To identify potential punctuated antigenic changes for each (sub)type, we computed the changes in susceptibility for each week and considered weeks with a relative 
 <italic>increase</italic> of 15% due to punctuated antigenic changes. We also tested a cutoff of 10%, for which the identified weeks were the same except for 2 additional weeks for A(H3N2) (1/10/1998 and 6/13/1999) and 1 for B (1/28/2001); these additional weeks were all in the early phase of the study period and thus likely due to greater uncertainty in the model-inference system.
