<p>To estimate the mean time interval between punctuated antigenic changes, we computed the time intervals between subsequent antigenic changes (right censored for the last observation) and fitted these to four survival models (i.e., the exponential, Weibull, gamma, and log-normal distribution) using the ‘flexsurv’ package [
