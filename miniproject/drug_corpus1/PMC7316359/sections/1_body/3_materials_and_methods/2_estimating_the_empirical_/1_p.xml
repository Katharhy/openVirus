<p>As discussed in the Introduction, the seasonality of influenza epidemics in Hong Kong is weaker than in temperate locations. To model this seasonality, we first computed the weekly average of incidence rate over the study period, excluding year 2009 during which seasonality may be altered due to the A(H1N1) pandemic. We then estimated the time-varying

 </sub> for each week of the year using a model-inference system we previously developed for Hong Kong [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007989.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This system used a basic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model and ran it with a particle filter with space re-probing. We further smoothed the posterior estimates of
