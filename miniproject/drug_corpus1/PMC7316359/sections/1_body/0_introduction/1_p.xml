<p>Influenza epidemics recur annually in many regions of the world and cause significant morbidity and mortality, leading to 3 to 5 million severe infections and 291,000 to 646,000 deaths worldwide each year [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007989.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These recurrent epidemics are a combined outcome of viral antigenic changes, interactions among co-circulating influenza viruses, transmission and host immune response. Influenza viruses undergo continual genetic mutations and punctuated antigenic changes, which allow them to escape prior immunity and cause new epidemics [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007989.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition, currently two influenza A subtypes, A(H1N1) and A(H3N2), and influenza B co-circulate in humans; and infection of a certain type/subtype can result in partial immunity to influenza strains of the same type/subtype as well as strains across subtypes [
