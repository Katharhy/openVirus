<p>Here we apply the validated model-inference system to the Hong Kong dataset and infer how major antigenic evolution and cross-immunity affect influenza transmission dynamics therein over the last 20 years. Our results reveal intricate ecological interactions among the three co-circulating influenza types/subtypes and their impacts on long-term influenza epidemic dynamics.</p>
