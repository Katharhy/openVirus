<p>As observed epidemic dynamics are the result of the aforementioned key evolutionary and epidemiological processes, in this study, we utilized a long-term influenza incidence surveillance dataset collected in Hong Kong since 1998 to estimate the timing of punctuated antigenic changes, strength of cross-immunity, duration of immunity, as well as other key epidemiological parameters for each of the three types/subtypes. Hong Kong is a subtropical city located in Southeast Asia. Unlike the highly seasonal epidemics in temperate regions, in the subtropics and tropics, influenza epidemics can occur at any time of the year [

The long-term Hong Kong dataset with diverse epidemics thus provides a unique opportunity to study the interplay of different influenza types/subtypes at the population level.
