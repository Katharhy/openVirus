<p id="p0040">Now once again, a pandemic is enveloping the globe. Although not yet as devastating as the Black Death that confronted Guy de Chauliac, COVID-19 has nevertheless sickened millions and killed over two hundred thousand people worldwide at the time of this writing. We surgeons can learn from our predecessors who lived through earlier epidemics and emulate their example of not just caring for patients but also leading campaigns to understand and manage the disease. National organizations have commendably stepped forward. The American College of Surgeons as well as other surgical societies have provided leadership and guidance regarding the practice of emergency surgery as well as delineating how to manage clinical workflow under present conditions. As an example, the College has launched a program coordinating the distribution of volunteer surgeons to areas of need. Surgery journals are publishing articles to inform the community of the signs and symptoms of the disease, including appropriate management strategies for sickened patients and guidelines regarding elective practice.

These studies will most certainly yield important insights into surgical and medical outcomes in affected cohorts (e.g. the UK National Institute for Health Research Global Health Research Institute:

Moreover, intensivists including trauma and critical care surgeons are at the forefront of translational studies to understand the biology of the disease, improving both therapeutics and prevention.
