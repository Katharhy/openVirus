 </xref> In the United States, typhoid tore through military camps hastily erected to house soldiers in the Spanish American War. US Army Surgeon Walter Reed, collaborating with Victor Vaughn and Edward Shakespeare, determined the unsanitary conditions that promulgated the disease. Reed later left for Cuba to address the yellow fever epidemic decimating American soldiers. Building on the research of Carlos Finlay, Reed and his team performed a series of controlled experiments to examine various possibilities of transmission. In conducting these tests, he utilized one of the first examples of written informed consents (in English and Spanish), advancing medical ethics along with epidemiology. By 1900, he had concluded that a mosquito transferred the disease, enabling successful public health measures to protect against this lethal virus.
