<p id="p0025">Sweeping throughout Europe in 1348, the bubonic plague killed an estimated one-third of the population, demolished the agrarian economy, and reconfigured the international political infrastructure for the next several centuries. Guy de Chauliac, known by historians as the “father of western surgery,” practiced amidst the Black Death. Trained in both medicine and surgery in an era when the specialties were in conflict, Guy strove to unite the two fields by providing surgery with a theoretical foundation that elevated it from its association with handicrafts.

 </xref> By 1348, he had achieved significant professional success, exemplified by his position as physician to the Papal Court. Present for the onset of the bubonic plague and the calamitous effects it had on society, he remained to minister to his patients, including Pope Clement VI. Guy eventually contracted the disease, surviving only through “god’s will.” He published extensively on this experience, recording the clinical and cultural consequences of the plague. Through his writings, this surgeon emerged as the contemporary authority on the condition, shaping scientific understanding of bubonic plague and medical responses to it for decades.
