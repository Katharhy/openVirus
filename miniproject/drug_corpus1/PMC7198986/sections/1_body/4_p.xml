<p id="p0045">What more can we surgeons contribute, particularly in this era of hyper-specialization? How can we move beyond surgery-based projects and expand to the levels of engagement that Guy, Lind, Snow, and Reed exemplified? While Hunterâ€™s example of self-inoculation ought not be replicated, the opportunities that the COVID-19 pandemic presents must be seized to think more broadly and creatively. Immunology-focused transplant labs could pivot towards vaccine research, while those conducting virology or pharmaceutical experiments must redouble their efforts towards identifying and testing novel drug therapies. Similarly, teams examining health disparities should harness this opportunity to implement innovative initiatives to provide remote care to rural and underserved communities and to redress deep-seated inequities of health care delivery at an international scale, refocusing on the social determinants of health.
