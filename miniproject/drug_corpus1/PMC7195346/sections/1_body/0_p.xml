<p id="para10">The speed and scope of detection of an infectious disease, in particular, timely identification and reporting of a new pathogen, is a major indicator of a country's ability to control infectious diseases. Findings of the Global Health Security (GHS) index

  <sup>1</sup>
 </xref> suggest that only 19% of countries have the ability to quickly detect and report epidemics of potential international concern, fewer than 5% of countries can rapidly respond to and mitigate the spread of an epidemic, and no country is fully prepared for epidemics or pandemics. Experience with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) seems to have confirmed these findings.
