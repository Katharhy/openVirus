<p id="para30">Using Singapore as a reference (because of its perceived perfect case-detection), Niehus and colleagues estimated that the global capacity to detect imported cases of COVID-19 before Feb 4, 2020, was 38% (95% highest posterior density interval [HPDI] 22–64) of Singapore's capacity, and was, respectively, 40% (95% HPDI 22–67), 37% (18–68), and 11% (0–42) of Singapore's capacity among countries with a high, medium, and low surveillance capacity, according to the GHS index.

 </xref> This finding indicates that about 2·8 (95% HPDI 1·5–4·4) times current reported imported cases should have been detected if all countries had Singapore's detection capabilities. The ratio of detected to undetected cases (1:1·8, 95% HPDI 0·5–3·4) indicates that about 64% of imported cases have not been detected.
