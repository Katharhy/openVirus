<p id="para40">Based on imported cases aggregated by location, air travel volume, and GHS index for detection and reporting, Niehus and colleagues inferred that total COVID-19 cases in Wuhan have been underestimated by 70% based on the relatively lower prevalence of visitors who stayed for 7 days in Wuhan and underdetection capacity, and by 81% for 3-day visitors. This percentage is probably the lower bound since detection capacity was estimated relative to that in Singapore, which was probably not 100% efficient.

 </xref> The relatively lower prevalence of COVID-19 among short-term visitors compared with residents of Wuhan has contributed to the underestimation.
