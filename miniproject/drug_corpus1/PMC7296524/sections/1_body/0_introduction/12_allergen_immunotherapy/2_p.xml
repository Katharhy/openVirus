 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. The possibility of increasing the duration of the intervals between the administration in the maintenance phase must be assessed on a case-by-case basis and can be useful when we do not want to expose the child or the family to an inconvenient transfer to reach our clinic or in case of recent contact with infected people. The administration of SLIT to the child or adolescent at home makes it very advantageous to avoid contact with potentially infected people [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Interrupting SLIT is never recommended, except in this case, there have been recent contacts with infected people or even mild, but suggestive symptoms of viral infection are present. Clinically, these results are manifested in better control of the allergic rhinitis symptoms and, especially, in asthma prevention, which could be confused with symptoms of viral infection. Moreover, AIT determines a decrease in the medication use (corticosteroids and inhaled therapy) that could reduce the risk of spreading viral infections (like COVID-19) in other subjects and the possible worsening of a viral infection in the patient himself.
