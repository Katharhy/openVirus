<p id="Par62">Heparins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], mainly low molecular weight heparins, have been widely prescribed as an anticoagulant drug to treat complications of COVID-19 infection. The most common type of hypersensitivity reactions to low molecular weight heparins consists of the local delayed-type ones that may become widespread and occur in 7.5% of patients. Baboon syndrome, DRESS (drug rash occurring with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) syndrome, AGEP (acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis), and TEN (toxic epidermal necrolysis), are very uncommon. Immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions occur only sporadically. Cross-reactivity of different low molecular weight heparins is a common and unpredictable problem. Allergy tests can be used to identify safe alternative heparin.
