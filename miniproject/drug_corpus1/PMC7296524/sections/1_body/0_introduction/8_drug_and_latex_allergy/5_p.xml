In the case of Azithromycin hypersensitivity, an antibiotic of the same class (i.e., clarithromycin) can be safely used because of the low grade of cross-reactivity after ascertaining tolerance under medical surveillance. Hydroxychloroquine exposes some patients to the risk of rare but potentially fatal SCARs. Azithromycin and Hydroxychloroquine co-treatment can be safely performed after a cardiological evaluation due to the risks of QT prolongation. Tocilizumab is mostly associated with a local reaction in the injection site, but it has been reported a prevalence of 3.9% of moderate-severe systemic reactions [
