Subjects at risk for latex sensitization include children with atopic dermatitis, children with any other allergic disease, patients with spina bifida and genitourinary malformations, or other conditions with high exposure to latex products in early age. There is a risk also when hypoallergenic latex gloves are used since it means that the additive content is low.
