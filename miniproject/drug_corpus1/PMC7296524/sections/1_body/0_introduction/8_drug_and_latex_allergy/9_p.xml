<p id="Par65">Patients with latex allergy cannot use latex gloves. Caution is also advised in patients at risk of developing latex sensitization: children with atopic dermatitis, children with any other allergic disease, spina bifida patients, or other conditions with high exposure to latex products in early age. In all these cases, the use of latex-free gloves (i.e., PVC gloves) is suggested.</p>
