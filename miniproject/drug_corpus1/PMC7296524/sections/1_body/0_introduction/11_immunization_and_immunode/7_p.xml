<p id="Par83">Routine influenza immunization should be considered in all children during the 2020â€“2021 season to ensure protection measures for children and healthcare operators. Inactivated influenza vaccine should be likewise considered in all primary immunodeficiency (PID) patients unless medical contraindications exist or the patient is considered unable to mount an effective immunological response. Nonviable influenza vaccination is also strongly recommended in household contacts of PID patients.</p>
