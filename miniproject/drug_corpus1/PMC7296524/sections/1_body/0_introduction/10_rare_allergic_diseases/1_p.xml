<p id="Par73">In pediatric patients, with a history of systemic reactions to Hymenoptera venom not isolated to the skin, a timely evaluation should be carried out on time. Moreover, an adrenaline auto-injector should be promptly prescribed, and venom immunotherapy (VIT) should be punctually started if deemed required after an appropriate diagnostic workup. VIT should be continued during the COVID-19 pandemic in pediatric patients who are currently undergoing the treatment. According to an individual cost-benefit ratio, spacing the VIT doses may be considered in patients in the maintenance phase.</p>
