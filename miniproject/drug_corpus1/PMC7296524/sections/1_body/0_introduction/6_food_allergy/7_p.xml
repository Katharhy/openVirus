<p id="Par48">When children with FA need milk formulas introduction (soy formula, rice milk, hydrolysate formula) under medical supervision, the oral food challenge (OFC) should not be deferred [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A challenge should also be considered when a child is suspected of not tolerating the substitutive milk or is highly suspected of an allergy misdiagnosis resulting in an unnecessary elimination diet. In other situations (such as challenges to confirm presumed cross-reactivity or outgrown IgE-mediated FA), OFC should be re-scheduled. In the case of uncertain symptomatic ingestion, the reintroducing of food may be delayed, and telehealth services are an excellent alternative to face-to-face visits to evaluate these patients. Control visits at the office should be postponed unless severe systemic reactions suggesting a new food allergy is reported. Any new patient visit for an elimination diet trial may be delayed unless an IgE-mediated reaction, FPIES, or eosinophilic esophagitis are suspected. Priority should be given to patients suffering from recurrent idiopathic anaphylaxis.
