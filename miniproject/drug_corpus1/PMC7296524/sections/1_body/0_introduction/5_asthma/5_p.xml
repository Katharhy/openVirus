<p id="Par36">Avoid spirometry in patients with confirmed/suspected infection by COVID-19, since the execution of this test can spread the virus and expose all staff and other patients to the risk of infection. Therefore, postpone the respiratory function tests or perform them only in case of real necessity if the patients and caregivers do not present flu-like symptoms (fever, cough, and dyspnoea) carrying out the maneuvers in a condition of maximum control of a possible contagion (disposable filter, instrument sterilization, PPE equipment). Follow the measures of social distancing and personal hygiene, washing the hands thoroughly, always wearing PPE, as part of the health activity and rigorous infection control procedures if aerosol generation procedures are required (for example nebulization, oxygen therapy, also with nasal cannulas, manual ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, and intubation).</p>
