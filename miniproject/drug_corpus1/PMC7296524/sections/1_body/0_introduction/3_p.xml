<p id="Par27">As chronic diseases have been associated with more severe COVID-19, the need to define pragmatic recommendations has emerged. Therefore, the executive board of the Italian Society of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology (SIAIP) has considered appropriate to disseminate a document including a series of recommendations for the management of allergies and immunological diseases in children and adolescents. All SIAP Committees have provided Consensus Statements. The current document is oriented to physicians and caregivers involved in the care of children and adolescents with the most common allergic and immunologic disorders. The literature search considered a time frame starting from 2020 January up to the end of April. The recommendations are mainly based on principles as very few primary data are available at present.</p>
