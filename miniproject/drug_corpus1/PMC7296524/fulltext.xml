The world has had to face an unprecedented pandemic. Only, Spanish flu had similar disastrous consequences. As a result, drastic measures (lockdown) have been adopted worldwide. Healthcare service has been overwhelmed by the extraordinary influx of patients, often requiring high intensity of care. Mortality has been associated with severe comorbidities, including chronic diseases. Patients with frailty were, therefore, the victim of the SARS-COV-2 infection. Allergy and asthma are the most prevalent chronic disorders in children and adolescents, so they need careful attention and, if necessary, an adaptation of their regular treatment plans. Fortunately, at present, young people are less suffering from COVID-19, both as incidence and severity. However, any age, including infancy, could be affected by the pandemic.</p><p id="Par2">Based on this background, the Italian Society of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology has felt it necessary to provide a Consensus Statement. This expert panel consensus document offers a rationale to help guide decision-making in the management of children and adolescents with allergic or immunologic diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>Pandemic</kwd><kwd>Child</kwd><kwd>Adolescent</kwd><kwd>Allergy</kwd><kwd>Asthma</kwd><kwd>Immunologic disease</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par25">A novel coronavirus, SARS-COV-2, lead to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 burst in China and rapidly spread worldwide. Italy was the first European country to be interested in the pandemic. South Lombardy was the first cluster, then, COVID-19 disseminated across Italy.</p><p id="Par26">COVID-19 had an impressive impact on Medicine so that COVID-19 Medicine is a new term to define this topic. Thousands of papers are publishing, so the scientific community is addressed to the peculiar aspects of this infection. COVID-19 has pleiomorphic characteristics of presentation and severity. In particular, it has been reported that severe and lethal disease is associated with male gender, old age, and comorbidity. Fortunately, childhood seems to be preserved by severe COVID-19, and relatively few cases occurred still now. Every age may be affected, including infancy.</p><p id="Par27">As chronic diseases have been associated with more severe COVID-19, the need to define pragmatic recommendations has emerged. Therefore, the executive board of the Italian Society of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology (SIAIP) has considered appropriate to disseminate a document including a series of recommendations for the management of allergies and immunological diseases in children and adolescents. All SIAP Committees have provided Consensus Statements. The current document is oriented to physicians and caregivers involved in the care of children and adolescents with the most common allergic and immunologic disorders. The literature search considered a time frame starting from 2020 January up to the end of April. The recommendations are mainly based on principles as very few primary data are available at present.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Allergic rhinitis</title><p id="Par28">In the current state of knowledge, topical nasal corticosteroid therapy for allergic rhinitis in children and adolescents with COVID-19 can be continued at the recommended posology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">It is considered appropriate to continue treatment with antihistamine drugs regularly so as not to lose control of oculorhinitis symptoms in the seasonal period or due to the increased exposure to indoor allergens.</p><p id="Par30">The interruption of topical nasal corticosteroids is not recommended, which does not seem to reduce the immune system.
