<p id="Par18">The CoV genome encodes more than 20 proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] amongst these are two proteases, papain-like protease (PLpro) and 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), also known as the main protease (M
 <sup>pro</sup>), that are important for virus replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. They cleave two translated polyproteins (PP1A and PP1AB) into individual functional components. These proteases are considered promising drug targets, particularly 3CLpro, as all residues involved in the catalysis, substrate binding, and dimerization are 100% conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [
