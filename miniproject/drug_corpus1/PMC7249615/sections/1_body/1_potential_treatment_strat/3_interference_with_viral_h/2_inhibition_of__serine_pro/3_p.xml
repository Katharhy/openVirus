<p id="Par12">TMPRSS2 is known to harbor an androgen-responsive enhancer and is androgen-regulated, and thus, an alternative strategy, other than selectively inhibiting TMPRSS2, would be to modulate the expression of TMPRSS2 using androgen receptor-targeted therapies. Mikkonen et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] administered androgen (testosterone) to lung adenocarcinoma-derived A549 cells and witnessed approximately a twofold upregulation of the TMPRSS2 transcript, as well as androgen-dependent loading of androgen receptor onto the TMPRSS2 androgen-responsive enhancer. It is likely that androgen antagonists (antiandrogens) can, thus, downregulate TMPRSS2 expression and thereby reduce the severity of COVID-19. Commercially available antiandrogens include, but are not limited to bicalutamide, enzalutamide, apalutamide, flutamide, nilutamide, or darolutamide [
