<p id="Par13">Viral fusion and release of the genetic components are highly dependent on the endosomal pathway and particularly pH. Chloroquine (N4-(7-chloro-4-quinolinyl)-N1,N1-diethyl-1,4-pentanediamine), an FDA-approved drug, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] has been used to treat malaria for many years, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] as well as autoimmune diseases. Chloroquine is known to block virus infection by increasing endosomal pH required for virus/endosome fusion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and release of viral DNA or RNA into the cytosol. Moreover, chloroquine has immunomodulatory effects, suppressing the production/release of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], which may synergistically enhance its antiviral effect in vivo. It also works as a novel class of autophagy inhibitor, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] further interfering with viral infection and replication. A combination of remdesivir and chloroquine was proven to effectively inhibit the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been found to be efficient against SARS-CoV-2, and reported to be efficient in Chinese COVID-19 patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Chloroquine is easily available and relatively low in cost. Therefore, it is potentially clinically applicable against COVID-19. However, an overdose of chloroquine can cause acute poisoning and death [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. HCQ sulfate, a derivative of chloroquine, demonstrated much less (~ 40%) toxicity than chloroquine in animals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and is a good alternative. As of March 2020, seven clinical trial registries were found using HCQ sulfate in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (
