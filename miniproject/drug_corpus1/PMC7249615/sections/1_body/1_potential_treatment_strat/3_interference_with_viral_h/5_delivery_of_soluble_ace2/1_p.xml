<p id="Par15">Kuba et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] showed that in mice, SARS-CoV down-regulates the ACE2 protein by binding its S protein, and that this, consequently, can lead to serious lung injury. This also suggests that excessive ACE2 may competitively bind SARS-CoV2. In so doing, it not only neutralizes the virus, but also saves the cellular ACE2 activity that regulates the renin angiotensin system (RAS) [

Therefore, treatment with a soluble form of ACE2 could slow down and/or even prevent virus entry into cells and reduce virus spread, and also protect the lungs from injury. A recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2; APN01, GSK2586881) is considered safe and healthy subjects showed no negative hemodynamic effects. This is likely to differ in multimorbids or weakened patients.
