<p id="Par9">As the CoV S protein is surface-exposed and mediates entry into host cells, it is the main target of neutralizing antibodies upon infection and the focus of therapeutic and vaccine design. The development of a vaccine based on the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be a promising approach. Of note, in SARS-CoV-2, the S2 subunit, containing a fusion peptide, a transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic domain, is highly conserved. Thus, it could be a target for antiviral (anti-S2) compounds. Currently, no SARS-CoV-2 S protein antiviral is available.</p>
