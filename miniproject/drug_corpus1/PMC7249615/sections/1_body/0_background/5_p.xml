<p id="Par6">This infers that ACE2-expressing AECII cells favor the replication of the CoVs in the lungs and are, therefore, essentially responsible for pulmonary complications. The expression of the ACE2 receptor was also found in many extrapulmonary tissues including pharynx, heart, kidney, endothelium, and intestine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Theoretically, there could be viral invasion and replication in any of these tissues. However, currently, it appears that almost all of the fulminant trends of the virus are primarily pulmonary [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This organ seems to be the main replication and distribution center for the CoVs. A potential treatment should, therefore, first target the lungs to prevent a generalized infection or at least mitigate the symptoms. ACE2 is also strongly expressed and used on the lumen surface of intestinal epithelial cells as a co-receptor for the absorption of nutrients, especially for amino acids from ingested food [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It can be assumed that the intestine could also be an important entry point for SARS-CoV-2 and that the first infection with SARS-CoV-2 may have resulted from eating food from the seafood and wet animal wholesale market in Wuhan, the suspected site of the outbreak [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. If SARS-CoV-2 does infect the human intestinal epithelium, it has important effects on the fecalâ€“oral route of transmission, the containment of the virus spread, and treatment for it [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The distribution of ACE2 tissue in other organs other than the lungs could also explain expansion of dysfunction observed in patients.
