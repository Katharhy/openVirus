<p id="Par20">A prophylaxis strategy and a suitable treatment for the emerging SARS-CoV-2 are crucial for reducing the mortality and morbidity of this disease, but developing and obtaining regulatory approval for new drugs can take years and are discordant with the urgent need for a therapy. Drug repurposing is an attractive alternative drug discovery strategy, because it eliminates many steps usually required at the early phase of drug development. There is the advantage of ease of access, decreased cost of development as they have established manufacturing arrangements, and the possibility to provide a wide array of options for combination studies. The background pharmacological knowledge available for such compounds may also reduce concerns regarding adverse effects in patients as they have gone through rigorous safety and risk testing and are already approved as safe for human use.</p>
