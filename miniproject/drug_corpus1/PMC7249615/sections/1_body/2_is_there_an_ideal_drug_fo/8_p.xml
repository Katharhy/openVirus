<p id="Par27">The extracellular concentration of the orally applied chloroquine, especially in lung tissue, in vivo
 <italic>,</italic> may not be high enough to inhibit virus binding via the discussed glycosylation of the binding pocket [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. After the viral infection has spread in the body and due to the incredibly high viral loads, the non-specific endocytotic pathway is mainly used for further virus replication. This may explain the recent success reported with chloroquine to assist in the curing of the virus. In already infected individuals, we believe that it is essential to combine HCQ with a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, like bromhexine, to block complete entry of the virus into host cells. In the case of prophylaxis, the inhibition of the TMPRSS2 is essential [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and the non-specific endosomal entry is negligible. An effective prophylactic medication to prevent viral entry has to contain, at least, either a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, e.g., bromhexine or a competitive virus ACE2-binding inhibitor, e.g., a peptide inhibitor. This will prevent further spreading of the virus through the hostâ€™s body. Furthermore, a combination with the lesser toxic chloroquine derivate, HCQ sulfate, that is (amongst other functions) an effective endosomal protease inhibitor, inhibiting cathepsin B/L, could be a favorable combination for the treatment of moderate-to-severe COVID-19 cases. The addition of the 3CLpro inhibitor, quercetin, is also a favorable addition. This combination would block virus-host cell entry completely by blocking the specific receptor-mediated entry (via bromhexine) and non-specific endocytotic virus entry (via HCQ sulfate and quercetin) as well as viral replication (quercetin).
