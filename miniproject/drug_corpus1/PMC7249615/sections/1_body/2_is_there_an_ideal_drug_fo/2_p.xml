<p id="Par21">It is feasible to address this problem from a theoretical perspective. Theoretically, the ideal drug candidate (or combination) has to be specific, effective, already has regulatory approval (for any indication) ideally globally, but at a minimum in multiple countries. It should be widely available, inexpensive, and most important, has a long history of safe use with minimal side effects. Such a drug candidate could be applied immediately off-label and in so doing break the spreading chain or at least decrease the speed of spreading of the disease. Such a drug candidate, if even only partially effective, could have a huge epidemiological impact. Looking at a global perspective, it could mean the difference between a moderate and severe course of the disease, and/or between life and death. A reduction in the replication of the virus and of the total initial viral load in the host cells, especially in young and healthy individuals, could prevent the critical threshold of becoming infected or transmitting the virus from being reached.</p>
