<p id="Par24">In theory, bromhexine is an attractive drug against COVID-19, because it is an OTC drug that is available globally, affordable, with proven safety, and in so doing fulfills all criteria hypothesized above for a global and immediate off-label use. The IC90 (inhibitory concentration) for TMPRSS2 inhibition using bromhexine is favorable at 1 μmol compared to 10 μmol for camostat mesilate. However, the first pass effect for bromhexine is much higher than for camostat mesilate (75–80% versus 33–40%). The currently recommended oral dose for camostat mesilate is 300–600 mg per day which would translate into an oral dose of about 68–136 mg and a parenteral dose of 17–32 mg per day. These are only estimations and dose finding has to be done to identify the ideal dose.</p>
