<p id="Par23">Lucas et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], as mentioned above, showed a decrease in the frequency of metastases and a slowdown of the spread of metastases in mice with prostate cancer using TMPRSS2 inhibitors. The extent of metastasis reduction with bromhexine was slightly lower in the wild-type mice than in the genetic TMPRSS2
 <sup>−</sup> mice. This is most likely due to an incomplete pharmacological blockage of the protease activity by the applied bromhexine, presumably due to the dosage and the long dosage intervals in the study (72 h) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The terminal half-life of bromhexine in an oral application of 8 mg per single dose is an average of 6.6 h [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Bromhexine is orally readily bioavailable, and thus, a more frequent and higher oral dose could have a stronger and longer term inactivation of the TMPRSS2 enzyme. Endonasal, sublingual, buccal application, or inhalation might also be good alternatives as this could circumvent the first pass effect. Laporte and Naesens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>] reported that bromhexine did not show any significant cell entry or replication inhibition effect in vitro in influenza viruses. However, the authors showed that influenza viruses utilize, contrary to SARS-CoV-2, a different extracellular host protease for priming. Thus, these results are not representative for SARS-CoV-2 [
