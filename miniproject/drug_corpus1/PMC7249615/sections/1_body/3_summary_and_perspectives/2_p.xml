<p id="Par30">Neutralizing antibodies and vaccines will play significant roles in controlling this SARS‐CoV‐2 outbreak, but will realistically only become available once it is too late. A fast and immediate prophylactic option to prevent or potent drug to treat the disease progression in these urgent times is the repurposing of an already existing approved drug to be used for off-label usage. Bromhexine or preferably in combination with HCQ could be such an ideal candidate or candidate combination. A further combination with quercetin could be beneficial, as well. First, the combination could be utilized for prophylactic applications, specifically for the more vulnerable individuals such as the elderly, diabetics, those with coronary diseases, and immune-compromised individuals. Here, quercetin could possibly replace HCQ. Second, this combination can be used to lower the viral burden in newly infected individuals, limiting their capacity to transfer the virus and in so doing also prevent them from developing a severe or even critical manifestation of the disease. We encourage the scientific community to test bromhexine and the suggested combinations and to follow our recommended approach to also identify further ideal repurposing candidates according to the herein proposed criteria.</p>
