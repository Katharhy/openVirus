  <p>Hostâ€“virus interaction: how we can exploit these mechanisms to treat SARS-CoV-2 using bromhexine and/or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and/or quercetin. SARS-CoV-2 employs two routes for host cell entry, which are dependent on the localization of the proteases required for activation of the S protein. Binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the cellular receptor, ACE2, can result in uptake of virions into endosomes, where the S protein is activated by the pH-dependent cysteine protease cathepsin B/L. Activation of the S protein by cathepsin B/L can be blocked by HCQ and quercetin. Alternatively, the S protein can be activated by TMPRSS2, resulting in fusion of the viral membrane with the plasma membrane. Activation of the S protein by TMPRSS2 can be blocked by bromhexine. Quercetin also blocks viral replication via inhibition of the viral cysteine protease 3CLpro. (</p>
