<p id="Par18">Spread of zoonotic infectious diseases require an integrated tactics for disease surveillance. It could be assumed that in future CoV host versatility such as insects, mosquitos, bits and flies can pose serious consequences on health and economy due to their countless generation and limited source of detection and elimination, thus there is a dire need of precision diagnosis approaches for classification, identification and cure of emerging infectious diseases. Infectious disease outbreaks are always challenging in terms of diagnosis and cure so diagnostic strategy like voice or breathe analysis (particularly focusing on asymptotic period) might be helpful in exploiting disease incidence and prognosis. This could be hypothesized that either patient voice or breathe might have significant role in early viral disease detection. Success in getting biomarker could lead to an alternative, noninvasive, portable devices that could be used for personalized screening tool in a nonclinical setting reducing risk of ultimate outbreak. Breathe or vocal signals based diagnostic apps or devices could be viable solution for the timely diagnosis of infectious disease that likely to reduce disease risk intensity and spread.</p>
