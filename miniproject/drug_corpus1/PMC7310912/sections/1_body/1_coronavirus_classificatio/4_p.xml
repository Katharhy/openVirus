<p id="Par6">Studies have figured out mutation in SARS and COVID-19 spike protein residue have likely to triggered process of pathogenesis via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which is mainly found in human lungs (alveolar epithelial cells) and enterocytes of small intestine. It is evident that SARS-CoV-2 uses receptor binding domain ACE2 for transmission and host tropism that also have identified in SARS pathogenesis [
