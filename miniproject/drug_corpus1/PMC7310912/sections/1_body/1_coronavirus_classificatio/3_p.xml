<p id="Par5">Genetic diversity or recombination ability in CoV is frequent due to large genome. As we know 26–32 kilobases sized genome of all CoV is centered on single stranded, non-segmented, positive sense RNA that having 5′–3′ end with 7–9 genes containing nonstructural (replicase gene) and structural (Spike, Membrane, Envelope and Nucleocapsid) genes. Among nonstructural genes/protein, four protein including chymotrypsin like protease, papain like protease, helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase are indispensable for the replication and transcription of viral genome. However, structural protein such as Spike protein with 2 sub units S1 and S2 assists in cell binding and fusion between the viral and host cell membranes resulting CoV genome release into the host cell for infection [
