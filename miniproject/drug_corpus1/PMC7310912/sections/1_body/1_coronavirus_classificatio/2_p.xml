<p id="Par4">On the basis of host vulnerability epidemiological investigation of CoV has always been doubtful. For instance, outbreak of SARS-CoV epidemic was connected with palm civet from animal market of Guangdong, China. However, follow-up studies exposed wild horseshoe bats (sold and served in Guangdong market and restaurants) as cradle of SARS-CoV outbreak [

Similarly, dromedary camels were thought to be potential source of MERS-CoV outbreak but studies on bat originated HKU4-CoV assumed that MERS-CoV might be circulated from bats to camels on the assumption of CD26 receptor which was common point in both CoV strains for host entry [

Likewise, recent COVID-2019 outbreak reported to be traced from seafood market located in Wuhan with assumption of wildlife animal involvement in disease prognosis. It has been figured out that SARS-CoV-2 cause of COVID-19 belong to bat strains that was involved in SARS-CoV epidemic thus pointing towards an unknown animal being a facilitator of crossing over between bats and human [

Such evidence on host variability and susceptibility confirms that CoV has high mutation and recombination capacity to modify genes with high frequency nearly 25% of the entire genome thus stimulating to cross species transmission (new host), pathogenesis and genetic diversity [
