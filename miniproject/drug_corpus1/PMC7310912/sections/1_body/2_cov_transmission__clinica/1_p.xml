<p id="Par7">CoV infection often goes asymptomatic and most of patients present with mild symptoms of flu with cough fatigue, and headache. An asymptomatic incubation period varying from is 0–14 days, occasionally be 21 days long cause of fueling up CoVID-19 infection across the borders and wrapping up almost people of all ages including new born to elderly via direct or indirect contacts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Direct contact (blood, slaiva, semens and nasal/body secretions, animal meat or products) or in direct contact (with bite of infected organism, contaminated food, water, bedding or cloths) are equally detrimental in CoV outbreaks. In comparison to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is spreading much faster because SARS-CoV-2 replicates in upper respiratory tract producing immense number of pathogenic progeny that release and transport from one person to another on sneezing and coughing via respiratory dissemination
 <bold>.</bold> Including this, during coughing and sneezing mucus droplets suspend in the air for hours and can travel with air flows to infect passersby via airborne dissemination or infected droplets when landed on any object could allow SARS-CoV-2 to transmit via contact with contaminated surfaces thus providing contact, aerosols and fecal oral transmission routes [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Earlier studies shown COVID-19 transmitted and infected more likely to male patients rather female but recent studies on ICU and non ICU patients declined this with justification that male could be victim more than females due to their work at Hunan wet animal market [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Likewise, Chen and colleagues in clinical data finding from COVID-19 infected nine pregnant showed that none of pregnant women developed severe pneumonia in neonates and fetal infection that might be caused by intrauterine vertical transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However another study on 10 neonates born to mothers showed neonatal infection through mother to child transmission, suggesting that COVID-19 have no age, gender and health status discrimination for transmission [
