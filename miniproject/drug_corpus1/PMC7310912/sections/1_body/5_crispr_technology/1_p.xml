<p id="Par12">Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (Crispr) associated protein (Cas) system adopted from natural immune system of prokaryotes is powerful tool against communicable and non-communicable infections. In order to work against infections host immune system operates through three stages namely, an adaptation, an expression and an interference [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. At first stage, Cas protein cut genetic material of invader phage or virus into short pieces which then deposited in bacterial genome or Crispr array as spacers so that bacteria can reminisce the viruses when they attack them again. In expression stage, spacers transcribed into small crRNA containing an invader spacer sequence and complementary tracrRNA, hybridize together to form single guide RNA (sgRNA) for the recruitment of Cas protein. In last step, sgRNA and Cas protein fuse to form complex whereby sgRNA identify target through sequence similarity and let Cas protein to scan and cut target sequence at particular point [

On the other side, screening of protein in host and pathogen that activate expression of infection and the development of vaccine and antimicrobial drugs are also possible through crispr technology [
