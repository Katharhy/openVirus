<p id="Par14">After CoVID-19 outbreak, several sources are constantly sharing and recording epidemiological, clinical evidence with public in order to understand risk factor, routes of transmission and geographic spread of infections. In addition to this, such data could be vital for policy makers and international health organizations to improve surveillance system for ongoing and emerging epidemics. Around the globe researcher are finding way to tackle and reduce the ultimate size of such outbreaks with lower morbidity and mortality rates at local and international level [

Notable improved diagnostic approaches and monitoring technologies usually relied on blood, swab or other body fluids that could increase risk of infectious agents in other and health care staff as reported in COVID-19 pandemic [

Therefore, there is need of noninvasive diagnostics tools that help in early diagnosis particularly in asymptomatic condition, as majority of viral infections used to appear after incubation time ranging from 1 to 20Â days and with more or less communal clinical observation/symptoms. Incubation period with no sign or symptoms is proved to be lethal in terms of disease spreading that pointing towards the dearth of diagnostics tools which work promptly in obscure state. No doubt, several breakthrough techniques have been launched for disease diagnosis but still there is a lot to do.
