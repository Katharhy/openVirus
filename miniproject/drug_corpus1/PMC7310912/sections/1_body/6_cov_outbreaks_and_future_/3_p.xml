<p id="Par16">In addition to breath analysis technique, disease detection through speech or voice using artificial intelligence technologies is attracting increasing attention. Study with enough evidence suggested that speech signals (such as certain vowel, words and numbers) contain vocal biomarkers that could be great aid to pathologist for the disease diagnosis. Several machine learning algorithms showed superior accuracy in disease prediction including Parkinson, depression, cardio and other diseases [

Both breath and voice analysis techniques could thought to be beneficial in early diagnosis of infectious disease through noninvasive device. Non-invasive diagnostic tools based on voice or voc could hold great promise in the control of infectious diseases. Nevertheless, the challenges to identify microbial voc discerning between human and pathogens are still missing [
