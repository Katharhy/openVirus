<p id="Par15">One of the technique that supposed to be helpful in disease diagnosis, particularly in asymptomatic condition is breath analysis. In past two decades, researchers are working on the breath analysis techniques using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for the diagnosis of cancer, respiratory, gastrointestinal diseases and infectious diseases [

Exhaled breath which contain distinctive breath print or volatile organic compound (VOC) is crucial in differentiating healthy and unhealthy individuals which produced in the body during metabolic reactions. Sometime oxidative stress, inflammation, smoking, pollution or microbeâ€™s intrusion triggers alteration in biochemical pathways resulting production of voc with variable composition and concentration. Schnabel et al. and Nakhleh et al. figured out exceptional voc signatures in patients suffering from different diseases including cancer, pulmonary, Parkinson, ventilator associated pneumonia and kidney diseases [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. These data suggested that voc contain disease specific unique pattern or biomarkers (produce due to stress or microbes and also representing pathogen signatures) that could be reconnoitered for diagnosis of infectious diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Therefore on the basis of voc disease specific pattern it could be hypothesized that patients with viral infection might possess shifts in voc profile and could be detectable upon the establishment of infections in the body. Upon recognition of such voc pattern using algorithms could benefit in early diagnosis and control of infectious diseases.
