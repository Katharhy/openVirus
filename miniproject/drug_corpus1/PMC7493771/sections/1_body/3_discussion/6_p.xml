<p>The current study is limited by the low number of PLWH diagnosed with symptomatic COVID-19. Only symptomatic PLWH were included in this study, but we now know that asymptomatic COVID-19 is not unusual [
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]; we are systematically performing ELISA IgM/IgA/IgG blood tests to know the real incidence of COVID-19 in the PLWH cohort. This cohort of PLWH had universal standardized HIV and COVID-19 care and this situation may not be extrapolated to other settings. The lack of identification of HIV or antiretroviral factors associated with a higher risk or severity of COVID-19 in PLWH does not rule out that they may exist. Although probable cases in the general population fulfilled the ECDC Case Definition for COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], they could be due to causes other than SARS-CoV-2 that were not so thoroughly investigated as we did in the PLWH cohort and therefore the comparison of incidences between PLWH and the general population should be taken with caution (Supplementary Figure).
