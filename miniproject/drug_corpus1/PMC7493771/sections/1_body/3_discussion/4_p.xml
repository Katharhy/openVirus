<p>We were unable to identify any HIV or antiretroviral factors associated with COVID-19 severity. As reported in the general population [
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], several laboratory parameters best distinguished between severe and nonsevere COVID-19 in PLWH. These results suggest that HIV characteristics including CD4

 <sup>+</sup>/CD8
 <sup>+</sup> ratio, or plasma viral load, or the type of antiretroviral therapy do not seem to play a major influence on the severity of COVID-19 in PLWH. In addition, we were unable to identify any epidemiological, HIV, or antiretroviral factor associated with the diagnosis of COVID-19 in PLWH.
