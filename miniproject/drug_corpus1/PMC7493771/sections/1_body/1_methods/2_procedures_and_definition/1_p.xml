<p>According to the hospital COVID-19 Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), criteria for admission included respiratory rate more than 20 bpm, room air oxygen saturation less than 95%, and any comorbidity; having CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell counts less than 350/μl was also a criterion for PLWH admission. PLWH had no restrictions regarding therapeutic resources including ICU admission. SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and B, and syncytial respiratory virus were assessed in nasal and pharyngeal swabs by real-time reverse-transcriptase–PCR (RT-PCR). ELISA IgM/IgA/IgG blood test performed 3 weeks or longer after the onset of the symptoms was used to confirm COVID-19 whenever SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR had not been done.
