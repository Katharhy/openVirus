Aside from the respiratory tract, SARS-CoV infection may also target intestinal mucosal cells, renal tubular epithelial cells and neurons as well as cells from the lymphoid and reticuloendothelial system. As a consequence, extrapulmonary features including watery diarrhoea and vomiting may also be part of the clinical presentation.
