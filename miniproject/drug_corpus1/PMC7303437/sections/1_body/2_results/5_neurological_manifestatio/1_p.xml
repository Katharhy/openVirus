<p id="Par43">Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 profits from the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2-R) to infiltrate in the intracellular space. It has been described that the brain expresses ACE2-R, which have been detected in glial cells and neurons as well as endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. Therefore, these cells and neurons are potential targets of COVID-19 [
