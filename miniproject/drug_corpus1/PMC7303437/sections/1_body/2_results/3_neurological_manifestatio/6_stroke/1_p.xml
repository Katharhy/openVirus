<p id="Par29">Five cases of large artery ischaemic stroke were described in SARS. It is suggested that a pro-coagulant state could be present in patients with SARS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This could contribute to large cerebral arterial thromboembolism, together with factors as systemic hypotension and cardiac dysfunction. However, stroke is not uncommon in critically ill patients with co-morbidity. Furthermore, it is believed that the use of intravenous immunoglobulins, used to treat SARS, could play a role in SARS-related stroke. Hyperviscosity induced by intravenous immunoglobulins in patients already prone to hypercoagulable state due to viral infection and the inflammatory response, could play a key role in stroke [
