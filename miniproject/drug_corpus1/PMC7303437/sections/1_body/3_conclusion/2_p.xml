<p id="Par55">Due to the hospital emergency plan and the splitting of hospitals in hot zones versus cold zones to prevent hospital clusters of corona-infection, neurological work up is limited to bedside clinical evaluation, spinal fluid analysis and CT scan. MRI imaging is mostly located in the cold zone, thus limited available for infected patients. A surveillance of neurological manifestations (Guillain-Barré syndrome, meningoencephalitis, stroke…) in these patients is warranted as is surveillance for thromboembolic sequelae (pulmonary embolism, stroke). Many patients present with fever, respiratory symptoms, but also headache, anosmia, dizziness. However, spinal tap is not routinely performed and literature on spinal fluid analysis is very sparse. An explanation for the lack of CSF-data would be that there is currently no validated test to detect SARS-CoV-2 in CSF. A multidisciplinary approach and more neurology consultations in the emergency department and COVID-19-wards could prevent under-diagnosing of neurological complications and thus insufficient treatment. Rapid diagnosis and proper treatment of Guillain-Barré syndrome, critical illness polyneuropathy, stroke, and other neurological disorders could have a positive impact on outcome. As the COVID-19 pandemic is evolving, our knowledge on the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 is also evolving. Although the current pandemic is of a much higher scale than SARS and MERS, and far more neurological cases could be expected, the thusfar available literature about neurological manifestation of COVID-19 is rather limited. This review will hopefully contribute to increased alertness for both neurologists and non-neurologists involved in the care of COVID-19 patients.</p>
