<p>Interestingly, residues Gly 70, Val 73 and Pro 74 are the prime binding residues of N-protein that lie common with the top dynamically stable hit complexes and the nucleotide molecules AMP and UMP. The in-place docking poses of top hits ZINC00003118440 (left) and ZINC0000146942 (right) with SARS-CoV N protein NTD (2OFZ) is shown in

One essential feature that compounds ZINC00003118440 displays in the molecular dynamics is its commitment to the binding site throughout the trajectory, there was no leaving off the binding site accompanied by in-range protein fluctuation.
