<p>Molecular dynamics simulation for the drug ligand complexes of Nucleocapsid protein N-terminal domain (PDB structure variants 2OFZ and 1SSK)were referred for the dynamic profile assessment of N-protein interaction with the selected ligands (selected on the basis of MM-GBSA, Log P, HERG inhibition potential, rule of 5, rule of 3 and drug likeness rules). Considering the low structural constancy of the protein model itself, the 1SSK N-protein molecule simulation model was shed off from the picture as it was highly unstable with avg. RMSD(s) ranging between 10 and 12 Å (

On the contrary, selected molecules from N-protein (PDB id: 2OFZ) complexes revealed few excellent binders. Lead molecules ZINC00003118440 and ZINC0000146942 emerged out to be high in interaction ratio and strength with N-protein active binding residues (
