<p>A log p value of 1–3 may indicate optimal physicochemical properties and a logP value more than five results in rapid turnover rate, low solubility and poor absorption. Log p not greater than 5 is a component of Lipinski’s rule (20). In our study, as the target is intracellular (nucleocapsid protein), the lipophilic nature of the ligand will be very important and we kept the range of 1 to &lt;5.</p>
