<p>In the case of 1SSK, among the 15 molecules selected (1SSK-ligand complexes), 9 ligands had log p value between 1 to &lt;5 (ligands 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12 and 14). Among these, ligand no 6 showed strong potential for HERG inhibition and ligand 3 showed additional rule of three violations. The rest of the molecules can be arranged in the order 8 &gt; 12 &gt; 9&gt;2 &gt; 4&gt;14 &gt; 7 on the basis of MM-GBSA. Top four molecules (8, 12, 9 and 2) were selected for MD simulation studies as the rest had poor MM-GBSA scores.</p>
