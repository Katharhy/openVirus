<p>In the case of 2OFZ, among the 15 molecules selected (2OFZ-ligand complexes), 8 ligands had log p value between 1 and &lt;5 (ligands 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 14 and 15). Among the ligands with log p value in the range 1 to &lt;5, taking an arbitrary cutoff MM-GBSA score of −45, we found that the binding affinity was weak (−45) in case of ligands 4, 8, 14 and 15. Again ligand 14 showed strong HERG inhibition. So, on the basis of lipophilicity and binding affinity, the best performing ligands were ligand 1, 5, 7 and 11. The selected complexes were advanced for MD simulations on discrete basis of docking score (ligand no 1, 2 and 3), on the basis of lipophilicity (log p) and binding affinity (MMGBSA score) (ligands 1, 5, 7 and 11). So, we conducted molecular dynamics study of a total of 6 ligands (ligand 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 11).</p>
