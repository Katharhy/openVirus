<p>We used two PDB structures for virtual screening (2OFZ and 1SSK). Fifteen hits of each were selected on the basis of docking score. The details of the screened molecules are shown in 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> (for 2OFZ) and 
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> (for 1SSK).
