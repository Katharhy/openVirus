<p>In the management of COVID-19, the interim guidelines encourage the use of selective M1/M3 receptor blockers (anti-cholinergic agents) to reduce the secretion of lung glands, reduce spasm and associated wheeze and improve the respiratory function (Jin et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT1000" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). As the best hit was a theophylline derivative, which is a bronchodilator, and bronchodilators are often used in the management of viral lung diseases, we further screened all approved bronchodilator drugs Tripathi (
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) for their binding to the N protein NTD (RNA binding domain). The detailed data is shown in 
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. In addition to other activities, our study also demonstrated the binding affinity of the different bronchodilators against the NTD (RNA binding region) of the N protein of coronavirus. The binding affinity is in the order of Formeterol &gt; Terbutaline &gt; Ipratropium bromide &gt; Tiotropium Bromide &gt; Theophylline &gt; salbutamol. One of the interesting facts is that formeterol also showed binding against 2019-nCoV PL protease (Zhavoronkov et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). A preliminary 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> assay may provide further details and may pave the way for a drug with dual action (antiviral and bronchodilator) and guide us on the choice of bronchodilators in case of COVID-19. However, toxicity and the presence of other co-morbidity parameters will also govern the choice of bronchodilators.
