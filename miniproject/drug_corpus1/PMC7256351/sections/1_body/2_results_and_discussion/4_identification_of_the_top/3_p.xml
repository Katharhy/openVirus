<p>The second compound ZINC000000146942 (Ethyl (4S)-4-methyl-2-oxo-6-[(1S)-1-phenylethyl]-3,4-dihydro-1H-pyrimidine-5-carboxylate) is a derivative of 3,4 Dihydropyrimidone. 3,4 Dihydropyrimidinones (DHPMs) are implicated in a wide range of biological activities. Pyrimidone derivatives are already being used against viral infections (Phucho et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT1001" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Wierenga et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>; Skulnick et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>; Sharma et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Seley-Radtke et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The pyrimidone nucleus is a core component of many of the anti-retroviral drugs (Sharma et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The pyrimidone scaffold is a backbone of many of the approved anti-retrovirals e.g. Zidovudine, Didanosine and Zalcitabine (Seley-Radtke &amp; Yates, 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Other pyrimidone derivatives 5-iododeoxyuridine and 5-iodo-2â€²-deoxyuridine are extensively used against viral infections (Sharma et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Thus it sounds likely to find a derivative in a screening study targeting SARS CoV.
