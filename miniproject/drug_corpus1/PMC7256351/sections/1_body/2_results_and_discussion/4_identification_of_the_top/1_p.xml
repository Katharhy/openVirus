<p>The hit molecule ZINC000003118440 [8-(2-hydroxyethyl) aminophylline] is a synthetic derivative of the drug Theophylline (detailed structure showed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref>). Theophylline is a bronchodilator of the Methylxanthine class. Few studies also reported the antiviral properties of Methylxanthines (Yamazaki and Tagaya, 
 <xref rid="CIT4023382" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>). However, if we see specifically for theophylline or theophylline derivatives, only one study reported that theophylline possesses antiviral activity against the hepatitis B virus (Zheng et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and no further data is available against other types of viruses.
