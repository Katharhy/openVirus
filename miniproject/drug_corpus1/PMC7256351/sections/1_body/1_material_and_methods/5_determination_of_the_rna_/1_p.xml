<p>For the determination of the binding pocket, Sitemap was used. Picturized representation of the estimated binding pocket can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>. The guided pocket coordinates were then docked with ribonucleoside 5′-monophosphates (AMP and UMP) to obtain an insight into the most active residues taking part in nucleotide binding (Lin et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The imperative insight from the docking to be noted is the aberrant difference between the binding coordinates of 2OFZ and 1SSK, owing to the crystal and solution structure of the N protein of SARS-CoV, respectively. The spatial UMP-AMP docked pose RMSD for 2OFZ and 1SSK were found to be 3.74 Å and 3.85 Å, respectively. The pictorial and tabular illustration showing interacting residues can be seen in
