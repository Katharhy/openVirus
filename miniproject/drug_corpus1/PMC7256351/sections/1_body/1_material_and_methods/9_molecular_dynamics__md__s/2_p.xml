<p>Molecular dynamics studies of the selected ligands were carried out against the chosen target structures. Module Desmond was used to carrying out MD simulations. In order to study the interactions of three targeted proteins with the ligands, the optimized potentials for the liquid simulations (OPLS)-2005 force field was employed. Firstly, a position restraint of 6000 ps was selected for the drug-target complex that allows water molecules in the system. Secondly, various frames were applied to minimize the complex upon which the force field is implied. Consequently, the root means square deviation (RMSD) for the C
 <sub>α</sub>, Ligand root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), Ligand contacts were obtained from the data to monitor the stability of three protein in its dynamic form along the simulated trajectory (Desmond, n.d.).
