<p>MD simulations can provide in-depth knowledge of the dynamic behavior of bio-molecules in a graphical simulation which can demonstrate a free-energy landscape that is close to the native protein state inside the body. Hence employing the docked complexes to MD simulations provide a more accurate interaction profile.</p>
