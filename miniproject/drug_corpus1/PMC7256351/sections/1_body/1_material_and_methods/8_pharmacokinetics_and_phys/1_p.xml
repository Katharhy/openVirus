<p>The N protein NTD co-crystallized models (15 molecules for each 2OFZ and 1SSK) screened with the highest docking score were submitted for evaluation of the physicochemical and kinetic properties in QikProp module of Schr√∂dinger. Drug-likeness of the hits were evaluated using values obtained from SwissADME (
