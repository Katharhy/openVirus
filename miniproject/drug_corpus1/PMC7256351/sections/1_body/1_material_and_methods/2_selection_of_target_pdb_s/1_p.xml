<p>In this study we tend to design an inhibitor of RNA binding. Our target of interest was the NTD of nucleocapsid (N) protein. In the nucleocapsid (N) protein, our segment of interest was the RNA binding domain of the nucleocapsid protein. However as there was no structure available on the nucleocapsid protein of 2019-nCov, the structures that were most close to the 2019-nCoV nucleocapsid protein N terminal domain (RNA binding domain) were 2OFZ (Saikatendu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) and 1SSK (Huang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT721832" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) (92% sequence homology with the Wuhan sea food market pneumonia virus nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, accession number QHN73802). Although, both the structures represented the RBD of the N protein, none of the structures were bound to any reported inhibitor of RNA binding. Among the selected structures, PDB IDs, 1SSK was a NMR structure (resolution is not given) and the second target structure PDB ID 2OFZ is an ultrahigh resolution crystallized X-Ray structure (1.17 Å). The PDB ids of the target structures (2OFZ and 1SSK) were retrieved from the RCSB database (PDB Database, n.d.).
