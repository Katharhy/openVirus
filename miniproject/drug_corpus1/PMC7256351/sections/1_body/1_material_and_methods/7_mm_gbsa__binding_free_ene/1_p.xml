<p>Prime MM-GBSA was used to predict the free energy of binding between the receptor and the set of ligands. The binding free energy (ΔGbind) was calculated using the default parameters of the Prime module in Maestro, Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY, USA (Singh &amp; Muthusamy, 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Prime uses a surface generalized Born (SGB) model employing a Gaussian surface instead of van der Waals surface for better representation of a solvent accessible surface area. MM/GBSA, provides better statistical correlations against experimental binding data than previous similar reported studies (Nain et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Adasme-Carreño et al, 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The co-crystallized pose-viewer complexes were used as input files with implicit VSGB solvation model, OPLS3 force field and all other settings as default in Prime MM-GBSA (GlideScore/Docking Score doesn’t correlate with my known activities.
