<p>We identified two potential hitsZINC000003118440 and ZINC000000146942 as inhibitors of RNA binding to NTD of N protein. The first hit is a theophylline derivative and the second hit is a pyrimidone derivative. Both the classes have reported to have antiviral effect against other viruses. However, this is the first time the binding potential of these two hits are reported against N protein NTD (RNA binding region) of SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, the first compound was a theophylline derivative (commonly used bronchodilator). Hence, we screened all the approved bronchodilators against the N protein RNA binding site, which showed binding affinity (MMGBSA) in the order Formeterol &gt; Terbutaline &gt; Ipratropium bromide &gt; Tiotropium Bromide &gt; Theophylline &gt; Salbutamol. These findings may help in the choice of bronchodilator in COVID-19. However these findings need in-vitro validation.</p>
