<p>The CoV has several conserved structural proteins e.g. the matrix protein (M protein), small envelop protein (E protein), trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein, nucleocapsid protein (N protein) and proteases (papain like and the main protease) (Prajapat et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The nucleocapsid protein is typically located inside the virus and is one of the most abundant structural proteins in the Coronaviruses. The N protein binds with the viral RNA genome to form a virion core, which is vital for its replication and transcription. In addition, the N protein also takes an essential part in viral RNA synthesis (Chang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Recent studies suggest that N proteins of coronaviruses can be useful antiviral drug targets against infections caused by these viruses for its importance in the replication initiation machinery (Chenavas et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Lin et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). One of the interesting features is that all CoV has the least variable structure of N protein (Chang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The N terminal domain (NTD) of the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) plays a significant role in binding to genomic and sub-genomic RNAs in MHV and IBV virions. The N protein of CoV plays a major role in the viral replication cycle by the formation of the ribonucleoprotien complex with the help of its interactions through the viral RNA and N terminal domain (NTD) of the N protein (Lin et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). It is due to this activity, the SARS-CoVN protein is suggested to be an RNA chaperone in a previous study and a stepping stone in viral genomic RNA replication.
