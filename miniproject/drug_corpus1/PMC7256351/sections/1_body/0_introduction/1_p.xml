<p>Coronaviruses are enveloped spherical or pleomorphic single stranded RNA viruses with characteristic bears club shaped glycoproteins on their surface (Prajapat et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Seven strains of human CoVs are documented, which include 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV (Prajapat et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The previous two Coronavirus epidemics, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with 10% mortality for SARS-CoV and 37% for MERS-CoV affected ∼10,000 individual lives (Huang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The reemergence and severe outbreak of Coronavirus, now as COVID-19 has caused global health emergency (Sarma et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Originated from Wuhan, China, the virus has spread as far as Thailand, Japan, Korea, the USA, Vietnam, Singapore, India (Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) and European nations. WHO has declared COVID-19 as a pandemic (
 <italic>Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)—Events as they happen</italic>, n.d.). The 2019-nCoV is reported to be the seventh and newest member of the Coronavirus, with human infections (Zhu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).
