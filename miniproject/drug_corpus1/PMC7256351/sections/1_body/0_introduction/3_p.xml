<p>Few studies are there, which tried to design a new drug targeting to disrupt the interactions between coronavirus N protein NTD and CoV-RNA. A molecule ‘PJ34’ designed targeting the N protein RNA binding domain of HCoV-OC43 N-NTD (PDB 4KXJ) is reported (Lin et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), however, the similarity between HCoV-OC43 N-NTD (PDB 4KXJ) and the 2019-nCoV N protein is only 46%. Here comes the need for designing new inhibitors against the RNA binding region of N protein to inhibit the binding of RNA and subsequent inhibition of viral replication in case of the 2019-nCoV.
