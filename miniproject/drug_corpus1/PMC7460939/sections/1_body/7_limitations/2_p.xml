<p>This study, despite its important results, has important applications, but it suffers from limitations. In terms of methodology, the reader should bear in mind that the study was based on the descriptive method, and the study sample was also small and restricted to university teaching staff at Princess Nora Bint Abdul Rahman University, but not to other universities. It also suffers from a third limitation, which is that it was concerned with revealing the role of teaching staff in universities only without studying teachers in the schools. For these reasons, we need future studies that apply other methodology, such as semi‐experimental and comparative causal. We also need other studies aim to revealing the role of teachers in schools in developing students' awareness about COVID‐19, and studying the degree of awareness of faculty members about developing student awareness through distance education about COVID‐19 disease and its effects and symptoms.</p>
