<p>It is important to remember that COVID‐19 does not distinguish between borders and ethnic groups, nor between individuals in terms of disability, age or gender. Educational spaces must remain welcoming, respectful, and inclusive environments. The actions of schools and universities can prevent COVID‐19 from spreading through students.</p>
