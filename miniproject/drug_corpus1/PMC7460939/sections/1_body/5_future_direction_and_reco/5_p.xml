<p>In light of the current study results, the researchers recommend several procedural recommendations, including the rehabilitation and training of faculty members on blackboard systems for e‐learning remotely to activate and use them effectively in crises. And also, we stressed on the use of learning materials and software available in digital environments for distance learning systems during crises. We also recommend employing effective and supportive strategies for the success of remote e‐learning in raising the level of cognitive, health, and moral value awareness. And we recommend the necessity of activating the e‐learning platforms, which include developing innovative curricula, study programs and alternative educational paths. In addition, activating development partnerships with companies specialized in the field of training and e‐learning to invest their experiences in a complete transformation toward e‐learning in crises. Also, setting up studied plans to manage e‐learning in times of crisis and the spread of epidemics, in order to ensure the continuity of the educational system in an efficient and successful manner.</p>
