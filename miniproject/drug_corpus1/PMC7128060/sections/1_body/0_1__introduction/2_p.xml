<p>Application of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has significantly reduced the transmission of HIV and has decreased HIV-related morbidity and mortality [

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. HIVDR poses a serious threat to the prevention of transmission of HIV/AIDS due to compromised efficacy of the first-line regimen. In addition, drug-resistant strains can be transmitted to newly infected individuals and are likely selected as dominant strains. HIVDR surveillance has made it possible to detect DR strains in time, evaluate and adjust treatment regimens, and reduce the transmission of DR strains.
