<p>The first HIV-1 case in Chengdu was reported in 1992. By the end of 2016, a total of 18,603 people were living with HIV in Chengdu, which accounts for the largest HIV/AIDS population among other provincial capitals, and 15,633 patients were receiving ART. However, there were little data on the molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 and the prevalence of drug resistance-associated mutations (DRMs) in this area. Therefore, epidemiological surveillance was conducted in patients receiving ART treatment in Chengdu, to provide HIV-1 subtypes, the prevalence of DR, and DRM profiles and thus to optimize clinical management, prevention, and control of HIV.</p>
