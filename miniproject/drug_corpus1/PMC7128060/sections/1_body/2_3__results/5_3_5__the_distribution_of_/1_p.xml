<p>14 NRTI-associated DRMs were all found in CRF01_AE, and V75I/L/M, T69N/D, and L210W were not found in CRF07_BC (S 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1"/>). 16 and 15 (except A98G) NNRTI-associated DRMs were found in CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC, respectively. No significant difference was found in the distribution of NRTI/NNRTI-associated DRMs and CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC subtypes. NNRTI-associated DRMs with extensively drug resistance such as G190A/E/K/Q/S/V, V179I/D/E/T, Y181C/V, and K101E/H/P reside in CRF55_01B and subtype B, C. Only one case infected with CRF_08BC recombinant subtype showed DR. E138A/G/R/K/Q was found in this case and was predicted to have low/potential resistance to RPV and ETR. PI-associated mutations only resided in CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC. The distribution of mutations in the PI coding region was significantly different in the two recombinant subtypes (
