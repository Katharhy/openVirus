<p>The prevalence of all DRMs to NRTIs, NNRTIs, and PIs was displayed in Supplementary 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1"/>. 14 DRMs were observed in NRTIs. The most commonly observed mutations with NRTIs were M184I/V (59.59%, 146/245), K65R (28.16%, 69/245), D67N/G (19.18%, 47/245), K70E/K/R (17.14%, 42/245), Y115F (15.10%, 37/245), L74I/V (11.02%, 27/245), and T215I/Y (8.16%, 20/245). 16 DRMs were found in NNRTIs. K103N (37.55%, 92/245) was the most frequent mutation, followed by G190A/E/K/Q/S/V (28.57%, 70/245), V179I/D/E/T (27.76%, 68/245), V106A/I/M (26.12%, 64/245), Y181C/V (18.78%, 46/245), K101E/H/P (14.69%, 36/245), Y188C/H/L (5.71%, 14/245), L100I (4.08%, 10/245), and M230L (4.08%, 10/245). Three major PI-associated and 7 secondary DRMs were found in this study. The most frequent mutations were L10I/V (32), A71I/T/V (28), and K20I/R (26), among which L10I/V and A71I/T/V are mutations that do not affect drug susceptibility and K20I/R were predicted to have potential resistance to NFV.
