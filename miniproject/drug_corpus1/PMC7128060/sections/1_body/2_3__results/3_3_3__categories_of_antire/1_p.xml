<p>In total, 1.2% were resistant to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 1.7% to non-NRTIs (NNRTIs), and 0.14% to protease inhibitors (PIs). The NRTI-associated mutations were forecasted to be highly resistant to lamivudine (3TC, 67.8%, 146/245) and abacavir (ABC, 40.4%, 99/245), resistant to stavudine (D4T, 50.2%, 123/245) and tenofovir (TDF, 47.76%, 117/245), and intermediate or low resistant to azidothymidine (AZT, 7.3%, 18/245). 96.33% of the patients were predicted to have high resistance to efavirenz (EFV) and nevirapine (NVP), followed by resistance to rilpivirine (RPV, 67.0%, 169/245) and etravirine (ETR, 67.3%, 165/245) (
