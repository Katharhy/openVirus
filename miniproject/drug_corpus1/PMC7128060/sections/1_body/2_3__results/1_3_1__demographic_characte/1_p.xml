<p>Between 2014 and 2016, a total of 13,872 HIV-infected patients were tested for HIV-1 VL. 4.7% (653/13872) of cases were considered treatment failure. A total of 481 (481/653) samples were amplified and sequenced successfully for subtypes and genetic resistance. Most of the subjects were male (411/481, 85.4%), and the main route of infection was heterosexual contact (342/481, 71.1%). The median age was 41 years (range: 15-81years), of which 50.3% were married. The demographic and subtype distributions of 481 patients are presented in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Based on the generated sequences, six subtypes were identified. CRF01_AE (261/481, 54.3%) and CRF07_BC (200/481, 41.6%) were found to be the predominant subtypes. Other subtypes such as CRF08_BC (9/481, 1.9%), B (6/481, 1.2%), C (3/481, 0.6%), and CRF55_01B (2/481, 0.4) were found in small proportions.
