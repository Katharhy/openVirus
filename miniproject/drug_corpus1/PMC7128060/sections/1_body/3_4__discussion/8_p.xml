<p>Patients infected with the CRF01_AE are associated with DR. All 14 NRTI-associated mutations and 16 NNRTI-associated mutations were all found in CRF01_AE. Both cases identified with CRF55_01B showed DR, suggesting that this newly discovered CRF may likely develop DRMs. NRTI-associated DRMs M184I/V and K65R and NNRTI-associated DRMs with extensively drug resistance K101E/H/P, V179I/D/E/T, Y181C/V, and G190A/E/K/Q/S/V were detected in CRF55_01B. PI-associated mutations were found in 97 cases, most of which were secondary mutations like L10I/V, A71I/T/V, and K20I/R, so, there were relatively few cases of DR. In this study, among the PI-associated DR mutations detected, K20I/R and T74S were mainly found in CRF01_AE while A71I/T/V, Q58E, and V82I were frequently observed in CRF07_BC, indicating that the presence of different mutations may vary among different subtypes.</p>
