<p>CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell count, CRF01 AE subtypes, and treatment with “TDF+3TC+EFV/NVP/other” are associated with DR. No significant differences were seen in other characteristics. Previous studies have suggested that patients with initial CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell count &gt; 200 cells/
 <italic>μ</italic>l had better recovery of immune function after ART [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The level of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell count may reflect the function of the immune system, and the patients with poor immune function, that is, primary CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell count ≤ 200 cells/
 <italic>μ</italic>l, are more likely to develop DR, indicating that HIV-infected patients should be detected early and initiate antiviral treatment started as soon as possible.
