<p>The Chengdu ART regimen includes 3TC, one NRTI (AZT/D4T/TDF), and one NNRTI (EFV/NVP). The resistance to NRTIs was DDI (69.80%), 3TC (69.39%), FTC (69.39%), ABC (69.39%), D4T (50.20%), TDF (47.76%), and AZT (13.47%) based on the number of the cases. Although FTC and DDI were not used in clinical settings, significant cross-resistance was observed. The structure, mechanism, and efficacy of FTC are similar to 3TC, and FTC was predicted to have the same DR profiles with 3TC. Similar findings were seen for DDI with ABC. Under the 3TC-based medication regimen, a high proportion of drug resistance was observed for 3TC, most of which showed high and intermediate resistance. Besides, the number of cases resistant to AZT was the lowest, most of which showed low or potential resistance. Thus, 3TC+AZT is the best choice in the current NRTI regimen.</p>
