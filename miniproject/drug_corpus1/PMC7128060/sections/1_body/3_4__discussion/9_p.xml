<p>There are some limitations in this study. Part of the cases did not obtain available genotypes, and hence, sensitive methods may need to be explored to improve genotyping success rate.

In order to better apprehend and evaluate the prevalence of acquired HIVDR in this area, attention should be devoted to the prevalence of drug resistance in ART-na√Øve HIV-1 infected patients.</p>
