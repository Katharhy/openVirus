<p>In addition, novel CRF such as CRF55_01B was first discovered in Chengdu, and both cases were MSM. CRF55_01B, a recombinant form of CRF01_AE and subtype B, was first identified in 2012 among MSM in China, becoming the third CRF in China [

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and has increased in the past 5 years especially in South and East China [

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Large cities may be the places where new recombinant strains would originate and spread. With CRF55_01B emerging in this area, long-term molecular monitoring is necessary for control and prevention of the HIV-1 epidemic.
