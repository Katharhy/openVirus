<p>Chengdu is an area with predominance of CRF01_AE and CRF08_BC, indicating distinct heterogeneity compared to what has been shown in other regions [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For instance, about half of the subtypes were identified as CRF08_BC (47.4%) among the recently infected population in Yunnan [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and CRF07_BC was the predominant strain in Xinjiang Province [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, CRF01_AE was dominant in east China [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It has been confirmed that one of the drug-trafficking routes in mainland China is from Yunnan to Sichuan and then to Xinjiang [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Hence, it is assumed that subtype profile in Chengdu is similar to Yunnan and Xinjiang provinces.
