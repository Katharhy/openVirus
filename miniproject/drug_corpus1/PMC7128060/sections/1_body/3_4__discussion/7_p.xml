<p>In our study, M184I/V (59.59%) was the most prevalent mutation associated with NRTI resistance in our study and was also frequently found in Europe, Africa, and other regions in China [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It alone causes high resistance to 3TC and FTC, low resistance to ABC, and potential resistance to DDI. K65R is one of the mutations with broad-spectrum resistance and was found in more than one-quarter of the cases. Nine mutations associated with DR were observed in large proportions and resistant to many NNRTIs. K101 E/H/P, Y181 C/V, and G190 A/E/K/Q/S/V are broad spectrum general mutations resistant to all NNRTIs. The L100I and M230L mutations (4.08%) had low incidence and intermediate or high resistance to RPV and ETR but no resistance to the first-line drugs EFV and NVP. These two mutations were found in CRF_01AE, CRF_07BC, and subtype C, and patients with these two mutations were undergoing 3TC+TDF+EFV/NVP, indicating that this regimen may be related to these mutations. Three primary mutations M46I, I47A, and I50V resistant to PIs were detected in one patient, whose regimen was 3TC+AZT+NVP then switched to LPV/r+3TC+TDF. This patient showed decreased treatment adherence that resulted in reduced effectiveness of treatment, indicating that clinicians should pay attention to compliance education to avoid similar cases and the transmission of “super” resistant strains.
