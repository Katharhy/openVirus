<p>HIV viral RNA was extracted from plasma using the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 Amplification Reagent Kit and then was reverse transcripted into cDNA by using the AccessQuickâ„¢ RT-PCR System (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA). The 
 <italic>pol</italic> gene fragments, containing the entire protease gene and partial reverse transcriptase gene (codons 1-300), were amplified by nested PCR (2x Pfu PCR MasterMix, Tiangen, Beijing, China). Primers and cycling conditions were previously described [
