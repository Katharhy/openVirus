<p>Interestingly, wildlife can also be infected by coronaviruses. For instance, a novel coronavirus SW1 was isolated from a deceased Beluga whale [
 <xref rid="B13-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The whale had suffered from a respiratory disease and acute liver failure and large quantities of SW1 particles were isolated from the liver. However, electron microscopy was not able to identify the virus as a coronavirus, but nucleic acid sequencing of liver tissue confirmed the presence of coronavirus RNA. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that SW1 belonged to the group of Î³-coronaviruses. For obvious reasons, there has been an intense interest in bat coronaviruses, as bats have been indicated as the original source of several coronavirus outbreaks. In the past decade, hundreds of novel bat coronaviruses have been identified [
 <xref rid="B14-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In this context, both the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) have been suggested to originate from bats. Moreover, it has been already discussed in 2015 that a SARS-like cluster of bat coronaviruses could pose a threat for human epidemics [
 <xref rid="B15-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For instance, the disease potential of a SARS-like virus, SHC014-CoV, circulating in Chinese horseshoe bats was evaluated by reverse genetics [
 <xref rid="B15-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The chimeric virus composed of SHC014-CoV spikes and wild-type backbone was able to efficiently utilize multiple orthologs of the SARS receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), replicate to high levels in primary human airway cells and generate in vitro titers equivalent to epidemic SARS-CoV strains. Moreover, the chimeric virus showed replication in mouse lung, with notable pathogenesis in vivo. These results indicated that there is a potential risk of SARS-CoV re-emergence from viruses circulating in bat populations. Needless to say, the re-emergence of SARS-CoV is a reality today, as will be discussed below.
