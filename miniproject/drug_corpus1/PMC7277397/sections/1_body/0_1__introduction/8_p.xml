<p>Currently, there are no antiviral drugs or vaccines available for the treatment of COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="B41-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The urgent need for treatment has therefore triggered a variety of approaches to design and develop novel drug and vaccine strategies against COVID-19. Therapeutic approaches have included angiotensin receptor blockers, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), gene silencing and even plant and mushroom extracts based on traditional Chinese medicine. Moreover, vaccine development involves different alternatives including epitope-based peptide vaccines, viral vector-based vaccines and the support of bioinformatics and immunoinformatics for the design of more efficient targets. However, before the various approaches are described in detail, it is appropriate to give an overview of the genomic composition of SARS-CoV-2 and its lifecycle to identify potential drug and vaccine targets.
