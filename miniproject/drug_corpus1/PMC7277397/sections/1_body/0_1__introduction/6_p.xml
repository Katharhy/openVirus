<p>After the SARS-CoV epidemic, the novel human MERS-CoV emerged in the Middle East in 2012, causing a series of highly pathogenic respiratory tract infections in Saudi Arabia and other Middle East countries [

 <xref rid="B36-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, differences in the structure of the mouse DPP4 receptor make mouse cells resistant to MERS-CoV, which does not allow evaluation of antivirals and vaccines in appropriate mouse models. However, a mouse model for MERS-CoV was engineered by introduction of the human DPP4 gene into mouse lungs by an adenoviral vector [
