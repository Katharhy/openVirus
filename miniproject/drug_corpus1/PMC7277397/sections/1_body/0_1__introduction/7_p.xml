It was thought to have originated from wild animals at the Huanan market in Wuhan and spread by person-to-person transmission, causing the disease named COVID-19, with various degrees of severity, from mild flu-like symptoms to pneumonia and death [

Bats, snakes and pangolins are potential carriers of SARS-CoV-2 based on sequence comparison to virus isolated from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. The COVID-19 pandemic has already overtaken both SARS and MERS in severity and has recently led to extreme quarantine measures including sealing off large cities, closing borders and confining people to their homes. Despite these efforts, as of April 28, there are 3,041,912 cases of COVID-19 and there have been 211,167 deaths in 210 countries [
