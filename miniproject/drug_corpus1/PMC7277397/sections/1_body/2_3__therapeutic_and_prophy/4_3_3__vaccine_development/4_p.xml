<p>Nucleic acid-based vaccines have become attractive alternatives to vaccines based on live attenuated or inactivated viruses. In this context, four plasmid DNA-based vaccine constructs were intradermally administered into C57BL/6 mice [
 <xref rid="B141-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. The pLL70 vector contained the SARS-CPoV S gene and the pcDNA-SS vector contained the codon-optimized SARS-CoV S gene fused with the leader sequence from the human CD5 gene. The pcDNA-St vector carried the N-portion of the codon-optimized S gene with the CD5 leader sequence and the pcDNA-St-VP22C contained the N-portion of the codon-optimized S with the CD5 leader sequence fused to the C-terminal of the bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1) VP22 protein, known to facilitate and enhance protein delivery [

Immunization studies revealed that pcDNA-SS and pcDNA-St-VP22C elicited superior cellular and humoral immune responses in mice and therefore represent the most immunogenic SARS vaccine candidates. Moreover, the DNA vaccine approach was verified targeting the SARS-CoV S protein using an improved plasmid DNA vector containing donor and acceptor splice sites and heterologous viral RNA export elements such as the constitutive transport element (CTE) and the post-transcriptional regulatory element (PRE) from Mason-Pfizer monkey virus and Woodchuck hepatitis virus, respectively [
