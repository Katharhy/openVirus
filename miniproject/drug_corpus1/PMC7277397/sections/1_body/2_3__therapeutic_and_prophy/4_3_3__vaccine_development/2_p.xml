<p>In the context of vaccine development, different computational and informatics tools play an essential role. For instance, the immune epitope database (IEDB) has been used to predict suitable MERS-CoV epitope vaccines against the most known world population alleles based on the S and E proteins [

The study showed that highly conserved sequences in the S and E proteins might be considered immunogenically protective and can elicit both neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses when reacting with B cells, T helper cell lymphocytes (HTLs) and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). In another approach, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was characterized to obtain immunogenic epitopes for vaccine development [

The epitopes were linked by specific linkers and docked to toll-like receptor-5 (TLR5), and immunoinformatics analysis was utilized for fast immunogenic profiling to accelerate vaccine development. In another immunoinformatics and computational approach, conserved B and T cell epitopes for the MERS-CoV S protein were identified [

The highest antigenicity score was obtained for the immensely immunogenic B cell epitope QLQMGFGITVQYGT. The T cell epitope peptides YKLQPLTFL (MHC-I) and YCILEPRSG (MHC-II) were also highly antigenic. These identified putative antigenic epitopes may prove effective for the development of novel vaccines. Using in silico approaches, two multi-epitope vaccines against MERS-CoV were designed by screening CTL and HTL epitopes from 13 different MERS-CoV proteins [

Both multi-epitope vaccines also carried potential B cell linear epitope regions, B cell discontinuous epitopes and interferon-γ-inducing epitopes. Moreover, human β-defensin-2 and β-defensin-3 were used as adjuvants for enhanced immune responses. The most potent CTL and HTL epitopes and adjuvants were linked by short peptide molecular linkers. Tertiary models for both multi-epitope vaccines were verified for their molecular interaction with TLR3 and cDNAs were generated for in silico analysis of expression in human cell lines before being tested in vivo as potential vaccine candidates.
