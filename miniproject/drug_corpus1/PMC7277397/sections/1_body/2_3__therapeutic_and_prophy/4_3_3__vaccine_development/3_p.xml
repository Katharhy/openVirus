<p>Computational approaches and immunoinformatics have provided strong support for vaccine development as described above. Moreover, structure–function studies have also contributed to the field. In this context, in comparison to antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain on the MERS-CoV S protein, less attention has been paid to antibodies targeting non-receptor-binding domain epitopes such as the neutralizing antibody G2, which targets the MERS-CoV N-terminal domain of S1 [

Structural and functional characterization of G2 alone or complexed with the MERS-CoV N-terminal of S1 demonstrated that G2 strongly disrupts the attachment of MERS-CoV S to the DDP4 receptor and could play an important role as a target for immunotherapy and vaccine development. In another approach, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) was applied for the human HCoV-NL63, providing a 3.4 Å resolution of the spike glycoprotein trimer essential for viral entry into host cells and representing the main target for neutralizing antibodies [

The structure revealed important components of the fusion process including the triggering loop and the C-terminal domains involved in the anchoring of the trimer to the viral membrane. The study also revealed that HCoV-NL63 use molecular trickery based on epitope masking with glycans and activating conformational changes in attempts to evade recognition by the host immune system. In another study, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was subjected to cryo-EM structure determination of the ectodomain trimer for the identification of potential targets for vaccines and viral entry inhibition as the furin cleavage site between the S1 and S1 subunits is unique for SARS-CoV-2 and not present in SARS-CoV or other related coronaviruses [

Related to the T cell epitopes, a population coverage analysis of associated MHC alleles was conducted, allowing the identification of a set of epitopes, which might provide a broad global coverage.
