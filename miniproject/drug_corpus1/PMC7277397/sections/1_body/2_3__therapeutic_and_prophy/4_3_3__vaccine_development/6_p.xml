<p>Cellular and viral vector-based expression systems play an important role in vaccine development. The large size of the CoV genome has complicated the construction of infectious clones for utilization in studies on basic viral processes and development of genetically defined vaccines [
 <xref rid="B156-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. In this context, bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) can provide a robust system for expression of viral RNA in the nucleus under the control of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter followed by RNA amplification by the viral replicase in the cytoplasm [

 <italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic> originating from swine [
 <xref rid="B145-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. Oral administration of 
 <italic>L. acidophilus</italic> in BALB/c mice induced significantly higher levels of S IgA antibodies compared to a commercial inactivated TGEV vaccine. The levels of TGEV-specific IgGs were similar but higher levels of interferon-Î³ were induced by the 
 <italic>L. acidophilus</italic> vaccine. Overall, the oral TGEV 
 <italic>L. acidophilus</italic> vaccine induced high levels of both mucosal and humoral immune responses. In another approach, a stable CHO cell line was engineered to express a subunit recombinant protein vaccine of residues 377-588 of the receptor-binding domain of the MERS-CoV S protein [
 <xref rid="B146-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. The vaccine has been demonstrated to elicit significant neutralizing antibody responses and can provide protection against MERS-CoV challenges in vaccinated animals. For stable expression, the IL-2 signal peptide was introduced in front of the S protein domain fused to the human IgG Fc fragment and transfected into an adherent dihydrofolate reductase-deficient CHO cell line. The adCHO-expressed fusion protein was secreted and showed functionality and binding specificity, and a suspension CHO cell line has been developed. Engineered transgenic mice with the DPP4 receptor susceptible to MERS-CoV were immunized with the S377-588-Fc subunit vaccine and adjuvant, which resulted in production of neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV and survival for at least 21 days after challenges with live MERS-CoV.
