<p>In the context of MERS-CoV the ORF1ab region encoding the replicase polyproteins plays a vital role in viral infection and therefore represents a suitable target for disease control. Four miRNA and five siRNA molecules were rationally designed by computational methods for silencing of nine different MERS-CoV strains for exploration of the treatment of MERS-CoV at the genomic level [

Recently, advanced nanotechnology based on lipids, polymers and inorganic compounds have been formulated [

In the context of porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), two short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-expressing plasmids targeting the M (pGenesil-M) and N (pGenesil-N) genes of PDCoV were evaluated in swine testicular (ST) cells [

Treatment with pGenesil-M and pGenesil-N resulted in a 13.2- and 32.4-fold titer reduction, respectively, and a 45.8% and 56.1% decrease in viral RNA, respectively. In another study, shRNAs targeting the M gene of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) and the N gene of PDCoV inhibited expression of each viral RNA over 98% [
