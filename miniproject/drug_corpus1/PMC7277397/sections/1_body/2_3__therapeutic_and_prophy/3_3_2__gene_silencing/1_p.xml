<p>Gene silencing based on RNA interference has proven to be an important tool in basic research but also for therapeutic applications [

 <xref rid="B117-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. The mechanism of RNAi relates to 19â€“23 base pair double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) mediating degradation of target RNA in a sequence-specific manner [

 <xref rid="biomedicines-08-00109-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). For instance, short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have been demonstrated to efficiently inhibit SARS-CoV replication in Vero E6 cells [

 <xref rid="B120-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Chemically synthesized siRNAs were transfected into fetal rhesus kidney FRhK4 cells before or after SARS-CoV infection and the inhibitory effects were verified by the decrease in intracellular viral genome copy number and viral titers. Four siRNAs demonstrated potent inhibition of SARS-CoV infection and replication. Prophylactic effects with up to 90% inhibition lasted at least for 72 h. Combination of siRNA duplexes from different regions of the viral genome provided up to 80% inhibition. Furthermore, siRNA duplexes have been shown to significantly suppress SARS-like symptoms in vivo in rhesus macaques [

 <xref rid="B122-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. It was further demonstrated that SARS-CoV infection was reduced in ACE2-silenced cell lines, providing an attractive approach for siRNA-based prophylactic or therapeutic strategies. Moreover, siRNA duplexes were applied to knock down expression of the actin-binding protein ezrin, which interacts with the SARS-CoV spike protein during the entry stage of infection [
