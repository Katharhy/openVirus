<p>Among therapeutics, the use of protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir as a combination therapy with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infections has provided durable virologic suppression and improved immunological outcomes [
 <xref rid="B84-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Lopinavir/ritonavir combination treatment was evaluated in marmosets with a MERS-like disease [
 <xref rid="B85-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. In comparison to mycophenolate mofetil (MFF), the treatment showed improved clinical, radiological and pathological outcomes and lower mean viral loads in necropsied lung and extrapulmonary tissues, whereas MFF-treated animals developed severe or fatal disease. Based on these results, a study protocol for a clinical trial for hospitalized adult MERS patients was prepared [
 <xref rid="B86-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. The goal is to investigate laboratory-confirmed MERS patients in a recursive, two-stage, multi-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized controlled trial. Related to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, a clinical trial on 99 patients receiving lopinavir and ritonavir were compared to 100 patients subjected to standard care. However, no difference in clinical improvement, mortality or detectable viral RNA was obtained [
 <xref rid="B87-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, the median time to clinical improvement was one day shorter for lopinavir/ritonavir treatment and although gastrointestinal adverse events were more common, serious adverse events were less frequent. Overall, the study indicated that the treatment offered no benefit compared to standard care. Another approach comprises the application of nucleoside analogues as antivirals [
 <xref rid="B88-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. For instance, several classes of nucleoside analogues were verified against SARS-CoV in Vero cells [
 <xref rid="B89-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. In the study, the D-isomer of thymine analogue exhibited strong anti-SARS-CoV activity and did not show any toxicity at the highest tested dosage of 100 µM. Although the L-cytosine analogue showed good activity, it exhibited strong toxicity to cells. Likewise, the 3′-azido-2′, 3′-unsaturated thymine analogue provided strong anti-SARS-CoV activity, but also significant toxicity. Additionally, dioxalane-thymine showed moderate antiviral activity without any significant cytotoxicity. Although C-nucleoside,4-amino-7-(β-L-ribofuranosylpyrrolo [3,2-D] pyrimidine hydrochloride inhibited SARS-CoV replication, it was cytotoxic. Overall, despite several classes of nucleoside analogues against SARS-CoV exhibiting moderate antiviral activity in vitro, no clear structure–activity relationship could be established. In another study, a series of doubly flexible nucleoside analogues were designed based on the acrylic sugar scaffold of acyclovir [
 <xref rid="B90-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. One compound displayed selective antiviral activity against HCoV-NL63 and MERS-CoV. In contrast, no activity was detected against SARS-CoV. In a study on FIP, the nucleoside analogue GS-441524, a precursor to the pharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate molecule, and acting as an alternative substrate and RNA chain terminator of viral RdRp was non-toxic and effectively inhibited FIPV replication in feline CRFK cells [
 <xref rid="B91-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Moreover, all ten cats treated with GS-441524 showed rapid reversal of disease symptoms in two weeks. In another approach, the guanosine analogue ribavirin was administered together with interferon-α2a in adult patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection and pneumonia needing ventilation support [
 <xref rid="B92-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. The study demonstrated that patients treated with ribavirin and interferon-α2a showed a significantly improved survival rate at 14 days but not at 28 days of treatment compared to the control group of patients. The adenosine nucleoside analogue remdesivir has proven efficient for inhibition of RNA viruses such as filoviruses, pneumoviruses and paramyxoviruses by targeting RdRp [
 <xref rid="B93-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Moreover, the antiviral activity of remdesivir has also been demonstrated for human endemic and zoonotic coronaviruses such as HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E [
 <xref rid="B94-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. In another study, it was shown that remdesivir potently inhibited RdRp from MERS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B95-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Very recently, it was demonstrated that remdesivir effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells and in human Huh-7 liver cancer cells known to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="B96-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. The first case of compassionate treatment of COVID-19 with intravenous administration of remdesivir took place in the US, leading to improvement in the patient’s condition with a decline in viral load [
 <xref rid="B97-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Neuraminidase inhibitors such as zanamivir, laninamivir, oseltamivir and peramivir have demonstrated potency against most influenza strains [
 <xref rid="B98-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. In this context, the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) were tested for inhibition of cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV in a cytopathic endpoint assay in Vero cells [
 <xref rid="B99-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. However, neither neuraminidase inhibitor showed any effect on SARS-CoV. Arbidol, a broad-spectrum antiviral agent against several DNA and RNA viruses, has been approved in Russia and China for prevention and treatment of influenza [
 <xref rid="B100-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Antiviral effect against Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus (WNV) and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) has been demonstrated in Vero cells [
 <xref rid="B100-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Furthermore, it was shown that arbidol can inhibit six different isolates of ZIKV and can protect against the cytopathic effects of ZIKV [
 <xref rid="B101-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Related to SARS-CoV, patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were treated with oral arbidol in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir or lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy [
 <xref rid="B102-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. After seven days, SARS-CoV could not be detected in nasopharyngeal specimens in 12 out of 16 patients subjected to the combination therapy compared to 6 out of 17 for the monotherapy group. The numbers at day 14 were 15 out of 16 for combination therapy and 9 out of 17 for monotherapy at day 14. Furthermore, CT scans revealed improvement for 11 out of 16 patients receiving the combination therapy, and 5 out of 17 receiving the monotherapy.
