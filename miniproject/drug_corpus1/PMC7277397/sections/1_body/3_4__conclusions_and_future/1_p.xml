<p>In summary, there are no efficient antiviral drugs or vaccines currently available for COVID-19. However, due to the extent of the current COVID-19 pandemic, it seems like the whole world has come together to conquer the outbreak. There seems to be enormous political and economic will to support research and development efforts in an unprecedented way. The positive outcome is that all avenues are explored including antiviral drugs in the form of existing drugs for other viral diseases, which should be subjected to thorough well-planned clinical evaluation. Moreover, new drugs targeting SARS-CoV receptors in the form of small molecules and monoclonal antibodies and gene silencing approaches preventing SARS-CoV replication are being explored.</p>
