<p>As drug development and particularly antiviral drugs used for other indications have seen a renaissance of clinical trials for COVID-19, it is appropriate to summarize recent clinical findings. In this context, remdesivir was applied for compassionate use in 53 hospitalized COVID-19 patientsâ€”of which, 22 were in the US, 22 in Europe or Canada and 9 in Japan [

The study indicated that Remdesivir was not associated with statistically significant clinical benefits although numerical reduction in time to clinical improvement was observed. On 29 April 2020, Gilead, the manufacturer of remdesivir, put out a press release on preliminary data on their phase III SIMPLE trials in COVID-19 patients [

The first of the two randomized, open-label, multicenter SIMPLE trials in 397 patients demonstrated that the time of clinical improvement for 50% of patients was 10 days in the group receiving intravenous remdesivir for 5 days and 11 days after 10 days of treatment compoared to 15 days for the control group and more than half of the patients in both groups were discharged from the hospital by day 14. The plan is to extend the study by enrolling an additional 5600 patients and conducting trials at 180 sites in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States. In the second SIMPLE trial, the safety and efficacy of 5- and 10-day dosing duration of intravenous remdesivir will be compared to standard of care treatment of COVID-19 patients with the first results expected by the end of May 2020.
