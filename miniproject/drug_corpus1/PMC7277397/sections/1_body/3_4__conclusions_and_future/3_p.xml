<p>Regarding hydroxychloroquine, initial clinical evaluation in 20 patients was conducted in France, as described earlier [

Although the study indicated some therapeutic effect of hydroxychloroquine and at least 80 trials on chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, or their combination with other drugs have been registered globally, one should be cautious, as many proposals are based on in vitro studies, animal models or experiences from other viral diseases [
 <xref rid="B172-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]. For instance, a Chinese trial in more than 100 patients demonstrated superiority of chloroquine phosphate compared to control treatment in inhibition of pneumonia exacerbation [

Moreover, in a placebo-controlled randomized trial of two different doses of hydroxychloroquine in 62 patients with radiological conformation of pneumonia, but without severe hypoxia, small improvements in body temperature and cough were registered only for the higher dose [
