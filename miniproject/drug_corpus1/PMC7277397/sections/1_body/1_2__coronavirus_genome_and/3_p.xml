<p>The coronavirus lifecycle is characterized by various steps including attachment and entry, expression of replicase proteins, replication and transcription, and assembly and release of mature viral particles (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomedicines-08-00109-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The initial attachment occurs between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 region of the S protein and its receptor. MHV uses an RBD at the N-terminus [

 <xref rid="B62-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The S proteinâ€“receptor interaction governs the virus tropism, which also reflects the targeting of different receptors by different coronaviruses. For instance, MHV targets carcinoembryonic antigen-related adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) [

After the initial attachment, acid-dependent proteolytic cleavage of the S protein by cathepsin or another protease occurs, followed by fusion in acidified endosomes or at the plasma membrane, which leads to the release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm [
