<p>The translation of the coronavirus replicase genes from two large open reading frames (ORFs), rep1a and rep1b, allows the expression of two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, utilizing a slippery sequence (5′-UUUAAAC-3′) and an RNA pseudoknot [

An interesting feature of coronavirus replication relates to the fusing of the leader and body TRS segments during the production of subgenomic RNAs. Although originally thought to occur during positive-strand synthesis, a recent model suggests that RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) pauses at any of the body TRS sequences during the discontinuous extension of negative-strand RNA, followed by either continued elongation to the next TRS or switching to amplification of the leader sequence at the 5′ end [
