<p>In the context of assembly, the viral structural proteins S, E, and M are translated and transported along secretory pathways into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the ERâ€“Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) [

 <xref rid="B77-biomedicines-08-00109" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. At the ERGIC, viral genomes surrounded by N protein participate in the formation of mature virions [

An interesting observation relates to coronaviruses assembled without the S protein, which leads to the formation of giant multi-nucleated cells spreading the virus within an infected organism without being detected or neutralized by virus-specific antibodies [
