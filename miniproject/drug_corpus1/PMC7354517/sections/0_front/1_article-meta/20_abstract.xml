 <p>Infections due to arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses) have dramatically increased worldwide during the last few years. In humans, symptoms associated with acute infection of most arboviruses are often described as “dengue-like syndrome”, including fever, rash, conjunctivitis, arthralgia, and muscular symptoms such as myalgia, myositis, or rhabdomyolysis. In some cases, muscular symptoms may persist over months, especially following flavivirus and alphavirus infections. However, in humans the cellular targets of infection in muscle have been rarely identified. Animal models provide insights to elucidate pathological mechanisms through studying viral tropism, viral-induced inflammation, or potential viral persistence in the muscle compartment. The tropism of arboviruses for muscle cells as well as the viral-induced cytopathic effect and cellular alterations can be confirmed in vitro using cellular models. This review describes the link between muscle alterations and arbovirus infection, and the underlying mechanisms.</p>
