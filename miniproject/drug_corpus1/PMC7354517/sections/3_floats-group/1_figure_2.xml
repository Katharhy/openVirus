  <p>In vitro infection of human myoblasts by Chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Human myoblasts in culture were inoculated with CHIKV (strain from La Reunion outbreak, 2006), at a multiplicity of infection of 1, as described in Ozden et al. (2007). Twenty-four hours later, infection was assessed by immunofluorescence using a mouse serum directed towards CHIKV, and a secondary goat anti-mouse monoclonal antibody coupled to FITC. Magnification: 400Ã—.</p>
