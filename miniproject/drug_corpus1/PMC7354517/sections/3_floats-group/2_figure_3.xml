  <p>Proposed model for arboviral-induced muscle cell alteration leading to muscle disorders. Muscle cell alteration may include infection of myoblasts and/or myotubes, according to different Arboviruses. Infection may induce the release of cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, MCP-1, IFN-γ, MIF, IL-6, Rantes…), macrophage recruitment and CD8+ T lymphocytes activation. These events may lead to cytopathic effect, dysregulation of myogenesis, and may inhibit the self-renewal of muscle progenitor cells. Alternatively, or in addition, cytotoxicity may send molecular signals to attract inflammatory cells. Abbreviations. CHIKV: Chikungunya virus; SINV: Sindbis virus; ZIKV: Zika virus; DENV: dengue virus; CTL: cytotoxic T lymphocyte.</p>
