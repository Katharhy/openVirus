<p>Ross River virus is considered as the prototype among the arthrogenic alphaviruses, and is one of the most studied arboviruses for muscular alterations. Several works have provided models to study the pathogenesis of RRV (

 <xref rid="B66-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], and inflammation was detected in skeletal muscle as well as in bones and joints [
 <xref rid="B67-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In a mouse model, lacking a functional T-cell response, described by Burrack and colleagues, histological analysis confirmed inflammation and, most interestingly, viral RNA was detected in muscle tissue with an important titer, which confirms the role of T-cells in the control of RRV infection in a tissue specific manner [
