<p>Concerning NHPs, the macaque seems to be an appropriate model, especially to detect the persistence of ZIKV RNA in muscle [

Indeed, in this study, after ZIKV infection of a macaque model, in addition to the observation of viremia, the viral genome could be detected by RT-PCR for up to 35 days post-infection in different tissues including muscle and joint, although it is not clear if replication occurred in muscle cells or in cells involved in inflammation [
