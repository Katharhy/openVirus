<p>Since the re-emergence and associated epidemics of ZIKV in 2016, many studies have been carried out to develop animal models [

 <xref rid="B93-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], mainly based on mice and NHPs. Indeed, these models have been crucial to clarify the large tropism of ZIKV, not only towards the central nervous system, but also for other tissues, including muscle. Mouse models of ZIKV infection include adult and neonate animals, either immunocompetent or immunocompromised, as recently reviewed by Morrison and Diamond [
