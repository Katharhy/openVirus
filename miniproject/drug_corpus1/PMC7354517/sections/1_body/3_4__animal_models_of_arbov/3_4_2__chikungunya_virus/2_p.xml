<p>In the immunodeficient IFNAR−/− mice, successfully used as a model for CHIKV infection [
 <xref rid="B64-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], CHIKV was shown to replicate in the epimysium (i.e., muscle fascia) of skeletal muscle. Fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, and, less frequently, satellite cells but not myotubes were shown to be infected [

 <xref rid="B80-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Recently, a mouse model was also employed to elucidate mechanisms of pathogenesis of CHIKV in muscle by using an engineered virus, which allows one to follow viral replication in muscle cells [
