<p>Pathogenesis of the inflammatory myopathy (myositis) related to CHIKV infection was studied in mice and non-human primates (NHPs) [

 <xref rid="B73-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Several mouse models, such as IFNAR−/−, new-born CD-1, C57BL/6, and others, were shown to develop myositis upon infection with CHIKV [

 <xref rid="B75-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Inoculation of CHIKV in mice provoked myositis, together with arthritis and tenosynovitis [
 <xref rid="B75-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]; tissue damage and inflammation in both muscle and joint were observed in parallel with viremia [
 <xref rid="B65-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. In the model developed by Dhanwany and colleagues, based on new-born mice, muscle degeneration related to viral infection was reported [
 <xref rid="B74-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Infected mice could develop a muscle pathology, with cell infiltrates and viral replication within the muscle, although specific target cells were not characterized [
 <xref rid="B74-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. In the model described by Nair and colleagues which was focused on the role of interferon in controlling viral replication, the presence of viral RNA was observed in muscle cells by in situ hybridization [
 <xref rid="B76-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. In addition, a co-staining of CHIKV envelope protein E2 antigen and fibroblast vimentin was observed [
