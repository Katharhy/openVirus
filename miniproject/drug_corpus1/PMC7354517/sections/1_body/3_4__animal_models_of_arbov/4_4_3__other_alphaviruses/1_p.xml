<p>Other reports concern different alphaviruses. Interestingly, in a new-born mouse model of SINV infection, viral RNA was also detected in muscle [
 <xref rid="B85-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. In the case of Barmah Forest virus, this latter has been reported to cause myositis and replicate in muscle, even if to a lower extent than RRV [
 <xref rid="B86-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. More recently, a mouse model of myositis (and arthritis) induced by Mayaro virus (MAYV) has been developed, showing virus-induced muscle inflammation, fiber degeneration, and regeneration similar to what has been observed for CHIKV and RRV. Moreover, viral replication was shown to occur within muscle tissue [
 <xref rid="B87-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. IFNAR−/− and RAG−/− mouse models were employed to investigate the role of both type I interferon response and adaptive immunity in MAYV replication and muscular inflammation [
 <xref rid="B88-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Finally, another (non-human) alphavirus, not transmitted by arthropods, i.e., the sleeping disease virus that infects salmonids, has been shown to target selectively the satellite cells in muscle of rainbow trout (
 <italic>Oncorhyncus mykiss</italic>) which had been experimentally infected [
