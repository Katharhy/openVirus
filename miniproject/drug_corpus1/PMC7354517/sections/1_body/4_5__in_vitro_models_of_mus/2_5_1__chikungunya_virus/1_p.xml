<p>Since the emergence of the CHIKV, its tropism has been investigated in several cell types [
 <xref rid="B101-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>], although initially not a lot of attention was given to muscle as a possible target. One of the first studies, carried out by our group to elucidate the tropism of CHIKV for muscle cells, showed the presence of viral antigens ex vivo on biopsies from two infected patients [
