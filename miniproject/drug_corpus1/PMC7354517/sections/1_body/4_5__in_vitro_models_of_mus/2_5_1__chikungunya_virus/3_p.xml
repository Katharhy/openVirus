<p>Indeed, muscle satellite cells together with fibroblasts, osteoblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages would be among the cells targeted during acute infection of CHIKV [

However, these observations are in contrast with the previous observations from Ozden and colleagues on muscle cells, as well as the study from Sourisseau et al. that showed the infection patterns were not affected by the type of CHIKV strain on several cell lines [
