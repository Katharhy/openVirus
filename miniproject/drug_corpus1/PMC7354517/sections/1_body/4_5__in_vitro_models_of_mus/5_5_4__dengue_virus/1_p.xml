<p>Human muscle satellite cells have been shown to be susceptible to DENV, independently from the serotype employed [
 <xref rid="B99-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>], as shown by detection of both viral RNA and antigens following infection. Additional studies have more recently demonstrated that DENV is able to productively infect differentiated myotubes [
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Permissiveness of a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line (RD) to DENV-2 has also been demonstrated [
