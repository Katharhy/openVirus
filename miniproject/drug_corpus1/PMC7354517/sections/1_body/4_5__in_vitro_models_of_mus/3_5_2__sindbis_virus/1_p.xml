<p>Sindbis virus, one of the most common and studied arbovirus in Europe [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], has been shown to successfully infect both primary human myoblasts and myotubes in vitro, with detection of viral antigens and observation of cytopathic effects on infected cells [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, it has not yet been fully elucidated as to whether different strains of SINV are equally pathogenic in muscle [
