<p>Cell culture still remains an essential tool of investigation in virology. It is well-known that many tissues can harbor arboviruses, but there is still a need to more precisely clarify the tropism for the cells of the musculo-skeletal system, by defining which specific cells are the targets of the viruses, and whether the tropism is restricted by cell or viral factors. 
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00616-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> illustrates the cell models which have been developed.
