<p>Muscle pain does not only concern the acute phase of the infection, as it can persist beyond it [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]; in a follow-up study on DENV infected patients, more than 60% (20, 
 <italic>N</italic> = 31) of patients still suffered from myalgia, two months following their hospitalization [

 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and arthralgias were still present in 25% of infected patients after three years [
