<p>In humans, arboviruses are associated with several diseases; according to a traditional classification, they can be described as hemorrhagic (e.g., dengue virus (DENV)), encephalitic/neurotropic (e.g., West Nile virus (WNV), Zika virus (ZIKV)) or arthrogenic (e.g., Ross River virus (RRV), Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Sindbis virus (SINV)). However, overlapping symptoms are often observed, thus making it difficult to discriminate these diseases into specific groups.</p>
