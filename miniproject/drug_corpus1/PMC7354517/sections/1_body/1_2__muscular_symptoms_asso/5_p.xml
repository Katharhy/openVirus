<p>Of note, myositis may occur following infection from arthrogenic (e.g., RRV, CHIKV, SINV), encephalitic/neurotropic (e.g., WNV, ZIKV, tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV)), or hemorrhagic arboviruses (e.g., DENV). Neurogenic myositis was reported to be associated with WNV, CHIKV, and ZIKV, as a consequence of polio-like, transverse myelitis, and Guillain-Barré syndromes, respectively [

 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Myositis has been described in one case report during CHIKV infection [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and in two CHIKV positive patients with detection of infected cells (satellite cells, i.e., muscle progenitor cells) in muscle, in one of them several months post-infection [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Severe myalgia and acute myositis have also been described in DENV-infected patients. For example, in one study, 15 cases were reported [
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], in another seven cases, two of them with a lethal outcome [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In a case report, myositis persisted for two months in a DENV-infected patient [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Arboviral-induced myositis has also been reported during childhood after DENV [

 <xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] or TBEV [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] infection. A more severe outcome occurring during some arboviral infections is rhabdomyolysis, as reported in DENV, WNV, CHIKV, and tick-borne Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus-infected patients [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,

 <xref rid="B46-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Interestingly, in a large-scale study during the 2014–2015 CHIKV epidemics in French Guiana, three of the 285 infected hospitalized patients exhibited rhabdomyolysis [
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Of note, such arboviral induced rhabdomyolysis can lead to acute renal failure with possible fatal outcome [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
