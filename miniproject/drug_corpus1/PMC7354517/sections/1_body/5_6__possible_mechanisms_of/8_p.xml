<p>Proteomic studies of arbovirus infection have also been developed to study pathogenesis in muscle: a study using a mouse infected with CHIKV showed that muscle damage is correlated with a variation of the cellular proteome following infection, especially concerning proteins related to energy and iron metabolism, stress (heat-shock proteins), structure (actin, vimentin, myosin) and inflammation [

Proteomic studies have been performed on a rhabdomyosarcoma muscle cell line (SJCRH30) infected with CHIKV; in this work Issac and colleagues proposed that some cell proteins, such as vimentin (a cytoskeleton protein involved in maintaining cell structure), could play a role in regulating CHIKV pathogenesis, by interacting with the viral protein nsP3, a part of the CHIKV replication complex [
 <xref rid="B96-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Vimentin would support CHIKV replication, as confirmed by inhibition of infection following silencing of its expression (siRNA). Interestingly, vimentin is expressed in myoblasts, but its expression is down-regulated in myotubes. However, the limit of this study stays in the use of a cell line rather than primary cells, with the latter being more appropriate to conclude on the validity of the proposed mechanism in muscle compartment in vivo.
