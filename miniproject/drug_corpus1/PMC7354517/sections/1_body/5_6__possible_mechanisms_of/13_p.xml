<p>The persistence of arboviruses in the muscle compartment is a question of major concern [

 <xref rid="B109-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Indeed, clinical muscular symptoms may remain after the acute phase, e.g., in DENV infection where myalgia persisted in 60% of patients [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], as in SINV six months after infection [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Interestingly, concerning the question of persistence, as observed during experimental infection of Cynomolgus macaque with CHIKV, viral RNA could be detected in muscle up to 45 days post-infection [
 <xref rid="B83-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Similarly, during experimental infection of Rhesus macaque with ZIKV, the presence of viral RNA was detected in muscle at 35 days post-infection [
 <xref rid="B90-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Of note, in one patient infected by CHIKV in La RÃ©union in 2006, viral antigens were detected by immunohistochemistry in the quadriceps, in satellite cells, as late as over 90 days after the acute phase of infection [
