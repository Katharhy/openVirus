<p>Another mechanism potentially involved in arbovirus-induced myositis is the direct infection of muscle cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00616-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Up until now, only one report has clearly demonstrated the infection of muscle by arboviruses in human skeletal muscle biopsies; during the chikungunya outbreak in La RÃ©union, in 2006, immunohistochemistry studies on muscle biopsies from two infected patients revealed that satellite cells were selectively infected by CHIKV, while myotubes were not [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, as stated before, in animal models, viral RNAs/antigens could be retrieved in the muscle compartment, as shown for RRV [

 <xref rid="B89-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Interestingly, in CHIKV animal models, satellite cells were found to be infected [
 <xref rid="B64-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], as well as myofibroblasts [
 <xref rid="B64-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], and, to a lesser extent and only for one viral strain, myofibers [
 <xref rid="B80-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. However, whether infected satellite cells can transfer the viral genome to fibers in vivo during myonuclear turnover or regeneration is not clear. Of note, when human primary myoblasts are infected in vitro by arboviruses, a clear cytopathic effect can be observed; in dengue-infected myoblasts, a pronounced cytoplasmic vacuolization has been reported [
 <xref rid="B99-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>], as well as in other cell types during flavivirus infection [
 <xref rid="B106-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. A strong cytopathic effect was also detected in myoblasts infected by CHIKV [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B94-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>,
 <xref rid="B95-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>], as well as by other alphaviruses: in the case of SINV, a disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton as well as cell rounding and detachment was observed [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]; concerning the rainbow trout alphavirus, a cytopathic effect was also observed, characterized by scattered foci of rounded cells [
 <xref rid="B92-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Since satellite cells/myoblasts are involved in myogenesis, regeneration and muscle fiber repair, it is tempting to hypothesize that such a cytopathic effect may have deleterious consequences on muscle integrity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00616-f003">Figure 3</xref>). In particular, a chronic infection could lead, through the cytopathic effect on satellite cells/myoblasts, to a depletion of these progenitor cells during successive cycles of degeneration and regeneration of the muscle fibers.
