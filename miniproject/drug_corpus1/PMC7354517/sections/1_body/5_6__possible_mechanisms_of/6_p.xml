<p>Another study suggested the role of macrophages for development of myositis associated with RRV [
 <xref rid="B71-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] by the action of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a factor indicating the activation of macrophages, as shown in a mouse model in which a higher level of MIF was correlated with higher inflammation (by modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines) and severity of disease (more cell infiltrates and more muscle disruption). In a second study by the same author, the role of CD74 was also demonstrated, in particular as regulator of apoptosis of recruited cells at the site of inflammation [

 <xref rid="B79-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. For RRV, it was also suggested that the pathogenesis of myositis may be related to complement activation pathways [

 <xref rid="B77-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]; in particular, the mannose binding lectin (MBL) would affect the expression of inflammatory mediators within the RRV infected muscle, thus contributing to tissue destruction and disease [

In the study from Nair and colleagues, the use of a mutant mice (Irf1−/−) depleted for interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) and infected with RRV and CHIKV, confirmed the role of the interferon early response to control virus replication and its role in virus spreading, inflammation and finally the pathogenesis [
 <xref rid="B76-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. When the IFN response was blunted, the muscle pathology was more severe. This study suggested an interplay between viral infection and inflammation and the role of the IFN response for establishing pathogenesis in muscle [
 <xref rid="B76-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Similar behavior was observed for type I interferon response during MAYV infection [
 <xref rid="B88-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]; in the same study, the role of adaptive immunity was investigated, suggesting a specificity for such alphavirus among the others [
