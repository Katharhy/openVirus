<p>Altogether, this review provides insights on the link between arbovirus infection and muscle alterations. If musculo-skeletal signs can frequently be clinically observed during arbovirus infection in humans, this remains often limited within the description of the general symptomatology of Dengue-like state, and has not been specifically investigated. It remains complex to discriminate the specific mechanisms underlying such failure. Animal and cellular models, especially those based on human primary cells, can be of support to investigate at this scope.</p>
