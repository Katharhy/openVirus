<p>Although the studies which have been carried on skeletal muscle infection by arboviruses suggest an etiological link with the observed myopathic syndromes, some aspects of muscle tropism still need to be elucidated; in particular, the exact nature of the target cells must be better characterized for their full susceptibility to arboviruses, e.g., by confirming the presence of specific receptors and/or entry factors in muscle cells, as well as the mechanisms of entry into the cells [
