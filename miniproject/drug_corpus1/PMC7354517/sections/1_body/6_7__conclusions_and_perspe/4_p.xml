<p>Another peculiar feature of muscle cell susceptibility to arboviral infection is the differential permissiveness of muscle cells according to their state of differentiation, e.g., myoblasts being sensitive to CHIKV infection and not myotubes, whereas myoblasts as well as myotubes seem to be susceptible to Sindbis virus infection. This remains an intriguing point concerning both the differential susceptibility of muscle cells to different arboviruses, as well as the different molecular actors involved in a potential transition from arbovirus susceptibility to resistance to infection during differentiation.</p>
