<p>Symptoms associated with acute infection of most arboviruses are often described as “dengue-like syndrome”, including fever, rash, conjunctivitis, arthralgia, and muscular symptoms such as myalgia, myositis, and rhabdomyolysis. Myalgia, defined as muscle pain, is a non-specific symptom that can be found during the dengue-like syndrome of acute infection of almost all arboviruses. Myopathy is generally defined as a pathological alteration of the muscle; many different types of myopathies exist, with a variable level of clinical outcome, from benign to lethal. Rhabdomyolysis can have many causes, including drug or other toxicity, and can be associated to renal failure. Inflammatory myopathies are defined as myositis. Several types of myositis have been defined, according to the mechanisms leading to their development [

In viral myositis, inflammation is associated with the migration of inflammatory cells following viral infection, commonly defined as the immune cell infiltrate. For myositis related to autoimmune disease, it is not yet clear how viral infection interplays with the development of an auto-immune response [
