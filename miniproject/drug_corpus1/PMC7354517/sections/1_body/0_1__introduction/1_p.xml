<p>The arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses) represent one of the best examples of viral emergence [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], since their burden has dramatically increased over the last few years [

 <xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,

 <xref rid="B5-viruses-12-00616" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Their emergence and re-emergence at the global level may be caused by several factors: environment (climate change, deforestation); virus evolution, such as acquisition or increase of virulence (genetic changes); and vector properties (geographical expansion of mosquito vectors, increase in mosquito anthropophily), human host (human behavior, globalization, overpopulation.)
