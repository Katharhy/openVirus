<p>Existing literature was first searched in PubMed database by using keywords ‘arbovirus’ alternatively combined with ‘muscle’, ‘myositis’, ‘myocarditis’, ‘rhabdomyolysis’, and ‘human’, ‘animal model’, ‘mice’, ‘model’, and ‘cell’, respectively. Then, the same was done with distinct genus’ and species’ names of arbovirus (e.g., 
 <italic>alphavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic>, Chikungunya, Zika, dengue). Selection of published works was made according to more detailed provided descriptions: for human studies, included works were chosen according to the suggestion of causality factor (etiology) between arbovirus infection and muscle failure in clinical studies; for in vivo and in vitro studies, the strategy for selecting publications was done according to the indication of occurrence of arbovirus infection in muscle compartment. In very few cases, responding to such requirements, works found on Google Search were also included.
