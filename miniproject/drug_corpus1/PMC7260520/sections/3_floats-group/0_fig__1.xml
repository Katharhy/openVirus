   <bold>Cumulative perspective of potential COVID-19 treatments based on three clinical stage classification.</bold> Symptomatic treatment is a basic step in all clinical stages of the disease, with oxygen therapy here reflecting all interventions that may be needed from nasal cannula to mechanical ventilation. While some argue that antiviral therapy (especially Remdesivir) could be considered for some patients in Stage I of the disease, other preserve it for the Stage II patients. Ribavirin and IFNα-2b in particular, in our opinion shouldn’t be considered in the management of Stage I. More severe cases (Stage III) need more extensive interventions by adding immunomodulatory treatments to the previous management steps in the attempt to contain the hyperinflammatory response.

  <p>*These treatments might also be investigated in both stage II and III.</p>
  <p>**These treatments might also be investigated in stage III.</p>
  <p>***These treatments are mainly investigated in stage III.</p>
