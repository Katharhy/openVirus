   <bold>Mechanism of action of drugs under investigation: Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Hydroxychloroquine, Remdisivir, and Tocilizumab</bold>. 
   <bold>1:</bold> SARS-CoV-2 attaches to the ACE2 receptor on human epithelial cells in order to gain entry to them. Once attached, it activates the TMPRSS2 which leads towards S protein activation by proteolytic cleavage. Camostat Mesylate is a therapeutic agent that inhibits TMPRSS2. 
   <bold>2 and 3:</bold> Endosomes, then, transfer the complex (virus-receptor) into the cell and 
   <bold>4:</bold> releases the virus genome (RNA) which undergoes 
   <bold>5 and 6</bold> translation and transcription using the targeted cell transcription system. Remdisivir inhibits polymerase, while Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/RTV) inhibits protease; the two fundamental enzymes during viral replication. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) targets several levels of viral infection. It changes the glycosylation of ACE2 to inhibit virus entry. Being a weak base, it also affects endosomal activity by increasing, the pH of acidic intracellular organelles. Finally, it interferes with RNA replication by targeting the polymerase. In severe and critical cases, macrophage activation leads to an uncontrolled and lethal inflammatory process known as “cytokine storm syndromes” driven by the release of multiple cytokines; IL-6 plays a key role in this process. Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the IL-6 Receptor which might mitigate the inflammatory response.
