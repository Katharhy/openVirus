 <xref rid="bib0390" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], authors reported the data of 10 severe COVID-19 patients who didn’t respond to a combination of low-dose corticosteroid (40−80 mg/d) and immunoglobulin (10 g/d) but have significantly improved after receiving a short-term moderated dose of corticosteroid (160 mg/d) plus immunoglobulin (20 g/d). Again, all patients received concomitant therapies including oxygen therapy, antiviral treatment, and antibiotic treatment.
