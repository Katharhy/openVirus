<p id="par0095">Lopinavir (LPV) is a human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitor which is administered in combination with the “booster” ritonavir (RTV), a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor that increases LPV half-life. Even though LPV/RTV was effective against SARS-CoV in tissue cultures, its efficacy against MERS-CoV was controversial. Results of a randomized, controlled, open-label trial that evaluated Lopinavir–Ritonavir vs. standard of care treatment in adults hospitalized adults with severe COVID-19 were recently published [

The two arms of this study included 199 confirmed COVID-19 patients and showed similar 28-day mortality rates and viral load at varying times since onset of symptoms. This study also showed withdrawal of medication in 13 patients in the LPV group due to adverse events (
