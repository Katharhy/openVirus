<p id="par0090">Remdesivir is a phosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine C–nucleoside that targets the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) proteins. Working as a nucleotide analogue, this drug has proved its broad-spectrum antiviral activity including the effect against several human and zoonotic coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2. Since human safety data for Remdesivir are available from several clinical trials that tested Remdesivir’s efficacy against Ebola virus, several clinical trials are already being held in the United States and China to investigate its efficacy treating COVID-19 patients [

In a cohort study that included 61 severe COVID-19 patients from different countries, using Remdesivir (200 mg IV. on day 1, then 100 mg daily for 9 days) led to a clinical improvement in 63 % of patients with a median follow-up of 18 days. The total mortality rate in this study was 13 % [
