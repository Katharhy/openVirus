<p id="par0220">This is the most severe stage in this disease stage classification and luckily it concerns a fewer number of patients with ARDS and cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) being the hallmark of the pathogenesis [

 <xref rid="bib0370" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. In these severe cases, virus replication and tissue damage continue, especially in the lungs and other ACE2 expressing organs, which leads to an even higher increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines released by macrophages and granulocytes [

 <xref rid="bib0265" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. High levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin 1b (IL-1b), IFN-c, IP-10, MCP-1, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), IL-4, and IL-10 are reported in patients infected with COVID-19. In addition, in severe cases of COVID-19 admitted to the ICU the following are present: increased IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, and IL-10; fibroblast growth factor (FGF); granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF); IP-10; macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP1A); tumor necrosis factor (TNFÎ±). The cytokine profile in these severe cases indicates cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) which is a life-threatening condition that leads to ARDS the main cause of death in critically ill COVID-19 patients [
