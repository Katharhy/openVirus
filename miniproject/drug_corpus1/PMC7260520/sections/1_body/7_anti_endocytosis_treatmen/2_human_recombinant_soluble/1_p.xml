<p id="par0115">ACE2 was identified as a key receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Data regarding the interaction between COVID-19 severity and Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor inhibition is conflict, and contrary theories have been proposed so far [

Initially, concerns were raised on the basis that ACEIs and ARBs led to an increase in the number of ACE2 receptors in the cardiopulmonary circulation in experimental animals, and that this might lead to more severe outcomes due to SARS-CoV-2 infection [

And some data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 down-regulates ACE2 expression after initial engagement with the receptor. This down-regulation of ACE2 activity in the lungs might facilitate lung injury. In a recent in-vitro study hrsACE2 was shown to significantly block early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infections [
