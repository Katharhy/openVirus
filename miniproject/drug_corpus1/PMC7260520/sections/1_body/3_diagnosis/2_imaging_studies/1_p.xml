<p id="par0050">Chest computerized tomography (CT-scan) seems to have high sensitivity in all cases -including severe ones- in epidemic areas. The most common patterns on chest CT scans are ground-glass opacity, consolidation, bilateral patchy shadowing and peripheral and diffuse distribution. In one Chinese study, radiological changes were detected up to 5.1 ± 1.5 days before PCR turned positive in pharyngeal swabs, demonstrating a sensitivity of 97 % with low specificity of 25 %. The positive predictive value of CT scans is 65 %, and the negative predictive value is 83 % with the note that this study was conducted in Wuhan, China, the center of the epidemic, meaning these values might change in non-epidemic areas [
