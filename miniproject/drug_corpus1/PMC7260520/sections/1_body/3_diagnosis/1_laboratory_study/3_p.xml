<p id="par0045">Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) remains the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, its sensitivity varies widely depending on the specimensâ€™ type with the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens demonstrating the highest sensitivity (93 %) while the reported sensitivity of the sputum (72 %), nasal (63 %) and pharyngeal (32 %) swabs are lower in sensitivity. Other concomitant samples (i.e. blood, feces, etc.) have been proposed as a way to improve sensitivity during COVID-19 diagnosis [

Some novel tests, like the rapid test using either by antigen or antibodies detection alongside enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) testing for antibodies are available in some settings and seem to be effective and also have acceptable sensitivity and specificity [
