<p id="par0075">After an incubation period, SARS-CoV-2 invades the mucosal membranes, especially nasal and oral-pharyngeal membranes, causing upper respiratory infection with mild symptoms in the first phase. The virus binds to target cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This activates the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming (
