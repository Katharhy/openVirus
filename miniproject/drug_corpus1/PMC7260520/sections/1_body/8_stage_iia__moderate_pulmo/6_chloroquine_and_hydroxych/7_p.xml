<p id="par0185">On the other hand, data emerging from other ongoing Chinese trials have demonstrated that CQ phosphate is superior to a control treatment in the following areas: pneumonia exacerbation inhibition, imaging findings improvement, virus negative conversion promoting, and disease course shortening [

 <xref rid="bib0320" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0325" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. In these studies, researchers investigated the efficacy of HCQ in combination with azithromycin for the treatment of confirmed COVID-19 patients. In the first study, a significant reduction in viral carriage on day 6 post inclusion compared to control group was noticed. Meanwhile, the second study reports a rapid fall in nasopharyngeal viral load on day 7 (83 %) and day 8 (93 %) which was confirmed by PCR. In addition, virus cultures were negative in 97.5 % patients on day 5. This allowed rapid discharge with a mean length of stay of five days. HCQ dosage used in these studies was 600â€‰mg per day for 10 days.
