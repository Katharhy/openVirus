<p id="par0170">A pilot randomized Chinese study [
 <xref rid="bib0295" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] investigated HCQ in 30 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Fifteen patients received 400 mg of HCQ per day for 5 days, while others received the conventional treatment. The primary endpoint was COVID-19 nucleic acid negativity in respiratory pharyngeal swab on day 7 after randomization. The results were comparable between the study and the control group as of day 7. Throat swabs were negative in 13 (86.7 %) cases in the HCQ group and in 14 (93.3 %) cases in the control group (P ＞ 0.05). Furthermore, the median duration from hospitalization to virus nucleic acid negative conversion and the median time for body temperature normalization were also comparable between the two groups.
