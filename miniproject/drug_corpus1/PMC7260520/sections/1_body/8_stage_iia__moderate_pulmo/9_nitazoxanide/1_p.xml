<p id="par0215">Nitazoxanide has shown in vitro activity against SARS CoV-2 with known broad antiviral activity against other viruses like influenza and rotavirus. The mechanism of action is believed to be due to interference with viral replication by targeting host regulated pathways rather than virus-specific pathways. In addition to its antiviral activity, it inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-, IL-2, IL-4, I-5, IL-6, IL-8 and IL10. No clinical information is yet available on the efficacy of Nitazoxanide in the treatment of COVID-19 [
