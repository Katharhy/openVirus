<p>K65R, K70RT, and M184IV were the most common of the NRTI resistance mutations we observed, particularly among the risk group of MSM living in Cologne and Hannover, indicating potential resistance to preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with tenofovir/emtricitabine. Such resistance might be an upcoming challenge as PrEP use increases. Monitoring for HIV infections with these mutations is of utmost importance for preventing an epidemic among high-risk PrEP users; one mitigation is to consider alternative PrEP regimens in regions with high resistance.</p>
