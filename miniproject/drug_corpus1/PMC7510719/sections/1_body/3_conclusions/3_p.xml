<p>Our study had several limitations. First, our sample population could have been biased because participants were not randomly selected; our dataset was limited to ART-naive patients who received an HIV diagnosis at 7 university hospitals during 2001â€“2018. Although we know no reason why a university hospital setting would not be representative of the region, it is possible that populations treated outside these centers may have different transmission networks and risks; results are not generalizable to the entire regions or nationwide. Second, mixing of heterosexual patients and MSM in clusters may be due to missing single or multiple risk factors. Thus, their role could not be represented in the transmission networks. Third, we have not tested clinical correlates and drug resistance; the clinical relevance was inferred from the Stanford database.</p>
