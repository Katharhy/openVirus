<p>Transmission network analyses revealed that 20.7% (289/1,397) of participants had a putative linkage forming 102 transmission clusters. The largest cluster included 12 participants, mostly MSM from Bonn, Cologne, Munich, and Frankfurt (

Participants &lt;25 years and 25–45 years of age were significantly more likely to cluster compared with participants &gt;45 years (&lt;25 years, adjusted OR [aOR] 4.38, 95% CI 2.55–7.52, p&lt;0.001; 25–45 years, aOR 1.91, 95% CI 1.36–2.678; p&lt;0.001). Participants infected with HIV-1 subtype B were more likely to cluster than those with non-B subtype (aOR 4.05, 95% CI 2.37–6.90; p&lt;0.001). Geospatial distribution differed; participants from Bonn were linked significantly more often than those from Cologne (aOR 1.63; 95% CI 1.06–2.49; p = 0.025), even though the cities are geographically close (
