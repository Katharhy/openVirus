<p>We identified an overall prevalence of any DRM at the time of diagnosis, excluding polymorphic mutations, of 17.8% (95% CI 15.7%–19.8%), 248/1,397 participants. The proportion varied significantly (p&lt;0.001) by region, ranging from 9.1% (95% CI 5%–13%; 21/231) in Munich, up to 31.4% (95% CI 24%–38%; 53/169) in Hannover. Resistance mutations associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (172/1,397; 12.3%) were most frequent, followed by nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) (124/1,397; 8.9%). The most common single mutations related to NNRTIs were K103N (31/124; 25.0%), and G190A (8/124; 6.5%). Of the NRTI resistance mutations, M41L (25/172; 14.5%), and T215S (18/172; 10.5%) were most frequently observed (
