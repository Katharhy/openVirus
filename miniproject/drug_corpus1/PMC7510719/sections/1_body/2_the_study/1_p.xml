<p>We analyzed HIV-1 partial 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences (HXB2 position 2550–3356), obtained as part of clinical routine care, and sociodemographic data of PLWH who received HIV care at the university hospitals of Bonn, Cologne, Frankfurt, Hamburg, and Hannover and at 2 hospitals in Munich during 2001–2018. Patients could participate in the study if they had recently received their diagnosis of HIV-1 and were ART naive; this conservative approach excluded participants for whom the exact start date of ART or history of prior ART was not accurately documented.
