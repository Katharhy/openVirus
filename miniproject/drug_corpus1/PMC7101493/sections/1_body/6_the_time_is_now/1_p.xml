<p>Despite huge progress, many unanswered questions remain in the DAA era. Insufficient focus has been given to the potential rise in resistance to DAAs; many continue to consider the threat of drug resistance to be negligible despite growing evidence to the contrary [

Particularly in low-resource settings, the lack of generic options for treatment failure cases means that there is a clear theoretical potential for drug-resistant HCV strains to spread in the community, creating problems in years to come. Few predicted the rapid rise of MDR-TB when multiple drug-regimens were made available 60 years ago, nor the evolution of XDR-TB. If hepatitis C becomes a disease of the poor as was once the case of TB, history reminds us there will be little financial incentive for research and development of new drugs and progress can be lost.
