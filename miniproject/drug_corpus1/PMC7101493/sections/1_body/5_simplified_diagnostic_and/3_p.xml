<p>We believe that as with other infectious diseases focus must be put on contact-tracing with the implementation of “a household model”, whereby screening and treatment of the whole household as a unit is routinely undertaken when one household member is positive. Household members are likely to share many of the same risk factors thought to spread disease, eg, local practitioners, barbers and hygiene products. This is an established concept within infectious disease approaches to preventing re-infections and missed opportunities within communities of people who inject drugs.</p>
