<p id="p0135">Providing holistic care in a pandemic can be compromised by extreme pressure on services. Hospice and palliative care services can mitigate against this by maintaining the ability to respond rapidly and flexibly; ensuring protocols for symptom management and psychological support are available, and nonspecialists are trained in their use; being involved in triage; considering shifting resources from inpatient to community settings; considering redeploying volunteers to provide psychosocial and bereavement care; facilitating camaraderie among staff and adopting measures to deal with stress; use of technology to communicate with patients and carers; and adopting standardized data collection systems to inform operational changes and improve care. Long-term priorities should include ensuring palliative and hospice care are integrated into pandemic plans.</p>
