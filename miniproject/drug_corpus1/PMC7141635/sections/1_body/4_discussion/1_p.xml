<p id="p0105">We provide the first evidence synthesis to guide hospice and palliative care teams in their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Key findings were the need for teams to be flexible and rapidly redeploy resources in the face of changing need. For hospital teams, this involves putting in place protocols for symptom control and training nonspecialists in their use. Hospice services may see a shift in need and should be prepared to focus their resources on community provision.</p>
