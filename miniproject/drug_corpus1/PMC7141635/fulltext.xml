This study aimed to synthesize evidence for the role and response of palliative care and hospice teams to viral epidemics/pandemics and inform the COVID-19 pandemic response. We conducted a rapid systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines in five databases. Of 3094 articles identified, 10 were included in this narrative synthesis. Included studies were from West Africa, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, the U.S., and Italy. All had an observational design. Findings were synthesized using a previously proposed framework according to systems (policies, training and protocols, communication and coordination, and data), staff (deployment, skill mix, and resilience), space (community provision and use of technology), and stuff (medicines and equipment as well as personal protective equipment). We conclude that hospice and palliative services have an essential role in the response to COVID-19 by responding rapidly and flexibly; ensuring protocols for symptom management are available, and training nonspecialists in their use; being involved in triage; considering shifting resources into the community; considering redeploying volunteers to provide psychosocial and bereavement care; facilitating camaraderie among staff and adopting measures to deal with stress; using technology to communicate with patients and carers; and adopting standardized data collection systems to inform operational changes and improve care.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Key Words</title><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>coronavirus</kwd><kwd>pandemic</kwd><kwd>palliative care</kwd><kwd>hospice</kwd><kwd>end of life</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Key Message</title><p id="p0010">An evidence synthesis on the role and response of hospice and palliative care in epidemics/pandemics to inform response to coronavirus disease 2019.

Key findings were the need for teams to be flexible and rapidly redeploy resources in the face of changing need. For hospital teams, this involves putting in place protocols for symptom control and training nonspecialists in their use. Hospice services may see a shift in need and should be prepared to focus their resources on community provision.</p><p id="p0110">This was a rapid review, and we did not assess quality of studies or grade our recommendations. We found existing evidence to be limited. All identified studies were observational, quantitative data were rare, and there were no studies with an experimental design. Most studies were from Asia or Africa, with one study from Europe, and one from the U.S. This reflects the fact that Europe and the U.S. are less experienced at responding to pandemics than other regions, and this may in turn result in a lack of preparedness to respond to COVID-19. Although the importance of palliative care in response to pandemics has been well documented,<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> this is not reflected in pandemic plans or in palliative care training, and the research literature is sparse.</p><p id="p0115">There were gaps in evidence, particularly around the role of palliative care teams in acute hospitals. There was also relatively little data on provision of palliative care in community settings, although in two studies, a reduction in demand for inpatient care was seen and led to the suggestion to shift resources into the community.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Community palliative care can facilitate advance care planning and symptom control and helps prevent hospital admissions among people near the end of life.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> It is likely that community palliative care may help prevent hospital admissions among people dying from COVID-19 who would prefer to remain at home or in their care home, although this has not been tested. However, the rapid escalation of breathlessness in patients with COVID-19 who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome may make this challenging.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Severe breathlessness and respiratory disease are both known to be associated with increased hospital admissions at the end of life.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Therefore, rapid community response may be needed to manage advanced disease in COVID-19 if people are to remain at home.</p><p id="p0120">Two studies reported cessation of hospice volunteer services in response to pandemics.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> An alternative role for volunteers may be in provision of psychological support for patients and carers, which could occur by using digital technology or telephones. In light of the social distancing measures being widely used in response to COVID-19, volunteers may have a wider role in supporting communities, for example, helping the most vulnerable with shopping for food and medicines.</p><p id="p0125">Providing palliative care in pandemics can be compromised by the hostile environment, infection control mechanisms, and extreme pressure on services.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> In addition, the family unit of care may be disrupted. Even so, provision of palliative care is an ethical imperative for those unlikely to survive and may have the advantage of diverting dying people away from overburdened hospitals as well as providing the care that people want.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Pandemic situations introduce complex ethical challenges concerning allocation of scarce resources, and palliative care teams are well placed to help patients and carers discuss preferences and make advance care plans.</p><p id="p0130">Data collection systems to understand outcomes and share learning are important in a palliative pandemic response. However, these are frequently lacking.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Such data should ideally include numbers of patients seen, as well as their main symptoms and concerns, treatments, effectiveness of treatment and outcomes. There is also a need to understand the prevalence of palliative care needs that are not met by palliative and hospice services. In a pandemic expected to last for several months such as COVID-19, implementing systems of data collection early would help services to plan for and improve care and could be used to project future needs.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0135">Providing holistic care in a pandemic can be compromised by extreme pressure on services. Hospice and palliative care services can mitigate against this by maintaining the ability to respond rapidly and flexibly; ensuring protocols for symptom management and psychological support are available, and nonspecialists are trained in their use; being involved in triage; considering shifting resources from inpatient to community settings; considering redeploying volunteers to provide psychosocial and bereavement care; facilitating camaraderie among staff and adopting measures to deal with stress; use of technology to communicate with patients and carers; and adopting standardized data collection systems to inform operational changes and improve care. Long-term priorities should include ensuring palliative and hospice care are integrated into pandemic plans.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref
