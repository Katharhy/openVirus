<p id="Par16">In view of the strong homology between the COVID-19 genome sequence and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], the currently reported cases of COVID-19 and SARS patients have great similarities in the symptoms of various organ systems such as pulmonary fibrosis, viral myocarditis, acute renal injury and other symptoms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and mental health is no exception [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In the follow-up study of SARS patients for nearly 10 years, it can be found that the mental symptoms will continue to exist after discharge and a considerable proportion of survivors will have mental diseases such as depression and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PSTD) in the recovery period due to the influence of social factors and identity changes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]; moreover, severe patients, high-dose corticosteroids and the status of medical staff are independent predictors of mental illness. Since the transmissibility and duration of critically ill patients with COVID-19 are much higher than that of SARS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], it is reasonable to believe that under the long-term pressure of this epidemic on patients, medical staff and the health care system, there will be a larger population facing various potential pressures in the future, such as the persistence or even worsening of residual symptoms, complications and side effects of treatment, and the negative impact on their quality of life and social role function after returning to society.
