<p id="Par21">It is reported that neuroendocrine, neural structure and neuroimmune disorders play an important role in depression and PTSD. On the one hand, coronavirus can guide the immune damage mechanism in the body and induce a large number of inflammatory reactions. In the blood and Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with coronavirus pneumonia, Interleukin-6(IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), Interleukin-1(IL-1), Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) and other proinflammatory factors are all increased to varying degrees [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], among with high levels of IL-6 are strongly related to progressive neurological dysfunction, neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This probably the mechanism how the virus affects the patientâ€™s mental health molecularly. And many evidences show that the inflammatory reaction in the lung, heart and nervous system will last for a long time in the prognosis of SARS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and lead to a variety of chronic inflammatory diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, viral myocarditis, multiple sclerosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], while the chronic inflammation, especially the inflammatory complications of the nervous system related to the changes of brain structure and function, which is considered to be one of the pathogenesis of depression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. On the other hand, the inflammatory reaction of the nervous system will cause the metabolic changes of the basal ganglia and affect the information processing through the cingulate cortex. Changes in the cingulate cortex may indicate increased sensitivity to conflict and negative life events [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], which further complements the possible pathogenesis of depression in patients with COVID-19 .
