These different pressures are highly correlated with the psychological stress index, so the causes of psychological problems are not only isolated factors. During one-year follow-up period, evidence showed that both women and medical staff were risk factors for mental maladjustment. Female survivors had higher stress levels, more severe depression and anxiety, and more severe post-traumatic stress symptoms, and their GHQ-12 scores were three times higher than that of men. Among them, women and participants with low education level are more likely to have avoidance symptoms [
