<p id="Par31">The mental and psychological impact of major public health events may be long-term and even far outweigh the initial threat to life. The psychological symptoms of COVID-19 patients and cured survivors include poor sleep quality, low mood, anxiety, inattention, and two of the most common and severe long-term mental illnesses-depression and PSTD, which will cause great burden and threat to society in the long run. Age, gender, incidence rate and risk factors of acute phase are highly correlated with psychological morbidity, thereby providing a reliable basis for early identification and psychological support. At the same time, medical staff, as a special group fighting against epidemics and susceptible to infection, are facing multiple and complex pressures and are more prone to mental and psychological diseases, especially in the infected medical staff. Inflammatory response and other organ system prognosis sequelae are the possible mechanism for the generation and continuous progression of depression and PSTD. Therefore, it will exert a significant effect by reducing the dosage of corticosteroids in the treatment period, actively treating the psychiatric or psychological complications in the rehabilitation period with psychological counseling and treating severe cases of depression with chronic antidepressant medication. In addition, the government should provide public policy support to survivors, de-stigmatize the disease, and develop follow-up research programs to strengthen the evaluation of COVID-19 for long-term mental illness.</p>
