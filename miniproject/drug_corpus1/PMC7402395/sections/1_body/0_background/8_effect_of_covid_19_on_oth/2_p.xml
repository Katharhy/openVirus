<p id="Par28">According to several studies, 2019-nCoV infection, similar to some viral infections, may be accompanied by cardiac injury. A study of 400 patients hospitalized in Wuhan, China, found that about one-fifth of patients with COVID-19 developed heart disease, which increased the mortality rate in patients [
