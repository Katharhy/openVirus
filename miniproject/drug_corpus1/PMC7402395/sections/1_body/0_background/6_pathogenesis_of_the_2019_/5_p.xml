<p id="Par21">In addition to ACE2, there are other enzymes capable to hydrolyze Ang-I or Ang (1–9) to Ang (1–7) such as Neprilysin, Prolylcarboxypeptidase, and Prolylendopeptidase. It appears that if the activity of these enzymes is up-regulated in the lungs of people with COVID-19, the effects of reduced ACE2 may be compensated. Among the mentioned enzymes, higher expression levels of Neprilysin have been detected in lung tissue, especially in the membrane of pulmonary epithelial cells [
