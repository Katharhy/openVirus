<p id="Par18">The lungs are the primary site of 2019-nCoV infection. The chest CT of the infected patients usually shows bilateral ground-glass opacity lesions in the posterior and peripheral lungs that are reported as the characteristic of 2019-nCoV pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Pathologic studies on biopsy samples of lung, liver, and heart obtained from death COVID-19 patients have revealed that the lung is the main affected tissue with pathological changes including hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes, damage to the alveolar epithelial cells, the formation of the hyaline membrane and diffuse alveolar damage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Thrombotic microangiopathy, significant accumulations of CD4+ mononuclear cells around small thrombotic vessels, and notable hemorrhage appear to be important causes of death in these individuals. Activated local megakaryocytes in the lung, platelet aggregation, fibrin deposition, and clot formation are involved with the mentioned process [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Besides, the abundance of viral RNA in neutrophils within the alveoli and the existence of some degenerated neutrophils indicate the viral infection in these cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Megakaryocyte response and platelet production have also been reported in H1N1 influenza infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Multifocal hepatic necrosis, mild lymphocytic infiltration, sinusoidal dilation, and steatosis are pathologic changes observed in the liver of COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe illness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Mild myocardial hypertrophy changes and focal fibrosis are tissue changes seen in the heart biopsies of death COVID-19 patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Therefore, the researchers believe that effective therapy for COVID-19 should not be limited only to the viral pathogen as a target, but also the microangiopathic and thrombotic effects of the virus, and body immune response to viral infection must be considered in the disease management [
