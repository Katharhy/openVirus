<p id="Par13">The Coronaviruses have four subfamilies including alpha, beta, gamma, and delta. The alpha and beta coronaviruses originate from mammals, while gamma and delta coronaviruses have been identified in pigs and birds. Beta-coronaviruses are also called bat-coronavirus. Bioinformatics analysis shows that RNA sequence of 2019-nCoV is more than 90% similar to a bat-coronavirus RaTG13. It has been reported that the beta-coronaviruses cause severe disease while the alpha-coronaviruses cause asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic disease [

To determine amino acid sequence and structure of 2019-nCoV proteins and subsequently to predict their interactions to host cells, the complete virus genome was sequenced and also was deposited in NCBI (GenBank: MN908947.3). Studies have revealed the outer membrane spike glycoprotein as the prime viral adhesion factor interacts with host cell targets such as ACE2, Ezrin, CD26, cyclophilins, and other cell adhesion factors [
