<p id="Par14">The recent COVID-19 outbreak may be comparable with the outbreaks of the SARS-CoV (2002–2003) in China and with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (2012) in Saudi Arabia for their zoonotic transmission and some similarities in clinical features [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of betacoronavirus lineages indicates that 2019-nCoV closely belongs to two bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses (bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat- SL-CoVZXC21) with 88–89% similarity, whereas its similarity to the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is 50 and 79%, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It is worth noting that although there are significant genetic differences between these coronaviruses and the subgroup with 2019-nCoV, cross-reactions in RT-PCR or antibody measurements for SARS or other beta-coronaviruses my occur, if the primers and antigenic epitopes are not carefully selected [
