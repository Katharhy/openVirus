<p id="Par11">There have been two types of tests for COVID-19 during this pandemic: One type is PCR tests, as a molecular diagnostic technique based on viral genetic material that can diagnose an active COVID-19 infection. The early detection of COVID-19 via PCR depends on the presence of a sufficient amount of viral genome in the patient sample [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and the sensitivity of the RT-PCR assay. So, optimized or screening methods that able to detect the 2019-nCoV even in low viral titers are fairly necessary. The other type is serological tests based on antibodies against viral proteins. Serological tests identify people who have developed an adaptive immune response to the virus, as part of an active/or prior infection. Three types of antibodies including IgG, IgM, and IgA may be detected in response to the virus, especially IgM which is produced early after the infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It seems that serological tests, along with PCR increase the sensitivity/accuracy of the diagnosis, but due to window-period, immune tests do not help diagnose and screen in early infection. After infection with 2019-nCoV, it takes 2 weeks or more for antibodies to be detected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Thus, early IgM/IgG antibody tests cannot detect active viral shedding in early infection, and if an individual is infectious. In other words, due to the direct identification of viral RNA, molecular tests are more sensitive than immune and serological tests in the diagnose of primary infection and can accelerate early screening even during the incubation period of COVID-19 (before symptom onset). So, immune tests will be practical and necessary for the event of a second recurrence of the virus in the society. Chinese researchers have reported a variety of results related to immune response, such as a broad range of antibodies between people with mild symptoms of the virus, while fewer antibodies among younger people, and no trace of antibodies in some individuals [
