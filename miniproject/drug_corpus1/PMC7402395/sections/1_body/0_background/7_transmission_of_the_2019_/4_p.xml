<p id="Par26">Intestinal infection and the presence of 2019-nCoV in feces have been reported, but there is not enough evidence for fecal-oral transmission of 2019-nCoV. Song et al. examined the presence of 2019-nCoV in testicular biopsy and semen of COVID-19 patients and did not find positive RT-PCR [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. The mechanism by which asymptomatic carriers can obtain and transmit 2019-nCoV requires further study. Thus, an effective intervention is needed to prevent and control the spread of 2019-nCoV.
