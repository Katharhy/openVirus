<p id="Par25">The routes of human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV among individuals include direct inhalation of contaminated droplets released into the environment by sneezing or coughing, and contact transmission via oral, nasal, and eye mucous [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Although a 6-ft distance is emphasized to protect against the spread of the disease, it is not enough. Microbes in droplets &lt; 5 μm in diameter can stay in the air for a long time and can be transmitted to others over distances of more than 1 m [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Dental procedures are also a high-risk transmission route due to face-to-face communication and the presence of contamination with saliva, blood, and other body fluids, as well as the use of sharp tools [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Transmission may also happen through objects and personal items in the near environment around the infected person. Therefore, COVID-19 can be transmitted through direct contact with infected people or indirectly, through the surfaces or objects contaminated by an infected person [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Positive COVID-19 patients extensively contaminate their bedrooms, toilets and bathrooms; therefore, daily disinfection of their living environment, high touch surfaces, bathtubs and toilet bowls is essential. Water places such as swimming pools, rivers, lakes and ponds are also places that may be exposed to contamination by positive COVID-19 people. There is no evidence that 2019-nCoV is spread through water in pools, rivers, lakes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. To date, no reports of positive crowns have been received from water play places [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]; however, it cannot be said that it is completely 100% safe.
