<p id="Par35">The mentioned antiviral drugs are not specific to 2019-nCoV and may have limitations in use for treatment. For example, Actemra (tocilizumab) is a monoclonal antibody against the recombinant human IL-6 receptor from the IgG1τ subclass. At first, it was used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Then, it was administered against cytokine storms in coronavirus and influenza infections that are characterized by high levels of IL-6 and other cytokines. Actemra successfully could diminish the cytokine storm associated with viral infections. Tian et al. in their research proposed that due to high similarity among receptor-binding domains in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody, CR3022, might also interact with 2019-nCoV spike protein and might be used as vaccines against COVID-19 disease, but CR3022 failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein. Thus, more research is needed to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that can be specifically linked to 2019-nCoV RBD [

Other examples are Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, that have been used as antimalaria for more than 70 years and also as anti-amoebiosis and anti-human immunodeficiency virus. In-vitro and small clinical studies have shown that both drugs could be effective against SARS-CoV infection and prevent from the virus spread [
