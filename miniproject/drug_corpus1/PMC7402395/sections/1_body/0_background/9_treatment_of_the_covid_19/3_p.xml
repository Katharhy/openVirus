<p id="Par34">Clinical control of the disease is only based on symptoms via available therapeutic drugs, and in severe cases, via supportive care including oxygen and mechanical ventilation. The available therapeutic agents used for the treatment of COVID-19 patients are antiviral agents including Remdesivir, Chloroquine, Tocilizumab, Hydroxychloroquine, Umifenovir, Lopinavir, Oseltamivir, and Favipiravir, and adjunctive agents such as zinc, vitamin D, Azithromycin, Ascorbic acid, Nitric oxide, Corticosteroids, IL-6 antagonists. Because the viral load reaches its peak around the time of symptom onset, the combination of multiple antiviral drugs, along with adjunctive agents may quickly suppress the amount of virus in a patient’s body and may be effective in reducing the severity of the disease and the duration of the viral infection [

Vitamin D as an adjunctive agent can reduce the risk of viral infections and prevent pneumonia and lung damage through a variety of mechanisms, including reducing the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increasing the concentration of anti-inflammatory cytokines [

Zinc is another adjunctive agent that is known for its antiviral, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties. It is involved in a variety of mechanisms, including inhibition of NF-κB signaling, regulation of T-cell, and restriction of cytokine storms [
