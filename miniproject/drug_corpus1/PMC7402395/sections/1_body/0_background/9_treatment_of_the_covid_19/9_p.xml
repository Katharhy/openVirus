<p id="Par40">Despite such treatments, there are few reports of improved patients with negative COVID-19 test, that after a while, their COVID-19 test has been positive again. The hospital reports have confirmed, it is possible that improved patients with negative COVID-19 tests become positive again for 2019-nCoV RNA, although a small portion of discharged COVID-19 has shown recurrent recurrences. There are reports of improved people that showed second recurrences with positive PCR tests after discharge from the hospital or during quarantine, and were hospitalized again. These people were mostly asymptomatic, but their blood IgM and IgG were still positive [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. Due to the possibility of recurrence of the infection, all discharged patients should be quarantined for at least 14 days and tested regularly for 2019-nCoV RNA. During quarantine, they should avoid contact with others because they may still be a virus carrier and spread the infection to others.
