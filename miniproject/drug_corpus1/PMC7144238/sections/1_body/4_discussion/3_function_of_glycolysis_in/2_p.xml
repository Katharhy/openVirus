<p>Glycolysis also plays a critical role in host cell antiviral responses. In pDC, glycolysis could be induced by virus infection and that regulate pDC antiviral functions, including IFN-α production and phenotypic maturation [
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. There is a antagonism between innate antiviral signalling and glycolysis; lactate produced by glycolysis is a natural suppressor of RLR signalling by targeting MAVS, whereas RLR activation suppresses glycolysis by inhibiting hexokinase [
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Here, we show that HIF-1α enhances glycolysis by regulating transcription of glycolytic enzymes and therefore, when HIF-1α is absent, the cellular ATP pool is drastically reduced. Autophagy is a dynamic physiological process that can generate energy and nutrients for cell survival under stressors. This is a feedback response to lower energy level in IAV infection. From this aspect, it is not surprising that HIF-1α depletion increases autophagy as a protective response for the cells during IAV infection.
