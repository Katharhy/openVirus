<p>From autophagy aspect, our study is not the first one to report that autophagy is essential for IAV replication and even the underling mechanism has been clarified clearly [
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The novelty of our story is to demonstrate how HIF-1α regulates autophagy in IAV infections. Additionally, we demonstrate that decreased glycolysis due to deficiency of HIF-1α, activates autophagy via AMPKα signalling during IAV infection. AMPKα senses cellular energy status and facilitates autophagy initiation [

 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. AMPKα activates ULK1, which initiates autophagy by driving the formation of the phagophore. Moreover, activated AMPKα directly phosphorylates ULK1 on Ser 555 resulting in its activation. HIF-1α has been reported to be involved in autophagy under some disease conditions [
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Previous studies reported that the HIF-1α signalling pathway could contribute to autophagy by increasing the expression of BNIP3, which is closely related to autophagy [
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, our data suggests that, in AEC2, HIF-1α signalling is essential to inhibit autophagy and contribute to control IAV replication. Additional studies are needed to expand to other viruses, which also could utilize autophagy to promote virus replication like IAV.
