<p>In this study, we aimed to elucidate whether HIF-1α regulates IAV replication and the underlying mechanisms. We have found that deficiency of HIF-1α in AEC2 worsens lung inflammation and injury by promoting viral replication during IAV infection. Knockdown of HIF-1α reduces glycolysis pathway, upregulates AMPKα-ULK1 signalling pathway, and enhances autophagy in IAV infected AEC2. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the role of HIF-1α in IAV replication.</p>
