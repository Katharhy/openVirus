<p>Influenza viruses are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in humans, and influenza A virus in particularly caused pandemic outbreaks in 1918, 1957, 1968 and 2009 [
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These outbreaks occur with regularity, but the severity was not consistent. Several influenza antiviral drugs have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA); oseltamivir, zanamivir, amantadine and rimantadine, these drugs mainly target two of the viral proteins, neuraminidase (NA) and the M2 ion channel protein [
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, there is now widespread resistance to these limited viral protein-targeted drugs [
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, it is very important to develop new influenza therapies and antiviral drug targets. Identification of host factors in viral replication is becoming an alternative therapeutic strategy to develop new pharmacological targets [
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Further understanding of hostâ€“pathogen interactions in the viral replication life cycle will provide new insight into the development of host-factor-directed antiviral therapies, which could reduce the emergence of viral resistance in therapies.
