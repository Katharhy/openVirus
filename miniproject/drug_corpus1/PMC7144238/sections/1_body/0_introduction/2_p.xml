<p>IAV, like other viruses, requires the host cell machinery to produce infectious progeny. During the early stages of the viral life cycle, viruses enter the cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis and are trafficked to the late endosome, where they fuse and release their genome into the cell. The genome segments are imported into the nucleus and catalysed by the viral polymerase to accomplish transcription and replication. The newly synthesized genome segments are exported from the nucleus and assembled at the cell membrane. In the final step, the budding virus particle is released into the extracellular environment from the host cell membrane [

Host cells release cytokines as well as chemokines after activation. However, inordinate or unbalanced immune response can result in severe inflammation, including excessive recruitment of neutrophils and mononuclear cells to the lungs, which damages lung tissue, reduces respiratory capacity, and causes severe disease and mortality [
