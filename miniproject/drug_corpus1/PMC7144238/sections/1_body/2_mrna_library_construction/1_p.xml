<p>Total RNA was extracted from A549 cells mock-infected or infected with PR8 at MOI of 2 at 24 hpi using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) based on the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA was treated with DNase I for 30 min at 37°C to remove residual DNA. mRNA was purified with oligo (dT) beads. Then, the purified mRNA was fragmented into small pieces with fragment buffer at appropriate temperature. The first-strand and second-strand cDNA was generated. Afterwards, A-Tailing Mix and RNA Index Adapters were added by incubating to end repair. The cDNA fragments were further amplified by PCR, and the products were purified by Ampure XP Beads, then dissolved in EB solution. The product was validated on the Agilent Technologies 2100 bioanalyzer for quality control. The amplified PCR products from previous step were denatured and circularized by the splint oligo sequence to get the library. The single strand circle DNA (ssCir DNA) was formatted as the final library. The final library was amplified to make DNA nanoball (DNB) which had more than 300 copies of one molecular, DNBs were loaded into the patterned nanoarray and single end 50 bases reads were generated on BGIseq500 platform (BGI-Shenzhen, China). The gene expression levels were calculated in fragments per kilobase transcriptome per million mapped reads (FPKM).</p>
