<p>Cells isolated from tissues or cultured cells were kept at 4°C, and nonspecific binding was blocked with anti-CD16/32 antibody before cell surfaces staining. Surface markers were stained for 20 min on ice in PBS supplemented with 2% FBS. Intracellular markers were stained with Fixation/Permeabilization Solution Kit (BD Biosciences). Dead cells were discarded during analysis by staining with DAPI. All the antibodies used are summarized in 
 <bold>Antibodies and Chemical reagents</bold>. Flow cytometry analysis was performed on LSRII or Fortessa (BD Biosciences), and flow sorting was performed on FACSAriaII (BD Biosciences). Data was analysed using the FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR).
