<p>To test whether autophagy promotes IAV replication, autophagy was inhibited by applying autophagy inhibitors, LY294002 (

 <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>(B)) and chloroquine (CQ) (
 <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>(C)). As previously reported, our results also showed that IAV propagation was efficiently inhibited after the disruption of autophagy. We further took advantage of rapamycin to induce autophagy and observe the change in viral replication. Our results showed that rapamycin treatment increased the expression of LC3-II and IAV replication compared to untreated cells (

Subsequently, the phenomenon was further validated by knocking down the cargo receptor p62/SQSTM1 and BECN1, which not only participates in autophagosome formation but also interacts with different protein complexes regulating the autophagosome-lysosome fusion. In agreement with our inhibitor experiments, knockdown of BECN1 and p62 in A549 cells inhibited IAV replication (
