<p>Given that HIF-1α-driven glycolysis is one of the most important functions of HIF-1α in metabolism, we measured the expression of several genes involved in the glycolytic pathway. Our results showed that IAV infection upregulated glycolytic genes (LDHA, HK2, GLUT1, and PKM2) and knockdown of

Our results showed that glycolysis inhibition enhanced phosphorylation AMPKα and ULK1, reduced p62 levels, increased LC3-II conversion, and finally increased PR8 NP expression (
