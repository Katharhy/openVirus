<p>It has recently been demonstrated that HIF-1α plays an important role in regulating the expression levels of cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6. HIF-1α nuclear accumulation led to enhanced proinflammatory cytokine production in IAV-infected A549 cells [

To substantiate the role of HIF-1α in IAV induced proinflammatory cytokine production, we analysed the expression levels of some pro-inflammatory cytokines by RT-qPCR. Consistently, knockdown of HIF-1α in A549 cells markedly decreased gene expression level of proinflammatory cytokines (
