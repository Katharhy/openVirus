<p>To investigate the effects of IAV infection on HIF-1α expression, we first infected A549 cells with PR8 and then quantified gene expression by RNAseq. First, we analysed the expression of innate immune response-related genes. Our results showed that the interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) were significantly upregulated after PR8 infection (

 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>(B)). Flow cytometry analysis of A549 cells labelled with HIF-1α antibody showed that IAV infection could upregulate HIF-1α level in A549 cells compared to the uninfected controls (

 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>(D)). Therefore, our data indicated that IAV infection upregulated HIF-1α mRNA and protein levels in A549 cells.
