  <p>Autophagy inhibition reduces replication of Influenza A Virus 
   <italic>in vitro</italic>. (A-D) A549 cells were pretreated with an increasing dose of LY294002 (A) or 3-MA (B) or chloroquine (C) or Rapamycin (D) for 30â€…min and then mock-infected or infected with PR8 at MOI of 5. Cell lysates were collected at 24 hpi and were subjected to Western blot analysis. (E-F) Effect of BECN1 and p62 knockdown on IAV replication in A549 cells. A549 cells were infected with pLKO.1 scrambled or shRNA-
   <italic>BECN1</italic> (E) or shRNA-
   <italic>p62</italic> (F) lentiviruses, infected with PR8 and harvested at 24 hpi for Western blot analysis. Results are representative of three independent experiments.
