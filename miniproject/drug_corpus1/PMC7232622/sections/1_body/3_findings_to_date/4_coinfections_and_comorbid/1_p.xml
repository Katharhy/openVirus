<p>IeDEA investigators have examined the prevalence and impact of coinfection with hepatitis B and C, and the epidemiology of different cancers and of (multidrug resistant) tuberculosis, renal disease and of mental illness.
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 47–58</xref> For example, an analysis of IeDEA data and data from the Collaboration of Observational HIV Epidemiological Research in Europe (COHERE)
 <xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> showed that children living with HIV from sub-Saharan Africa, but not those from Europe or Asia had a high risk of developing Kaposi sarcoma after starting ART.
 <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> Similarly, a recent analysis of IeDEA and COHERE data showed that compared with European women, rates of cervical cancer were 11 times higher in South Africa.
 <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> A recent multiregional study of multidrug resistant tuberculosis included HIV-positive and HIV-negative adults with tuberculosis from seven high-burden countries (Côte d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Peru and Thailand). Molecular or phenotypic drug susceptibility testing was done locally and at a reference laboratory. The results showed that inaccurate local drug susceptibility testing led to undertreatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis and increased mortality.
