<p>Over 500 publications in MEDLINE acknowledge funding from a core grant from the NIH to one or several African IeDEA regions, and these publications have been cited over 10 000 times. Multiregional projects are developed in IeDEA working groups, which currently address eight clinical areas: (i) cancer, (ii) ART outcomes, (iii) hepatitis, (iv) mental health, (v) mother–infant and paediatrics, (vi) renal disease, (vii) substance use and (viii) tuberculosis. Multiregional research concepts are discussed in the Executive Committee of IeDEA, revised and approved or rejected. In recent years, several analyses were done in collaboration with WHO or UNAIDS.
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21–23</xref> The number of publications reporting multiregional analyses from several African IeDEA regions increased over time, from one such publication in 2007 to 24 multiregional publications in 2018. Some of the key studies are summarised below, with a focus on more recent and on multiregional analyses.
