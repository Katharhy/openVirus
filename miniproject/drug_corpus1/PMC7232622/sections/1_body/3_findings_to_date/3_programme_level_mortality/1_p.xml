<p>It became clear early on during the scale-up of ART in sub-Saharan Africa, that loss to follow-up of patients initiating ART was substantial,

 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Ignoring loss to follow-up might thus bias programme-level estimates of mortality, and much effort has gone into correcting programme-level mortality for loss to follow-up.
 <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40â€“46</xref> For example, an analysis of all four African regions showed that when analysing the uncorrected data observed in the clinics, 52% of adults and children were retained on ART, 42% were lost to follow-up and 6% had died 5 years after ART initiation.
 <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> After accounting for undocumented deaths and self-transfers, an estimated 67% of patients were retained on ART, 19% had stopped ART and 15% had died.
