<p>At the end of 2018, IeDEA published a consensus statement
 <xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> and a journal supplement
 <xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> on research priorities to inform the implementation of the ‘Treat All’ policy in children and adolescents,
 <xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> pregnant and postpartum women,
 <xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref> and for mental health, substance use
 <xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref> and drug resistance.
 <xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref> These documents will guide IeDEA’s future research agenda in sub-Saharan Africa. Furthermore, the creation of an IeDEA Sentinel Research Network will facilitate the collection of detailed data in selected IeDEA sites on cardiometabolic risk factors (eg, hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidaemia) liver disease (liver fibrosis and steatosis), mental health and substance use. In the East and Southern African regions, pharmacovigilance in pregnancy is being developed to assess the impact of ART on birth outcomes. A project involving all four African regions studies the cascade of screening for cervical cancer, while the establishment of the South African HIV Cancer Match (SAM) study of over 10 million PLWHIV, from linkage of national laboratory with cancer registry data, will allow the study of less common cancers. Finally, the creation of a drug resistance database as a central repository for resistance tests performed in routine clinical care is another planned addition.
