<p>Several studies examined outcomes in PLWHIV-1 or PLWHIV-2 who initiate ART, including determinants of mortality, of switching to second-line and third-line ART, drug resistance, loss to follow-up and the immunological and virological response to different ART regimens.
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24â€“37</xref> For example, the African IeDEA regions contributed importantly to a large-scale analysis of outcomes in adolescents living with perinatally acquired HIV, which showed that HIV-associated mortality during adolescence was substantially higher in sub-Saharan Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and South America and the Caribbean than in Europe.
 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> A similar analysis of adolescents living with HIV showed that mortality and loss to follow-up were worse among those entering care at 15 years or older.
 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> The authors concluded that adolescents must be evaluated separately from younger children and adults to identify population-specific reasons for death and loss to follow-up.
