<p>The WHO, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and many of the countries most heavily affected by the HIV epidemic have committed to ending HIV/AIDS as a major public health problem by 2030.
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Targets to be reached by 2020 include that 90% of people living with HIV (PLWHIV) be aware of their status, 90% of those diagnosed initiate ART and 90% of those on ART achieve undetectable viral loads (the 90-90-90 targets).
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Progress towards these goals has been more substantial in Eastern and Southern Africa than in West and Central Africa. Of the 20.6 million PLWHIV in Eastern and Southern Africa, an estimated 58% were virally suppressed, compared with 39% of 5.0 million in West and Central Africa.
