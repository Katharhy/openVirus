<p id="Par4">Epidemiological transition theory has focused mostly on the effects of demographic and socioeconomic transitions on well-known preventable infections and a shift from infectious diseases to non-communicable diseases

 </sup>. However, it has become clear that current demographic transitions—driven by population growth, rapid urbanization, deforestation, globalization of travel and trade, climate change and political instability—also have fundamental effects on the dynamics of infectious diseases that are more difficult to predict. The vulnerability of populations to outbreaks of zoonotic diseases such as Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and Nipah has increased, the rise and spread of drug-resistant infections, marked shifts in the ecology of known vectors (for example, the expanding range of

These factors and effects combine and interact, fuelling more-complex epidemics.
