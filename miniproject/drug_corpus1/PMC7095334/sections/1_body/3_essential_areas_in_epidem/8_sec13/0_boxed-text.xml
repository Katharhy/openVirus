  </sup>. This was in response to the newly recognized association between infection with Zika virus during pregnancy and microcephaly in the newborn. Developing a vaccine was an obvious route to explore, but many researchers felt that they could not conduct clinical trials with pregnant women because it is generally assumed that the risk to the woman, the fetus or both outweighs any potential benefit. However, as Heyrana et al. argue: “Preventing pregnant women from participating in clinical trials is well intentioned but misguided.”
