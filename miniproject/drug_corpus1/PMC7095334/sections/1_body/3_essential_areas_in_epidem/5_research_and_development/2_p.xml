 </sup> should be created as soon as the option becomes viable. The essential consideration is how the resulting data can add to previous trials and influence the approach to trials in future epidemics. For example, research during the 2013â€“2015 Ebola epidemic enabled progress on therapeutic agents

 </sup> that are now being trialled in the ongoing outbreak in DRC
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>
 </sup>. Scientific progress during and between epidemics must be matched by other workstreams, such as the preparation of supply chain logistics and communication with at-risk populations. Plans have to be made for a series of future outbreaks, enabling adaptive, multi-year, multi-country studies

 </sup>. Similar plans are needed for continual preclinical research to ensure that future vaccine and therapeutic pipelines will be filled.
