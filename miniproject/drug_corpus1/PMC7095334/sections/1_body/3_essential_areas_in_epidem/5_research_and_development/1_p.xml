<p id="Par34">Vaccination is one of the most effective public health interventions and innovative strategies for research and development of vaccines, such as using ring vaccination as a trial design during Ebola epidemics since 2015

The lack of a profitable market for such products means that pharmaceutical companies lack the incentives to push this work between epidemics. Initiatives such as the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations are attempting to positively disrupt financing models for vaccines against epidemic diseases
