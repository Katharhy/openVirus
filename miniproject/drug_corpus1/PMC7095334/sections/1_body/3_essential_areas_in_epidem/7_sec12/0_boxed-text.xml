 <label>Box 2  Precision public health</label>
 <p id="Par38">Precision medicine refers to the use of genomic sequencing to retrace the specific course of a disease in individual patients, with the aim of being able to choose the best treatment option for each person. In public health, the analogous idea of precisely directing the right intervention to the right population is equally appealing.</p>
 <p id="Par39">The potential of such an approach has been illustrated by the identification of two areas in the United States in 2016 that were at risk of Zika transmission
  <sup>

  </sup>. Rather than the whole country, or even only Florida, being declared at risk, these two areas each measured less than 5 km
  <sup>2</sup>, and the response focused only on these specific neighbourhoods. By contrast, a campaign against yellow fever, also in 2016, defined risk ‘at the level of entire nations’.

 <p id="Par40">A broad interpretation of precision public health
  <sup>
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>
  </sup> incorporates many different types of data to increase the power of epidemiology
  <sup>
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>
  </sup>. Such data would not only include genomic information, but also satellite imaging, mobile phone data, social media use data and so on. For example, a study published in 2019 combined epidemiological surveillance data, travel surveys, parasite genetics and anonymized mobile phone data to measure the spread of malaria parasites in southeast Bangladesh

  </sup>. A retrospective analysis of mobile phone call data in Sierra Leone from 2015 showed how it might have been used to assess the impact of travel restrictions on mobility during the Ebola epidemic

  </sup>.

 <p id="Par41">The principle of selecting the most relevant information from all available data seems within the scope of good epidemiological practice already. The challenge is recognizing and incorporating new types of data when they become available.</p>
