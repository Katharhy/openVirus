<p id="Par36">The term ‘One Health’

 </sup> is used to acknowledge that human, animal and ecosystem health are tightly interconnected and need to be studied in the context of each other (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Changes in the environment—whether natural or anthropogenic—affect interactions between pathogens, vectors and hosts in multiple and complex ways, making the emergence or decline of endemic, epidemic and zoonotic diseases difficult to predict, while epidemics of animal diseases can challenge a community’s access to food. The fact that pools of viruses, bacteria and parasites are maintained in wild and domesticated animals

 </sup> makes surveillance of potentially zoonotic diseases an intrinsic part of One Health epidemic planning. Many agencies and nations around the world now use prioritization tools such as those developed by the US CDC

 </sup> or the United Nations (UN) Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)

 </sup> to identify and prioritize zoonotic diseases of concern. An early precedent was a joint consultation on emerging zoonotic diseases by the WHO, the FAO and the World Organisation for Animal Health in 2004

 </sup>. Understanding disease ecology in the zoonotic reservoir could potentially lead to ways to predict the risk of human disease, thus providing the basis for smart early-warning surveillance systems.
