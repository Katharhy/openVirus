 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows HBV genotyping by phylogenetic analysis of the entire S region, including pre-S1, pre-S2 and S (1295 nt); due to limited sample amount, sequencing of the S region could be carried out in 57 of the 80 samples. The genotype assignment by S analysis was consistent with the genotype assignment by BCP/pre-core/core analysis in all patients. The genotype distribution in this subset of 57 cases was: 45 genotype D, 11 genotype A, 1 genotype E.
