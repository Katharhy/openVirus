<p id="Par35">All but one sequences from IDUs clustered in a separate branch of the D3 subtype, together with some other sequences, but the bootstrap value did not reach significance (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, “IDU enriched” clade); phylogenetic analysis was repeated by a completely different approach, Maximum Parsimony, in which the phylogenetic tree that requires the smallest total number of evolutionary events to explain the observed sequence data is identified: sequences from IDUs clustered in a statistically supported clade, larger than in the previous tree (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). Overall, these results suggest the variants observed in IDUs are more genetically related to each other than to most remaining D3 sequences, likely a consequence of restricted circulation/transmission in this population group both in 1978–79 and in 1994–95; however, different phylogenetic approaches show different ability to highlight their relatedness.
