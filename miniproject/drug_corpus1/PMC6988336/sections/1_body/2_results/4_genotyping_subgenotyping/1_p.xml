 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows genotyping of HBV from 80 patients by phylogenetic analysis of BCP/pre-core/core region (374 nt). Genotype D largely predominates in both groups (43/50, 86% in the 1978/79 group and 24/30, 80.0% in the 1994/95 group); genotype A was detected in the remaining cases (6/50, 12% in 1978/79 and 6/30, 20.0%% in 1994/95) with one only exception, a genotype E virus in the 1978/79 group (1/50, 2%).
