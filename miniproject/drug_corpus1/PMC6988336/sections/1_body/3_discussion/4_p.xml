<p id="Par46">The results show that the same genotypes and sub-genotypes were stably transmitted in this Italian area through 16 years. In particular, HBV-D was the most prevalent in both the 1978–79 and the 1994–95 groups, while HBV-A accounted for the remaining cases, with the unique exception of an HBV-E strain detected in one single patient in 1978. Even at the sub-genotype level, the D3, D2 and D1 in decreasing abundance and the A2 were detected in both groups at similar frequency. Thus, the epidemiological and public health events occurred between the two investigated periods did not impact on the distribution of transmitted HBV genotypes/subgenotypes.</p>
