<p id="Par50">In the present work no such mutations were observed. Two main differences between the two studies are likely responsible for this result: (a) different infection status (acute vs chronic cases) and (b) different sampling period (1978–79 and 1994–95 vs 1993–2005). It is not surprising that no escape mutations were observed in the present study. Acute cases had been enrolled either several years before (1978–79 group) or just a few years after (1994–95 group) the introduction of mandatory vaccination, which started in Italy in 1991 in two population cohorts: 3 months of age newborns and 12 years old children. Thus, in 1978–79 any strain with a vaccine escape polymorphism would have not been subjected to any vaccine selection, while in 1994–95 the vaccinated cohorts were 0–4 years and 12–16 years, so the selection pressure for escape mutants was likely still negligible. In contrast, the survey analysed in De Maddalena et al. included chronic cases, sampled about a decade later (between 1993 and 2005): the reported escape mutants could have been either the result of natural selection during chronic infection because of their ability to evade the host immune response or had been directly acquired when escape mutant strains had possibly started spreading (cases were in fact sampled up to 14 years after introduction of mandatory vaccination) [
