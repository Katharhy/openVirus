<p id="Par44">The first descriptions of the HBV strains circulating in Northern Italy were reported in 2006 and 2007, when two studies described the strains detected in two surveys of chronic carriers enrolled, respectively, between 2000 and 2004 and between 1993 and 2005 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In the present retrospective study, HBV strains from the same area (North-East Italy) dating back 1978–79 and 1994–95 were analysed, but exclusively from acute cases: this provides an accurate overview of the strains actually transmitted in those years because, in contrast with chronic carriers, the time point of infection can be safely defined.
