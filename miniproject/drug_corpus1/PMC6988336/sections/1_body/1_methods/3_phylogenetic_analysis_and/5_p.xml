<p id="Par25">The best nucleotide substitution model for phylogenetic analysis was estimated for each dataset by the Models tool in MEGA6 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Then, phylogenetic trees were constructed using the Maximum Likelihood approach in MEGA6 with the best substitution model. The reliability of phylogenetic trees was tested by bootstrap analysis (1000 replicates). To check for robustness of results, additional trees were also built by a completely different approach, Maximum Parsimony, that assumes no substitution model.
