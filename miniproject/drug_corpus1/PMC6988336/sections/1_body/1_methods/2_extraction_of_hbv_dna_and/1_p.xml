<p id="Par20">Viral DNA was extracted from 200 μL serum using the EZ1 Virus Mini Kit v.2.0 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. HBV-DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the Platinum Taq DNAPolymerase (Invitrogens, Life Technologies Corporation, Monza, Italy) as previously described [

Sequencing reactions were performed using the Genome Lab DTCS Quick Start Kit (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA) and were run on an automated DNA sequencer (Beckman Coulter, Inc.). Raw output sequences were analysed by the Chromas software and the BioEdit Package. A 374 bp sequence (encompassing BCP/pre-core and the 5′ portion of the core coding region) and a 1295 bp sequence (encompassing the entire coding region of the S gene, including pre-S1, pre-S2 and S) were finally obtained and analysed.
