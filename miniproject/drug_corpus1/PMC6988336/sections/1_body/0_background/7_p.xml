<p id="Par16">In the ‘80s and ‘90s, two remarkable events might have impacted on HBV strains transmitted in North-East Italy: (a) a significant increase of acute HBV infections in young males and a parallel increased proportion of drug addicts were observed between 1978 and 1982 [

However, whether or not those events produced changes in the HBV strains circulating in this Italian area is unknown. The only available data about HBV strains circulating in North and North-East Italy were from chronic carriers (rather than acute cases) enrolled several years later, in 1993–2005 and 2000–2004 [

None of them included acute cases that had occurred earlier than 1999; thus, no data about HBV strains circulating in acute infections in ‘80s and early ‘90s are available [
