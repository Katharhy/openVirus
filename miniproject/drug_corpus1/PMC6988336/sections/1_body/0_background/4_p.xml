<p id="Par13">HBV genotypes have an ethno-geographic distribution, genotypes D (HBV-D) and A (HBV-A) being the most ubiquitous and responsible for the majority of infections in Northern and Southern Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Very high degree of heterogeneity has been described for genotype D, with ten sub-genotypes (D1 to D10) so far reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The divergences are strictly associated to population-related factors such as spread rate of epidemics and main routes of transmission. During the 1940s–1950s (that included the 2nd World War), HBV-D divergence and epidemic exponential growth took place as a result of unsafe medical practices and unscreened blood and blood derivatives. Another epidemic, mainly linked to HBV-D3, took place in the 1960s–1970s and involved subjects with high risk behaviour, such as intravenous drug users (IDU) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. HBV genotype A (particularly sub-genotype A2) largely spread between 1960s and early 1980s as a result of sexual transmission [
