<p id="Par17">The aim of the present study was to evaluate if the epidemics observed in 1978–1982 in North East Italy as well as the anti-HIV educational campaigns (started locally in 1985 and nationally in 1988) had any impact on HBV genotypes/sub-genotypes and clinically relevant mutants circulating in acute cases in this Italian area. The aim was addressed by comparing HBV sequences from acute cases enrolled in 1978–79 and 1994–95, i.e. before and after those events. Two viral genome regions of HBV (a 374 nt BCP/pre-core/core region and a 1295 nt region spanning the entire S open reading frame) were sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic analysis as well as search for BCP/pre-core and S mutations.</p>
