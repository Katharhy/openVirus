  <p>Genotyping by phylogenetic analysis of BCP/pre-core/core gene sequences from 80 patients. The sequence dataset included 19 reference sequences. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the ML approach with the K2 + G + I substitution model (preliminary estimated to be the best substitution model for the dataset under analysis by the Models tool in MEGA6). Bootstrap values &gt; 70 are reported. A blue circle marks sequences from 1978 to 79, a red circle those from 1994 to 95; reference sequences are shown in bold</p>
