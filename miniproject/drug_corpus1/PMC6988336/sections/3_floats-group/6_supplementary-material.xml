    <bold>Figure S2.</bold> Subtyping by phylogenetic analysis of the 11 genotype A sequences from S region. The sequence dataset included subtype A1 to A7 reference sequences. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the ML approach with the K2 + G substitution model (preliminary estimated to be the best substitution model for the dataset under analysis by the Models tool in MEGA6). A blue circle marks sequences from 1978 to 79, a red circle those from 1994 to 95; reference sequences are shown in bold. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site.
