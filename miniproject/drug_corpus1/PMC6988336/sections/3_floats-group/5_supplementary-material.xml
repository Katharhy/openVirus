    <bold>Figure S1.</bold> Subtyping by phylogenetic analysis of the 45 genotype D sequences from S region by Maximum Parsimony approach. The sequence dataset included the same subtype D1 to D10 reference sequences reported in Fig. 
    <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the maximum Parsimony approach. A blue circle marks sequences from 1978 to 79, a red circle those from 1994 to 95; reference sequences are shown in bold. A black arrow marks sequences whose patient reported the IDU risk factor. Bootstrap values &gt;â€‰60 are shown.
