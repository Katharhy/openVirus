<p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the zoonotic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and started in China in December 2019 (
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). By March 2020, it had been declared by WHO as a global pandemic. It is predominantly spread by airborne droplets but there is also viral shedding in stool, giving the potential for faecal-oral transmission (
