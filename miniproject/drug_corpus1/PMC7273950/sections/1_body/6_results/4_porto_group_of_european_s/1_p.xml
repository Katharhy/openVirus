<p>Of the current 35 members of the Porto group of ESPGHAN, 32 (91%) responded to the survey of their practice during the COVID-19 outbreak, representing 32 PIBD referral centers in Europe, Israel, and Canada. Some of the face-to-face visits have been changed to remote visits in 97% of PIBD centers. Thirty centers (94%) tried to limit patients attending the hospital if not strictly needed (exceptions are flares, drug collection, or infusions). Postponing clinics except those experiencing flares or new diagnosis has been practiced by 40% of centres. Of the 32 centres, 31 (97%) encourage their patients not to make any changes in current treatments in response to COVID-19; drug doses and infusion intervals were not changed and combination therapy was continued. Children requiring infusions (ie, infliximab, vedolizumab) continued with the same regimen. Twenty-nine centers (91%), including endemic areas in Europe, had no limitations in the administration of parenteral drugs. Other actions implemented in the various centers included facilitating drug administration to the patients (eg, modifying pharmacy opening hours, and increasing the number of dispensed doses) and limiting or stopping nonurgent endoscopic procedures.</p>
