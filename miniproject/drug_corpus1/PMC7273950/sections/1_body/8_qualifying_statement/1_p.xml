<p>ESPGHAN is not responsible for the practices of physicians and provides guidelines and position papers as indicators of best practice only. This guidance may be revised as necessary to account for changes in technology, new data, or other aspects of clinical practice. This guidance is intended to be an educational device to provide information that may assist clinicians in providing care to patients. They are not a rule and should not be construed as establishing a legal standard of care or as encouraging, advocating, requiring, or discouraging any particular treatment. Clinical decisions in any particular case involve a complex analysis of the patient's condition and available courses of action. Therefore, clinical considerations may require taking a course of action that varies from the suggestions made as part of this guidance.</p>
