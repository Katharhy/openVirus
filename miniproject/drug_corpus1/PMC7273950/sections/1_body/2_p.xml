<p>SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor that is abundantly expressed in cells of the lungs, oral cavity, and the gastrointestinal tract. Lymphopenia and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase levels are associated with a more severe course (

 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). It seems that the most severe presentations of COVID-19 result from hyperinflammatory cytokine responses in particularly dysregulated IL-6-dependent acute phase responses associated with a decrease in cytotoxic T and natural killer (NK) cells. Those findings explain why in addition to antiviral therapies, immunomodulatory therapies and passive immunisation strategies could potentially be considered to improve outcome in severely affected patients (
