<p>Despite the above, the IBD-related immunosuppressive treatment has raised concerns regarding the management of COVID-19 with potential implications for treatment, isolation, and routine hospital attendance (

 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Provisional reports from adult IBD centres in China are reassuring (
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), and as some of the pulmonary damage may be caused by autoinflammatory response of the host, immunosuppressive medication have even been postulated to protect from severe disease (
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Nonetheless, children may have different recommendations than adults, given the overall milder course of the infection. In addition, IBD in children tends to be more extensive and severe than adults with consistently higher need for immunomodulators and biologics. We thus aimed to collate available data on paediatric IBD (PIBD) and SARS-CoV-2 globally and to develop consensus statements for the management of PIBD during the COVID-19 pandemic. The consensus process included specialists in paediatric IBD from the Paediatric IBD Porto group of European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN).
