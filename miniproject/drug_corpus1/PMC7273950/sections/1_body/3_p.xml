<p>The coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, were responsible for previous epidemics. Although clinical and immunological data from these viruses cannot directly be translated to predict interventions in SARS-CoV-2 infections, it is noteworthy that thiopurine metabolites, 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine, have been shown to have direct antiviral activity by inhibiting the papain-like protease of both viruses (
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) as well as host proteins involved in antiviral response (
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Systemic steroids, however, did not confer substantial clinical benefit (
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Indeed, the safety of corticosteroids during COVID-19 is unclear (
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), but it seems that if used for short periods and at a low dose they are not related to a worse prognosis, even in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). There are no published data about the safety of monoclonal antibodies during this infection although anti-IL-6 receptor antibody has been used in a few patients with COVID-19 with promising results (
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Current literature related to other viral infections does not indicate stopping these treatments or modifying therapeutic regimes (
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In light of the hyperinflammatory immune response seen in patients with COVID-19 it is highly relevant that blockade of IL-6R with tocilizumab resulted in clinical improvement associated with normalisation of fever, lymphocyte counts, and CRP in a retrospective group of 21 adults with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Locally active medications, such as anti-α4β7 (eg, vedolizumab) or budesonide are unlikely to have a major impact on systemic nor pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 responses.
