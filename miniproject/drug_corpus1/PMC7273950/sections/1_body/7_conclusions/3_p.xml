<p>On the basis of currently (March 2020) available limited data presented here, we suggest the following: IBD children, with and without immunosuppressive and biological therapy, do not seem to carry a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared with the general population. We can cautiously suggest that currently there is no signal indicating worsening the COVID-19 course by IBD-related treatment. On the other hand, the risk of inappropriate management of IBD driven by the fear of the virus may have a significant impact on the health of IBD patients as indicated by increased flares with delayed therapy in China and South Korea. Therefore, there is presently no justification to support adaptation of therapies for children with IBD in the light of the currently ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, especially in children who have in general a more extensive and severe IBD on one hand and milder COVID-19 course on the other. Managing disease relapses in this period in epidemic areas can be difficult, thus it is crucial to advise patients to maintain their therapies, particularly when in remission. These interim conclusions may be adjusted in the future based on emerging data on COVID-19 in children with IBD.</p>
