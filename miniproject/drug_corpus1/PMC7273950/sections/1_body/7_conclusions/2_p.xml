<p>We provide the first case series of children with IBD who have SARS-CoV-2 infection, all cases were mild despite being treated with immunosuppressive medications. These reassuring cases are supported by the lack of symptomatic disease among children with PIBD cases in China and South Korea. As SARS-CoV-2 infection is often asymptomatic in children, it is likely that the true mild/minimal infection rate is higher than identified. Among 171 Chinese children with COVID-19, nearly a quarter had no symptoms (

Our observation of mild or minimal SARS-CoV-2 infection in children with IBD despite treatment with immunosuppressive medications is further supported by observations in children with liver disease on immunosuppression in Northern Italy where only 3/700 were documented to have SARS-CoV-2 infection and none with a severe course (
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The larger case series of adults reported from the SECURE-IBD registry show that current outcomes do not vary substantially from reports from the general population infected with SARS-CoV-2. SECURE-IBD cases may be biased towards more severe cases as only confirmed infections have been reported and in many countries, asymptomatic and mild infections are not tested for the virus by local policy. Careful continuous monitoring of the data is needed to base future possible adjustments to the current guidance.
