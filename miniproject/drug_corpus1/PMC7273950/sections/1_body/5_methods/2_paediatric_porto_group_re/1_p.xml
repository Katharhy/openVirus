<p>A REDCap reporting system has been constructed to collect all COVID-19 cases among children with IBD in the 102 Porto group-affiliated paediatric IBD centres in Europe (and several beyond). We asked for cases with a virological confirmation of SARS-CoV-2, but to avoid reporting bias of the more severe cases we allowed also highly suspected cases when testing was not available as per local testing policy since several countries permit testing only those with evidence of pneumonia (eg, France and Spain). Nonetheless, the suspected cases were labelled and justified individually based on both typical symptoms and close contact with a confirmed case. A 7-day follow-up was required to ensure capturing of the disease severity. The registry included demographic questions as well as pre-infection IBD clinical explicit details, treatments, and outcomes. The ethics committee of Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, waived the need for approval, given the urgent need for reporting clinical experience and as the report was retrospective, anonymous, and without contacting patients. For the SECURE IBD cases, the UNC-Chapel Hill Office for Human Research Ethics has determined that storage and analysis of de-identified data does not constitute human subjects research as defined under federal regulations (45 CFR 46.102 and 21 CFR 56.102) and does not require IRB approval.</p>
