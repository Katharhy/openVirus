<p id="p0115">The bulk of the safety data regarding Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors comes from the use of tofacitinib in rheumatoid arthritis. Analysis of the most recent tofacitinib data from randomized controlled trials and long-term extension studies in rheumatoid arthritis reveals serious infection rates of 2.4 per 100 patient-years,

 </xref> A particular concern with JAK inhibition is the risk of varicella zoster virus reactivation and antiviral immunity. This appears to be a class effect due to impairment of the interferon antiviral response. It has been noted across all indications and occurs at an increased rate with both selective and nonselective JAK inhibitors.
