<p id="p0065">In clinical trials, methotrexate increased infection risk in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (risk ratio, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.01-1.56), compared with placebo, but not in those with other immune-mediated conditions, including psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and scleroderma.

 </xref> Robust data for adverse events related to methotrexate come from a recent clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of low-dose methotrexate for the treatment of atherosclerosis in patients with cardiovascular disease. Mild infections were slightly increased (hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.01-1.30), but there was no statistically significant increase in upper respiratory tract (URI) or influenza infections.
