<p id="p0135">Data from BIOBADADERM (Spanish Registry of Adverse Events for Biological Therapy in Dermatological Diseases), a Spanish registry designed to study the safety of systemic therapy in psoriasis, showed an increased risk of overall infection with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors compared with ustekinumab and nonbiologic drugs (acitretin, cyclosporine, and methotrexate). Of all TNF inhibitors, infliximab had the highest risk of infection (adjusted risk ratio, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.1-2.65).
