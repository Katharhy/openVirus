 </xref> examined the 6-month risk of serious and opportunistic infections in patients with atopic dermatitis. Compared with methotrexate, cyclosporine A had a 58% higher risk of overall infection (adjusted RR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.17-2.15). In the same study, azathioprine had double the infection risk (RR, 1.78; 95% CI, 0.98-3.25), whereas mycophenolate mofetil tripled the risk (RR, 3.31; 95% CI, 1.94-5.64). A separate study comparing patients with systemic lupus erythematosus newly treated with mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine found no differences in rates of serious infections.
