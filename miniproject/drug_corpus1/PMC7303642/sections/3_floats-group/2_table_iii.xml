    <td>Although the potential benefit of immunosuppression is being studied in the context of cytokine storm, we suggest that, if possible, immunosuppressive therapy be held in patients testing positive for COVID-19, even if asymptomatic, with the concern being the complication of bacterial infections and pneumonia. Many systemic immunosuppressive drugs have long half-lives, and temporary cessation of therapy is unlikely to result in disease flare. Individual discussions may be considered for severe flares with potentially organ-threatening manifestations. Treatment can resume after recovery (refer to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or local health authority for recovery criteria).

   <p id="ntpara0050">With limited COVID-specific safety data available on any given treatment, it is challenging to produce firm recommendations on the safety of immunosuppression in the context of the current pandemic. Notably, our guidance statements are based on expert opinion and interpretation of safety data deemed most relevant rather than on formal guidelines derived from high-quality comparative studies. Limitations include the heterogeneity of the safety data encompassing various autoimmune conditions and the limited reports available on the status of immunosuppressed patients affected by COVID-19. The applicability of the information and recommendations provided here are limited by the rapidly evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to patient-specific and local health care constraints. Decisions should ultimately be individualized to a specific scenario, and reflective of shared-decision making between provider and patient.</p>
