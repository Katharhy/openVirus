<p>Important COVID-19 therapeutic approaches include convalescent serum and neutralizing antibody for thwarting viral infections. Several biotech/pharmaceutical companies, including Regeneron, AbCellera and Lily, Vir and GlaxoSmithKline, CytoDyn, AstraZeneca, and Amgen, are developing monoclonal antibody technologies against SARS-CoV-2 [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] showed that phagocytosis by macrophages was the major causative factor in viral clearance from lungs. Leronlimab that targets chemokine receptor CCR5 was originally developed to block HIV binding and breast cancer metastasis and is now being tested for COVID-19 therapy (NCT04347239). A significant risk with antibody therapy is the potential to develop antibody enhanced disease (ADE) as seen in dengue and vaccine induced ADE in RSV and atypical measles (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]). While, our current knowledge in human patients and animal models have shown no evidence of ADE and, therefore, could prove to be a low risk, more rigorous testing and experimental data is essential to understand the true risk posed by antibody-based therapeutics.
