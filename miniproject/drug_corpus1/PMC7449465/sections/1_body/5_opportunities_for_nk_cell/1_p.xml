<p>Since the outbreak of COVID-19 infections worldwide began around January 2020, there has been a tremendous concerted effort to fast track therapeutics and vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2. Targeted cell therapy, bioengineered and vectored antibodies, and nucleic acid-based therapies are among some of the current approaches toward SARS-CoV-2. Already available biologics targeting other RNA viruses (such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HIV, and Ebola) and anti-inflammatory drugs to combat cytokine dysregulation are being repurposed against SARS-CoV-2 and provide the advantage of overcoming the lengthy and arduous process of new drug development. In this section we discuss some of the therapeutics and vaccine strategies that harness the rapid antitumor and antiviral functions of NK cells by employing strategies that range from boosting NK cell expansion and function in the body to NK cell reprogramming to confer them with memory, memory-like functions, and antigen targeting.</p>
