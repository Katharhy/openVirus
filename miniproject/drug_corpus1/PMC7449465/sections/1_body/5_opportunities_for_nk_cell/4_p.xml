<p>Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) expressing NK and T cells have been effectively used as targeted cell therapy against tumors [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Recently, CAR-NK cells have been shown to overcome the life-threatening toxicities due to the cytokine release storm (CRS) that is commonly associated with CAR T cell therapy [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Peak IL-6 levels observed in the CRS associated with CAR T cell therapy was not observed with CAR-NK cells. Since IL-6 is the central cytokine in COVID-19 pathology as well, CAR-NK cells could provide antiviral responses without inducing the same inflammatory cytokines. CAR-NK cells co-expressing the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 and the activating NK receptor NKG2D are currently in clinical trials (NCT04324996). Their ACE2 expression specifically targets the spike protein of the virus and so can competitively inhibit virus attachment to host cells as well as destroy virus infected cells. The NKG2D receptor activation is mediated through NKG2D ligands expressed by infected cells. These CAR-NK cells are inclusive of additional enforcements such as IL-15 secretion for their long-term survival and persistence, and GM-CSF neutralizing scFv region to prevent CRS. Even with these protective armors, the potential risk of CAR-NK cells causing tissue damage is high [

Robust targeted killing of virus infected cells, which would include pneumocytes in the lungs and enterocytes in the intestine, without their replacement by functional counterparts could lead to scarring, fibrosis, and reduced organ function.
