<p>The usual lack of antigen specificity of NK cells, unlike T cells, can be exploited for therapeutic purposes. Two allogenic, off the shelf NK cell therapy are in clinical trials, of which one is derived from the blood of healthy donors (NCT04344548). The other, CYNK-001, developed by Celularity is derived from in vitroâ€“expanded human placental CD34+ cells and is being tested for the treatment acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma. Recently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the testing of CYNK-001 as a potential universal NK therapy for COVID-19 patients and is recruiting for Phase I and II trials (NCT04365101). While this NK cell therapy could be useful in killing virus infected cells and, thus, limit virus mediated inflammation, there is no publicly available data yet to substantiate projected therapeutic potential.</p>
