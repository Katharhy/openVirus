<p>Activation and expansion of NK cells, particularly in early stages of infection, could prove useful against COVID-19 since an early viral clearance would limit the development of cytokine storm and ARDS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008820.g001">Fig 1</xref>). This can be achieved by the use of adjuvants and vaccines that modulate the innate response. For example, a few groups have hypothesized the role of BCG vaccination in the reduction of COVID-19 infections and mortality [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The hypothesis is based on observational reports built on COVID-19 data from countries with or without BCG vaccination. While these reports and this model have several limitations due to the variations in the reporting of case numbers, population densities, cultural differences, and others, the immunomodulatory effect of BCG vaccination in providing trained immunity is not mere speculation but rather well established. The BCG vaccine induces epigenetically modified and trained monocytes, macrophages, and NK cells with enhanced defensive functions against non-mycobacterial infections. Additionally, NK cells are essential for successful BCG immunotherapy [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. A clinical trial to study the efficacy of vitamin C infusion for COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia is also underway in China [
