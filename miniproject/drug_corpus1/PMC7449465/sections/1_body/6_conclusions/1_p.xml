<p>The rising death toll of the pandemic COVID-19 has brought the global scientific community to the frontlines of the battle against SARS-CoV-2. Researchers have been mostly focusing on myeloid cells, neutralizing antibodies, and T cells in SARS-CoV-2 infection while an important antiviral defense system, the NK cells, remain understudied. The role of NK cells in other viral infections and tumors have been well established that NK cellâ€“based therapeutics, including CAR-NK cells, activated NK cells, NK cell exhaustion blocking antibodies, and off the line NK cell therapy, are currently in clinical trials for COVID-19. However, there could be serious adverse effects (particularly, overt activation and tissue pathology) associated with these therapies, and the negligible number of studies investigating the pathogenic role of NK cells in COVID-19 do not provide a clear proof of protection versus pathology in infected patients. With the overarching goal of a COVID-19 vaccine and/or immunotherapeutics, a deeper understanding of COVID-19 pathophysiology, the immune evasive strategies employed by the virus, and the interplay of immune cells under the influence of the cytokine storm is desperately needed. In addition, factors such as the type of therapy, timing of therapeutic interventions, disease severity and associated comorbidities, will ultimately influence whether NK cells act as friends or foes in this race to win over the pandemic.</p>
