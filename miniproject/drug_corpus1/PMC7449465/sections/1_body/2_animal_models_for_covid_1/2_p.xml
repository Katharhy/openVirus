<p>Old World monkeys and humans have highly conserved ACE2 protein, with 100% identity for critical residues at the binding sites of ACE2 to SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The similar binding affinity of ACE2 in NHP allows them to be more permissive for viral replication. In addition, NHP are more comparable to humans in terms of lung anatomy, physiology, and immunology than rodent models [

SARS-CoV2–infected rhesus and cynomolgus macaques exhibited viral shedding in nasopharyngeal and oral samples, pneumonia and lung pathology characterized by diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), pulmonary edema and hyaline membrane formation, and accumulation of neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes similar to COVID-19 patients [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Similarly, an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine was found to induce neutralizing antibody development in macaques in addition to mice and rats and was capable of inducing complete protection against challenge [

Overall, these studies show that animal models, particularly NHP, can recapitulate human viral shedding, antiviral immune responses, and lung pathology; however, more animal studies with large sample size are essential to further elucidate COVID-19 pathogenesis and effectively test vaccines and therapeutic interventions.
