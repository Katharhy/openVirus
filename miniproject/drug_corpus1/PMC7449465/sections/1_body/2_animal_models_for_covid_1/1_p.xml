<p>Given the zoonotic nature of SARS-CoV-2, it is unsurprising that several species including mice, ferrets, cats, and nonhuman primates (NHP) have been found to be susceptible to this virus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Dogs have low susceptibility, while pigs, chickens, and ducks appear not to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Animal models including mice, Syrian hamsters, and NHP have been useful for understanding SARS and MERS previously and, therefore, could be useful to fill in gaps in our COVID-19 knowledge, such as immune correlates of protection, role of innate immunity in immune protection/ tissue pathology, antibody-based control of reinfections, and others. However, it is important to consider the strengths and weaknesses of the animal models in order to ascertain their suitability to model COVID-19, particularly for the rapid development of vaccine and therapeutic efficacy. For example, mice models were shown to be only semipermissive to SARS-CoV-1 infection since murine ACE2 binds less efficiently than human ACE2 to SARS-CoV-1 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 failed to infect lungs of wild type mice [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The poor viral tropism was overcome by K18-hACE2 transgenic mice expressing human ACE2, which showed severe lung pathology with immune cell infiltration and up-regulated cytokine expression in the lungs [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, this model delivered an altered clinical and fatal disease with 100% mortality and viral infiltration in the brain of SARS-CoV-1–infected mice [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], but no viral RNA or pathogenicity was observed in brains of SARS-CoV-2–infected mice [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. While ferrets are susceptible to SARSCoV2, only mild clinical disease with high viral titers in upper respiratory tract and relatively lower viral titers in lungs was reported [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Shi and colleagues [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] also showed the presence of virus in nasal turbinate, soft palate, and tonsils but not in lungs, intestines, the brain, and other tissues, indicating that ferrets show only partial recapitulation of human disease.
