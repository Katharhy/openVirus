<p>The novel SARSCoV2 is an enveloped, positive sense, single stranded RNA virus of the genus 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> and family Coronaviridae, with more than 80% and 50% homology to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, respectively [

While there are stills gaps in the understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, the increasingly growing body of COVID research and the information available from the previous 2 coronaviral epidemics, SARS and MERS, has helped piece together the clinical course of COVID-19 infection [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], which Mason and colleagues [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] describe as 3 stages of infection. SARS-CoV-2, similar to SARS-CoV-1, primarily spreads through the intranasal route, in which the viral spike protein binds to the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that is expressed on many cells of the respiratory tract [

With a mean incubation period of 5.1 days, the first stage of COVID-19 infection is characterized by local viral replication and shedding in the upper respiratory tract even in the absence of clinical symptoms, thus making asymptomatic patients infectious and further facilitating easy spread of infection. In the second stage of infection, the virus spreads to lower respiratory tract at which time a robust innate immune response is elicited and is also marked by clinical disease of COVID-19. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and fatigue and, additionally, headache, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and diarrhea [

High blood neutrophil count particularly neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphopenia, and elevated proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that include CCL7, interleukin (IL) -1β, IL-1RA, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, basic fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte monocyte colony stimulation factor (GM-CSF), interferon (IFN)-γ, IP-10/CXCL10, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, monocyte inhibitory protein (MIP)-1α, MIP-1β, platelet derived growth factor subunit B (PDGFB), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and vascular endothelial factor (VEGF)-A in the plasma of COVID-19 patients have been reported [
