<p>Approximately 80% of infected patients manifest mild symptoms and are able to clear the virus. However, 20% of the infected patients progress to stage 3, which involves viral replication in the alveolar type II cells, pulmonary infiltration of immune cells leading to pathologic changes associated with severe pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with fatal outcome [

Widespread damages in the lungs include pulmonary edema, diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membranes, fibrosis, multinucleated giant cells, and cytopathic changes of the pneumocyte. Uncontrolled cytokine storm, as a product of the infiltrating immune cells in the lungs, causes severe systemic inflammation, ARDS, multiorgan failure, and death [

Further, fatal complications are particularly high in certain risk groups, such as the elderly, in whom the case fatality rate can be as high as 14.8% to 20% due to diminished protective immune responses and regenerative ability of the epithelium [
