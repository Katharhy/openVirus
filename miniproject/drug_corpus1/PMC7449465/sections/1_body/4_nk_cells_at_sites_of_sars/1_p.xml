<p>Lung NK cells account for approximately 10% to 20% of lymphocytes in the parenchyma of human and murine lungs [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Of all nonlymphoid organs, lungs are the most enriched tissues in conventional NK cells, which suggests that they play major roles in homeostasis and infections. The lung NK subsets, composed of highly differentiated and mature NK cells that include CD56
 <sup>dim</sup>CD16
 <sup>+</sup> and CD57
 <sup>+</sup>NKG2A
 <sup>-</sup> NK cells than commonly observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and other tissues [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], were found to be hypofunctional in homeostasis, potentially due to the suppressive local microenvironment contributed by alveolar macrophages and the epithelial lining [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], thus tightly regulating pulmonary homeostasis. When homeostasis is disrupted during infections, the lung NK cells could have dichotomous roles, either beneficial leading to clearance of pathogen and/or deleterious causing tissue damage due to hyperresponsiveness. In influenza A virus (IAV)-infected mice models, activated lung NK cells clear virus through cytotoxicity, secretion of IFN-γ, and stimulation of adaptive cells [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In addition, IL-22-producing NKp46
 <sup>+</sup> NK cells facilitating epithelial regeneration were found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), trachea, and lung tissues [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Conversely, depletion of NK cells alleviated lung immunopathology in high dose infected mice [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. These studies suggest that the hyporesponsive lung NK cells are activated in respiratory infections and could lead to viral clearance and/or lung pathology, depending on the dose of the virus infection. In SARS-CoV-1 infected mice, immune cells including NK cells, NKT cells, macrophages, and CD4 T cells were elevated in lungs at day 2 postinfection and then declined after reaching a peak in numbers at day 7 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. There are very few studies investigating NK cells in mice models for SARS and MERS, and they have mostly shown that NK cells and their ADCC functions are not essential for viral clearance in the lungs [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. However, rodent respiratory system do not recapitulate human lung immunology efficiently. NHP models have shown infiltration of immune cells and associated lung pathology [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], but these studies have not investigated lung NK cells. Overall, lung NK cells in COVID-19 have been mostly overlooked and warrant a closer look at their potential antiviral immune defenses.
