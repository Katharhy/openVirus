While the peripheral immune responses and parameters are useful in generating disease outcome predictors for COVID-19, knowledge of immune cell responses at the local and mucosal tissue microenvironment are even more critical for viral control and limiting severity of disease. The lack of NK cell knowledge and in general early immune responses at the primary site of infection and the lungs in coronaviral infections in both humans and animal models is a huge roadblock in the path to control of the COVID-19 pandemic.
