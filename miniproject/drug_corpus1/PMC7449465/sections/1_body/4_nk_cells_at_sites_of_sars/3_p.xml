<p>Neurologic manifestations including taste, smell, and/or vison impairment, acute cerebrovascular diseases, and impaired consciousness are increasingly reported in COVID-19 patients, particularly those with severe respiratory involvement and lymphocytopenia [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008820.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. It is not yet clear if the neurological symptoms are due to the posited cytokine syndrome or the direct CNS invasion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In transgenic mice expressing human ACE2, SARS-CoV-1 entered the brain through the olfactory nerve, rapidly replicated in the brain, and up-regulated proinflammatory cytokines (including IL-6), but, surprisingly, there was no evidence of inflammation in the brain [

The fatal outcome of brain infection in this model could be attributed to any of these several mechanisms: neuronal infection and dropout, infection of the cardiorespiratory center in the medulla, and cytokine storm. NK cells are one of the key immune cells that can cross the blood brain barrier under pathological conditions. Indeed, NK cells were the major immune cells elevated in patients with disrupted blood brain barrier and were correlated with multiple proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, CCL3, and IL-6, in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with neuroinflammation [

In mice infected with a recombinant murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) expressing CXCL10, showed CXCL10 mediated recruitment of NK cells into the brain and was critical in controlling MHV infection before T cell responses were activated in the brain [
