<p>Gold NPs (AuNPs) are commonly used in nanovaccines because of their ability to work as adjuvants in immunization, in addition to being antigen carriers [
 <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. VLPs can be formed by incubating AuNPs as a core with CoV S proteins (such as S protein of avian CoV), which spontaneously functionalize the surface (S-AuNPs) [
