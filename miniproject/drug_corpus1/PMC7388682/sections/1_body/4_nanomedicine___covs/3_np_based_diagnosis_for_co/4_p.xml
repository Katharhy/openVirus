<p>Chiral gold nanohybrids (CAuNPs) with quantum dots (QDs) have previously been used to develop self-assembled star-shaped chiroplasmonic AuNPs and detect different viruses including CoVs [
 <xref rid="B144" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. In this method, each of CAuNPs and QD were electrostatically conjugated to two different target virus-specific antibodies. In the presence of the target virus, a nano-sandwich structure was assembled, resulting in superior plasmonic resonant coupling with the excited state of QD [

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. MERS-CoV protein was immobilized on an AuNP-electrodes and in the presence of antibodies of known concentration, competition occured between the free viruses in the specimen with the immobilized MERS-CoV protein. A ferrocyanide/ferricyanide probe was used for electrochemical measurement. This chip could be used for multiplexed detection at the same time through using many electrodes on the same chip, with each electrode attached to different viral antigen [
