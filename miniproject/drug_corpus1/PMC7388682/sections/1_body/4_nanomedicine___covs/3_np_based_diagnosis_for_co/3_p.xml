<p>AuNPs have been intensively studied in the development of nanoassays for two reasons: ease of electrostatic surface-decoration with various moieties such as antigens and antibodies and; surface plasmon resonance shift and color changes [

 <xref rid="B140" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. AuNPs have been commonly used in colorimetric hybridization assays. One of these assay is the disulfide bond-based colorimetric assay, which was designed by Kim 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B141" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>] using thiolated ssDNA probes to target specific regions of MERS-CoV genome (upstream of E protein gene and ORF 1a), forming a long self-assembled hybrid. This hybrid protects citrate ion-capped AuNPs from salt-induced aggregation. However, in the absence of target genes, this protection does not exist, resulting in aggregation of AuNPs and color change [

 <xref rid="B143" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. Following this, alkaline phosphatase streptavidin was conjugated through streptavidin–biotin interaction, catalyzing the reduction of silver (Ag) ions and deposition of metallic Ag on electrode surface. Metallic Ag can be measured and it is directly proportional to concentration of alkaline phosphatase and hence target viral DNA [
