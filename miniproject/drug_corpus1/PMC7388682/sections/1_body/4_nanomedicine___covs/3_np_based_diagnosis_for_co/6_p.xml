<p>As a trial to improve the readout signal, combined IgM and IgG detection is recommended, this is done using a membrane-based chromatographic immunoassay to detect patient-generated antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 via coating a strip with SARS-CoV-2 antigens-AuNPs conjugates [
 <xref rid="B145" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>,
 <xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. This conjugate is able to bind any specific antibodies in the sample, producing a visible colored line within 10Â min (qualitative assay) [
 <xref rid="B145" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>].
