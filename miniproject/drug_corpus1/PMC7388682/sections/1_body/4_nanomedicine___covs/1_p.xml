<p>Following the emergence of COVID-19 virus, researchers are racing to find a specific treatment. Nanomedicine, which is the medical application of nanotechnology, has a crucial role in accelerating development of promising clinically translatable therapeutics against different viral infections [
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Nanomedicine has already proven its activity against several infectious diseases including HBV [
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>], HIV-1 [
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>,
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>], respiratory syncytial virus [
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>] and influenza virus [
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. In addition, many CoV-related patents have been reported in the field of nanotechnology [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The high surface area of NPs and their ability to be functionalized with wide range of functional groups imparts specific physicochemical properties, resulting in desirable cellular interactions and dramatic therapeutic efficacy [
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. NP-based systems have been designed and developed to deliver therapeutic or diagnostic agents, as well as immunogens against coronaviral infections and most of these systems are illustrated in the following parts [
