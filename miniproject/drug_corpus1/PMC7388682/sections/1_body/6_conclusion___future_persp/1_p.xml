<p>The COVID-19 pandemic represents a global crisis, the likes of which has not been seen in recent history, leaving behind huge human losses and deep socioeconomic damages and also disturbance in the healthcare sector [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Despite the tremendous international effort and the launch of several clinical trials to contain this pandemic, no effective therapy has yet been proven. This review highlights the different traditional therapeutic approaches, in addition to the potential contribution of nanomedicine against the new SARS-CoV-2. Repositioning of drugs, such as chloroquine and remdesivir, is a rapid process to reach safe therapeutics and the related clinical trials have revealed promising effects against COVID-19. Several SARS-CoV-2 S protein-based vaccine candidates have entered clinical phases, showing optimistic results. Furthermore, metallic and self-assembled nanovaccines, which are based mostly on antigenic properties of S protein, are feasible and promising approaches to reduce the viral burden. Moreover, numerous NP-based diagnostic systems have been reported for CoVs and specifically for SARS-CoV-2. However, extensive studies in the field of NP-based therapy are still required.
