 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Currently, development of an effective vaccine and specific treatment is the main concern for researchers worldwide to fight the current COVID-19 and any future mutations of the CoV family. Understanding the coronaviral genome and the processes of viral replication and pathogenesis will enable researchers to develop specific drugs and vaccines. While nanomedicine has been considered one of the most important and emerging fields of modern science, this review also summarizes several conventional therapeutic approaches and clinical phase drug candidates developed since the first emergence of SARS-CoV.
