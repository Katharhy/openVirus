<p>Multiple antigenic components using the whole virus either as live-attenuated virus (living but significantly weakened) or inactivated virus (killed) trigger the host immune system, producing strong cellular and humoral immune responses [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. However, whole virus vaccines have the potential risk of reversion to virulent phenotype due to residual infectivity. Thereby, safety and stability of these vaccines are considered as essential features required for preclinical–clinical transition. Accordingly, much research focusing on reversion mechanisms needs to be performed to develop safe vaccines [

 <italic>et al.</italic> produced stable live-attenuated SARS-CoV vaccine with an optimum balance between virulence loss and immunity induction through using 7-nucleotides rewired transcription regulatory networks [

A SARS-CoV vaccine, which was prepared via two-step inactivation with sequential formaldehyde and UV irradiation, prevented virus replication in the host cells without the risk of infection [
