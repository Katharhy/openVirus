<p>Understanding viral replication and the molecules required for virus pathogenesis can allow identification of potential antiviral targets. As rapid control of COVID-19 is an imperative need, repositioning (repurposing) of drugs that are safe and with known pharmacokinetic profiles is currently being applied with several drugs being clinically tested on CoVs. Nucleoside analogs, which inhibit viral replication via interfering the cellular nucleotide synthesis, were tested against CoVs. Remdesivir (adenosine analog) showed promising

The protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir, which inhibit viral replication through binding to the viral proteases responsible for proteolytic cleavage, have been tested against SARS-CoVs and MERS-CoVs and currently, clinical trials against SARS-CoVs-2 have been initiated [

 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101–107</xref>]. However, due to chloroquine’s ineffectiveness, the WHO stopped chloroquine-related clinical studies.
