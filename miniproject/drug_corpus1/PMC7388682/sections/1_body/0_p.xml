In late 2019, a new strain from the CoV family, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan/China causing COVID-19.

Therefore, it may be the right time to think about the development of a universal vaccine platform or an antiviral agent for any upcoming outbreak of CoV, which is considered as a continuing health threat. The SARS-CoV-2 genome was rapidly sequenced to aid the development of potential diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic approaches [
