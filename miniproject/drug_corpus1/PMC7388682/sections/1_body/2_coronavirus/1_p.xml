<p>The first human CoV, which belongs to the 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family, was identified in 1960s and up till now, seven α- and β-CoVs have been identified. CoV is named for its crown-like surface projections (corona) of spike proteins [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. CoV particles (80–120 nm) are spherically enveloped, positive-sense ssRNA genomes encoding 8–10 open-reading frames (ORFs) [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11–13</xref>]. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the genome (∼30,000 nucleotides) has around 79.5% sequence identity with SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Two-thirds of the viral genome (ORF1a/b) translate to two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, and encode 16 nonstructural proteins (NSP1–NSP16), while the remaining ORFs, located near 3′-terminus, encode accessory and structural proteins (

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The structural proteins, which are translated from subgenomic mRNAs, include envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M) and spike (S) proteins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17–19</xref>]. The major immunodominant antigen is the S protein, which is a type-I transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on the virus surface and has two conserved domains at the amino (S1) and carboxy (S2) termini [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. S1 is responsible for recognition and binding to host cell receptors following which, S2 mediates fusion of the virus envelope with the host cell membrane. The sites of receptor-binding domains (RBDs) are different, where MERS-CoV binds to DPP4 receptor, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 bind to ACE2 receptor. Unfortunately, ACE2 receptors are expressed in most human organs, resulting in invasion of many human cells and rapid infection, specifically in cells of the lower respiratory system that express high levels of ACE2 receptors [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21–24</xref>]. After the virus binds with the host cell receptors, it enters and releases its viral genome to start RNA synthesis using RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Finally, protein synthesis occurs for virion assembly and the virus is transported to the surface of the host cell and released by exocytosis [
