<p>Nanomedicine with its physicochemical characteristics could be a promising therapeutic approach to win the battle between CoVs and host cells. Nanoparticles (NPs), which are studded with viral antigens or antibodies, could be used against SARS-CoV-2 and any re-emerging CoV. This review discusses different therapeutic approaches for CoVs, focusing on the implementations of nanomedicine to contain COVID-19 and related pathogenic CoVs.</p>
