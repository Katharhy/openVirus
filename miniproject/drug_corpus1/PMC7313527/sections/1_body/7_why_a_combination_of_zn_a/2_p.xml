<p id="par0135">It has been discussed in the preceding section that Zn is involved in boosting the immune response against viral infection including SARS-CoV-2. Immune-boosting activities of Zn include proliferation and activation of neutrophils, NK cells, macrophages, and T and B cells as well as cytokine production by the immune cells. Zinc also mediates protection from the adverse effect of ROS that are generally produced during inflammatory processes. In addition, Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> was shown to stop recombinant SARS-CoV RdRp activity by inhibiting elongation and template binding (

 <sup>2+</sup> inhibits the proteolytic processing of replicase polyproteins (
