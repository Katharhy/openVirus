<p id="par0050">Central to its replication, SARS-CoV-2 uses its own genome-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The RdRp which is integrated into a membrane-associated viral enzyme complex synthesizes the negative-strand RNA (âˆ’RNA) using the + RNA as the template. The negative RNA strand is then used as a template to synthesize viral mRNAs.</p>
