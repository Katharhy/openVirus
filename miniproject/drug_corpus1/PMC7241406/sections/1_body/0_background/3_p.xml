Whereas influenza viruses generally represent a respiratory pathogen and only occasionally cause ocular complications, adenoviruses mirror image this disease pattern, causing severe ocular surface disease, and are often highly contagious (known as “eye hospital eye

Thus, all three virus types share a common ocular entrée but vary in their degree of contagion, ocular versus respiratory/system impact and lethality. Taken as a whole, these disease patterns have implications for more effective management strategies.
