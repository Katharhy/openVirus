<p id="p0065">Human eyes are located at a coign of vantage in the body, simultaneously providing information from our highest bandwidth sense but also being exposed to risk of exposure including to airborne virus. The surface area of the eye(s) is large compared to that of the mouth and nares – (
 <xref rid="fig2d" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> D) and was recognized early as a target for “promiscuous spraying” whereby coughing could project material at least 10 feet away [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Since this 1919 study [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], a number of other studies have investigated ocular surface area and reported as a total (for two eyes) as 226–426 [
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and 300–640 mm
 <sup>2</sup> [
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], indicating that the figure from Maxcy's early study [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] was a good estimate (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ) of the “visible” ocular surface. The later study [
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] also explains variability in measurements, since palpebral aperture is dependent on eye gaze direction. However, the total ocular surface area has been estimated at ~1600–1869 sq. mm/eye [
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], including the cornea, this representing a maximal absorptive area of ~3738 sq.mm, accounting for the tarsal conjunctiva and including the palpebral fornices. Even this consideration underestimates the potential ocular/periocular landing zone for a viral particle. It is not an uncommon observation that makeup, applied around the eye, can “migrate” onto the ocular surface [
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], similar to the phenomenon by which noxious agents in minute quantities are easily transferred from fingertip to periocular skin and then the eye. This may be due to subtle actions of Riolan's muscle [
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In fact, this mechanism of transport of agents from the periocular eye lid skin to the eye (obviating the need for eyedrops) has been termed supracutaneous and has been developed as an efficient delivery system for management of dry eye syndrome [
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This supracutaneous mechanism, might provide a substantial periocular area in which viral particles could land and be “funnelled” onto the ocular surface and beyond. 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> provides available information on the size of the orbital opening 
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and reviewed in 
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, which likely underestimates the area of eyelid skin. We have estimated eyelid skin to be ~4000 mm
 <sup>2</sup> and that of the brow to be ~3000 mm
 <sup>2</sup>, so that in total with the ocular surface area, a landing site of ~10,000 mm
 <sup>2</sup> would be available, – 2 orders of magnitude greater than for the nares and mouth. This does not take into account the surface area that could be attributed to the hair of the eyebrows or the eyelashes, for which estimates have not been made. Eyelash aerodynamics may also play a role [
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Eyelashes have been shown to divert airflows, acting as a passive ocular dust controlling system. They reduce evaporation and particle deposition up to 50%. In a comparative study [
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], Asian eyelashes had lower lift-up and curl-up angles, fewer numbers and a thicker transverse diameter as compared to Caucasian eyelashes. Whether these differences play any role in influencing the rate at which particles land on the ocular surface is unknown. However, it is possible that a deficiency in this mechanism could increase the risk of infection.
