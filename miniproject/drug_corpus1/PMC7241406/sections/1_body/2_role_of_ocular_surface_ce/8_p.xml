<p id="p0110">Thus, the pathophysiology of ocular surface-SARS-CoV-2 interactions requires re-evaluation, not only to determine the dynamics of ocular surface viral exposure and binding but also transmission via the lacrimal drainage system. Less pathogenic coronaviruses as well as other respiratory viruses could be used in animal models to better elucidate this relatively unexplored pathway.</p>
