<p id="p0115">Thus, the ocular surface, representing a large surface area, exposed to and likely receptive to coronavirus, bearing the appropriate SARS-CoV-2 entry factors, may be an ideal point of intervention. Efforts in directly targeting the ACE2 receptor in this way are limited [
 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Potentially, blocking the ACE2 receptor would deprive coronaviruses from their main point of tissue binding. P4 and P5 peptides and NAAE, a small molecule targeting ACE2 have been developed but there have been concerns about a narrow spectrum of activity and effects on blood pressure regulation [
 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. This strategy has previously been employed, using antibodies [
 <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] - anti-ACE2 but not anti-ACE1 antibody blocked viral replication in a model system. Blocking of TMPRSS2 protease and cathepsin B/L activity could also be considered, however it appears that ACE2, rather than protease activity, may be the viral entry rate limiting factor [
