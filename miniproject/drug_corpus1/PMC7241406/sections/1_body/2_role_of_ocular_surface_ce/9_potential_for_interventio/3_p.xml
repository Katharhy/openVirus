<p id="p0125">A search of FDA-approved drug libraries identified a number of drugs including chloroquine as potentially having 
 <italic>anti</italic>-coronavirus actions [
 <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] and therefore potentially able to be repurposed. 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> summarises the drugs that have been identified as potential treatments for coronavirus infection, their efficacy (in vitro and in vivo) and for which there is data (for that agent or a related compound) for previous topical ocular surface usage. It is apparent that while for each of these agents, there is evidence of in vitro 
 <italic>anti</italic>-coronavirus activity, there is a paucity of in vivo studies. This has been raised as a matter for concern in that there are precedents for paradoxical untoward drug systemic effects that result in increased disease severity when in vitro testing alone might suggest efficacy [
