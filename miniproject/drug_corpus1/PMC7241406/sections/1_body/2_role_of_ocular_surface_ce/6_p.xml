<p id="p0100">The nasolacrimal system, via the nasopharynx (considered crucial for viral replication [
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]) thus provides a bridge between ocular and respiratory tissues, serving as a conduit for virus-containing fluid exchange between these sites [
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Furthermore, beyond the anatomical linkage, it was recognized that the structure and distribution of cellular receptors in these systems is likely contributing to the tissue tropism of respiratory viruses [
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Furthermore, there is respiratory-ocular mucosal immune interdependence with linkage via the nasolacrimal lymphoid tissue [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].
