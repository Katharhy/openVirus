<p id="p0095">The possibility of ocular surface viral replication and transmission should be further explored given the finding of likely sustained SARS-CoV-2 replication in three patients with systemic infection and conjunctivitis [
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>]. While it was found that no viral RNA was detected in the tear fluid and conjunctival secretions of infected patients without conjunctivitis in one study, it was felt that this did not eliminate the risk of transmission via this pathway [
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The finding that human conjunctival explant cultures were more extensively infected by SARS-CoV-2 than by SARS-CoV is also significant [
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Taken together, these findings are also consistent with the concept that the tear film may protect the ocular surface from epithelial infection and convey virus downstream.
