<p id="p0155">ACE inhibitors have been used topically in animal models of glaucoma [

Since chloroquine and ACE2 inhibitors seem to act at different parts of the receptor, in combination, synergy is possible or at the very least an additive effect, permitting a reduction in dosage and risk of potential side effects. However, another issue is that ACE2 inhibitors may upregulate this receptor [
