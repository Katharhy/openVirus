<p>Although a respiratory viral infection is a major contributing factor to asthma exacerbation as well as a triggering factor, information about the influence of SARS-CoV-2 on asthma and allergic diseases is limited. It was reported that none of the 140 patients who were hospitalized due to confirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan, China had asthma or other allergic diseases such as AR, atopic dermatitis (AD) and food allergy.
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Drug hypersensitivity and urticaria were found in 11.4% and 1.4% of the patients, respectively, in that study; their relationships to COVID-19 remain unclear. Another report from Wuhan observed a markedly lower prevalence of asthma (5 asthmatics among 548 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 0.9%) compared to the prevalence of adult asthma in Wuhan (6.4%).
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In another recent study of the 1,099 patients with COVID-19 admitted, no asthmatics were found among the study subjects.
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Korean data demonstrated that none of the 22 patients who died of COVID-19 were suffering from asthma or other allergic diseases.
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> However, the possibility of under-diagnosis or under-reporting exists in those studies. Although it has not been determined whether allergy or asthma may predispose patients to COVID-19, non-pandemic coronavirus infections have aggravated asthma both in adults and children.

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Thus, the probability of the aggravation of asthma and other allergic diseases by COVID-19 should be considered. Furthermore, as pediatric patients with asthma are at higher risk of respiratory viral infections, most experts advise extreme caution in such cases.
