<p>No specific documents are available for the management of AR during the COVID-19 pandemic; therefore, stepwise treatment should be performed according to symptom severity. However, given the benefits of controlling AR in patients who also have asthma, AR should also be treated more actively.
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> In cases of mild/intermittent AR or seasonal rhinitis, face-to-face consultation should be postponed, and instead non-face-to-face consultation (online consultation) is advisable.
