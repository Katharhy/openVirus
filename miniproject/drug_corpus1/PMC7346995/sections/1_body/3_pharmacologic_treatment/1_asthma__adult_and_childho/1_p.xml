<p>It is well known that common coronaviruses are associated with the worsening of asthma symptoms.

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Recent reports have suggested that asthma does not increase the risk of COVID-19 infection or related complications.

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, these data have been obtained from hospitalized patients with COVID-19; therefore, the actual risk has not yet been accurately determined. The WHO recommends avoiding systemic steroid use in patients with COVID-19 (not limited to asthmatic patients), except in some situations such as septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> All asthmatic patients should be treated with inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) with/without long-acting beta
 <sub>2</sub>-agonists as controllers according to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines.
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> It would be better to use a metered-dose inhaler or dry-powder inhaler rather than a nebulizer in order to prevent the risk of the spread of the virus via the device.
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> If patients with mild-to-moderate asthma are well controlled and have sufficient maintenance medications, it would be better to postpone face-to-face visits along with online consultations.
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Considerable efforts should be made to reduce the prescribed dose of systemic corticosteroids in order to avoid an immuno-compromised status in the management of severe asthma. Elderly patients with asthma or comorbid conditions should be more strictly monitored. Additionally, it is recommended that regular Ig replacement treatment be maintained in asthmatic patients with IgG subclass deficiency suffering from frequent asthma exacerbations.
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Such patients should receive IgG replacement treatment during the pandemic, even though they have the risk of exposure to the virus during their visits in order to prevent asthma exacerbation.
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Taken together, it is important to maintain each patient in an optimal controlled status, and it is not recommended to step-down controller medications that are maintained.

 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> If patients have asthma exacerbations, they should be managed according to the GINA guidelines. When conducting lung function tests to monitor control status, the clinical necessity and potential risk of droplet infection are compared carefully based on the judgment of the clinician. It is recommended to perform spirometry only when its results can draw an immediate treatment descision.
