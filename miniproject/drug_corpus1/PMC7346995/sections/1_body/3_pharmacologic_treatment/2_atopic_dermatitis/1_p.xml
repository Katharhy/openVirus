<p>AD is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by recurrent eczematous skin lesions and pruritus. Not only is AD associated with airway diseases such as asthma and AR, but patients with severe AD are also likely to be vulnerable to respiratory infections because of their systemic immunosuppressive treatment.
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> However, discontinuation of immunosuppressive agents should not be applied in all AD cases, since it can lead to the aggravation of AD and even to disseminated viral skin diseases such as eczema herpeticum.
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Maintenance of skin hygiene and the use of moisturizers and topical immunosuppressive agents would be preferable options in the treatment of AD. However, systemic immunosuppressant or immune-modulating agents, such as dupilumab, seem unlikely to elevate the risk of COVID-19. A recent Italian study reported that only 2 (0.82%) of 245 AD patients treated with dupilumab developed COVID-19, and they successfully recovered from COVID-19 while maintaining dupilumab therapy.
