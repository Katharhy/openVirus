<p>CU is defined as urticaria that has been present for at least 6 weeks and required long-term maintenance therapy because symptoms can last for years in many cases.
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> In healthy subjects without any underlying diseases, CU symptoms are not usually life-threatening, and visiting healthcare facilities needs to be delayed and rescheduled (a few weeks to a few months) during the COVID-19 pandemic. To avoid this highly contagious disease, it is necessary to reduce unnecessary visits to hospitals and to be isolated at home. In particular, older patients with comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and chronic respiratory disease, are vulnerable to infections and are more cautious in visiting hospitals.

When patients develop severe symptoms, such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm, dizziness, and hypotension accompanying urticaria, they should visit the emergency department to treat symptoms. Patients are required to follow all the policies for infection control. Physicians should delay the evaluation of the causes of CU and reschedule patient outpatient visits until the pandemic is over.
