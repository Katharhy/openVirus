<p>Injections for SCIT should be modified after case-by-case assessment. At the up-dose phase, discontinuation of SCIT is recommended if regular visits to the allergy center are difficult. Re-initiation can be planned until continuous visits are available. In patients who are at the maintenance phase of SCIT, the injection protocol can be adjusted later, and the next dose can be administered again as recalculated according to the authoritative guidelines. SLIT can be continued without interruption.
