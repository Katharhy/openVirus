<p id="Par4">Early warning is an important measure to control and prevent outbreaks and epidemics of infectious diseases. The core is to find the abnormal distribution of infectious diseases and then estimate the risk of an outbreak. Its main work is to collect and analyze relevant information and data on the incidence of infectious diseases, and to explore the spatiotemporal transmission and epidemic laws of infectious diseases by using genomics, statistics and mathematical methods. It is indispensable to use mathematical methods to establish appropriate warning models in the early epidemic stage so that relevant departments can take timely response measures to prevent the development into a malignant state and reduce the degree of harm as far as possible. As recognized by the WHO, mathematical models, especially those that are timely, play a key role in informing evidence-based decisions by policy-makers (Morgan
