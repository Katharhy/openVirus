<p id="Par24">The outbreak has not only caused huge losses, but also reminded us of the need to strengthen public health surveillance and management. At the micro level, it is important to find the agent that is the cause of observed morbidity and mortality (Gardy and Loman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2018</xref>). When used with phylogenetic analysis, it is possible to find the natural reservoir and intermediate host of the virus, which can help us isolate the source of the infection accurately. Furthermore, codon usage bias analysis provides us with another method and perspective to trace the source of the virus, although the results are still open to question. At the macro level, to solve the surveillance and detection problem, the next set of issues concern data capture, the development of diagnostic tests and treatment algorithms and the identification of public health measures to control the epidemic spread. Real-time data capture and associated analysis to reveal how the epidemic is expanding and how interventions are acting to slow its spread is essential. Based on the mathematical frameworks, we can better assess the infectious capacity of pathogens and the effects of public health control measures.
