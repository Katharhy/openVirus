<p id="Par18">The SIR structure was modified based on the unique characteristics of the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. In the modified SIR model, recovered population R was extended to include those cured, died, and isolated in hospitals because under those conditions the virus does not spread (Zhu

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2020</xref>). This model was used to predict the trend under three possible scenarios, such as the current trend maintained, control efforts expanded, and person-to person contact increased due to work resuming. By March 12, 2020, the total infectious estimates in each of the three scenarios are 72,172, 54,348, and 149,774. The model also predicted that the probability of no new cases in other cities at the end of February is 95.4%, 100%, and 75.7%, under these three scenarios respectively. The simulation suggested that strict quarantine of inner or inter-city population movement would have a significant effect on the suppression of virus spreading.
