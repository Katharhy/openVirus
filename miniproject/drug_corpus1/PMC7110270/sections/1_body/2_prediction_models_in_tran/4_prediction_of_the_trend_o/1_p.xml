<p id="Par16">The most classic infectious disease prediction and early warning models are the susceptible–infectious–recovered (SIR), susceptible–infectious–susceptible (SIS) and susceptible-infectious-recoverd-susceptible (SIRS) models. The SIR model is used to predict diseases in which individuals can obtain permanent immunity after infection. The SIS model is used for diseases in which the individual is not immune after the infection is cured. The SIRS model is used for diseases in which individuals can acquire immunity for a certain period of time after infection. However, these common predictive models are only applicable when there is a non-drug prevention intervention. The estimated numbers of infected people far exceed reported cases in the available literature which used these models (Anastassopoulou
