<p id="Par9">Another way to help identify the origin and evolutionary trends of viral hosts is to study codon usage bias given that the use of viral codons is subject to different selection pressures in different host environments. Ji 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2020</xref>) found that the codon usage bias of SARS-CoV-2 is most similar to that of snakes by using relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analyses. In fact, there are two levels of codon usage biases, one is at the amino acid level and the other is at the synonymous codon level. Amino acid composition can also introduce confounding effects if we only focus on the variation of synonymous codon usage. In order to overcome the above problem, another research team performed global correspondence analysis (CA), within-group correspondence analysis (WCA) and between-group correspondence analysis (BCA) among different genes in the coronavirus viral sequences (Gu 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020</xref>). The results showed that the SARS-CoV-2 had amino acid usage similar to bats, but the synonymous codon usages were relatively different, which indicated similar protein characteristics but maybe different evolutionary histories. However, these analytic approaches have not been used in studying viral sequences widely, so the information only provided some insights into wildlife reservoirs and that the further validation by animal model experiments is indispensable. Moreover, as a potential intermediated mammal, virus in civets share ~ 99.8% genome identity to SARS-CoV in humans. As the origin for SARS-CoV-2 is most possibly the bats, and we should also be concerned about other mammals, while are likely to be predicted as intermediate hosts.
