<p id="p0040">There are other molecular-based detection techniques in addition to RT-PCR and similar optimized detection techniques. For example, reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) is an RNA amplification technique that detects the N gene of MERS-CoV and the ORF1a gene [

 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], while RT-LAMP-VF is the deformation of RT-LAMP [
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], which is the combination of reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification and vertical flow visualization strips. Both are used to detect the N gene of MERS-CoV, making detection easier, faster, more efficient and highly specific. Besides these three methods, reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assay (RT-PRA) is also used to identify MERS-CoV [
