<p id="p0045">Finally, the following multiplex tests can detect both coronaviruses and other viruses. MCoV-MS (multiplexed CoV mass spectrometry) uses an array matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) system to accurately identify known human coronaviruses (hCoVs) and to provide phylogenetic evidence for emerging unknown hCoVs [

 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The method can detect hCoVs, and Zika and Ebola viruses. The last one, the paper-based colorimetric assay, uses Pyrrolidinyl Peptide Nucleic Acid-induced silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) aggregation of pathogen DNA testing [
