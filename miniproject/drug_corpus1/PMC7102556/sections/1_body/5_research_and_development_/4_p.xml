<p id="p0060">Most CoVs share a similar viral structure, similar infection pathway, and a similar structure of the S proteins [
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], suggesting that similar research strategies should also be applicable for the 2019-nCoV. For example, the study of MERS-CoV vaccines was accelerated by virtue of strategies that had been established for SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. It has been reported that the 2019-nCoV is also genetically close to SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Therefore, to predict whether vaccines developed for SARS-CoV will also be effective against 2019-nCoV infection, the full length S protein sequences from the 2019-nCoV, a SARS-CoV, and two genetically similar bat CoV strains were selected for alignment (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.Â 1</xref> ). The results indicated more than 50% homology of the viruses. However, the most variable residues are located in S1, a critical vaccine target, implying that neutralizing antibodies that were so effective against SARS-CoV infection may fail to recognize the 2019-nCoV, and that multiple amino acid differences at the receptor binding motif may modify virus tropism, a possible reason for cross-species transmission.
