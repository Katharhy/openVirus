<p id="p0065">However, several bottlenecks typically delay the approval of vaccines to prevent CoVs infection. First, a lack of proper animal models for evaluating vaccine efficacy. Second, there are limitations from the S protein itself, such as mutations in the neutralization antibody epitopes in S protein that can cause virus escape [
