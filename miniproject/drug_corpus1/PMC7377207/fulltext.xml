Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms such as respiratory symptoms, cough, dyspnea, fever, and viral pneumonia and recover without any special cure. However, some others need special and emergency treatment to get rid of this widespread disease. Till now, there are numbers of proposed novel compounds as well as standards therapeutics agent existed for other conditions seems to have efficacy against the 2019-nCoV. Some which are being tested for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are validated that could be also efficient against this new coronavirus. However, there are currently no effective specific antivirals or drug combinations introduced for 2019-nCoV specifically that be supported by high-level evidence. The main purpose of this paper is to review typical and ongoing treatments for coronavirus disease including home remedies, herbal medicine, chemical drugs, plasma therapy, and also vaccinies. In this regards, famous herbal medicines and common chemical drugs which are routinely to be prescribed for patients are introduced. Moreover, a section is assigned to the drug interactions and some outdated drugs which have been proved to be inefficient. We hope that this work could pave the way for researchers to develop faster and more reliable methods for earlier treatment of patients and rescue more people.</p></sec><sec><title>Graphical abstract</title><p id="Par2"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="12575_2020_129_Figa_HTML" id="MO1"/></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Coronavirus</kwd><kwd>Therapeutic compounds</kwd><kwd>Drugs</kwd><kwd>Home remedies</kwd><kwd>Vaccine</kwd><kwd>Plasma</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par38">On 30 January 2020 the WHO declared global PHEIC about the epidemic problem of a new coronavirus called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was first appeared in Wuhan wet market, Hubei province [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This virus genetically is very similar to a bat coronavirus in the subgenus Sarbecovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The WHO named the disease as COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and it spread all over the world rapidly less than 3 month<italic>s. corona</italic>viruses can be classified into four genera (&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x003b3;, and &#x003b4;) and they are detected in a very wide selection of animal species, including humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The virus that causes the COVID-19 infection belongs to the &#x003b2; coronaviruses family. Since the beginning of the twenty-first century, three coronaviruses crossed the species barrier and causes deadly pneumonia in humans: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Unlike previous coronaviruses that caused large-scale epidemics such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the transmission rate for COVID-19 is much higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Due to the high rate of contagious and highly nonspecific symptoms of this disease such as respiratory symptoms, cough, dyspnea, fever, and viral pneumonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the establishment of precise and fast diagnostic tests are urgently required to verify suspected cases, screen patients, and conduct virus surveillance.</p><p id="Par39">The disease is typically confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) reverse Real-Time PCR assay (rRT-PCR), which can be carried out using a variety of clinical specimens, including Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, fibro bronchoscope brush biopsies, sputum, nasal swabs, pharyngeal swabs, feces, or blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. But it has been reported that the sensitivity of RT-PCR might not be enough for the diagnosis of the disease. So the Computed tomography (CT), as a noninvasive imaging approach, can detect certain characteristic manifestations in the lung associated with COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">The main goal of this paper is to review the newly developed or in developing medicines or remedies for the treatment of COVID-19 disease to help researchers around the world to find advantage and disadvantage of each method and select the best one.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Coronavirus History</title><p id="Par41">The Nidovirales order, includes Coronaviridae, Roniviridae and Arteriviridae families and Coronaviruses (CoVs) are the greatest group of viruses that relate to this order and Coronaviridae family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Coronaviruses have a single-strand RNA genome with 26 to 32 kilobases in length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. There are different hosts for coronaviruses but their special hosts are different types of avian hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, they have also other hosts like different kinds of mammals, including mice, bats, masked palm civets, camels, cats, and dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. New mammalian hosts are identified for coronaviruses these days and they are rapidly growing up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. For example, fatal severe diarrhea syndrome in pigs, associated with an HKU2-related coronavirus of bat source was reported in 2018 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. There are different coronaviruses, but the majority of them are associated with mild clinical symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 is a virus from coronaviruses family which causes infection in humans; SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 can cause acute disease, while NL63, HKU1, OC43, and 229E cause mild symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The first time that Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) appeared, it was in Guangdong, southern China, in November 2002 and the first time when the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged, it was in 2012 in Saudi Arabia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. During 2002&#x02013;03, more than 8000 infected cases by SARS-CoV and more than 774 deaths in 37 countries were confirmed, and MERS-CoV outbreak in September 2012, caused 2494 confirmed cases of infection and 858 mortalities, including 38 fatalities in South Korea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In late December 2019, many infected patients with viral pneumonia were reported, but the point was that all of them were associated with the Huanan seafood wholesale market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. So, a new virus which was associated with infecting human was confirmed and provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and this virus was detected with the use of next-generation sequencing.</p><p id="Par42">Reported cases with SARS-CoV-2 are now more prevalent, on 28 April 2020, 3,121,118 cases have been reported in 210 countries, and the number of death stands at 216,508 in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] at 20:52 GMT. At present, available data shows that 2019-nCoV spread the infection to the human population from a bat source, but it is unknown if other animal species are associated with this virus and acting as an intermediate host between humans and bat or not.</p><p id="Par43">Full-genome sequencing of 2019-nCoV shows that this virus is genetically similar to bat-SL-CoVZC45 (sequence identity 87&#x030fb;99%; query coverage 99%) and SARS-like betacoronavirus of bat origin, bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (accession number MG772934;23 87&#x030fb;23%; query coverage 98%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">Genetic-wise the 2019-nCoV strains are less similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (about 79 and 52%, respectively). Samples from Wuhan and China after Sequencing indicated that this virus comes from the subgenus Sarbecovirus. Also, it shows that it is more analogous to bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, which both are bat-derived coronavirus strains than to other recognized human infecting coronaviruses, which caused the SARS outbreak of 2003 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Coronaviruses have an evolutionary rate of 10<sup>&#x02212;&#x02009;4</sup> nucleotide substitutions per site per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Their genetic sequence endures mutations at every replication cycle. Due to every fact and information, 2019-nCoV emerged from one source instantaneously. However, as the virus is transmitted to more individuals, arising mutations should be investigated. All the evidence indicates that there is a relationship between bats and the novel coronaviruses, but facts show that there is another animal and it may act as an intermediate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Coronavirus Treatment Methods</title><p id="Par45">Most of the COVID-19- infected cases will face mild to moderate respiratory illness and they will recover without requiring special therapies.

So, Favipiravir may have the potential to act against SARS-CoV-2; researches showed that Favipiravir independently associates with more active viral clearance and higher improvement rates in the chest imaging and has a positive impact on treating patients with COVID-19 positive tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In a study in Wuhan, Favipiravir was administered to 200 patients, and their test results were appeared negative after a relatively short time.

The function mechanism of Chloroquine is increasing the endosomal pH. With a pH higher than what is required for virus/cell fusion, the infection is blocked. This interferes with glycoproteins of cellular receptors of sars-cov-2 which bind to their targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Therefore, Chloroquine can inhibit a pre-entry step of the viral cycle via interfering with the binding of viral particles to their cellular cell surface receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. In one study carried out by a Chinese researchers group about the efficiency of chloroquine in in-vitro studies, using Vero E6 cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.05, Chloroquine was highly effective in decreasing viral replication and it can block SARS-CoV-2 infection at low concentration (half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 1.13&#x02009;&#x003bc;M and a half-cytotoxic concentration (CC50) larger than 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;M) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].

This drug is a common anti-hypertensive agent that is presently suggested for the regulation of high blood pressure, particularly those cases that are prone to diabetic nephropathies. Losartan causes the release of aldosterone that is the physiological effects of AngII. Then plasma renin activity increases due to the absence of AngII and some biochemical events occur such as AngI to AngII (by ACE), converting angiotensinogen to AngI, vasoconstriction and aldosterone release (by AngII). The presence of aldosterone leads to recollecting sodium from the kidney which finally increases the blood pressure. Thus, losartan can reduce the blood pressure. Accordingly, losartan is a selective antagonist of the AT1 receptor which employs an inhibitory effect on the ACE-AngII-AT1 axis in the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS). So, it may be an effective drug to protect from lung damage induced by coronavirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Based on earlier laboratory researches, losartan also reduces the synthesis of TGF-1&#x003b2; and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Therefore, it can prevent or control persistent fibrotic diseases such as cardiac hypertrophy and asthma in addition to hypertension. Moreover, apart from direct anti-hypertensive outcomes of losartan, it provides a notable decrease of platelet aggregation by ristocetin and reduction of hematocrit with hemoglobin, following administration in newly diagnosed hypertensive patients which is suggestive for applying losartan for thrombosis and atherosclerosis as well. Other lateral functions of losartan considered to be the immunomodulatory role and significantly regulating IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-6, IL-17F, and IL-22 cytokines in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of rheumatoid arthritis patients.</p><p id="Par62">Finally, an earlier hypothesis illustrated that losartan as an angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blocker in the RAS pathway could be useful for patients infected by COVID-19 who experience pneumonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].</p><p id="Par63">The role of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) in COVID-19 infection is a hot topic of discussion. RAAS inhibitors, such as Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), which are used to treatment of cardiovascular diseases, have been resulted in increased cell surface levels of ACE2. ACE2 is the host receptor for COVID-19 which discovered in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Angiotensin receptor blockers (i.e., AT1R), like losartan, olmesartan and valsartan can inhibit Ang II-mediated vasoconstriction. Besides, aldosterone inhibitors (e.g., spironolactone, eplerenone, amiloride) control vascular tone by affecting sodium channels for sodium reabsorption in the kidneys to maintain blood volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Early experiments indicated that the interaction of the spike protein of the virus with the ACE2 leads to a decrease in ACE2 levels in cells, which causes lung damage. So the block of other available receptors is suggested, e.g. AT1R blockers (Angiotensin II receptor blocker) such as losartan, can help in curing COVID-19. However, this approach also needs more clinical patient records [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Interferon</title><p id="Par64">IFNs are a group of cytokines, which communicate between cells against pathogens and have a critical role in the immune system, such as activating natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages.

This can indicate the increased response threshold of immune cells to IFNs during CoV infections. Differences in the primary immune responses due to the interferon -depending on the age- lead to the various mortality rates. The increase in these rates in the elderly can be explained through the higher threshold of interferon-mediated immune responses. According to this, earlier induction of interferons in children and their less developed immune system is the main factor for their near to zero lethality rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>].</p><p id="Par68">Many researchers reported that their data about the identified gene expression signatures of viral invasion and type I interferon (IFN-I) responses is the key characterizing factor for the diagnosis of the COVID-19 infection stage in humans.

However, there are some supportive treatments, like oxygen supply in mild patients and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for the critical cases. In SARS-infected cases to enhance the survival rate of patients in cases whose state deteriorated, the last resort in treatment was applying immunoglobulins or convalescent plasma despite therapy with pulsed methylprednisolone. Besides, many different studies indicated a shorter hospital stay and less fatality in patients cured with convalescent plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. In 2014, WHO suggested the use of convalescent plasma acquired from Ebola virus-infected cases who had recovered as an empirical treatment through prevalence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. In 2015, a protocol for the use of convalescent plasma in the remedy of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus was appointed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. In a study, Hung and colleagues indicated that in the influenza A H1N1 (H1N1pdm09) virus-infected cases in 2009, there was a great decrease in the relative risk of mortality for those cases treated with convalescent plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. Besides, in a subgroup analysis, after convalescent plasma therapy viral load was lower on days 3, 5, and 7 after intensive care unit admission. There were not any adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. One of the results for indicating the efficacy of convalescent plasma treatment is that the antibodies from these kinds of plasma might repress viremia. Schoofs et al. described that 3BNC117-mediated immunotherapy, which is a wide neutralizing antibody to HIV-1, increases host humoral immunity to HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>].. Moreover, an in vivo test indicated that the effects of this antibody were not only blocking new infection and viral clearance but also involves fast clearance of infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. In the first week of infection, Viraemia peaks occur in viral infections. By days 10&#x02013;14 and through virus clearance, the patient usually arises a primary immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. So, theoretically, it looks like that it should be more useful to administer the convalescent plasma at the primary stage of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. However, other therapies might affect the connection between antibody level and convalescent plasma, involving antiviral drugs, intravenous immunoglobulin, and steroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. WHO recommended the main focus on infection prevention, infected detection and monitoring, and supportive treatment for COVID-19. However, there is not any special anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatment recommended due to the lack of evidence. There is a recommendation in a Comment in <italic>The Lancet</italic>, which emphasizes that systematic corticosteroids should not be given typically for the remedy of COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. Evidence indicates that convalescent plasma from patients who have recovered from viral infections can be applied as a therapy without the occurrence of severe harmful events. So, it might be beneficial to test the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma transfusion in SARS-CoV-2-infected cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. There are more than 30,000 recovered COVID-19 patients and they are the perfect source of convalescent plasma for health care providers. China National Biotec Group Co has claimed that 10 severely ill patients receiving this convalescent plasma treatment showed better oxygenation and less inflammation and viral load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>].

Avoiding contact with others will protect them from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par123">Till the time of writing this review, there are no specific vaccines or certain treatments for COVID-19. Many ongoing clinical trials and potential existed treatments are introduced which we also reported them here in this review, including home remedy, herbal medicine, chemical drugs, plasma therapy and also vaccines. Although, all the named principles could support the goal of improving more efficient drugs and therapeutic strategies to reduce mortality of coronavirus disease but among all the ways for treathing COVID-19, prevention is better than cure. Therefore, for keeping away from COVID-19, the best way is social distancing and observing the personal hygiene. Moreover, It is a pivotal condition for defeating the current outbreak of the COVID-19 and the contribution of all related researchers from all over the world is needing. Hope this review can help researchers to have general overview on existing methods for treating COVID-19 and to develop more efficient drugs and remedies for this deadly virus in the near future. Finally, hope this virus to be eradicated very soon.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>PHEIC</term><def><p id="Par3">Public Health Emergency of International Concern</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MERS</term><def><p id="Par4">Middle East Respiratory Syndrome</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SARS</term><def><p id="Par5">Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RT-PCR</term><def><p id="Par6">Reverse-transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>rRT-PCR</term><def><p id="Par7">Reverse Real-Time PCR</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CT</term><def><p id="Par8">Computed tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RNA</term><def><p id="Par9">Ribonucleic Acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DNA</term><def><p id="Par10">Deoxyribonucleic Acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p id="Par11">World Health Organization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CQ</term><def><p id="Par12">Chloroquine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MOI</term><def><p id="Par13">Multiplicity of Infection</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EC50</term><def><p id="Par14">half-maximal Effective Concentration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CC50</term><def><p id="Par15">Half-Cytotoxic Concentration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HCQ</term><def><p id="Par16">Hydroxychloroquine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HIV</term><def><p id="Par17">Human Immunodeficiency Viruses</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RAAS</term><def><p id="Par18">Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AT1R</term><def><p id="Par19">Angiotensin Receptor 1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ACE</term><def><p id="Par20">Angiotensin Converting Enzyme</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ARBs</term><def><p id="Par21">Angiotensin II receptor blockers</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NK</term><def><p id="Par22">Natural Killer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IFN-I</term><def><p id="Par23">Type-I Interferon</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>cGAS</term><def><p id="Par24">Cyclic GMP&#x02013;AMP Synthase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>STING</term><def><p id="Par25">Stimulator of Interferon Genes</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>STAT1</term><def><p id="Par26">Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CEP_C30</term><def><p id="Par27">Coronavirus Endopeptidase C30</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CYP3A</term><def><p id="Par28">Cytochrome P4503A</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IFN-&#x003b2;1b</term><def><p id="Par29">Interferon Beta-1b</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRP</term><def><p id="Par30">C-reactive Protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LDH</term><def><p id="Par31">Lactate Dehydrogenase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CDC</term><def><p id="Par32">Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CEPI</term><def><p id="Par33">Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>S-Trimer</term><def><p id="Par34">Subunit-trimer Vaccine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RBD</term><def><p id="Par35">Receptor-binding Domain</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ACE2</term><def><p id="Par36">Angiotensin-converting Enzyme 2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NIGEB</term><def><p id="Par37">National Institute of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>This study was made possible by a grant from the National Institute of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (NIGEB), Tehran, Iran.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>Matin Mahmoudifard has a role in the design and collection of data.
