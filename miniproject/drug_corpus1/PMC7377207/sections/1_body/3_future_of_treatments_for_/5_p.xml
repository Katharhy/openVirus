<p id="Par116">Studies indicates that human kidney and blood vessel can be easily infected, which can be significantly inhibited by hrsACE2 at the first phase of infection. But these studies have limitations, the design of their studies were based on the early stages of infection, showing that hrsACE2 can block the first entry of SARS-CoV-2 infections in host cells. As such, we cannot make any predictions to the effect of hrsACE2 in later stages of the disease process (

We recommend that further studies are needed to clarify the effect of hrsACE2 at later stages of infection in vitro and in vivo.
