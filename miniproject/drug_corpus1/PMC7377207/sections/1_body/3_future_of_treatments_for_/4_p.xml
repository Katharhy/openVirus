<p id="Par115">In a normal adult human lung, ACE2 is expressed firstly in alveolar epithelial type II cells and it can play a role as a viral source [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>]. These cells produce surfactant and it decreases surface tension, so it prohibits alveoli from collapsing, and therefore they are important for the gas exchange function of the lung [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">130</xref>]. The ACE2 tissue distribution in these organs may illustrate the multi-organ dysfunction confirmed in infected cases [
