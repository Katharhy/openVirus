<p id="Par41">The Nidovirales order, includes Coronaviridae, Roniviridae and Arteriviridae families and Coronaviruses (CoVs) are the greatest group of viruses that relate to this order and Coronaviridae family [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Coronaviruses have a single-strand RNA genome with 26 to 32 kilobases in length [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. There are different hosts for coronaviruses but their special hosts are different types of avian hosts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, they have also other hosts like different kinds of mammals, including mice, bats, masked palm civets, camels, cats, and dogs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. New mammalian hosts are identified for coronaviruses these days and they are rapidly growing up [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. For example, fatal severe diarrhea syndrome in pigs, associated with an HKU2-related coronavirus of bat source was reported in 2018 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. There are different coronaviruses, but the majority of them are associated with mild clinical symptoms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 is a virus from coronaviruses family which causes infection in humans; SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 can cause acute disease, while NL63, HKU1, OC43, and 229E cause mild symptoms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The first time that Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) appeared, it was in Guangdong, southern China, in November 2002 and the first time when the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged, it was in 2012 in Saudi Arabia [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. During 2002â€“03, more than 8000 infected cases by SARS-CoV and more than 774 deaths in 37 countries were confirmed, and MERS-CoV outbreak in September 2012, caused 2494 confirmed cases of infection and 858 mortalities, including 38 fatalities in South Korea [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In late December 2019, many infected patients with viral pneumonia were reported, but the point was that all of them were associated with the Huanan seafood wholesale market [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. So, a new virus which was associated with infecting human was confirmed and provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and this virus was detected with the use of next-generation sequencing.
