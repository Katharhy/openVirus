<p id="Par44">Genetic-wise the 2019-nCoV strains are less similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (about 79 and 52%, respectively). Samples from Wuhan and China after Sequencing indicated that this virus comes from the subgenus Sarbecovirus. Also, it shows that it is more analogous to bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, which both are bat-derived coronavirus strains than to other recognized human infecting coronaviruses, which caused the SARS outbreak of 2003 [

 <sup>− 4</sup> nucleotide substitutions per site per year [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Their genetic sequence endures mutations at every replication cycle. Due to every fact and information, 2019-nCoV emerged from one source instantaneously. However, as the virus is transmitted to more individuals, arising mutations should be investigated. All the evidence indicates that there is a relationship between bats and the novel coronaviruses, but facts show that there is another animal and it may act as an intermediate.
