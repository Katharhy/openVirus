<p id="Par38">On 30 January 2020 the WHO declared global PHEIC about the epidemic problem of a new coronavirus called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was first appeared in Wuhan wet market, Hubei province [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This virus genetically is very similar to a bat coronavirus in the subgenus Sarbecovirus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The WHO named the disease as COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and it spread all over the world rapidly less than 3 month
 <italic>s. corona</italic>viruses can be classified into four genera (α, β, γ, and δ) and they are detected in a very wide selection of animal species, including humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The virus that causes the COVID-19 infection belongs to the β coronaviruses family. Since the beginning of the twenty-first century, three coronaviruses crossed the species barrier and causes deadly pneumonia in humans: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Unlike previous coronaviruses that caused large-scale epidemics such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the transmission rate for COVID-19 is much higher [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Due to the high rate of contagious and highly nonspecific symptoms of this disease such as respiratory symptoms, cough, dyspnea, fever, and viral pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the establishment of precise and fast diagnostic tests are urgently required to verify suspected cases, screen patients, and conduct virus surveillance.
