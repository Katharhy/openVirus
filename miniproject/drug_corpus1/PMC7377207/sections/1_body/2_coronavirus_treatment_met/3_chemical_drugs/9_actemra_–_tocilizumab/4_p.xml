<p id="Par76">As during previous pandemics (SARS and MERS), corticosteroids are not routinely recommended and might exacerbate COVID-19-associated lung injury. However, in hyper inflammation, immunosuppression is likely to be beneficial. Re-analysis of data from a phase 3 randomized controlled trial of IL-1 blockade (anakinra) in sepsis, showed meaningful survival impacts in patients with hyper inflammation, without extra side effects. A default controlled trial of tocilizumab (licensed for cytokine release syndrome), has been approved in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and raised IL-6 in China (
