<p id="Par78">Vitamin D has many mechanisms that reduce the risk of microbial infection and death. Vitamin D with enhance cellular innate immunity partly through the induction of antimicrobial peptides, including human cathelicidin, LL-37, by 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D and defensins that has antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, enveloped and nonenveloped viruses, and fungi. It is known that COVID-19 infection is associated with the increasing production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, C-reactive protein, increase risk of pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and heart failure. (Evidence that Vitamin D Supplementation Could Reduce the Risk of Influenza and COVID-19 Infections and deaths). Vitamin D also deregulates the inflammatory response, especially of the renin-angiotensin system, which is characteristic of COVID-19, and degree of overactivation is associated with poorer prognosis. Vitamin D is known to interact with a protein in this pathway—angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)—which is also exploited by SARS-CoV-2 as an entry receptor. Downregulates expression of ACE2, vitamin D promotes the expression of this gene [
