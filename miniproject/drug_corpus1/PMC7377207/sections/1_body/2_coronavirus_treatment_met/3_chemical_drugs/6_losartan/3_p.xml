<p id="Par63">The role of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) in COVID-19 infection is a hot topic of discussion. RAAS inhibitors, such as Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), which are used to treatment of cardiovascular diseases, have been resulted in increased cell surface levels of ACE2. ACE2 is the host receptor for COVID-19 which discovered in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Angiotensin receptor blockers (i.e., AT1R), like losartan, olmesartan and valsartan can inhibit Ang II-mediated vasoconstriction. Besides, aldosterone inhibitors (e.g., spironolactone, eplerenone, amiloride) control vascular tone by affecting sodium channels for sodium reabsorption in the kidneys to maintain blood volume [

Early experiments indicated that the interaction of the spike protein of the virus with the ACE2 leads to a decrease in ACE2 levels in cells, which causes lung damage. So the block of other available receptors is suggested, e.g. AT1R blockers (Angiotensin II receptor blocker) such as losartan, can help in curing COVID-19. However, this approach also needs more clinical patient records [
