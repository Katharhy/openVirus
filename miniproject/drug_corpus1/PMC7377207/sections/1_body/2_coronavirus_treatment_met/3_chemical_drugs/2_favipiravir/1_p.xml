<p id="Par55">Favipiravir is a drug approved for the treatment of influenza in China. The action mechanism of Favipiravir is to inhibit RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. In addition to the action against the influenza virus, this antiviral drug can inhibit the replication of flavi, alpha, filo, bunya, and other RNA viruses [

So, Favipiravir may have the potential to act against SARS-CoV-2; researches showed that Favipiravir independently associates with more active viral clearance and higher improvement rates in the chest imaging and has a positive impact on treating patients with COVID-19 positive tests [

Also, the symptoms of pneumonia were significantly reduced. In another study in Wuhan, showed that the patient treated with Favipiravir recovered from fever after an average of 2.5 days, compared to 4.2 days of other patients [
