<p id="Par70">Lopinavir is metabolized by cytochrome P4503A (CYP3A) isoenzyme in the liver. It is always used with ritonavir to reduce the dose of lopinavir and enhance the plasma levels of lopinavir as ritonavir inhibits CYP3A isoenzyme. Lopinavir and ritonavir are antiretroviral protease inhibitors used in combination as a second-line drug for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in children and grown-ups through the fewer side effects. A few historical control studies or case reports show the effectiveness of the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections. The reduction of steroid consumption and nosocomial infections was seen in patients initially treated with lopinavir/ritonavir. Also, results indicate decreasing viral load and enhancing peripheral lymphocyte count. Findings from in vitro and clinical studies, together with the availability and safety profiles of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon beta-1b (IFN-β1b) suggest that the combination of these agents has potential efficacy for the treatment of patients with MERS-CoV [
