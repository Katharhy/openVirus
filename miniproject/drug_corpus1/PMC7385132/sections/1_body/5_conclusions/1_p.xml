<p>SARS-CoV-2 effects on the kidney and in patient with underlying kidney disease is not well-characterized. Preliminary data has indicated that previous kidney disease could represent a risk factor, especially in elderly patients, for a more severe disease course. SARS-CoV-2 infects the kidneys and may induce acute kidney injury. While there is no current specific therapy, many drugs both antiviral and/or anti-inflammatory are being actively tested in randomized trials. Further studies are necessary to better understand disease pathology, acute kidney injury associated with infection, long-term renal consequences, and potential therapies. Rigorously controlled interventional studies and international registry analyses will be crucial to define risk factor and the best therapeutic approaches to resolving COVID-19 disease outcomes.</p>
