<p>Complement activation through the lectin pathway has already been described in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Gao et al. (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) showed that blocking this pathway ameliorates lung injury induced by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in mice. Autoptic lung samples and skin biopsies from patients with severe COVID-19 showed a deposition of mannose binding lectin (MBL)-associated serine protease (MASP)2, C4d, and C5b-9 (MAC component), suggesting an activation of the complement system through the alternative and the lectin pathways (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Due to the implicated role of complement in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury and ARDS, ongoing clinical trials are testing the hypothesis that blocking the complement cascade ameliorates disease severity in COVID-19 patients.
