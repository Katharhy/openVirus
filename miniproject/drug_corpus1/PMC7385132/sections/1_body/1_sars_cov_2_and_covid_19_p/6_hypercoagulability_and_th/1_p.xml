<p>In general, altered hemostasis due to viral infections often leads to vascular complications like thrombosis and or hemorrhage. Vascular and endothelial changes by the virus as well as inherited host factors help define the clinical presentation. Some viral contributions to the ischemic and thrombotic environment include procoagulant factors, hemodynamic changes, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. The pro-inflammatory response also directly induces plaque rupture (

 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) and is of increasing concern for patients with severe COVID-19. The majority of severe COVID-19 patients show signs of increased coagulation activity, resulting in consumption of coagulation factors and disseminated microvascular thrombosis. Hypoxia associated with COVID-19 pneumonia increases blood viscosity both directly and through hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-dependent signaling pathway thereby promoting thrombosis (

Laboratory results indicate a prolongation of the prothrombin time and international normalized ratio (PT/INR) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), elevation of D-dimer, decreased fibrinogen levels, thrombocytopenia, and schistocytes in peripheral blood smears. In one study of 449 COVID-19 patients, 71% of non-survivors had diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC) compared to 0.4% of survivors (
