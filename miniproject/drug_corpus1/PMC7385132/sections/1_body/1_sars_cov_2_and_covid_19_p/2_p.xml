<p>The spike protein is key to its high-virality as the RNA virus enters cells through binding between the S protein and its host receptor. The virus efficiently binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (

Zhao et al. demonstrated that ACE2 is highly expressed in the alveolar epithelial type II cells (AECII), suggesting that these cells could be the reservoir for the virus. Other studies have showed that the AECII cells have several genes related to the viral process, replication, life cycle and assembly, therefore facilitating the viral replication in the lung (
