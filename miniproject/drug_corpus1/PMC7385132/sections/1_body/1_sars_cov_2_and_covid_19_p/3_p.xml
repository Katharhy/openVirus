<p>After binding to ACE2, the cellular transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) mediates the S protein priming allowing the virus to enter the host cells through clathrin-dependent endocytosis (

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The endosomal entry way for the virus requires a low inner pH, and once inside, the virus exploits the cellular transcriptional machinery to replicate itself and spread throughout the host (
