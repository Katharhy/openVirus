<p>SARS-CoV-2 needs an acidic endosomal pH for processing and internalization (

 <italic>In vitro</italic> data indicate that the antimalarial drug chloroquine exerts antiviral effects by increasing endosomal pH and abrogating virus-endosome fusion. Antiviral effects

 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>). Preliminary data suggests potential efficacy of hydroxychloroquine, particularly combined with azithromycin, in viral clearance. Hydroxychloroquine is often administered in conjunction with azithromycin, but caution is needed since these drugs are both associated with QT prolongation that could cause arrhythmias especially when combined with medications used to treat other chronic conditions (e.g., kidney failure, hepatic disease). In a small randomized study of 62 COVID-19 positive patients (not peer-reviewed) patients treated with hydroxychloroquine treatment showed an improvement in the clinical recovery and in the resolution of pneumonia compared to the control group (
