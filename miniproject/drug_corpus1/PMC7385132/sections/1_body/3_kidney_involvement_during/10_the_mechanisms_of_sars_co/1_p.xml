<p>The exact mechanism of kidney involvement is unclear and likely multifactorial. Kidney disease may be caused by SARS-CoV-2 binding to the ACE2 receptor on kidney cells that allows the virus to enter (

 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Moreover, normal kidney and intestinal tract have higher ACE2 expression than lung tissue (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Detection of coronavirus in the kidneys and urine of patients with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 supports the theory that the virus can directly damage the kidneys (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). However, in another study, no urine tested positive for viral RNA in 72 samples (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Preliminary evidence in postmortem examinations of kidney tissue from six patients found severe acute tubular necrosis and lymphocyte infiltration. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) has been detected through immunohistochemistry in kidney tubules (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Moreover, in one autopsy of a kidney transplant patient who died of COVID-19, viral inclusion structures were found in the endothelial cells of the kidney (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Viral infection could induce tubular damage through the deposition of the MAC complex (the final step of the complement cascade) on tubules and infiltration of CD68
 <sup>+</sup> macrophages in the tubule-interstitium (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Diffuse damage in proximal tubules with the loss of brush border, vacuolar degeneration, and even necrosis were observed in a study of 26 autopsies of patients with COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). In the peritubular and glomerular capillary of these autopsies, diffuse erythrocyte aggregation with endothelial damage, and obstruction without fibrin thrombi or distinct fragmentation of erythrocytes or platelets were observed (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). Clusters of SARS-CoV-2 was found with electron microscopy in the tubular epithelium and podocytes (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). However, this finding could be non-specific as the presence of viral proteins may not represent direct damage mediated by the virus and instead indicate clathrin-coated vesicles (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Puelles et al. (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>) showed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and proteins in all kidney areas, especially in glomerular cells in autopsies of three of six COVID-19 patients.
