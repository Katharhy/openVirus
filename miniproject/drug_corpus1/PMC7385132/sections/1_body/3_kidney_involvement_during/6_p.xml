 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). SARS, MERS, and sepsis have been successfully treated in the past with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). In these cases, CRRT by hemofiltration and hemodiafiltration can contribute to the improvement of organ failure. Therefore, CRRT may be beneficial in patients with COVID-19 and sepsis syndrome, but it needs to be evaluated more carefully (
