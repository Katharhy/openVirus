<p>Approximately 80% of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 present with mild disease and can recover spontaneously (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). The other 20% of patients present with severe disease and 6% become critically ill (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). In these symptomatic patients, the main signs manifest as an upper respiratory tract infection, cough, fever, and asthenia. Patients with severe disease will present with pneumonia suspected by the presence of decreased oxygen saturation, lymphopenia and increased inflammatory markers (CRP, D-dimer, ferritin) (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Chest CT scans usually show bilateral involvement of the lungs, with consolidation in subsegmental areas (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Viral pneumonia can evolve into severe acute hypoxic respiratory failure mediated by increased pulmonary capillary permeability and damage of the alveolar epithelial cell (
