<p>Viruses have evolved multiple strategies to interfere with IFN expression and this seems especially true of coronaviruses. In a related previous study, experimental infection with a MERS-CoV strain (human coronavirus EMC) failed to induce expression of type I and type III IFNs in respiratory tissue cultures, while infection with influenza virus induced high levels of both IFN types [
