<p>The authors obtained human lung tissue samples from 6 donors who were not infected with SARS-CoV-2 and divided each sample into 2 subcultures to compare viral replication and immune activation caused by experimental infection with SARS-CoV-2 to that for SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This self-paired design addresses potential random differences between tissue samples that are a problem for small studies. The investigators found that although these 2 coronaviruses have similar cell tropism (types I and II pneumocytes, as well as alveolar macrophages), infection and viral replication was much more efficient for SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV. The higher viral levels associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection may reflect an even more striking observation from this study: SARS-CoV-2 largely failed to induce expression of any IFNs (type I, II, or III) in the infected human lung tissues. While this study does not address how SARS-CoV-2 evades the innate immune response and suppresses endogenous IFN production, these results suggest that treatment with exogenous IFN to stimulate antiviral immunity might be effective against SARS-CoV-2.
