<p>There are as yet no data with respect to treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection with IFN-λ; however, there are relevant data concerning SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In macaque monkeys experimentally infected with SARS-CoV, prophylactic treatment with intramuscular pegylated IFN-α reduced viral replication and excretion, as well as pulmonary damage [
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In a human airway epithelial cell culture model, IFN-λ3 and IFN-λ4 exhibited antiviral effects against MERS-CoV [
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]; therefore, IFN-λ might provide similar prophylactic protection against coronavirus infections.
