<p>Preclinical data from various animal model studies suggest that pegylated IFN-λ1 might reduce the disease severity and risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. While more specific measures are being developed, this extensively studied agent should be evaluated as part of an early and rapid response to attenuate disease and prevent infection spread. As the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is incompletely understood, both the efficacy and safety of the pegylated IFN-λ1 administration require careful study. An important difference between chronic viral hepatitis, where pegylated IFN-λ1 has been tested so far, and SARS-CoV-2 infection is that patients with severe COVID-19 have a high degree of lung inflammation. While IFN-λ has weaker proinflammatory properties than type I IFN, pegylated IFN-λ1 has not been tested in patients with respiratory infections and, ideally, should be first studied in patients with early SARS-CoV-2 infection or as prophylaxis. Possible trials of pegylated IFN-λ1 for treating more advanced COVID-19 should be informed by those results and include careful monitoring of the inflammatory state of the patients.</p>
