<p>As highlighted in published case series, there is wide variation in clinical presentations of COVID-19, ranging from no symptoms to intractable ARDS and shock. The determinants of these varied outcomes remain unknown, but experience with other viruses suggests that variation in the dose of viral inoculum, route of inoculation, and underlying immune status of the patient can lead to widely variable host responses.

 </sup> At the same time, moderate SARS-CoV-2 viral loads can be detected in nasal swabs up to 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms and in asymptomatic individuals.

 </sup> The attributable risk from higher viral inocula is difficult to quantify in real-world settings, but higher viral loads in critically ill patients pose at least a theoretical risk to healthcare providers.
