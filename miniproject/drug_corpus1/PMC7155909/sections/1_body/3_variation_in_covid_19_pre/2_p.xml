<p>The major risk factors for mortality among early reported cases of COVID-19 are old age and underlying respiratory disease.

 </sup> Again, the reasons for these age associations are unknown, but there are multiple theories that can be extrapolated from host–pathogen biology. For example, immunosenescence could contribute to the increased risk among the aged. As individuals age, the frequency of naive B and T cells diminishes, implying less capacity to recognize and adapt to novel antigens. At the same time, aged immune cells have less proliferative and functional capacity even when responding to known antigens. Such age-related changes in cellular immunity manifest in decreased vaccine effectiveness, worse outcomes in the setting of influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and herpes zoster infections,

 </sup> and have been demonstrated in mouse models of coronavirus infection.

 </sup> As the lung ages, the airway epithelium restorative capacity is also diminished. Telomere dysfunction is one biologic mechanism of aging, which primarily manifests as pulmonary fibrosis but can also restrict leukocyte proliferation. It is conceivable that poor outcomes from COVID-19 could be linked to short telomeres, as has been reported with pulmonary fibrosis, ARDS, and sepsis.

 </sup> It is also possible that younger individuals may have differential susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, in the rat lung, angiotensin converting enzyme-2 expression decreases with age.

 </sup> Children also could benefit from immunity developed from other coronavirus infections. Indeed, modest cross-reactivity was observed between endemic coronaviruses, such as OC43 and SARS-CoV.

 </sup> This potentially protective cross-reactive immunity would be limited by age and immunosenescence. If fecal–oral transmission resulted in a milder gastroenteritis presentation of SARS-CoV-2, it is also conceivable that children could be subsequently protected from the COVID-19 respiratory syndrome. While we currently can only speculate as to the causes of variation in COVID-19 presentations, these mechanisms likely hold important clues that will inform management and therapeutics.
