<p>The majority of patients with COVID-19 infection present with fever as the first symptom. Other common symptoms at onset of illness include cough or fatigue. Less commonly reported symptoms include palpitations, headache, and diarrhea. A subset of patients develop dyspnea at days 5 to 8 after hospitalization. The most commonly reported hematologic laboratory abnormalities with COVID-19 are leukopenia and lymphopenia.

 </sup> While the majority of patients have mild symptoms and good prognosis, up to 15% of patients will develop pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cardiac injury, renal injury, or multiorgan failure from days 7 to 10 after hospitalization. A subset of patients with COVID-19 will require admission to the ICU and respiratory support with noninvasive or invasive ventilation, or potentially extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
