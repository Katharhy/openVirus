<p>The incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 appears to be from 4 to 7 days. Initial reports demonstrated rapid person-to-person viral transmission, with the number of infected individuals doubling every 7.4 days.

 </sup> Viral evolution patterns inferred from viral gene sequence variations suggest that much of the viral transmission that has occurred in the United States has been undiagnosed, where two cases reported 6 weeks apart could potentially represent a cluster of hundreds of infections.

 </sup> Two distinct groups of SARS-CoV-2 sequences have been identified: The L-type represented 96% of the cases in Wuhan, while the more ancestral S-type was found in 38% of cases outside Wuhan. It has been postulated that the S-type could be less severe and thus capable of more rapid spread because of less negative selective pressure.
