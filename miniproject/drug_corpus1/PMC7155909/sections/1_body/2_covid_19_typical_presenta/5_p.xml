<p>For diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing is the standard assay. Throat swab and nasal swab samples are commonly used for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. While reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction is a useful test to confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19, with limitations of sample collection and kit performance, the total positive rate of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for throat swab samples has been reported to be about 30 to 60% at initial presentation.

 </sup> Serial reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing and inclusion of lower airway sampling can improve the sensitivity of testing. Commercially available molecular tests for endemic coronaviruses, such as the FilmArray Respiratory Panel (BioFire Diagnostics, USA) do not detect SARS-CoV-2

 </sup> currently. It is expected that SARS-CoV-2 will be added soon.
 <sup>30</sup> Chest computed tomography may have higher sensitivity for COVID-19 infection, with a sensitivity as high as 97% in one study.

 </sup> Based on challenges with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing, computed tomography imaging has been proposed as a primary tool for COVID-19 detection in hospitalized patients in epidemic areas. However, within the first 2 days after symptom onset, the majority of patients may have normal computed tomography imaging.

 </sup> Thus, early in the disease course, there may be no diagnostic sufficiently sensitive to exclude COVID-19.
