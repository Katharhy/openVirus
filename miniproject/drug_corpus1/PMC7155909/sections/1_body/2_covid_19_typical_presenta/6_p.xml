 </sup> While many of the pathologic findings are similar to those seen with coronavirus-associated severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndromeâ€“related coronavirus, such as inflammatory infiltrates and hyaline membrane formation, the findings of inspissated spherical secretions or fibromyxoid exudates are more prominent in COVID-19 infection. Accumulation of these thick secretions likely causes decreased alveolar gas exchange predisposing to respiratory failure, suggesting a potential role for airway clearance and bronchial hygiene in the treatment of COVID-19.
