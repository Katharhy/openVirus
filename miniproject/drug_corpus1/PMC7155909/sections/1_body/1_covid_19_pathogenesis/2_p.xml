<p>SARS-CoV-2 is a beta-coronavirus, a family that includes the original severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, as well as Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS), and endemic human pathogens that are common causes of the cold, including OC43 and HKU1. While beta-coronaviruses have been around for more than 5,000 yr, outbreaks of lethal strains of SARS-CoV in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus in 2012 have added to their notoriety.

 </sup> SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, and SARS-CoV-2 all likely originated in bats, with SARS-CoV using civets as intermediary hosts and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus passing though camels. Pangolins, also known as scaly anteaters, are implicated in the passage of SARS-CoV-2 to humans on the basis of sequence similarity with pangolin coronaviruses.
