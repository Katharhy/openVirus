<p>The variable clinical manifestations caused by distinct coronavirus strains can be attributed to structural differences in virus proteins, affecting tropism and replication. The “corona” description references the crown-like halo of viral spike (S) proteins observed by electron microscopy (fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Variations in this S-protein determine which proteins coronavirions use to enter cells. Early investigations into SARS-CoV-2 suggest that it uses tissue angiotensin converting enzyme-2 as its receptor, a trait shared with SARS, but not Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus or more common endemic human coronaviruses such as OC43 and HKU1.

 </sup> Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 is expressed in the lower respiratory tract but not bronchi, as well as enterocytes in the small intestine.

 </sup> Thus, angiotensin converting enzyme-2 dependence may explain the clinical presentations of lower respiratory tract infection and enteritis in COVID-19. Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 expression in vascular endothelium and cardiac myocytes has also been implicated in acute cardiac injury resulting from COVID-19.

 </sup> In animal models, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers increase angiotensin converting enzyme-2 expression and activity, respectively, leading to speculation that these medications could possibly potentiate SARS-CoV-2 infection.

 </sup> Major cardiology societies do not recommend changing renin angiotensin aldosterone system antagonist treatments based on COVID-19 risk at this time.
 <sup>13</sup> Other sites express angiotensin converting enzyme-2, such as the tongue and parts of the genitourinary tract, but the clinical significance of this finding in COVID-19 is unclear.

 </sup> Binding of S-protein to angiotensin converting enzyme-2 likely contributes directly to pathogenesis, resulting in downregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme-2, increased production of angiotensin II, and resulting increased pulmonary vascular permeability.

 </sup> While SARS-CoV-2–susceptible angiotensin converting enzyme-2 appears universally expressed in humans, there may be genetic variations regulating angiotensin converting enzyme-2 expression that could lead to differential susceptibilities across populations and genotypes.
