<p>Relative to the assortment of viruses that cause human upper respiratory tract infection, the group of viruses that cause lower respiratory tract infection is smaller, but includes influenza and parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, cytomegalovirus, and hantavirus. These infections are mostly limited to tracheobronchitis in healthy individuals but can cause severe viral pneumonias in immunocompromised patients. While influenza is one of the best-known causes of pneumonia in the intensive care unit (ICU), this presentation is frequently related to bacterial superinfection, such as with

 </sup> Some of the rarity of viral pneumonia can be attributed to the types of cells that viruses can infect, termed 
 <italic>tropism</italic>. Thus, while the more common influenza strains (like H1N1) target cells in the trachea and bronchi, influenza pneumonia is particularly linked to avian strains (like H5N1) that skip the upper respiratory epithelium and infect alveolar epithelial cells of the lower respiratory tract.
