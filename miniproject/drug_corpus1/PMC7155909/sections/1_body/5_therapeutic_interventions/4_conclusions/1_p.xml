<p>In the face of this rapidly emerging global threat, there are several reasons for optimism about future control. As described above, a number of antiviral drugs have shown promise 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Even a partially effective antiviral could allow sufficient reduction in viral load so that the immune system can recover and respond to prevent lethal disease. There is even potential that antivirals could be used in chemoprophylaxis to prevent transmission in recently exposed individuals. While resistance to antivirals developed quickly in patients with HIV, studies in coronaviruses suggest this might be less of a problem.

 </sup> Similarly, while HIV readily evades cellular and humoral immunity, sharply limiting vaccination approaches,

 </sup> SARS-CoV infection appeared to induce broad and long-lasting immunity with less evidence of immune escape.

 </sup> Thus, it is likely that as COVID-19 evolves, physicians will have a variety of therapeutic and vaccination options to minimize morbidity and mortality. Until these arrive, anesthesiologists will be called upon to provide supportive care while minimizing the risk of viral transmission to themselves and others.
