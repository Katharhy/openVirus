<p>COVID-19 patients have multiple distinct radiologic patterns: diffuse ground glass, reticulation, consolidation suggestive of pneumonitis, diffuse alveolar damage, and organizing pneumonia.

 </sup> In cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, steroid administration has been suggested to prevent progression to hypoxemic respiratory failure in case series.

 </sup> At the same time, the requirement for steroids has been shown to be less relevant for organizing pneumonia with an identified cause, as in COVID-19.

 </sup> Compared with steroids, patients treated with macrolides for mild cryptogenic organizing pneumonia also demonstrated symptom resolution, albeit with higher relapse rates.

 </sup> In case series of COVID-19 patients, steroids and macrolides were commonly used, but we lack data as to their effectiveness.

 </sup> In a retrospective analysis, which could be confounded by indication, steroid therapy was associated with decreased risk of death in patients with ARDS and COVID-19.
 <sup>99</sup> Specific studies in COVID-19 patients are needed to determine whether corticosteroids or macrolides could be beneficial in a subset of patients, such as those with organizing pneumonia patterns.
