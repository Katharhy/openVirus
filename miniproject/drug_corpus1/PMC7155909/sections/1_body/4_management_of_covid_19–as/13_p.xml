<p>The World Health Organization guidelines for the management of COVID-19 echo the United Kingdom ARDS guidelines in recommending a conservative fluid management strategy for patients without evidence of tissue hypoperfusion.

 </sup> While both the U.S./European Union and United Kingdom ARDS guidelines weakly recommend the use of higher PEEP in moderate to severe ARDS and the United Kingdom guidelines weakly recommend the use of neuromuscular blockade by continuous infusion early in moderate to severe ARDS, recent clinical trials challenge these recommendations, and thus, various components of best clinical practice for ARDS remain unclear at this time.

 </sup> A large multicenter trial of patients randomized to receive either a conventional low PEEP ventilation strategy or a titrated PEEP strategy resulting in high PEEP combined with lung recruitment maneuvers found increased mortality in the higher PEEP and lung recruitment maneuver arm.

 </sup> Regarding the use of neuromuscular blockade, a recent multicenter randomized trial found no mortality benefit with its use in early moderate to severe ARDS, and more adverse cardiovascular events in the paralysis arm of the study.

 </sup> With these trials in mind, the World Health Organization guidelines suggest cautious use of higher PEEP in moderate or severe ARDS, but not routine use of neuromuscular blockade.
