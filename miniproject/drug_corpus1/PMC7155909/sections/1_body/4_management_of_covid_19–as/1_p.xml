<p>While most patients with COVID-19 appear to have a relatively mild disease course, a subset will develop hypoxemic respiratory failure with imaging patterns consistent with diffuse viral pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia, or diffuse alveolar damage.

 </sup> The true incidence of severe pulmonary disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 is not yet clear, but several studies from Hubei province have reported a 5 to 25% ICU admission rate among hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2, and an ARDS diagnosis in 60 to 70% of patients admitted to the ICU (table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

 </sup> Among patients who do develop dyspnea and hypoxemia, the median time from onset of symptoms to the development of dyspnea appears to be between 5 and 8 days, with ARDS developing in a smaller subset of those patients at 7 to 10 days.
