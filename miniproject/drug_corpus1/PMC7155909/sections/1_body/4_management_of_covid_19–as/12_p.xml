<p>After intubation, management of COVID-19–associated respiratory failure is the same as in ARDS from other causes. U.S., European Union, and recently released United Kingdom ARDS guidelines strongly recommend the use of low tidal volume ventilation (4 to 8 ml/kg predicted body weight in the U.S./European Union guidelines or less than 6 ml/kg in the United Kingdom guidelines, to maintain plateau pressures less than 30 cm H
 <sub>2</sub>0), with permissive hypercapnia.

 </sup> The U.S., European Union, and United Kingdom guidelines also strongly recommend the use of prone positioning for greater than 12 h per day in patients with severe (moderate-severe in United Kingdom guidelines) ARDS, and this recommendation is echoed in the World Health Organization SARS-CoV-2 guideline.

 </sup> However, as prone ventilation is a resource-intensive intervention where the endotracheal tube and other lines may become displaced, it is only recommended when there are sufficient human resources and expertise within the medical center for this intervention to be performed safely.
