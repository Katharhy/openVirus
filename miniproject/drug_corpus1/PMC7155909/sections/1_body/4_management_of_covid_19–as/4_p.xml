<p>High flow nasal cannula can provide 100% oxygen to patients at a high flow rate, adds a low (2 to 3â€‰cm H
 <sub>2</sub>0) positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) effect, and reduces the work of breathing in patients with acute respiratory failure.

 </sup> High flow nasal cannula has been used to treat ARDS with a good safety profile, but given its more recent clinical introduction, there are little data from other outbreaks to guide its use in COVID-19 associated respiratory failure.

 </sup> In one study of 310 patients with ARDS randomized to receive initial high flow nasal cannula, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, or conventional oxygen therapy, the use of high flow nasal cannula did not significantly reduce intubation rates overall, but patients randomized to the high flow nasal cannula arm had a lower 90-day mortality rate.

 </sup> Patients with moderate or severe ARDS were less likely to require conversion to mechanical ventilation when randomized to the high flow nasal cannula arm of this trial.

 </sup> A systematic review of the use of high flow nasal cannula in ARDS did not find a difference in mortality or intubation rates as compared with usual care, and found that high flow nasal cannula is well tolerated by patients.

 </sup> The use of novel indices, such as the ratio of oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen to respiratory rate, may be helpful to predict clinical deterioration and the need for intubation when high flow nasal cannula is used.
