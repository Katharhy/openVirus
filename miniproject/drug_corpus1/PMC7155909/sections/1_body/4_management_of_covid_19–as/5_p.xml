<p>Given the existing literature base, the use of high flow nasal cannula as an initial strategy for the treatment of COVID-19â€“associated respiratory failure appears reasonable when patients are closely monitored for worsening respiratory distress. World Health Organization COVID-19 guidelines and others recommend avoiding high flow nasal cannula use in patients with severe or worsening hypercapnia, hemodynamic instability, multiorgan failure, or altered mental status.
