<p>Regardless of the choice of initial oxygen therapy for patients with COVID-19–associated respiratory failure, these patients should be closely monitored for deterioration and intubated promptly to avoid the need for an emergent intervention.

 </sup> Experience from the 2003 SARS epidemic suggests that intubation is a time when healthcare workers are at high risk for viral transmission from infected patients (odds ratio, 6.6).

 </sup> It should be noted, however, that several of the healthcare providers who contracted SARS while intubating patients were wearing only standard surgical facemasks at the time of intubation, and there is no strong evidence to link intubation with risk of transmission of virus to healthcare workers when proper airborne precautions are taken.

 </sup> Of note, while several 
 <italic>post hoc</italic> reports from the 2003 SARS epidemic and emerging reports from this current epidemic recommend the use of higher level personal protective equipment such as a powered air-purifying respirators, double gloves, coveralls, foot covers, or hoods when performing aerosol generating procedures such as intubation, there does not appear to be evidence to support the superiority of these measures over standard droplet, contact, and aerosol precautions.

 </sup> Some have even suggested that the use of increasing layers of barrier precautions without strong evidence to support their application makes patient care more challenging and could increase the risk of contamination during lengthy and complex personal protective equipment removal procedures.

 </sup> Application of full barrier precautions has been reported to take at least 5 min, and ideally should not be performed emergently.
