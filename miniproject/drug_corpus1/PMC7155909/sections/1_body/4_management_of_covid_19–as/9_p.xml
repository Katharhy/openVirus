<p>There is substantial concern that using noninvasive positive pressure ventilation or high flow nasal cannula in patients with viral respiratory illness results in increased production of aerosolized virus particles, creating a risk for healthcare workers or contaminating the clinical environment. While multiple studies from the 2003 SARS epidemic have identified participation in tracheal intubation as a risk factor for viral spread to healthcare workers, noninvasive ventilation was only identified as a risk factor in two small studies not considered robust enough to establish the risk of transmission in a 2012 meta-analysis.

 </sup> Experimental studies of exhaled air dispersion by mannequins in isolation rooms using conventional low flow nasal cannula, high flow nasal cannula, and continuous positive airway pressure with nasal pillows or full facemask, demonstrated greater exhaled air dispersion with conventional low flow nasal cannula at 5 l/min (up to 1 m from the patient’s face) as compared with either high flow nasal cannula or continuous positive airway pressure.

 </sup> The authors postulated that lower exhaled air dispersion from high flow nasal cannula or continuous positive airway pressure masks could be related to tighter fit to the face with these modalities, and also that the humidified air generated by these modalities could result in exhalation of larger droplets with a shorter trajectory due to gravity.

 </sup> The use of a full noninvasive positive pressure ventilation facemask might also prevent spread of aerosolized droplets in a patient who is sneezing or coughing.

 </sup> Thus, there is a risk that any method of oxygen delivery to a patient with COVID-19–associated respiratory distress can result in spread of virus-containing exhaled air, especially if the mask is poorly fitted or leaking, but the concern that use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation or high flow nasal cannula specifically leads to worse environmental contamination is not substantiated by the current available evidence. Patients receiving any supplemental oxygen therapy should be cared for in airborne isolation rooms whenever possible, with staff using full contact, droplet, and airborne isolation precautions.

 </sup> Providers should be aware that coronaviruses can remain infectious on inanimate surfaces for up to 9 days, and all surfaces and equipment used for SARS-2-CoV–infected patients should be carefully disinfected with 70% or greater ethanol for small surfaces or 0.1% or greater sodium hypochlorite for larger surfaces.
