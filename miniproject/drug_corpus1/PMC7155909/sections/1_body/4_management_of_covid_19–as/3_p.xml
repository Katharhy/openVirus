<p>In select patients with COVID-19–associated respiratory failure presenting with hypoxemia that is not adequately treated with low flow nasal cannula oxygen or conventional facemask, a trial of either noninvasive positive pressure ventilation or heated and humidified high flow nasal cannula oxygen may be reasonable before endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.

 </sup> World Health Organization COVID-19 management guidelines, among others, suggest this trial should be of limited duration (1 h) to avoid unrecognized severe respiratory decompensation that requires emergent intervention. The use of high flow nasal cannula or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is contraindicated in patients with hemodynamic instability, multiorgan failure, or altered mental status.
