<p>Although guidelines recommend the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in the management of acute respiratory failure due to cardiogenic pulmonary edema and in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation leading to respiratory acidosis, no recommendations have been made regarding the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in ARDS.

 </sup> The use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in patients with ARDS has been evaluated in several large trials. A recent study reported a high (greater than 40%) rate of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation failure leading to invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with moderate to severe ARDS.

 </sup> In this study, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation failure was associated with increased mortality, as was the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in patients with more severe ARDS (Pa

 </sup> Several authors have suggested that the increased mortality observed when noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is used in patients with more severe ARDS and in those who ultimately require invasive mechanical ventilation may be explained by noninvasive positive pressure ventilation delaying time to a needed intubation, and from lung injury caused by uncontrolled high tidal volumes with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation.

 </sup> There are limited data to suggest that when noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is delivered

While a helmet mask may be additionally beneficial from an infection control perspective, this intervention is not widely available.
