<p>The seroprevalence of anti-CHIKV IgG observed in our study was similar for the group of patients using bDMARDs and the control group, reaching approximately 25% of the patients, corroborating the results of the study by Cunha et al., who found a seroprevalence of 20.0% in Feira de Santana, northeastern Brazil [

Although no statistically significant difference was demonstrated, the number of subjects in the bDMARD group with positive serology and no symptoms was higher than that in the control group, suggesting that despite immunosuppression, there was no increased risk of symptomatic infections.
