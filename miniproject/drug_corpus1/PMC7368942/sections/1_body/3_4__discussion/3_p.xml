<p>Experimental models of alphavirus-induced arthritis suggest that CHIK pathogenesis is the result of a combination of direct cellular and tissue damage caused by viral replication and mainly by activation of the indirect immune response in target tissues, with the production of different cytokines, such as interleukins and TNF [

Since TNF is one of the elements involved in the inflammatory response and tissue damage, its blockade or reduced synthesis could potentially slow the inflammatory process in tissues in the acute phase of CHIKV infection. Our finding of this more favorable clinical evolution in our patients using anti-TNF biologicals than that in controls is probably due to the reduction in the intensity of inflammation by blocking cytokines involved in the pathophysiology of chronic joint injury.
