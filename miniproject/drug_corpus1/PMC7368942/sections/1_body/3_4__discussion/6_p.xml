<p>A previous study using mice infected with an arbovirus (Ross River virus), in which etanercept was applied in the acute phase, showed a higher viral load and higher recruitment of inflammatory cells and tissue damage than mice without etanercept, leading to the death of all tested animals using the drug on the 14th day and suggesting that the use of anti-TNF biologicals could aggravate the disease [

However, this result is not reproduced in clinical practice, although the use of anti-TNF biologicals in the acute phase has not been evaluated exclusively. Two studies in the literature refer to the pattern of CHIKV infection in biological users and do not show a more severe joint disease in this group of patients [
