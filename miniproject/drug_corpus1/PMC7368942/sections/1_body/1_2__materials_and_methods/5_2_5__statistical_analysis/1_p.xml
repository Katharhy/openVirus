<p>Descriptive statistics were performed for numerical variables through the range and standard deviation (SD) or median and interquartile range (IQR). When the distribution was considered nonnormal, the categorical variables were described as numbers and percentages. The chi-square test was used to verify the differences between the proportions, and Student's 
 <italic>t</italic>-test was used to evaluate the differences between the means. The confidence interval for proportions was calculated, as well as the absolute risk reduction (AAR), to compare the results between symptomatic patients with and without bDMARD. The confidence interval was 95%. Data were analyzed using Stata Statistical Software, version 16.
