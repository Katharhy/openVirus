<p>Regarding the clinical pattern of musculoskeletal pain, the cases in which there was no period of symptom improvement or arthralgia remission after the acute episode of chikungunya until the interview or complete regression of the condition were considered to exhibit the “persistent” pattern. In the “intermittent” or “relapsing” pattern, there were periods of improvement or remission, followed by exacerbations with the same characteristics as those of the acute phase, between the period from the onset of the condition until the interview or complete regression.</p>
