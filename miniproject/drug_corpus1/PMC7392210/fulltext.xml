Although results from preliminary epidemiological investigations pointed towards a zoonotic origin from a local seafood market in Huanan, the exponential increase in the number of cases suggested the possibility of human-to-human transmission <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The World Health Organization (WHO) was notified of the outbreak by the Chinese authorities on December 31, 2019. By January 7, 2020, scientists had isolated a novel coronavirus from the lower respiratory tract samples of patients who were admitted to a hospital in Wuhan <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. This pathogen was later termed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The WHO declared this novel viral disease a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and subsequently termed it as COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> on February 11, 2020. The first fatality was reported on Jan 11, 2020.

Four (hCoV-229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1) out of the seven species of beta-coronaviruses found in humans cause mild illnesses of the upper respiratory tract such as common cold (also caused by rhinoviruses). Two other kinds, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), are considerably more dangerous (mortality rates of 9.6% and 35% respectively <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>). SARS-CoV first emerged in late 2002 in China and spread rapidly to other parts of the world from Hong Kong via air travel. The virus was believed to have originated from a bat (primary host) from where it mutated to infect the intermediate host- Civet cats (a nocturnal mammal sold for meat in China) and subsequently infected humans <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. It turned into an epidemic with over 8000 cases and 744 deaths <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Almost a decade later, MERS emerged in the Middle East with Dromedary Camel as the intermediate host from which it mutated enough to affect humans, resulting in 2494 cases and 858 deaths <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.

ACE2 is a type 1 transmembrane aminopeptidase expressed in the heart and lungs. It negatively regulates the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) and plays a significant role in neurohumoral regulation of the cardiovascular system.

ACE2 receptors are abundantly distributed in the epithelia of the lung- especially the alveolar Type II (ATII) cells.

It has been highly touted as a potential antiviral drug for COVID-19. It has been shown to have potent in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 (EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.77&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>), SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Because of its high selectivity for viral polymerases, Remdesivir is less likely to cause toxicity in humans. The drug also exhibits a high genetic barrier to resistance in coronaviruses and its long intracellular half-life is conducive for once-a-day dosing <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. There are currently 38 registered trials listed on ClinicalTrials.gov for investigating the efficacy of this drug. Preliminary results from a small cohort show clinical improvement in 68% of hospitalized patients <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> on administration of Remdesivir. However, the small sample size and the lack of a control group limit its significance. Wang et al. reported that in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial of 237 participants (NCT04257656), Remdesivir did not exhibit significant clinical benefits <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. On April 29, the US NIH reported that in a high powered RCT of 1063 participants, patients in the Remdesivir group had shown a 31% faster time to recovery (median 11&#x000a0;days) <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> than those in the placebo group (15&#x000a0;days) (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001).

It has also been approved for therapeutic use in COVID-19 patients by the regulatory bodies of Japan, Australia, Singapore, and Europe <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The use of Remdesivir might prove to have a measurable impact on healthcare capacity by minimizing the length of hospital stay and reducing the overall severity of the illness. In a comparative analysis of the Phase 3 SIMPLE-severe trial and a retrospective cohort study of severe COVID-19 patients, Remdesivir has recently shown a 62% reduction in the risk of mortality as opposed to the standard of care and an improvement in clinical recovery <xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.

The drugs have recently gained notoriety due to much sociopolitical hype that has led to a spate of newly launched clinical trials- more than 240 studies are currently underway around the world.

In a small open-label non-RCT of 36 patients (20 treated/ 16 controls), significantly improved virologic clearance was observed in the HCQ (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;14) group. All six patients in the HCQ plus Azithromycin group had significantly better viral clearance <xref rid="b0300" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>.

A study in Brazil (NCT04323527) was forced to prematurely halt patient recruitment due to the high fatality rate in the CQ group <xref rid="b0305" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. The authors of the study opined that treatment providers should refrain from administering high doses of CQ to critically ill patients with COVID-19 because of its potential safety hazards.

First, the review only included studies conducted on individuals aged 18 or above. Thus, findings from the studies might not always be generalizable to the pediatric population. Second, the search was limited to only English-language articles which might have been a bottleneck because much of the early data on COVID-19 came from studies which were based in China.</p></sec><sec id="s0215"><label>16</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0175">In summary, SARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious novel coronavirus that has rapidly brought about a global pandemic, destroying lives and livelihood at an alarming pace. Even though much is known about its genetic sequence and virology due to our knowledge of its predecessors, several questions regarding the epidemiological properties, transmission and pathogenesis remain unanswered. Animal studies and clinical trials on therapeutics directed against immunopathologic host responses are needed to elucidate the full spectrum of damage caused by this pathogen. Repurposing of existing drugs and the use of non-pharmacological therapies such as Convalescent Plasma are currently the best treatment avenues until a safe and efficacious vaccine is discovered. Although certain prospective agents listed in this review are promising, definitive evidence regarding their effectiveness remains inconclusive. COVID-19 has emerged to be a formidable adversary to the very existence of life as we know it. Overcoming these tough times requires the concerted efforts of people from all walks of life. It necessitates extensive international collaboration between academia, healthcare professionals, pharmaceutical companies, regulators, policymakers, public health organizations and philanthropic associations. The onus on coordinated technical and financial resource mobilization has never been higher, and is indispensable if we are to get the better of this pandemic.</p></sec><sec id="s0220"><title>Funding</title><p id="p0180">None.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of Competing Interest</title><p id="p0185">The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bi005"><title>References</title><ref id="b0005"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="h0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Horby</surname><given-names>P.W.</given-names></name><name><surname>Hayden</surname><given-names>F.G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>G.F.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern</article-title><source>Lancet</source><volume>395</volume><year>2020</year><fpage>470</fpage><lpage>473</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">31986257</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b0010"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="h0010"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China</article-title><source>Lancet</source><volume>395</volume><year>2020</year><fpage>497</fpage><lpage>506</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">31986264</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b0015"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="h0015"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Q.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Early transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia</article-title><source>N.
