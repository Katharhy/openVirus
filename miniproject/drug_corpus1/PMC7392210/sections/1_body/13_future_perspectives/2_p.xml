<p id="p0165">In order to understand the long-term impact of COVID-19, vigilant follow-up of those recovering from the disease is needed. Previous respiratory diseases brought about by coronaviruses have resulted in deranged lipid and glucose metabolism as well as cardiovascular issues in recovered individuals for up to 12Â years 
 <xref rid="b0450" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref>. Widescale serology testing of recovered individuals for the identification of antibodies is key to developing a broader understanding of the disease dynamics of COVID-19. It will also shed light on the neutralizing antibodies, which could potentially act as templates for monoclonal antibody therapies and vaccine candidates in the near future. New diagnostic modalities, serological tests, contact-tracing technologies and disease surveillance tools are essential to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and help prepare for future outbreaks with better preparation and preventive measures.
