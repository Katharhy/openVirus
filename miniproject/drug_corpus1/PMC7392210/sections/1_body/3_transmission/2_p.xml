<p id="p0020">Inhalation of respiratory droplets generated by symptomatic patients’ cough and sneeze is the main mode of transmission of COVID-19. Infected droplets can spread to distances of up to 2 m and deposit on surfaces, which can act as potential fomites for transmission of the virus to seemingly healthy individuals who touch their mucosa (mouth, nose) and conjunctiva (eyes) without proper sanitization. Asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic people can also spread the infection. The virus is also believed to be present in the stool, and transmission via the feco-oral route cannot be ruled out 
 <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. There is currently no evidence of transmission of the virus from a pregnant mother to her fetus via transplacental route.
