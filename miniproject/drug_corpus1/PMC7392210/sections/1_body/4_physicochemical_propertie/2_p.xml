<p id="p0025">SARS-CoV-2 can remain viable on surfaces like plastic and stainless steel for up to 72 h in favourable atmospheric conditions 
 <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> but is susceptible to common disinfectants like sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, diethyl ether, 75% ethanol, chloroform etc 
 <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Soap is found to be equally effective since it readily dissolves the lipid bilayer of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 can also be inactivated by UV or when heated at 60 °C for 30 min
