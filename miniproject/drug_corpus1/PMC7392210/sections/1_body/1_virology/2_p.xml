<p id="p0010">Coronaviruses (derived from the Latin word corona, meaning crown) are positive sense, single-stranded enveloped RNA viruses with a diameter of 60 nm to 140 nm, and are widely dispersed in nature 
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Four (hCoV-229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1) out of the seven species of beta-coronaviruses found in humans cause mild illnesses of the upper respiratory tract such as common cold (also caused by rhinoviruses). Two other kinds, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), are considerably more dangerous (mortality rates of 9.6% and 35% respectively 
 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>). SARS-CoV first emerged in late 2002 in China and spread rapidly to other parts of the world from Hong Kong via air travel. The virus was believed to have originated from a bat (primary host) from where it mutated to infect the intermediate host- Civet cats (a nocturnal mammal sold for meat in China) and subsequently infected humans 
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. It turned into an epidemic with over 8000 cases and 744 deaths 
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Almost a decade later, MERS emerged in the Middle East with Dromedary Camel as the intermediate host from which it mutated enough to affect humans, resulting in 2494 cases and 858 deaths 
 <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. SARS-CoV-2, the pathogenic factor for COVID-19, is a novel zoonotic RNA betacoronavirus. Several studies have conducted phylogenetic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 to determine its sequence homology with other viruses of the family

 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> depicts the structure of SARS-CoV-2. While the exact source of the virus remains a mystery, it is widely reported to have originated from a bat

 <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and made its way to humans via an intermediate animal host, the pangolin
