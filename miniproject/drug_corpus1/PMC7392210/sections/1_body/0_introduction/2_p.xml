<p id="p0005">In late 2019, there was a sudden surge in the number of individuals being admitted to local hospitals of Wuhan, in the Hubei Province of China, with a pneumonia-like illness of unknown etiology 
 <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Although results from preliminary epidemiological investigations pointed towards a zoonotic origin from a local seafood market in Huanan, the exponential increase in the number of cases suggested the possibility of human-to-human transmission 
 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The World Health Organization (WHO) was notified of the outbreak by the Chinese authorities on December 31, 2019. By January 7, 2020, scientists had isolated a novel coronavirus from the lower respiratory tract samples of patients who were admitted to a hospital in Wuhan 
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. This pathogen was later termed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) 
 <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The WHO declared this novel viral disease a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and subsequently termed it as COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) 
 <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> on February 11, 2020. The first fatality was reported on Jan 11, 2020. The mass migration of people during the Chinese New Year fuelled the rapid spread of the disease to all parts of the globe, which led to the official declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic 
 <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> by the WHO on March 11, 2020. COVID-19 has wreaked havoc worldwide, resulting in 15,151,738 confirmed cases and 621,121 deaths across 215 countries and territories 
 <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> as of July 22, 2020. Despite stringent public health measures, the outbreak has continued at a breakneck pace and has laid bare the glaring inadequacies of the present healthcare systems around the world.
