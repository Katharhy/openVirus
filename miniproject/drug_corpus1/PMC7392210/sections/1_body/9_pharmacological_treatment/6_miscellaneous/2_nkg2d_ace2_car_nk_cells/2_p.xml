<p id="p0120">NKG2D is an activating receptor for the immune system's natural killer (NK) cells. SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE-2 receptor using its S protein. By targeting the S protein of the virus and NKG2DL on the surface of infected cells with ACE-2 and NKG2D respectively, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 can be eliminated from the infected cells. Moreover, ACE2 CAR-NK cells can competitively inhibit infection of ATII cells by SARS-CoV-2 through ACE2 receptors, thereby preventing the production of infectious virus particles. A multicenter, randomized Phase 1/2 trial (NCT04324996) is currently testing this cell therapy.</p>
