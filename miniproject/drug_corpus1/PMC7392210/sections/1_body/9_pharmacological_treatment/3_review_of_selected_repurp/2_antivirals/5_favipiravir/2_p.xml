<p id="p0070">Favipiravir is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor. It is used in China for the treatment of Influenza and is capable of blocking the replication of other RNA viruses 
 <xref rid="b0260" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> such as arenavirus, filovirus, bunyavirus etc. Favipiravir is activated into its phosphoribosylated form (favipiravir-RTP) in cells, which then inhibits viral RNA polymerase activity 
 <xref rid="b0265" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. It has shown potential in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 
 <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. There are currently 32 studies underway which are aimed at investigating the efficacy of this drug in COVID-19. Favipiravir has been approved for experimental use in COVID-19 patients in Italy, China and Russia 
 <xref rid="b0270" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0275" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. In a recent multicenter trial in Japan, Favipiravir did not show a significant benefit in mild and moderate COVID-19 cases
