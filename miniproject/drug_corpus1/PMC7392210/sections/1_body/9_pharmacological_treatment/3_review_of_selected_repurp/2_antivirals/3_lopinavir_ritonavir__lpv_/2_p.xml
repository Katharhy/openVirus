<p id="p0060">It is an antiviral combination of protease inhibitors that are used to treat HIV infections. Eighty trials are listed on clinical trial registries around the world for testing the drug as a COVID-19 treatment. As Lopinavir has insufficient oral bioavailability (it gets rapidly catabolized by the Cytochrome P450 enzyme system)

LPV/r has also been discontinued from randomization in the treatment arms of the RECOVERY trial, and the SOLIDARITY trial as it did not demonstrate any beneficial effect in either clinical recovery or mortality
