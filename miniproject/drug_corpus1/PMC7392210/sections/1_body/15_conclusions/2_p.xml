<p id="p0175">In summary, SARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious novel coronavirus that has rapidly brought about a global pandemic, destroying lives and livelihood at an alarming pace. Even though much is known about its genetic sequence and virology due to our knowledge of its predecessors, several questions regarding the epidemiological properties, transmission and pathogenesis remain unanswered. Animal studies and clinical trials on therapeutics directed against immunopathologic host responses are needed to elucidate the full spectrum of damage caused by this pathogen. Repurposing of existing drugs and the use of non-pharmacological therapies such as Convalescent Plasma are currently the best treatment avenues until a safe and efficacious vaccine is discovered. Although certain prospective agents listed in this review are promising, definitive evidence regarding their effectiveness remains inconclusive. COVID-19 has emerged to be a formidable adversary to the very existence of life as we know it. Overcoming these tough times requires the concerted efforts of people from all walks of life. It necessitates extensive international collaboration between academia, healthcare professionals, pharmaceutical companies, regulators, policymakers, public health organizations and philanthropic associations. The onus on coordinated technical and financial resource mobilization has never been higher, and is indispensable if we are to get the better of this pandemic.</p>
