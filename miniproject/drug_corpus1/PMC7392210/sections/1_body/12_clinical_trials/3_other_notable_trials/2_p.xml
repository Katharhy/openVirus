<p id="p0150">The SOLIDARITY trial is an international collaborative clinical trial initiated by the WHO to help find an effective treatment for COVID-19 in over 100 countries. The trial will assess the efficacy of four treatment options against COVID-19, namely: Remdesivir; LPV/r; LPV/r with Interferon β-1a; and HCQ/CQ. Trial arms in multiple countries will help expedite the results to rapidly discover whether any of the drugs are effective against SARS-COV-2
