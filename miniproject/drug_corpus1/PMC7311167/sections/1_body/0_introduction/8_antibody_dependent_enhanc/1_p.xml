<p>Antibodies can also exacerbate viral infection by different mechanisms that have long been described (
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Halstead, 1982</xref>). In the vaccine context, infection by alpha- and flaviviruses (such as Dengue and Zika viruses) is enhanced when the antibody occupancy on the virion-surface epitopes falls below a critical threshold (
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Pierson and Diamond, 2015</xref>). This is the stoichiometric condition of an Fc-receptor-dependent form of ADE: the same antibodies that mediate ADE can neutralize and protect at higher occupancies on virions; alternatively, non-NAbs binding to epitopes exposed on the virion surface to antigens that are not functional for mediating entry may confer ADE (

 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Klasse, 2014</xref>). The in vitro observations of ADE seem to account for the unfortunate outcome of recent Dengue vaccine trials with examples of worsened disease post-infection (

An exception is a study of vaccinia-vectored immunization of kittens with the S protein of the coronavirus feline infectious peritonitis virus. The vaccine induced NAbs poorly. After challenge with the infectious virus, deaths occurred sooner in the S-protein-vaccine group than in the vaccinia-only control group (
