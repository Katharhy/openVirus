<p>The lethal coronaviruses cause fatal acute lung injury (ALI) by driving hypercytokinemia and aggressive inflammation through incompletely understood mechanisms. In macaque models of SARS-CoV-1 infection and passive or active immunization, IgG specific for the S-protein was reported to exacerbate ALI by counteracting inflammation-resolving responses, abrogating wound-healing, promoting monocyte chemoattractant peptide-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) production, and increasing proinflammatory monocyte and macrophage recruitment (
