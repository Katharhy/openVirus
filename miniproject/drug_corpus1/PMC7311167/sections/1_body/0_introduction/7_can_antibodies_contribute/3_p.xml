<p>In vitro, sera from subsequently deceased patients enhanced SARS-CoV-1 induced MCP-1 and IL-8 production by human monocyte–derived wound-healing macrophages, whereas blockade of the FcγR receptor reduced these effects (
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). One must be prudent when extrapolating from a macaque model of SARS-CoV-1 infection to human COVID-19 patients, but the antibody response to these lethal coronaviruses might play a role in disease progression, perhaps by formation of immune complexes, and by promoting macrophage infiltration and sustained inflammation. We hypothesize that there may be a causal link between seroconversion and the rapid deterioration that can take place in the second week after the first symptoms, but this remains to be established.
