<p>Other reports suggest that anti-S and other CoV-specific antibodies have pathogenic effects in animal models. Thus, multiple CoV vaccines were associated with an increase in eosinophilic proinflammatory pulmonary responses upon challenge of the immunized animals (

It has not been determined which factors, such as viral dose and the extent of the innate and adaptive immune responses, yield these problematic effects. A particularly important knowledge gap is whether certain specificities and other properties of antibodies are responsible.
