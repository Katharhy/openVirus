<p>In plasma collected from 175 patients who had recovered from mild COVID-19, NAb and S-binding-antibody titers correlated positively with age and CRP (C-reactive protein) levels, but negatively with lymphocyte counts; and the NAbs did not cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-1 (

Since no severe cases were included and viral loads were not monitored, it is unclear what promoted the NAb responses within the patient cohort in which antibody titers, age (range 16â€“85 years), lymphopenia, and inflammation were associated. The positive correlation between NAb responses and age contrasts with a general decline in the vigor of new B-cell responses in the elderly (

Other studies have shown higher binding-antibody titers to the nucleocapsid protein N in patients who recovered than in those who did not (
