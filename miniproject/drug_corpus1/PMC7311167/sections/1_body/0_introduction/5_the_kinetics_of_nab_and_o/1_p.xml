<p>The information on the antibody responses elicited in COVID-19 patients is growing fast, but none is yet available about the longevity of the immunity. Data on SARS-CoV-1 infection may, however, be informative in that respect. Surprisingly, the NAb response in patients who later succumbed to the infection has been found to be faster than in those who recovered; in the patients who later died, the titers had peaked around day 15 after the onset of symptoms, whereas similar titers and extents of neutralization were reached only after day 20 in the patients who recovered (

 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">To et al., 2020</xref>). These findings do not exclude the possibility that the initial viral loads, before NAbs emerged, were particularly high and stimulated stronger and earlier antibody responses in the patients who subsequently became most severely affected.
