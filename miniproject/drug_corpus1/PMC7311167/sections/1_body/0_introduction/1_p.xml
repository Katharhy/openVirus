<p>Passive immunization with plasma from patients who have seroconverted to and recovered from infection with a pathogen has a long and generally successful history. It has been used extensively against influenza virus and on a small scale during the 1995 and 2014â€“2015 Ebola epidemics (

To determine the efficacy of convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19, the FDA has called for randomized clinical trials and encouraged investigational new drug applications (

A major goal of viral vaccine development is the induction of strong and broadly active neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), and that goal applies also to SARS-CoV-2 (
