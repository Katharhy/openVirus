<p>Plasma infusion as therapy for COVID-19 is a stop-gap measure that is now being used in a medical emergency. Within the next year, effective drugs are likely to emerge, and they may well include highly potent and specific MAbs to the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein. Animal experiments, particularly in macaques, will be valuable for comparing the capacity of different monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, including combinations, or of recombinant receptor mimics, to clear SARS-CoV-2 infection. Ideally, the intervention should permit or even promote the emergence of favorable innate responses and the resolution of inflammation (

Furthermore, differences in Fc-receptor biology may invalidate some extrapolations of antibody effects from macaques to humans (

In these circumstances, an awareness of what has occurred in other viral infections, particularly with SARS-CoV-1, as well as what is now being published on SARS-CoV-2, may guide both treatment strategies and the development of antibody-based vaccines (

 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Agrawal et al., 2016</xref>). Prospective or retrospective analyses of how the binding-antibody and NAb titers of transfused plasmas are associated with clinical improvements should also guide both MAb-based therapies and vaccine evaluation. If apparently antibody-mediated adverse events do occur, they too should help to improve these important public health measures against the COVID-19 pandemic.
