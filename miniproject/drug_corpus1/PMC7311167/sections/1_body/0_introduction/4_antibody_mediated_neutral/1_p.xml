<p>The entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells is initiated by the interaction of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral Spike (S) glycoprotein with the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), which acts as a receptor for the virus on the target cell surface (

 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Ou et al., 2020</xref>). The most potent NAbs are directed to the RBD and some may act by simply competing with the receptor for binding to the S-protein. Antibodies to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV generally do not cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2; although cross-reactive antibodies are frequently detected in S-protein ELISA (

Recently, however, the S-protein-specific NAb S309, isolated from memory B cells of a patient who had recovered from CoV-1 infection in 2003, was shown to neutralize both SARS-CoV-1 and âˆ’2 potently by ligating the RBD. Cryo-electron microscopy and binding assays demonstrated that the conserved S309 epitope comprises glycans and that in spite of the specificity of the Mab for the RBD, it does not interfere with ACE2 binding (
