<p>The neutralizing potency of antibodies against the RBD may be determined not only by their own affinity for the S-protein but also by the affinity of the latter for ACE2, at least when they act by a competitive mechanism (
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Ju et al., 2020</xref>). In this context, it is notable that the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein has a 4–20-fold higher affinity for ACE2 than its counterpart from SARS-CoV-1 (35, 37). Although most NAbs to SARS-CoV-1 and −2 are directed to the RBD (
