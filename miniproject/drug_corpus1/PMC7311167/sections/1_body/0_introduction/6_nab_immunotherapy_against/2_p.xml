<p>No significant adverse reactions were noted when plasma with high NAb titers were given to SARS-CoV-1 patients; benefits such as lower viral loads and earlier release from hospital were noted in retrospective analyses (

Recently, five critically ill COVID-19 patients were transfused at 10–22 days post-admission with a pool of plasma derived from five convalescent patients; the RBD-binding antibody endpoint titers in ELISA were &gt;1000, and the neutralization endpoint titers were &gt;40 (
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2020</xref>). All the patients (36–65 years; three male, two female) were receiving mechanical ventilation. After plasma transfusion, body temperatures normalized, while organ-failure and respiratory-function scores improved to various extents. Nasopharyngeal viral loads decreased and became undetectable within 12 days in all five patients, while SARS-CoV-2 ELISA and NAb titers increased, reflecting the antibody-content of the transfused plasma. Thus, in this preliminary and necessarily uncontrolled case series of five critically ill COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the transfusion of NAb-containing convalescent plasma was associated with improved clinical status (

A subsequent larger study yielded similar results: ten patients with severe COVID-19 received 200 mL of convalescent plasma obtained from recently recovered donors with NAb inhibitory-dilution factors &gt; 640. Three days later, clinical, pulmonary-radiological, and laboratory parameters were improved, the latter including oxyhemoglobin saturation, lymphocyte counts, and C-reactive protein levels; viral loads in serum became undetectable in seven patients (

 <xref rid="table1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Overall, these studies showed plasma transfusion to be well tolerated. Although beneficial effects were reported, they could not be proven because the studies were not controlled and included other antiviral interventions.
