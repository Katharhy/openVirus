<p>How could therapeutic interventions be improved so as to preserve the capacity of the infused NAbs to reduce virus replication while preventing the possible induction of fatal ALI through promotion of IL-8 and MCP-1 production and inflammatory macrophage accumulation? One precaution would be to administer NAbs with Fc deletions. In principle, this could be accomplished by enzymatic treatment of polyclonal IgGs purified from plasma to generate bivalent F(abâ€™)two fragments. But in practice this would probably be too onerous. More feasible is the genetic engineering of neutralizing MAbs to eliminate the ability of the Fc-domains to bind activating FcR:s. Although such mutations would also eliminate potentially beneficial Fc-mediated effects such as ADCC, there is no evidence that these effector functions play a role in reducing viral load. For that goal, virus neutralization may be necessary and sufficient, at least during the COVID-19 acute phase.</p>
