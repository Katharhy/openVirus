<p>An alternative neutralizing intervention, which eliminates some risks associated with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, is the use of a soluble, recombinant form of the ACE2 receptor, which is potent (nM range) and effective (depending on target cells) at blocking SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro (
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Lei et al., 2020</xref>). Since the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein has a 4â€“20-fold higher affinity than the SARS-CoV-1 S-protein for ACE2, it may be more sensitive to this particular intervention, at least under some conditions of infection (
