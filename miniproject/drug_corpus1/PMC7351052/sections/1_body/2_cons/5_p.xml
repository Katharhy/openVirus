<p id="par0070">Despite of dearth of previous conclusive studies on steroid therapy in COVID-19 and the steadily increasing number of infected patients, the Chinese Thoracic Society (CTS) released an expert consensus on the use of steroids, declaring that: (i) the benefits and risks must be carefully weighed before using steroids; (ii) steroids should be used with caution in critically ill patients; (iii) greater caution should be paid for patients with hypoxemia due to underlying diseases or who regularly use steroids for chronic diseases; and (iv) the dose administered should be low to moderate (≤0.5−1 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone or equivalent), and the duration short (≤7 days). Additionally, CTS experts recommend against the indiscriminate use of steroids in COVID-19 (Zhang et al., 2020).</p>
