A study of 30 patients with SARS-CoV-1 infection treated with methylprednisolone showed that the initial stage of the disease is characterized by a reduction of CD4
 <sup>+</sup>, CD8
 <sup>+</sup>, and CD3
 <sup>+</sup> cells and, therefore, immunosuppression can be worsened by the administration of high-dose steroids, increasing the risk of serious secondary infections. Finally, in a study of SARS-CoV-1 patients in which ribavirin and hydrocortisone therapy were compared versus placebo, suggested that corticosteroid administration could be associated with increased viral load in plasma of patients who had received the combination treatment compared to placebo group (
