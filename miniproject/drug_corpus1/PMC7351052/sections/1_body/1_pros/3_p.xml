<p id="par0045">During the first SARS epidemic, an intense activation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines was observed, and steroids were found to effectively control the rapid deterioration of clinical condition by attenuating the immune response (

In 2003, patients with SARS-CoV-1 infection showed elevated levels of T-helper lymphocyte type 1 (Th1) cytokine interferon (IFN)-γ, Th1 chemokine IFN-γ-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 for at least 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms. At that time, methylprednisolone was able to reduce levels of IL-8, MCP-1, and IP-10 5–8 days after treatment initiation. Steroids are also known to inhibit the gene expression of IL-6, IFN-γ (Th1 response), and IL-4 (Th2 response) (

Based on the foregoing, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign suggests the use of low-dose steroid therapy in COVID-19 patients with refractory shock, with the aim of mitigating the cytokine storm caused by SARS-CoV-2 and reducing peripheral vasodilation (
