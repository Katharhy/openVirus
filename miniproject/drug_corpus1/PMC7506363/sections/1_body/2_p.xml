The number of basic research publications grew steadily to 116 (8%). Viral genomic evolution and the structural basis of spikeâ€“receptor interaction were identified. Interestingly, studies on diagnostic assays, and therapeutic and preventive medications initially followed the pace of basic research, but preceded it since late February, reflecting the high demand of these agents in a pandemic context. Urgent need drove the research into treatment and prevention remedies, including repurposed molecules, investigational drugs and vaccines [

Furthermore, patients with pre-existing conditions need special attention during the outbreak, which was addressed in 171 (12%) publications.
