<p>In general, all pandemics pass through three phases until they become endemic. The first phase of “seeding” or slow spread is often not noticed early enough, leading to dissemination of the disease before effective countermeasures can be initiated. During the second phase, there is a rapid increase in cases until a peak occurs in the number of infected individuals; parallel efforts to control and contain the virus can mitigate this phase. In the third phase, the infection rate curve will start to decrease until the disease becomes extinct or endemic. The kinetics of increase and decrease in the rate of infections can vary significantly between populations depending on the use of preventive measures and the availability of effective treatments. Previous coronavirus outbreaks and the current pandemic highlight the urgent unmet medical need to expand and focus our research tools on these long neglected infectious diseases and to prepare for future inevitable pandemics. Herein, we briefly recap the current and potential future therapeutic interventions for SARS-CoV-2 and highlight the recently published crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease and its inhibitors as novel agents against SARS-CoV-2.</p>
