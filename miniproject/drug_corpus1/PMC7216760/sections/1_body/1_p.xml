<p>As of May 6th, 2020, more than 3.7 million cases of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients have been reported worldwide with over 260,000 deaths, reflecting a ∼6.8% case fatality rate. While the infection fatality rate is currently unknown, and likely to be lower than the current case fatality rate, estimates suggest it is close to 1%, or approximately 10 times the infection fatality rate of seasonal influenza (flu), which is fatal in only ∼0.1% of infected patients.
