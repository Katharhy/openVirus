<p>M
 <sup>pro</sup> and PL
 <sup>pro</sup> are cysteine proteases responsible for the cleavage of viral polypeptides into functional proteins for virus replication and packaging within host cells.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>
 </sup> These enzymes represent the best characterized drug targets among coronaviruses and are currently the focus of attention among scientists seeking novel coronavirus small molecule therapeutics.

 </sup> M
 <sup>pro</sup> is shared by all coronavirus genera and has similarity to the 3C
 <sup>pro</sup> of the 
 <italic>Enterovirus</italic> genus in the picornavirus family.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>
 </sup> M
 <sup>pro</sup> contains a Cys···His catalytic dyad with an additional α-helical domain involved in the dimerization of the protease, which is essential for its catalytic activity.
 <sup>

 </sup> The enteroviral 3C
 <sup>pro</sup> functions as a monomer featuring a classical Cys···His···Glu/Asp catalytic triad.

 </sup> Yet, they share the almost absolute requirement for Gln in the P1 position of the substrate and space for only small residues such as Gly, Ala, or Ser in the P1′ position. Since no human proteases with a similar cleavage specificity are known, it may be possible to identify highly selective M
 <sup>pro</sup>/3C
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors, which display minimal inhibition of host proteases.

 </sup> The 3-D structures of unliganded SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> and of its complex with a peptidomimetic α-ketoamide inhibitor (
 <bold>11r</bold>) have been solved
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>
 </sup> and were used to support the design of an optimized derivative (
 <bold>13b</bold>) through docking studies (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsinfecdis.0c00224/suppl_file/id0c00224_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Figure S2</ext-link>). α-Ketoamides can interact with the catalytic center of M
 <sup>pro</sup> through two hydrogen bonding interactions rather than only one as with other warheads such as aldehydes or Michael acceptors.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>
 </sup> Nucleophilic attack of the α-keto group by the catalytic Cys residue results in reversible formation of a thiohemiketal. These α-ketoamides feature a 5-membered rigid γ-lactam as a mimic of the P1 residue, glutamine, required for M
 <sup>pro</sup> specificity, with the advantage of reducing the loss of entropy upon binding.

 </sup> Follow up optimization efforts guided by docking to the SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> co-crystal structure with 
 <bold>11r</bold>, included incorporation of the P3-P2 amide bond into a pyridone ring as in 
 <bold>13a</bold>. The resulting half-life of 
 <bold>13a</bold> in plasma was enhanced by 3 fold relative to 
 <bold>11r</bold>, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> kinetic plasma solubility improved by a factor of ∼19 and thermodynamic solubility by a factor of ∼13. 
 <bold>13a</bold> inhibited purified recombinant SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup>, SARS-CoV M
 <sup>pro</sup>, and MERS-CoV M
 <sup>pro</sup> in the submicromolar range.

 </sup> Modification of the P1′ and P3 moieties of 
 <bold>13a</bold> afforded an optimized derivative 
 <bold>13b</bold> which was crystallized with SARS-CoV-2 M
 <sup>pro</sup> (PDB: 6Y2G and 6Y2F). Both 
 <bold>13a</bold> and 
 <bold>13b</bold> displayed good stability in mouse and human microsomes. 
 <bold>13b</bold> (3 mg/kg) showed longer 
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>1/2</sub>, 
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>max</sub>, and residence time compared to 
 <bold>13a</bold> (20 mg/kg) in CD-1 mice. Both compounds showed lung tropism which is thought to be beneficial. While the development of these ketoamides into clinical candidates requires additional safety studies, the availability of their crystal structures is of great importance in facilitating the discovery and development of other M
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors. One of the suggested agents for testing is the previously reported Rhinovirus and SARS-CoV M
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitor clinical candidate rupintrivir (AG-7088) (

 <sup>pro</sup> crystal structures with inhibitors such as the peptidomimetic Michael acceptor 
 <bold>N3</bold> (PDB: 6LU7) and the reversible inhibitor 
 <bold>X77</bold> (PDB: 6W63) (

 </sup> A large array of M
 <sup>pro</sup> crystal structures with multiple covalent and noncovalent fragments were solved through an exceptionally large screen with vast opportunities for fragment growing and merging. The cryo EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp was recently solved, showing nearly an identical sequence to its SARS-CoV homologue.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>
 </sup> RdRp should be another high priority target for therapeutic intervention given that lead inhibitors such as remdesivir already exist.
