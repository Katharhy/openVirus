<p>The search strategy included index identificationâ€”PubMed, Web of Science, OVIDEmbase, OVID Global Health, CINAHL and Africa Wide Information. We conducted a grey literature search in Google Scholar and clinicaltrials.gov. A sample search for the Medline database is included as 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-17-04951">supplement Table S1</xref>. We used a search strategy of controlled vocabulary terms and synonymous free text to capture the concepts of hepatitis C, reinfection, recurrence, and drug use by people who inject drugs. We excluded articles published before 2013 because all oral DAA regimens were not available in this period. We scanned titles and abstracts to eliminate studies conducted in high-income countries and those not using DAA treatment regimens. We conducted an additional review of the LILAC database-a database for Latin American and Caribbean health science literature, due to a lack of published studies in Latin and Central America and the Caribbean. Our Ovid MEDLINE search is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-04951-f001">Figure 1</xref>. The conduct and reporting of this study were guided by PRISMA and the full strategy is available from the lead author.
