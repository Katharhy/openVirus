<p>In conducting a review of HCV reinfection among PWID, caution is required when defining the outcome variable (reinfection) and analyzing which instruments or assays are used to identify the outcome variable. Simmons and colleagues (2016) reported a meta-analysis of HCV reinfection studies among PWID in high-income countries, where they used a broad definition of recurrence (“confirmed HCV RNA detectability post-SVR”) but made the relapse vs. reinfection classification dependent on terminology used in the original studies [

Of the 59 studies included in the meta-analysis, Simmons et al. reported that 23 used genotyping (including 9 of 13 studies in PWID currently injecting), 5 studies used author judgement of individual patient risk, and 31 did not specifically classify or distinguish relapse from reinfection [

Authors of a recent meta-analysis of HCV reinfection in PWID included 36 studies and 6311 person-years (PY) of follow up and found an overall reinfection rate of 5.9 per 100 PY (recent drug use 6.2/100 PY, opioid substitution therapy (OST) 3.8/100 PY) [
