<p>Seven studies met inclusion criteria. 
 <xref rid="ijerph-17-04951-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> provides the design, key characteristics, and HCV reinfection rates for each included study. The studies had three different designs: cohort study, clinical trial, and integrated analysis (systematic review, meta-analysis). Five of the seven studies were conducted across multiple sites, including the following lower middle-, and upper middle-income countries: Mexico, Romania, Russia, Taiwan, Georgia, Bangladesh, and Brazil. These multi-site studies also used data from partnering high-income countries, including Canada, Australia and the United States. We observed an inverse association between HCV infection rates and country income level (World Bank category and median income). While the available data are insufficient to comment further, this finding merits further investigation. No studies were conducted in low-income countries. Study population sizes ranged from 200 to 3004 participants. However, the largest study of 3004 individuals did not report demographic information. Among studies reporting demographic information, participants were mostly male (range: 57% to 100%). The length of follow-up in these studies ranged from 2 to 62 months.
