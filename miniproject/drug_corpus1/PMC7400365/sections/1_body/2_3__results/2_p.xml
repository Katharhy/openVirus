<p>The overall crude reinfection rate for the pooled data was 2.8 cases per 100 PY (95% CI 0.8 to 6.3). 
 <xref rid="ijerph-17-04951-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows that only the Huang (2019) study had [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-17-04951" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] a reinfection rate greater than 5 per 100 PY, and this study only analyzed recurrence (no differentiation between relapse and reinfection); five studies had rates under 2 per 100 PY. Only the Latham (2019) study compared participants using and not using OST services, and found a lower rate of reinfection (0.6 cases per 100PY for OST recipients and 1.9 cases per 100PY for non-OST recipients). The prevalence of HCV in the study populations (when reported or available) ranged from 33.7% to 56.8%. No report included background information on recruitment methods (e.g., flyer, bus ad, outreach in clinics) or sampling methodologies (e.g., consecutive patients); inquiries for supplemental information yielded one result. Testing intervals ranged from varied or not delineated in three studies [
