<p>This study has some limitations. First, there were a limited number of studies outlining reinfection rates in middle-income countries and no studies in low-income countries. Second, heterogeneous study designs, the variability of follow-up time, and different methodologies to measure reinfection presented significant challenges to comparing or allowing a confident summary of HCV reinfection rates in these settings. Finally, high-risk characteristics are not always consistent across regions, cultures and economic classes. Despite these limitations, our systematic review demonstrates that HCV reinfection rates among PWID were low overall. These results are equivalent to studies conducted in the general population (not PWID) and are comparable or even lower than those of studies in high-income countries [
