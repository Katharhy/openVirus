<p>Our study highlights the current lack of data about HCV reinfection rates in low-income countries and the limited data available about HCV reinfection rates in middle-income countries. This deficiency undermines policy makersâ€™ efforts to develop clinically appropriate treatment guidelines and implement evidence-based programs. The lack of data also weakens global efforts to address socioeconomic health disparities. Given the limited data on HCV reinfection rates in PWID in resource-limited settings, policy makers should commit to using comprehensive programs that implement a broad range of public health strategies supported by most current modeling studies, including widespread testing, faster linkage to care, treatment for all, and increased access to harm reduction interventions [
