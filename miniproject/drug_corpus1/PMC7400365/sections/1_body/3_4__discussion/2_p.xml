<p>Based on our systematic review, we also suggest that certain factors may influence the measured reinfection rates seen among PWID in upper and lower middle-income countries. Past epidemiological studies have shown that higher background HCV prevalence is associated with a higher risk of reinfection rates among people actively engaged in high-risk injection behavior (e.g., sharing needles or equipment) [

 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-04951" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Among studies in our review, however, background prevalence did not appear to have a significant impact on reinfection rates. In fact, as seen in
