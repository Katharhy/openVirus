<p>Our review of studies suggests that the testing interval for recurrent HCV viremia (e.g., every 24 weeks versus 12 weeks) may play a role in reinfection rate. Due to viral clearance of the reinfection, longer testing intervals between assessments for recurrent viremia can result in lower measured reinfection rates. Among the reviewed studies, longer testing intervals did appear to be associated with lower reinfection rates supporting this finding. Similarly, the length of follow-up may play a role in reinfection rate. While the role of longer follow-up needs to be clarified, lower reinfection rates may be observed because those who are at the highest risk of reinfection due to high-risk behavior or being in high-risk networks tend to get reinfected early [
