<p>The results of this systematic review highlight the heterogeneity in study design, reinfection measurement, and testing intervals. Overall, reinfection rates ranged from 0.024 cases per 100 PY to 10.5 cases per 100 PY, with an overall pooled crude rate of 2.8 cases per 100 PY. This is the first review to concentrate on PWID in LMICs, providing initial evidence that concern for HCV reinfection should not be used to justify withholding DAA treatment outside high-income counties.</p>
