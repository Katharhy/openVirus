<p id="Par17">At present, there is still a lack of in-depth research on the complete pathophysiological process of COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease. However, through clinical manifestations and theoretical assumptions, it is speculated that SARS⁃CoV⁃2 may affect the cardiovascular system through various mechanisms. Here, the S protein/Furin/ACE2 signal axis provides a further potential explanation for the susceptibility of the heart to COVID-19. The sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be due to the simultaneous upregulation of ACE2 and furin in the diseased myocardium, and RAAS in this population. The lack of a specific antiviral drug means that the infected people cannot be treated and poses difficulties in controlling the spread of the virus. We mainly rely on isolation measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Although clinical trials of antiviral drug candidates (HIV protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir) were conducted early in the outbreak, the test results were unfortunately disappointing. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are not beneficial and increase the risk of arrhythmia or even death. It is still necessary to continue to test and apply the currently available and future therapies of COVID-19. Therefore, in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, transient regulation of the viral binding sites on ACE2 or furin through immunological or pharmacological methods may constitute a new therapeutic strategy to deal with this unprecedented and powerful virus threat.</p>
