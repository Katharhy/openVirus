<p id="Par8">Interestingly, members of the PCs family often cause functional redundancy or complementation due to the high structural similarity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Among the PCs secreted by the heart, PCSK6 is the most abundant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and is more than 70% structurally similar to furin. PCSK6 functions as a critical protease for processing corin and is involved in the regulation of enkephalin blood pressure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. It has also been shown to be involved in the pathological process of atherosclerosis and myocardial fibrosis after myocardial infarction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Therefore, furin is likely to be a functional complementarity or redundancy of PCSK6. Blocking the activity of these enzymes can reduce viral infections and cardiovascular damage and is beneficial for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Besides, to limit viral infection, host cells infected by the virus can cause an interferon response, which autonomously inhibits the enzyme activity of furin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].
