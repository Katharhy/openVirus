<p id="Par7">The S protein acts as a key medium for SARS⁃CoV⁃2 to invade the host and cause cell damage. After entering the body, the host cell PCs cleave the trimer S protein at the S1/S2 cleavage site, dividing it into an N-terminal extracellular domain of S1, which recognizes related cell surface receptors, and a C-terminal S2 membrane anchoring protein, which is involved in the entry of the virus into the cells. SARS-Cov-S2, like the S protein of SARS-CoV-S1, contains a conserved RBD that recognizes ACE2 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Therefore, the PCs family, especially furin, can be regarded as a key medium that mediates the processing and maturation of viral spike protein and recognizes membrane proteins and plays an important role in the treatment process of viral infection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The biological process of Furin processing and activation of coronavirus S protein to expose the reactive domain also explains partially the phenomenon of COVID-19 with severe cardiovascular damage. Furthermore, heart failure, accompanied by a marked increase in the level of furin in the peripheral blood in the course of COVID-19 in patients [
