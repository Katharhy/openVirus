Although furin has been regarded as a potential therapeutic target for infectious diseases, the use of host protease inhibitors (especially inhibitors against furin) as a treatment strategy for COVID-19 seems to be premature. Therefore, its lysis role and pathogenesis in SARS-CoV-2 need further clarification.
