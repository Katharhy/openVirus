<p id="Par10">Pathogens or their toxins require processing by host PCs to enter host cells and cause disease. Conversely, inhibiting PCs may protect host cells from furin-dependent pathogens. The correctness of the concept of furin-dependent infection has been supported by many basic studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Various methods have been proposed that inhibit furin activity hence limiting viral and bacterial infections and tumor growth. The variant of natural serine protease inhibitor α-1 antitrypsin affects the replication of the HIV-1 virus by interfering with the differentiation and maturation of gp160 to gp120 and gp41 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Nevertheless, because furin is involved in many cellular processes, it is important to avoid this systemic inhibition as it can cause some toxicity. Therefore, rapid screening of small molecule inhibitors or other more effective oral active inhibitors, such as
