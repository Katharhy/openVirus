<p id="Par6">The processing and activation of the coronavirus S protein are critical to the infectivity of the virus. Therefore, relevant enzymes constitute potential targets for antiviral intervention. The proprotein convertase family (PCs; gene name PCSKs) is composed of nine serine-secreting proteases and is widely involved in regulating various biological processes in normal and disease states. The PCs can perform multiple activation functions and are involved in many key cellular pathways. The PCs cleave precursor proteins at specific single or paired basic amino acids (aa), turning them precursor proteins into an active state. In many PCs, the processed substrate is the infectious virus cell surface glycoproteins [
