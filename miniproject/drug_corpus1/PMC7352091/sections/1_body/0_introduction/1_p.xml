Current clinical reports indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with significant morbidity of cardiovascular diseases and complications, such as hypertension (HTN), myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction, and increased heart failure [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The widespread expression of ACE2 in the myocardium and vascular endothelial cells might be due to the presence of SARS-CoV-2, which could cause direct cardiovascular damage and lead to adverse consequences [
