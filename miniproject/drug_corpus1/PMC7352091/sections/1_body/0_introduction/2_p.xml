 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Coronavirus S protein is a granule-shaped structural protein with a length of about 1200 aa, which helps the virus to bind to cell receptors and participate in mediating viral infection and pathogenesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. During viral infection, the host cell PCs cleave the S1/S2 cleavage site of the trimer S protein dividing it into an N-terminal S1 extracellular domain that recognizes the relevant cell surface receptor and a C terminal S2 membrane anchor protein that is involved in translocation of the virus into the cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. SARS-Cov-S2 and SARS-CoV-S1 proteins contain a conserved receptor-binding domain (RBD), which can recognize ACE2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Therefore, PCs family, especially furin, can be considered the key medium that mediates the maturation of S protein processing and recognition of membrane proteins. Furin can also be considered a critical molecule that makes SARS-Cov-S2 cause adverse cardiovascular events through the ACE2 receptor. This speculation is also supported by the occurrence of a high level of furin in the peripheral blood of heart failure patients.
