<p id="Par15">Based on these theories, it is assumed that the ACE2 receptor plays an important role in this pathological process, and therefore by directly acting or by discontinuing ACEi/ARB, ACE2 has become a candidate treatment strategy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The theoretical advantages of discontinuing ACEi/ARB from results observed in clinical cohort studies are inconsistent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Drug analysis in hypertensive-positive patients found no association between any single drug category and the increased likelihood of positive tests. At the same time, no drug is associated with a significant increase in the risk of serious diseases. The reduction of mortality caused by the use of ACEi/ARB has been adequately studied. The current beneficial effects on patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and proteinuria or proteinuria exceed the theoretical risk. In patients with chronic heart failure, the beneficial effects of ACEi/ARB outweigh the theoretical risks. Currently, COVID-19 has reached a pandemic level and affect more patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, and the ongoing randomized clinical trials to investigate whether hospitalized COVID-19 patients should continue to use ACEi/ARB, will shed more light on the accuracy of the existing hypothesis (NCT04351581). Out of caution, there is currently no plan for discontinuation of ACEi/ARB in COVID-19 patients with heart failure, hypertension, or ischemic heart disease.
