<p id="Par16">Faced with the dilemma of whether to discontinue ACEi/ARB, the clinical strategy of direct injection of ACE2 seems more promising. The bacterial-derived ACE2-like enzyme B38-CAP and human recombinant soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (rhACE2) have the same mechanism of action. The use of B38-CAP and rhACE2 can eliminate the membrane-anchoring domain to inhibit angiotensin II induction, high blood pressure, myocardial hypertrophy, and fibrosis, which in turn shows beneficial effects in disease models such as heart failure, acute lung injury, and diabetic nephropathy. The rhACE2 is currently being tested clinically to treat patients with ARDS and COVID-19 infection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. On the other hand, hrsACE2 or B38-CAP can prevent SARS-CoV-2 from entering the cell and induce the virus to attach to the exogenous ACE2 copy instead of the host cell. This destroys the ability of the virus to infect the cell to the same extent leading to reduced viral replication in the lungs and other organs. Furthermore, the role of hrsACE2 or B38-CAP in inhibiting COVID-19 could be achieved by down-regulating the host ACE2 since it is the right receptor of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, hrsACE2 or B38-CAP is expected to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, and some of the ongoing clinical trials will further corroborate these clinical advantages (NCT04375046, NCT04382950).
