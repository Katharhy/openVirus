<p id="Par13">S protein is a structural protein of about 1200 aa in length that constitutes the corona shape of coronavirus particles. It binds to the cell receptors and participates in mediating viral infection and pathogenesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. However, in the process of infection, the S protein plays a direct damaging role by recognizing and binding to the ACE2 receptor and invading the host cell [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Studies have shown that the affinity of the S-spike protein of SARS⁃CoV⁃2 with ACE2 is 10 to 20 times higher than that of SARS⁃CoV-1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Based on the high expression of ACE2 in cardiomyocytes, it is theoretically speculated that many new coronaviruses could directly bind to ACE2 and directly damage cardiomyocytes.
