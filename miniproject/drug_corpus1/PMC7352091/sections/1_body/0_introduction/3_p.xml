<p id="Par4">Based on these theoretical assumptions, it can be concluded that the S protein/host furin/ACE2 signal axis exists in the pathological process of SARS-Cov-S2 infection and mediates the occurrence of adverse cardiovascular prognosis events. Numerous studies discussed ACE2 before, and therefore this article has focused on the role of furin in this pathological process. Furthermore, a unique furin-like cleavage site exists in the S protein of SARS-Cov-S2 [
