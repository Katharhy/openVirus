<p>The electrospraying system was designed to accommodate electrospraying with a single or multi-needle assembly in an enclosure with a controlled atmosphere. Wires connecting the voltage source to the needle and ground electrode were routed through holes with an adjustable diameter on the side of the enclosure. Fluid tubing was routed in a similar fashion. A high-speed camera was included to enable real time monitoring of the liquid jet and to confirm its stability during processing. The camera was affixed to a solid steel stand with an adjustable mount and located directly outside the front of the enclosure to allow for visualization while protecting the camera and lens.</p>
