<p>A sterile aluminium dish was placed on top of the ground electrode 7.25 cm away and was used to collect electrosprayed solutions. PBS (pH 7.4) was used as the base for all electrosprayed solutions unless otherwise stated. The enclosure was sealed, and nitrogen (N
 <sub>2</sub>) flow was established to eliminate oxygen and thereby avoid the risk of solvent ignition. One mL of the appropriate virus solution was taken up in a sterile syringe. A high voltage DC power supply (PS/FC03P04 12w, Glassman Europe Limited, Bramley, UK) with an output voltage range of 0–30 kV and a current range of 0–4 mA was connected to the needle and ground electrode using alligator clips to create an electric field suitable for electrospraying. After turning on the power supply and setting it to the appropriate voltage, 5 mL of the virus solution was pumped through the needle at a constant rate of 10 µL/min. After the solution had been collected, the tubing and needle assembly were rinsed by flushing through 10 mL of ethanol, followed by 10 mL of PBS. The lowest applied voltage used, 8 kV, marked the average onset of a cone-jet for a variety of solvent/polymer solutions; 12 kV was identified as the average voltage needed to generate a stable flow of uniform microscale droplets, and 24 kV represented the highest voltage achievable before extensive corona discharge and arcing occurred [
