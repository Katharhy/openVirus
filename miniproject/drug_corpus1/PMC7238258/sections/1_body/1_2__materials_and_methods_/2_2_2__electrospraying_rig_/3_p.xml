<p>Liquid was supplied to the needle assembly via polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubing to limit solvent-induced swelling and degradation as much as possible. Syringes containing the aqueous solution of interest were mounted on a Harvard syringe pump (Infuse/Withdraw PHD 2000 programmable dual syringe pump, Harvard Apparatus Ltd, Edenbridge, UK) to control the flow rate of solution to the needle assembly. The capacity of the syringes used for the solutions was 5 mL unless otherwise stated. When coaxial electrospraying was performed, a SGE Gas Tight Luer Lock Syringe (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK) mounted on a second syringe pump (Cole-Parmer Syringe Pump, Infuse/Withdraw Programmable, Touchscreen Control WZ-74905-04, Cole-Palmer Instrument Company, Eaton Socon, UK) was used so that both inner and outer flow could be controlled separately.</p>
