<p>For these experiments, a coaxial two-needle stainless steel assembly was used. The outermost needle had an internal diameter of 1.07 mm. The central needle had an internal diameter of 0.34 mm. The outer needle carried the appropriate solvent solution, and the inner needle contained the viral solution. The needles were not electrically insulated from each other, and thus held at the same potential during coaxial electrospraying. When a single jet was desired, the inner needle was blocked, and flow was restricted to the outer needle.</p>
