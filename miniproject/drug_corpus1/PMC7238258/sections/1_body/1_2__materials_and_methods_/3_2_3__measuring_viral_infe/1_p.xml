<p>Immortalized human alveolar adenocarcinomic cells (A-549s) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S). Immortalized Chinese hamster ovarian cells (CHOK1s) were grown in Ham’s F-12 medium with 10% FBS. Cells were grown in a temperature- and CO2-controlled incubator at 37 °C and 5% carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub>2</sub>). Cells were passaged every three days at approximately 80% confluence. In preparation for transduction by either Ad or MVA, A-549 cells were seeded on a 96-well plate at a concentration of 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well and left to incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 24 h before any virus was added. Ad infectivity after electrospraying was assessed by removing all media from the wells and subsequently adding a solution containing a mixture of electrosprayed and/or solvent exposed Ad in PBS and DMEM such that the multiplicity of infection (MOI) was either 10:1, 100:1, or 1000:1. The same was done in the case of MVA, but the MOI employed was either 0.01:1, 0.1:1, or 1:1. Cells were then left to incubate again for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. To expose the luciferase contained intracellularly, media was replaced with the lysis buffer solution, and cells were left overnight at −80 °C and thawed the next morning. In a white, opaque 96-well plate, lysed cell solution was added followed by an equal amount of luciferase reagent. The resulting luminescence was measured using a microplate reader (FLUOstar Omega, BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany). To express luminescence intensity as a function of total protein content, a BCA assay was also performed to quantify the amount of protein in each well.
