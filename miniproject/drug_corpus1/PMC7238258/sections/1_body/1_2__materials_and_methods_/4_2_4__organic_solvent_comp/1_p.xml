<p>Ten microlitres of concentrated MVA or Ad in PBS were added to 90 µL of either PBS (sham treatment), triacitin, anisole, benzyl acetate, PPh GE, PC, DCM, or toluene in a sterile vial. The resulting immiscible solution was vortexed (Digital Vortex Mixer, VWR, Lutterworth, UK) at 1000 rpm for five seconds. The vial was then left to rest for 60 s, and 400 µL of PBS were added to the vial and 100 µL of the aqueous phase were subsequently transferred to a sterile Eppendorf tube. This 100 µL aliquot was then used to complete a luciferase assay. While all the organic solvents used are immiscible with water, each solvent is marginally soluble in water to varying degrees. To confirm that any potential small quantity of solvent contained in the 100 µL aliquot was inconsequential, the experiment was performed without any viral vectors, and a MTS assay was performed to determine cell viability 24 h after a portion of the aliquot was added to cells.</p>
