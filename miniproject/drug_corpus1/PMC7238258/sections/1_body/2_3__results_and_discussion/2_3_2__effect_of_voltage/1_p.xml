<p>Establishing an electric field of several thousand volts is typically essential to forming droplets in electrospraying. As indicated in the introduction, however, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and/or irreversible electroporation could potentially affect viral infectivity. Hence, it was important to assess the impact of operating voltage upon infectivity and to understand the mechanism of any inactivation. MVA and Ad suspensions were electrosprayed at a range of voltages, with or without the addition of 1 mM of rGSH. rGSH was used as it has been shown in previous studies to reduce the inactivation rate of the bacteriophage MS2 when exposed to an electric current [
