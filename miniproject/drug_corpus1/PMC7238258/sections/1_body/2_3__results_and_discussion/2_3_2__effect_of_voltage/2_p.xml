 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-12-00388-f003">Figure 3</xref>A shows that without rGSH, MVA infectivity decreased significantly compared to the control at both 20 and 24 kV, but with rGSH, a significant reduction was only seen at 24 kV. Additionally, at 24 kV, MVA without rGSH was significantly less active than MVA with rGSH. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-12-00388-f003">Figure 3</xref>B, in contrast, indicates that Ad was tolerant across all of the electrospraying conditions tested. One of the main differences between MVA and Ad is the presence of a lipid envelope surrounding the virus.
