<p>The observed reduction in MVA infectivity at high voltages would therefore suggest that irreversible electroporation is likely the main route of inactivation, and the protection afforded by rGSH implies that pore formation allows for exacerbated damage from ROS generated during electrospraying. It is important to note that the relatively large diameter of MVA also likely reduces its tolerance to electrospraying. Evidence of smaller enveloped viruses exhibiting greater resistance to electric fields can be found in the study conducted by Mizuno et al., where 1.33 to 2.67 times as many 30 kV pulses were required to inactivate swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV) compared to herpesvirus-1, which is more than twice the diameter of SVDV [
