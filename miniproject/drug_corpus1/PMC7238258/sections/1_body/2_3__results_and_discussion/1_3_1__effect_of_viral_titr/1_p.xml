<p>Using an appropriate viral titre is vital to generating reliable results. If the titre is too high, the virus may saturate cells as the machinery available for viral infection cannot reasonably accommodate numerous co-infections, and it could be postulated that any reduction in infectivity as a result of exposure to processing conditions may be attenuated or lost completely [

 <xref rid="B34-pharmaceutics-12-00388" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Operating at too low a titre could significantly increase the variability across samples as some wells may receive no active virus. To ensure an appropriate viral titre range could be established and to examine any effect that concentration may have on resilience to electrospraying, both MVA and Ad were electrosprayed at the highest experimentally relevant voltage, 12 kV, at various titres represented in MOI.
