<p>The results shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-12-00388-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B indicate respectively that the concentrations of both MVA and Ad were within the appropriate range and neither oversaturating nor undersaturating the plated cells. In both cases, an order of magnitude increase in MOI generated an order of magnitude increase in luminescence. Additionally, within each concentration, each treatment did not differ significantly from any other. Finally, the results indicate that there is a predictable linear relationship between the concentration of infective viral units and luminescence, and for the remainder of the discussion, viral infectivity will be directly inferred from luminescence values.
