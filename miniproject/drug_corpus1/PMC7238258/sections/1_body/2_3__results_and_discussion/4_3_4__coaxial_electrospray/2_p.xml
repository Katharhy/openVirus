<p>In contrast to the results shown in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-12-00388-f005">Figure 5</xref>B) when subjected to coaxial electrospraying at 10 kV. These results suggest that it is not only the solvent but also the contact time that is important and that the latter is sufficiently short during electrospraying to limit the effect on viral infectivity. This is a further potential advantage over either conventional emulsification or microfluidic techniques, both of which involve more prolonged solvent exposure. DCM in particular offers the further advantage of rapid particle formation and good biocompatibility, again due to its high volatility.
