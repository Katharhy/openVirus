<p>MVA and Ad were not shown to be negatively affected by single needle electrospraying at experimentally relevant voltages. Encapsulation within core shell particles is, however, only possible with coaxial electrospraying [
 <xref rid="B41-pharmaceutics-12-00388" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Hence, to determine the effects of the electric field and organic solvent exposure during coaxial electrospraying, a solution of pure DCM was passed through the outer needle and coaxially electrosprayed with an inner solution of MVA or Ad. Due to its particularly volatile nature, it was assumed that DCM would not remain as a contaminant after electrospraying [
