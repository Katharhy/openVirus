<p>The fact that MVA was affected more severely by solvent exposure is again likely due to its being enveloped. As above, solvents and detergents are routinely used to inactivate lipid-enveloped viruses [

 <xref rid="B40-pharmaceutics-12-00388" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. These results confirm that solvent selection may be extremely important in enabling viral encapsulation. This would be true not only for electrospraying but any technique requiring the use of polymer solutions. Indeed, techniques such as double emulsion solvent evaporation/extraction involve more extensive solvent exposure.
