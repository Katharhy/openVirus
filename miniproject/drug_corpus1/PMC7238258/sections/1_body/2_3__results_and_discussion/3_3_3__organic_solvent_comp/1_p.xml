<p>Ad and MVA were exposed to seven solvents to better understand how each solvent impacted the infectivity of the virus. Triacetin, anisole, benzyl acetate, PPh GE, and PC were selected for their amenable electrospraying properties and favourable toxicity profiles. DCM and toluene were selected for their prevalence in a variety of encapsulation techniques [

A separate experiment was also performed to check whether any trace solvent in the virus suspensions would affect the viability of the A549 cells. No difference in cell viability was found across any of the samples exposed to solvents only.
