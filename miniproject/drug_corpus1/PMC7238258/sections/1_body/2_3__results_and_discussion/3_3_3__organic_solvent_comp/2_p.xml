<p>In the case of MVA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-12-00388-f004">Figure 4</xref>A), there was a significant difference in infectivity between each of the solvent groups. Triacetin was found to be the least damaging, producing an 83.4% (SD ± 3.3%) decrease in infectivity compared to the control. Benzyl acetate, PPh GE, PC, and DCM were the most harmful, all reducing infectivity by more than 99%. Interestingly, the sham treatment of vortexing without the addition of solvent also caused a significant decrease in infectivity (23.8%, SD ± 6.1%), suggesting that MVA may be susceptible mechanical stress. Ad (
