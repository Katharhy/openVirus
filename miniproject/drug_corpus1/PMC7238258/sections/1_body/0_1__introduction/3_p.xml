<p>There are multiple techniques available for therapeutic encapsulation. However, although many of these techniques are sufficient for producing drug loaded microparticles, the sensitive nature of viral vectors necessitates careful consideration and control of processing conditions [

 <xref rid="B15-pharmaceutics-12-00388" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Conventional encapsulation methods, e.g., emulsion solvent evaporation/extraction, coacervation, membrane emulsification, and spray drying, have repeatedly been shown to significantly degrade complex molecules such as proteins through exposure to harsh organic solvents and high mechanical stresses [
 <xref rid="B15-pharmaceutics-12-00388" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Hence it is necessary to employ a microencapsulation method that preserves virus integrity and affords greater control over the antigen release profile. Microfluidic methods avoid the need for high temperatures and pressures and offer exceptional control over particle characteristics [

 <xref rid="B17-pharmaceutics-12-00388" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Generating particles at a sufficient scale, however, requires parallel operation of a very large number of devices and this has hindered widespread industrial translation. A further technique that also offers both mild processing conditions and good control over particle characteristics but may be more readily scalable [
 <xref rid="B18-pharmaceutics-12-00388" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] is electrohydrodynamic processing or electrospraying. In this technique, a strong electric field is used to deform a fluid meniscus into a cone-jet to produce small, uniform droplets from an electrified liquid in a capillary [
