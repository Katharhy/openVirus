<p>The aim of this study was to determine whether electrospraying could provide a viable method for virus encapsulation. In particular, the effect of the very high electric fields and/or the solvents typically upon viral infectivity were examined. To this end, a coaxial electrospraying system was designed and configured, and the effect of different processing parameters, particularly electric field strength and solvent exposure, on the viability of two widely used therapeutic viruses, Ad and MVA, was tested. </p>
