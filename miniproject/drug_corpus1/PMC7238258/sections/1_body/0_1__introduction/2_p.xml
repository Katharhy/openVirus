<p>One of the primary challenges in fully realizing the benefits of viral therapies is ensuring that the delivered virus prevails over pre-existing immunity. While viral vectors can be delivered unmodified, some vectors, such as adenovirus, can be rendered largely ineffective because of the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies for several Ad strains in hosts [

 <xref rid="B7-pharmaceutics-12-00388" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. To enhance the longevity of more efficacious therapeutic virus strains in the body, a number of studies have explored ‘stealthing’ viruses by attaching various polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the viral capsid or envelope [

 <xref rid="B9-pharmaceutics-12-00388" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This technique has demonstrated success in reducing viral inactivation by the innate immune response and allows for retargeting. The covalent bonding process, however, is slow and can result in decreased infectivity of the virus [
 <xref rid="B10-pharmaceutics-12-00388" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. If retargeting is not desired and longer in vivo survival is required, the virus can be encapsulated using lipids or biodegradable polymers, such as alginate or poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). These protect the virus while preserving its natural tropism and infectivity until it is released [

 <xref rid="B12-pharmaceutics-12-00388" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-pharmaceutics-12-00388" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. With this strategy, notable applications such as viral vector-based vaccines that need only be administered once could be realized, as the booster doses can be delivered in the biodegradable vehicle alongside the prime dose for delayed release. In addition to facilitating global vaccination coverage and compliance, single-dose vaccines would have a particularly important role in stemming epidemics of outbreak pathogens.
