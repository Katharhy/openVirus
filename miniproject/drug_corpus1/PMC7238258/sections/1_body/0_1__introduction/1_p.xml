<p>Evolution has honed the ability of viruses to deliver a payload of genetic material to a target cell. Consequently, viral therapies have attracted a great deal of interest for the development of cancer treatments, vaccines, and various gene therapies. In the context of vaccination, viral vectors generate a robust humoral and cell-mediated immune response to the encoded antigen. They also offer a versatile platform that could enable the development of vaccines for infectious diseases, such as malaria, that have seen little success with traditional vaccine development strategies [

Moreover, viral vectored vaccines utilising non-replicating adenovirus (Ad) and modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) have demonstrated excellent safety and immunogenicity, as well as good efficacy against flu, malaria, respiratory syncitial virus (RSV) and Ebola infection.
