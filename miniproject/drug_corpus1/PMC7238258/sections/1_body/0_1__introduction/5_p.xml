<p>A further concern is that using electrospraying to encapsulate material in a biodegradable polymer requires the use of an organic solvent [

The risk of toxicity from the final product can be mitigated by suitable solvent extraction methods, and in the case of electrospraying this is simply through evaporation from the jet during particle formation. The direct effect of the solvent on the integrity of the material to be encapsulated must also be considered, however. In particular, organic solvents are widely used in the destruction of viruses [
