<p>The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of using electrospraying for virus encapsulation. In particular, it was sought to determine whether the high electric fields and organic solvents typically used in electrospraying would damage the infectivity of two common therapeutic viruses, MVA and Ad. The results indicate that neither virus was adversely affected under practically relevant processing conditions, up to maximum voltage of 16 kV. The infectivity of Ad was not compromised at any of the voltages tested. The infectivity of MVA was compromised at 20 kV and above. This was attributed to it having a lipid envelope which, unlike Ad, made it susceptible to electroporation and damage by ROS. It was found that adding the ROS scavenger rGSH had a significant protective effect. MVA also suffered significant reductions in infectivity when exposed directly to all of the solvents tested in this study. The effect was particularly pronounced with DCM, PPh GE, and benzyl acetate. Again, this was attributed to it being enveloped. </p>
