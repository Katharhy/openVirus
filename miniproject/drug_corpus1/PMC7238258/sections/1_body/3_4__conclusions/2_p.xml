<p>When MVA was co-axially electrosprayed with DCM, however, its infectivity was preserved. This suggests that the effect of a solvent is dependent upon exposure time and that this is sufficiently short during coaxial electrospraying to minimize any damage. Ad was found to be robust to all electrospraying and co-electrospraying configurations tested and was only inactivated to a significant degree when exposed directly to anisole, benzyl acetate, PPh GE, and toluene. </p>
