  <p>Luminescence, represented as relative light units adjusted for protein concentration, measured after lysis of cells incubated with either MVA (
   <bold>A</bold>) or Ad (
   <bold>B</bold>) after single or coaxial electrospray. Working distance: 7.25 cm, Virus solution flow rate: 5 µL/min, dichloromethane (DCM) flow rate: 25 uL/min. One-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post-hoc tests were used to make statistical comparisons. A 
   <italic>p</italic>-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Error bars represent the standard deviation, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3.
