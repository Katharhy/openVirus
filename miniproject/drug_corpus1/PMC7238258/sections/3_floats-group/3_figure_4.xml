  <p>Mean average luminescence, represented as relative light units adjusted for protein concentration, measured after lysis of cells incubated with solvent-exposed MVA (
   <bold>A</bold>) or Ad (
   <bold>B</bold>). Welch’s ANOVA and Games–Howell’s post-hoc tests were used to make statistical comparisons. A 
   <italic>p</italic>-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant and indicated by an asterisk. Error bars represent the standard deviation, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3.
