  <p>Mean average luminescence, represented as relative light units adjusted for protein concentration, measured after lysis of cells incubated with either electrosprayed MVA (
   <bold>A</bold>) or Ad (
   <bold>B</bold>) with or without the presence of rGSH. Working distance: 7.25 cm, flow rate: 10 µL/min. Error bars represent the standard deviation, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3. Two-way ANOVA and Tukey–Kramer post-hoc tests were used to make statistical comparisons. A 
   <italic>p</italic>-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A single asterisk indicates significance compared to respective group control, a hash symbol indicates significance within a given voltage.
