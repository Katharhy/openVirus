<p>Mouse-adapted influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) was kindly donated by Professor Li-Yang from Shanghai University of Chinese Medicine. Virus was propagated in the allantoic cavities of 9 day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicken embryonated eggs. After further incubation for 48 h at 37 °C, allantoic fluids containing the viruses were harvested. The viruses were divided into small portions and stored at −80 °C until use. Virus titers were calculated by the Reed–Muench method and expressed as median tissue infectious doses (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>). The murine macrophage cell line (RAW264.7) was purchased from the Type Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China. RAW264.7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA). The media was supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin G and 100 μg/mL streptomycin) (Gibco). The cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37 °C. After RAW264.7 cells were infected with influenza virus (multiplicity of infection, MOI = 20), the virus growth medium (serum-free DMEM medium) was supplemented with 2 μg/mL 
 <sc>l</sc>-1-(tosyl-amido-2-phenyl) ethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma).
