<p>In this study, the main bioactive compounds (forsythoside E, verbenalin, and emodin) in SFJD exerting antiviral effects were identified. They remarkably increased the cell viability of H1N1-infected RAW264.7 cells. Further mechanism study reveals that Type I IFNs and MAPK/NF-ÎºB signaling pathways are involved in the anti-H1N1 infection effects of SFJD. Our study not only provides solid theoretical support for the clinical application of SFJD but also sheds light on the novel research methods for TCM study.</p>
