 </sup> They comprise a certain chemical constituent and take advantage of clear target and certain biological effects. Although antiviral therapy is an important strategy for controlling influenza, the efficacy depends on the timing of administration and is often limited by supply shortage.

 </sup> Additionally, mutations of the virus have also been found in previous studies to alter the binding property of neuraminidase (NA) for the binding of oseltamivir, making viral strains become resistant against these drugs.
