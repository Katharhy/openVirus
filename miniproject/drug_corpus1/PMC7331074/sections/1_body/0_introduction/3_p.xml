<p>In this study, we investigated the main bioactive compounds exerting antiviral effects in SFJD and uncovered the underlying mechanisms involved in the anti-H1N1 infection effects of SFJD. We assessed the underlying mechanisms of SFJD on regulating the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, the IFN-stimulated gene expressions,

 </sup> Interestingly, forsythoside E, verbenalin, and emodin made distinguishing roles and functions in several certain signals related to antivirus activities, and western blot was finally used to verify related signals. Our studies provide experimental evidence for studying the antivirus mechanism of SFJD and also offer a new way for researchers to find potential natural drugs in TCMs.
