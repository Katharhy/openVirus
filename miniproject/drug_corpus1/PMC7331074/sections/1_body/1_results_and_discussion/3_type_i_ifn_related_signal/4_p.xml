<p>To further explore the underlying antiviral mechanisms of SFJD, we examined the expressions of the Type I IFN and PRR-related protein phosphorylation. Western blot analysis was performed using the lysates of H1N1-infected RAW264.7 cells treated with or without target ingredients (forsythoside E, verbenalin, or emodin) to determine the protein expressions of the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of TBK1, IRF3, MAPK
 <sub>P38</sub>, and NF-κB
 <sub>p65</sub>. TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase-1) is a kinase downstream of critical adaptors in the cytoplasmic DNA- and RNA-sensing pathways, which phosphorylates transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). As shown in

 </xref>, the ratio of 
 <italic>p</italic>-TBK1/TBK1, 
 <italic>p</italic>-IRF3/IRF3, and p-NF-κB
 <sub>p65</sub>/NF-κB in the H1N1-infected group was markedly higher in comparison with that in the uninfected group (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Compared with the H1N1-infected group, protein expressions of the phosphorylated forms of TBK1, IRF3, MAPK
 <sub>p38</sub>, and NF-κB
 <sub>p65</sub> in the forsythoside E-treated group were significantly downregulated.
