<p>The most studied members of the Type I family of interferons are the multiple IFNα and IFNβ. Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is a transcription factor of IFN-β. In the early phase of viral infection, IκB kinase ε and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK-1) phosphorylate IRF3 lead to the activation and homodimerization of the molecule. The phosphorylation of IRF3 indicates the translocation of IRF3 molecules into the nucleus and the initiation of the transcription of Type I IFNs.
