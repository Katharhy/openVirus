<p id="p0265">Vaccine Mediated Enhanced Disease (VMED) was the focus of discussion, could it be antigen associated? The spike protein is the antigen of choice for the vaccine, associated with a strong (neutralizing) antibody response. This antigen was also shown to be the best antigen in MERS. Using the nucleoprotein may be less risky in eliciting VMED but this antigen was not successful in SARS. To be able to look at VMED, good animal models are needed. Nevertheless, even with those, there will be some remaining risk going into clinical trials, which is impossible to avoid as animal models may not fully predict effects in humans. Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE) as a second mechanism for enhanced disease has been hypothesized as having a potential link to enhanced disease for coronaviruses and is mostly an in vitro phenomenon, but people may be at risk after waning of the antibody response, with dengue as an example. ADE will remain a difficult topic, for which careful monitoring will remain necessary.</p>
