<p id="p0215">Regarding seasonality, it was discussed whether seasonal vaccines would be needed, as for influenza. But it is too early to say, first of all, the genetic drift is currently unknown, and secondly the duration of post-vaccine protection is unclear. In analogy, MERS antibodies do wane, but it is unclear how quickly. As previously discussed, some reinfections with SARS-CoV-2 have been described but this could be due to waning or inadequate antibody levels after infection. An annual booster may therefore be necessary, perhaps with a (slightly) adapted vaccine. It is as yet unclear whether overcoming a natural infection is protective and whether we can rely on herd immunity. However, T lymphocytes are frequent, so we may benefit from previous exposure.</p>
