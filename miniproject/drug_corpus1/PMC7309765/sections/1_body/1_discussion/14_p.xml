<p id="p0275">Finally, the most effective treatment was discussed. It was strongly advocated that hydroxychloroquine should not be used based on rumors but only within the setting of a clinical trial. This will lead to a comparison of benefits and risks. So far, the picture is that there is no clear benefit (no reduction in disease severity), whereas there are risks associated with the use (increased number of cardiological events in treatment group). Meta-analysis of ongoing clinical trials should provide a definitive answer. On the other hand, monoclonal antibodies do seem to be able to play a key role and can be manufactured in suitable quantities. These monoclonal antibodies are almost in phase 1 clinical trials which will hopefully show their value.</p>
