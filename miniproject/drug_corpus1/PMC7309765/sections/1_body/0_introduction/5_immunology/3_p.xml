<p id="p0115">When cells are infected by SARS-CoV-2 and the virus starts replicating, in a healthy immune response, the cells are rapidly destroyed by innate and adaptive immune effectors, and the released viral particles inactivated by neutralizing antibodies [

Although the immunological determinants of severe disease are not yet established, it is associated with tissue infiltration of inflammatory cells, including macrophages and T lymphocytes. These cells generate pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, attracting further inflammatory cells to the site, creating a pro-inflammatory feedback loop, potentially leading to damage to the tissues. Moreover, the cytokine storm may lead to multi-organ damage [
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Macrophages are thought to play an important role in this cascade. Monocytes are recruited to the site of infection by chemokines produced by epithelial and endothelial cells. Reaching the tissue, they differentiate in macrophages and are potentially activated by multiple signals, including viral RNA, inflammatory cytokines produced by neighboring inflammatory cells as well as complexes formed by viral antigens and antibodies [
