<p id="p0135">Some key questions remain open. Are people who were previously infected protected against reinfection? The potential for reinfection has been discussed [
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Studies should determine the persistence of antibodies as well as memory B-cells and T-cells following symptomatic as well as asymptomatic infection. Nevertheless, the aim of vaccines is to induce neutralizing antibodies and there could be an advantage of inducing cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. Currently, around 200 vaccine candidates are in development based on one of the following strategies: live-attenuated or inactivated virus; recombinant subunits in combination with adjuvants; recombinant viral vectors or bare nucleic acids. If all these strategies have the potential to induce neutralizing antibodies, they differ in their capacity to induce cytotoxic T cells. Another approach involves the induction of pathogen-agnostic immunity using live-attenuated vaccines e.g. BCG. Studies are ongoing to determine the potential of this approach [

When developing vaccines, it will be essential to avoid disease enhancement, as observed with dengue or inactivated respiratory syncytial virus vaccines. Finally, an impact of vaccination on virus replication in the upper respiratory tract would increase its efficacy at the population level.
