<p id="p0085">Arnaud Fontanet, Director of the Department of Global Health, Head of the Emerging Diseases Epidemiology Unit, Institut Pasteur, France, discussed the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, using France as an example. As other countries, France was hit hard by the epidemic, particularly in the Eastern parts and in the capital, Paris. Overall, 4.4% of the population was infected and the reproduction number, R0, was estimated at 2.9, indicating 66% of the population (100 â€“ [1/R0]) should become infected to achieve herd immunity. Now that the first wave has passed, what can be expected in the coming months? Looking at human CoV types OC43, 229E, HKU1, and NL63, in a cohort from Ann Harbor, Michigan, U.S., distinct seasonality in the identifications was observed. Only 9 (2.5%) of the total 364 CoV-associated acute respiratory infections occurred between June and September. The number of identifications for each virus increased in December, peaked in January or February, and began to decrease in March. Furthermore, the seasonal similarity between the four types is striking, with only the peak aggregate month differing between January and February [
