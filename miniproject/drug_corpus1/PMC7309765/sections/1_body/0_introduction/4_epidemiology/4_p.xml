<p id="p0095">In Copenhagen, the first wave of the 1918–1919 Spanish flu pandemic was marked by high transmissibility, substantial morbidity, and low mortality [
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Despite the few deaths attributed to influenza in the summer wave, its general patterns were otherwise characteristic of the 1918 influenza pandemic overall. First, its peak morbidity rate was approximately 300-fold higher than that of any other summer during 1910–1917 and was approximately 50% that of the fall wave. Second, the mortality rate was highest in young adults and lower in elderly. In contrast, the second wave during autumn had a lower R0 but a higher case fatality rate. The third wave had an intermediate case fatality rate, and deaths were more equally spread over age groups.
