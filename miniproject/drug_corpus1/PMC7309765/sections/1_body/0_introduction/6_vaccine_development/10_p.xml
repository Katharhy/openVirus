<p id="p0205">To support vaccine development projects and prepare for vaccine use in clinical trials and in outbreak response settings, biological standards and assays will be developed and access will be provided to laboratory analyses of preclinical and clinical samples. Secondly, animal models will be developed, and access to laboratories for vaccine testing will be secured. Thirdly, epidemiological modelling of the public health impact of a vaccine on the disease burden and transmission, including the possibility of herd immunity will be done using the following parameters: target populations, duration of protection, onset of immune response, dosing schedules, dosing regimen, adherence, vaccine coverage, vaccine effectiveness, and others. Global seroprevalence, incidence and mortality data of Covid-19 will be gathered.</p>
