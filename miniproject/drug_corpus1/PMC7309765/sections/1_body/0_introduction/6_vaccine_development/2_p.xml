CEPI is an innovative global partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil society organizations, launched in Davos in 2017, with the mission to accelerate the development of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases and enable equitable access to these vaccines for people during outbreaks. In the pre-Covid era, research was focused on five pathogens: Lassa, MERS, Nipah, Rift Valley Fever and Chikungunya. Of these, MERS is also a CoV, which has helped in accelerating vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2. For the advancement of vaccine candidates for each of the pathogens, a science portfolio is needed, including an antibody standard, standardization of assays, the antigen, an animal model for preclinical testing, diagnostics and epidemiological studies.
