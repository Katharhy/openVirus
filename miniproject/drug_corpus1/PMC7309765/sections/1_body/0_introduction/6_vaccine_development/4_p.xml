<p id="p0155">Partnerships and programmes of work have been announced which will leverage rapid response platforms already supported by CEPI. The aim is to advance Covid-19 vaccine candidates into clinical testing as quickly as possible. This includes:

   <p id="p0160">A DNA platform with electroporation for delivery (Inovio). Already having developed a MERS vaccine candidate currently in clinical trials, the SARS CoV2 builds on that knowledge to deliver optimized synthetic antigenic genes into cells. These will then be translated into antigens that activate an individual's immune system to generate robust immune response. The SARS CoV2 vaccine candidate is in Phase I clinical trials.</p>

   <p id="p0165">A recombinant protein platform (University of Queensland). This “molecular clamp” technology works by synthesizing viral surface proteins and “clamping” the protein in a pre-fusion form to optimize the immune response.</p>

   <label>3)</label>
   <p id="p0170">An mRNA platform (Moderna). An mRNA vaccine has been manufactured against the novel CoV spike protein to conduct investigational drug studies to decide whether it is safe to progress to the next stage of clinical trials. This vaccine moved into phase I clinical trial testing in just 10 weeks after sequence identification and is currently in phase II</p>

   <label>4)</label>
   <p id="p0175">A second mRNA platform (CureVac). This platform aims to optimize the properties of mRNA therapeutics and vaccines. The technology can be tailored to induce varying degrees of immune responses against antigens of choice, potentially providing potent prophylactic vaccines for the prevention of infectious diseases.</p>
