<p id="p0200">First-in-human studies will be performed on healthy adults for dose selection, safety and reactogenicity, excluding the at-risk population of older adults). During Phase Ib/IIa trials, the population will be expanded to include at risk populations. For vaccine efficacy, cases of COVID19 will be captured from phase I, to support development of a case definition and potential integrated analyses across early stage trials. Furthermore, an adaptive design will be used, with a number-of-events approach, subject to Covid-19 incidence. Finally, regarding safety, a safety database will be set up prior to market access; the number of subjects followed for safety will depend on discussions with regulators. Data on Vaccine-Mediated Enhanced Disease will be derived from animal models, immune response characterisation as well as monitoring throughout clinical development (and post-licensure). CEPI, together with the Safety Platform for Emergency vACcines (SPEAC) will develop case definitions for adverse events of special interest and set up a meta Data Safety Monitoring Board to evaluate safety across projects. Simultaneously, manufacturing is also scaled-up at risk (before clinical trial data is available) and scaled-out (the best candidates will be produced in multiple countries, potentially by multiple manufacturers) to maximize doses available upon licensure.</p>
