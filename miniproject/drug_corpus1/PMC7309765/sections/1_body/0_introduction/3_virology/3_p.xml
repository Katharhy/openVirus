Data show that the virus has a degree of similarity to viruses obtained from bats and pangolins. Based on genetic diversity, three genogroups are defined, groups G, V and S, of which the G group is currently most prominent and has been additionally subdivided in 3 sub-groups (G, GR and GH). However, the genetic diversity seems to have limited impact on antigenicity.
