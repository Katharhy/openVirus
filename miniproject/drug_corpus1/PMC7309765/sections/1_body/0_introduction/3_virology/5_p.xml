<p id="p0050">The availability of the sequence data has also enabled development of diagnostic tools. Diagnosis is usually based on nasopharyngeal swabs (a sample from the upper respiratory tract). Using real-time (RT-)PCR, a high accuracy can be obtained (combining high sensitivity with high specificity) but variation exists between different tests [

While the virus can also be found in stool using molecular assays, the value of this finding is as yet unclear, but detection does not seem to be related to disease severity.
