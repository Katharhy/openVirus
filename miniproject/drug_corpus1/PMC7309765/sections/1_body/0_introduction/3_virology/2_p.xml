<p id="p0035">Bruno Lina, professor of Virology at the University Claude Bernard Lyon and Director of the research laboratory VirPath, France, provided an overview of the virologic aspects of the new pandemic coronavirus (CoV) strain SARS-CoV-2. The origins of the virus lie in China. Despite rumors, there is no scientific evidence that it is a laboratory-produced virus. The major risk factor is contact of humans with live wild animals at markets, which is not uncommon in East Asia.</p>
