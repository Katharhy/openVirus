<p id="p0060">Antibody detection methods have been developed to investigate seroepidemiology, including ELISAs, lateral flow assays and virus neutralization assays, although the latter need to be performed in biosafety level 3 facilities. These assays provide insight into the number of previously infected individuals. However, different assays and different antigens within an assay will provide different pictures, therefore, it is essential to know which test was used, to be able to interpret the data.</p>
