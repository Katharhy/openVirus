<p id="p0070">Tracking immunological markers from illness onset, it was shown that the baseline lymphocyte count was significantly higher in survivors than in non-survivors [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In survivors, lymphocyte count was lowest on day 7 after illness onset and improved during hospitalization, whereas severe lymphopenia was observed in non-survivors. Levels of IL-6 were clearly elevated in non-survivors compared with survivors throughout the clinical course and increased with illness deterioration.
