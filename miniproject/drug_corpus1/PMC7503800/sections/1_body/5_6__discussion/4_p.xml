<p>The study was conducted on 100 healthy participants, divided into two groups based on their levels of education (&lt;12 years of formal education and &gt;12 years of formal education). Stigma related to HIV/AIDS was compared among these two groups, and there was no significant difference in the level of stigma in these distinctly different educational groups. The results showed that there is more perceived stigma as compared to enacted stigma. Nearly 46% of the individuals feel that HIV-infected persons should be blamed for their illness and 41% individuals feel that they will feel ashamed if they have HIV. It was also seen that older adults (between 46 and 55 years) have more stigma as compared to younger adults (between 16 and 25 years). The most educated individuals still have stigma to a certain extent. Most of the individuals would like to tell their partners if they were diagnosed with HIV. This study shows how today, stigma is still present in society, to a certain extent, among educated and urban individuals. The level of stigma may not be significantly different in people with educational differences [
