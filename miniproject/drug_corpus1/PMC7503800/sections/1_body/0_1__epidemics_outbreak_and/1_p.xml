<p>According to work by Rosenborg [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-17-06341" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] (1989), inspired by the Albert Camus novel published in 1947, epidemic outbreaks can be divided into three social phases. First, the society, seeking to reassure itself and to safeguard its economic interests, tries to reject the existence of epidemics. This phase continues if the community is reluctantly forced to face illness and mortality acceleration. The first act brings acknowledgement, but not acceptance, and this process leads to the second step. In the following phase, people demand and offer explanations, both mechanistic and moral. These aggregate explanations form the “public” responses, which can hide pitfalls and problems and make the third phase as dramatic and disruptive as the disease itself. One of the most important aspects of this process is the desire to assign personal and social responsibility (Rosenborg, 1989, according to Terror Management Theory by Greenberg et al., 1997 [

 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-17-06341" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] historical review (2020), two familiar aspects echo in the history of pandemics. First, stigmatization and discrimination follow closely on the heels of every pathogen. For example, anti-Chinese hostility has been a recurrent problem, i.e., with the plague in San Francisco in 1900, SARS in 2003, or COVID-19 today. Secondly, epidemics too often claim the lives of healthcare providers (Jones [
