<p>Stigma and discrimination have been, and currently are, major issues during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Specific tools are needed to investigate their impact on sick people, as well as healthcare workers dealing with COVID patients. So far, no studies have been conducted on this specific psychological impact related to SARS-CoV-2. The purpose of this review is to offer a psychological driven perspective on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in relation to stigma and discrimination, based on consolidated scientific evidence gained through the study of other infectious diseases. The results will provide accurate insight on the various aspects of stigma and discrimination related to infectious diseases to be applied to the current pandemic scenario.</p>
