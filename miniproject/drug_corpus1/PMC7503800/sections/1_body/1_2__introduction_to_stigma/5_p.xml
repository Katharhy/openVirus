<p>Stigma has some strength similarities to “prejudice”, according to work by Allport (1958) [
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-17-06341" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The differences between the research traditions of stigma and prejudice have more to do with different subjects of interest rather than any real conceptual difference [
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-17-06341" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In fact, stigma research has traditionally emphasized the study of people with unusual conditions and visible differences (for example, facial disfigurement, HIV/AIDS, short stature, and mental illness) [

 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-17-06341" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; consequently, discrimination brings unequal behaviors from the collectivity and the society, convoying high levels of individual stress and significant health disparities [
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-17-06341" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In their research, Dovidio et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-17-06341" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] (2010) focused on three stigmatized groups (blacks, sexual minorities, and people suffering obesity), underlining that stigmatization is related to lower and poorer health levels. Kowalczuk et al. (2018) [
 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-17-06341" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] also highlighted the existence of a horizontal discrimination in such occupational sectors, which typically offer lower rates of wages, and where women are frequently over-represented.
