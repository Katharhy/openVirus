<p>Scientific data also support the use of saline to enhance the virucidal activity of epithelial cells by increasing intracellular hypochlorite.[
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Rising levels of sodium chloride in the form of saline eye drops may help in reducing the colonization and shedding of the virus in tears. Hence, the use of commonly used hypertonic saline (5%) drops may also provide a therapeutic avenue to explore to avoid transmission through the ocular surface. Similar antiviral action may exist in the epithelium lining the nasal cavity. BAK containing saline nasal drops may have a dual-mode of action and may be considered for blocking viral entry and exit through the nose as a preventive measure for the individual as well as the community.
