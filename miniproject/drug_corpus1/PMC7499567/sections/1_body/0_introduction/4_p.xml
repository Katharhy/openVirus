In recent decades, new pandemic strains of coronaviruses have often appeared, which are frequently fatal for humans. These include severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV, which occurred from 2002 to 2004), Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV, which was identified in 2012) and most recently the new pneumonia coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, which is the ongoing outbreak that was identified in 2019) (Table
