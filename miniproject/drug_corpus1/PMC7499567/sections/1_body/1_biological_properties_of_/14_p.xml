<p>The process of internalization of coronaviruses is determined by the functional activity of the S protein (widely known as the spike protein) of the viral envelope. The S protein of a coronavirus is a highly glycosylated supramolecular structure that enables the fixation of viral particles on the plasma membrane of epithelial cells, followed by the release of their RNA into the cellular cytoplasm (Li

 <sub>1</sub>-subunit; these domains interact with either specific proteins or sialoglycans of the epithelial cells (Li
