<p>Influenza viruses belong to the orthomyxoviruses family (Orhtomyxoviridae, RNA viruses with segmented genome) and are represented by four monotypic genera: influenza A viruses (
 <italic>Alpha influenzavirus</italic>), influenza B viruses (
 <italic>Beta influenzavirus</italic>), influenza C viruses (
 <italic>Gamma influenzavirus</italic>) and influenza D viruses (
 <italic>Delta influenzavirus</italic>); each genus contains only one type of eponymous virus. It is understood that only type A viruses have pandemic potential (Bouvier and Palese

 <xref rid="bib141" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Influenza A viruses are further classified into subtypes, depending on the antigenic properties of hemagglutinin (HA; a glycoprotein of the viral envelope that ensures the recognition of target cells and binding of viral particles to the terminal residues of sialic acids of the glycoproteins of plasma membranes of epithelial cells) and neuraminidase (NA; exo-α-sialidase catalyzing the splitting of glycoside bonds of the terminal residues of sialic acids of oligosaccharides, glycoproteins and glycolipids, thus providing release of newly formed influenza virions from the infected cells).
