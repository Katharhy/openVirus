<p>After that, the internalization of the viral genome may proceed by endocytosis of the virion (which is in many respects a similar process to the internalization of the influenza viruses) or by the fusion of the membrane of a coronaviral envelope with the plasma membrane of an epithelial cell, without the formation of endosomes (directly on the plasma membrane). In any case, the release of the viral RNA into the cellular cytoplasm is preceded by the proteolytic (provided by serine proteases) cleavage of S
