<p>It is well known that serine proteases participate in the process of internalization of coronaviruses and influenza A viruses into the epithelial cells (Simmons

 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The activity of trypsin-like proteinases in the upper respiratory tract significantly depends on the activity of inhibitors of secretory leucoproteinases and in the lower respiratory tract it depends on the surfactant (Kido
